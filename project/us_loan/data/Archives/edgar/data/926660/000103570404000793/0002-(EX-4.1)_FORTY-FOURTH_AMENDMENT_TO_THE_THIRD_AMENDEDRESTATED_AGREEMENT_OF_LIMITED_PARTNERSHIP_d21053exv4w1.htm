be entitled to receive distributions payable in cash in an amount per Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred
Unit equal to the per share dividend payable on the Class&nbsp;Y Preferred Stock on such Distribution
Payment Date. Each such distribution shall be payable to the holders of record of the Class&nbsp;Y
Partnership Preferred Units, as they appear on the records of the Partnership at the close of
business on the record date for the dividend payable with respect to the Class&nbsp;Y Preferred Stock
on such Distribution Payment Date. Holders of Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units shall not be
entitled to any distributions on the Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units, whether payable in cash,
property or stock, except as provided herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.&nbsp;</B><B><I>Liquidation Preference.</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;In the event of any liquidation, dissolution or winding up of the Partnership, whether
voluntary or involuntary, before any payment or distribution of the Partnership (whether capital,
surplus or otherwise) shall be made to or set apart for the holders of Junior Partnership Units,
the holders of Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units shall be entitled to receive Twenty-Five Dollars
($25.00) per Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Unit (the &#147;Liquidation Preference&#148;), plus an amount per
Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Unit equal to all dividends (whether or not declared or earned)
accumulated, accrued and unpaid on one share of Class&nbsp;Y Preferred Stock to the date of final
distribution to such holders; but such holders shall not be entitled to any further payment. Until
the holders of the Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units have been paid the Liquidation Preference in
full, plus an amount equal to all dividends (whether or not declared or earned) accumulated,
accrued and unpaid on the Class&nbsp;Y Preferred Stock to the date of final distribution to such
holders, no payment shall be made to any holder of Junior Partnership Units upon the liquidation,
dissolution or winding up of the Partnership. If, upon any liquidation, dissolution or winding up
of the Partnership, the assets of the Partnership, or proceeds thereof, distributable among the
holders of Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units shall be insufficient to pay in full the
preferential amount aforesaid and liquidating payments on any Parity Partnership Units, then such
assets, or the proceeds thereof, shall be distributed among the holders of Class&nbsp;Y Partnership
Preferred Units and any such Parity Partnership Units ratably in the same proportion as the
respective amounts that would be payable on such Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units and any such
other Parity Partnership Units if all amounts payable thereon were paid in full. For the purposes
of this Section&nbsp;4, (i)&nbsp;a consolidation or merger of the Partnership with one or more partnerships,
or (ii)&nbsp;a sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the Partnership&#146;s assets shall not be
deemed to be a liquidation, dissolution or winding up, voluntary or involuntary, of the
Partnership.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;At any time that the Previous General Partner exercises its right to redeem all or any of
the shares of Class&nbsp;Y Preferred Stock, the General Partner shall cause the Partnership to redeem an
equal number of Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units, at a redemption price per Class&nbsp;Y Partnership
Preferred Unit payable in cash and equal to the same price per share paid by the Previous General
Partner to redeem the Class&nbsp;Y Preferred Stock. In the event of a redemption of Class&nbsp;Y Partnership
Preferred Units, if the redemption date occurs after a dividend record date for the Class&nbsp;Y
Preferred Stock and on or prior to the related Distribution Payment Date, the distribution payable
on such Distribution Payment Date in respect of such Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units called for
redemption shall be payable on such Distribution Payment Date to the holders of record of such
Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units on the applicable dividend record date, and shall not be
payable as part of the redemption price for such Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;If the Partnership shall redeem Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units pursuant to paragraph
(a)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;5, from and after the redemption date (unless the Partnership shall fail to
make available the amount of cash necessary to effect such redemption), (i)&nbsp;except for payment of
the redemption price, the Partnership shall not make any further distributions on the Class&nbsp;Y
Partnership Preferred Units so called for redemption, (ii)&nbsp;said units shall no longer be deemed to
be outstanding, and (iii)&nbsp;all rights of the holders thereof as holders of Class&nbsp;Y Partnership
Preferred Units of the Partnership shall cease except the rights to receive the cash payable upon
such redemption, without interest thereon; provided, however, that if the redemption date occurs
after dividend record date for the Class&nbsp;Y Preferred Stock and on or prior to the related
Distribution Payment Date, the full distribution payable on such Distribution Payment Date in
respect of such Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units called for redemption shall be payable on such
Distribution Payment Date to the holders of record of such Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units on
the applicable dividend record date notwithstanding the prior redemption of such Class&nbsp;Y
Partnership Preferred Units. No interest shall accrue for the benefit of the holders of the Class
Y Partnership Preferred Units to be redeemed on any cash set aside by the Partnership.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;If fewer than all the outstanding Class&nbsp;Y Partnership Preferred Units are to be redeemed,
units to be redeemed shall be selected by the Partnership from outstanding Class&nbsp;Y Partnership
Preferred Units not previously called for redemption by any method determined by the General
Partner in its discretion. Upon any such
