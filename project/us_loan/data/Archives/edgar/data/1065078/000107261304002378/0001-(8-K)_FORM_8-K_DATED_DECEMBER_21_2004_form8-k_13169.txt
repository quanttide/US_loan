ITEM 3.02   UNREGISTERED SALE OF EQUITY SECURITIES
            --------------------------------------

            On December 21, 2004, in a transaction exempt for registration under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act") pursuant to Section 4(2) of
the Act and Regulation D promulgated thereunder, the Registrant sold 2,085,000
shares of common stock and three (3) year warrants to purchase 1,563,750 shares
of common stock for an aggregate purchase price of $2,085,000 to a group of 15
accredited investors.

            The three (3) year warrants to purchase 1,563,750 shares of common
stock consist of (i) warrants to purchase 1,042,500 shares of common stock at an
exercise price of $1.25 per share and (ii) warrants to purchase 521,250 shares
of common stock at an exercise price equal to $1.75 per share.

            The Securities Purchase Agreement in which the aforementioned
securities were sold provides that the Registrant may sell up to an additional
$915,000 (or an aggregate offering of $3.0 million) of the same securities
(common stock and warrants) upon the same terms for a period of sixty (60) days
from the initial closing. The Securities Purchase Agreement also provides that
the Registrant is obligated to file a Registration Statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission registering for resale the common stock and shares of
common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants sold in the offering.
