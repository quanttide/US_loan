technology licensed to Pain Therapeutics, Inc. On June 29, 2004, Pain Therapeutics announced the results of studies conducted in human volunteers in the United Kingdom to confirm Remoxy&#146;s anti-abuse properties and to assess the drug&#146;s
pharmacokinetics. On December 6, 2004, in a subsequent study, Pain Therapeutics announced the results of a head-to-head comparison of the abusability of Remoxy versus Oxycontin&reg;, a brand name narcotic painkiller with annual sales exceeding $1.9
billion. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;This represents a significant milestone for our ORADUR
franchise and we are very pleased with the rapid progress by which this partnered program has advanced into late stage clinical development. Thus far, these clinical results reinforce our belief that products developed with our ORADUR sustained
release oral gel-cap technology may offer a variety of benefits, including the potential to reduce abuse when compared to current long-acting dosage forms that are on the market today,&#148; stated James E. Brown, DVM, President and CEO of DURECT.
&#147;Beyond our partner Pain Therapeutics, we have ongoing feasibility activities utilizing our ORADUR and look forward to expanding our relationships with a number of pharmaceutical companies to develop additional innovative sustained release oral
gel-cap products that utilize select opioids and other potentially abused active agents.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The positive results of the Remoxy clinical studies reported to date were attributed to the unique characteristics of the ORADUR sustained released oral gel-cap technology. Products based on the ORADUR technology can
take the form of an easy to swallow gelatin capsule that uses a high-viscosity base component, SABER<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1" COLOR="#000000"><SUP>&#153;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"></FONT></SUP><FONT

gel-cap may also have the added benefit of being less prone to abuse than other controlled release dosage forms on the market today. ORADUR-based products can be manufactured by a simple process using conventional methods making them readily
scalable. These properties have the potential to make ORADUR-based products an attractive option for pharmaceutical companies that seek to develop tamper and abuse resistant oral products. </FONT></P> <P

properties and offers the convenience of twice-a-day dosing. Remoxy is formulated with DURECT Corporation&#146;s ORADUR technology under a joint development and license agreement. Oxycodone is also the active drug ingredient in OxyContin, a brand
name narcotic painkiller with annual sales exceeding $1.9 billion. ORADUR is a patented technology based on sucrose acetate isobutyrate, a high-viscosity, biodegradable liquid matrix that forms the basis for a number of different injectible depot
and oral gel-cap drug candidates, including Remoxy. Under the terms of the license agreement between Pain Therapeutics and DURECT, Pain Therapeutics has exclusive worldwide rights to </FONT></P>
