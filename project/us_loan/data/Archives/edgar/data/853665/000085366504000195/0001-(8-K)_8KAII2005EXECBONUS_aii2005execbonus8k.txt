Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     On December 23, 2004,  the Executive  Compensation  Committee of Applebee's
International, Inc. (the "Company") approved the criteria pursuant to which cash
bonuses  will be paid to the  Chief  Executive  Officer  and the next  four most
highly  compensated  executive officers of the Company for fiscal 2005 under the
Company's  2001 Senior  Executive  Bonus Plan and 1999  Management and Executive
Incentive Plan.  These criteria are also used to establish  bonuses for officers
and other  employees of the company.  The Committee has not approved  individual
bonus eligibility  amounts or percentages.  The officers are eligible to receive
bonuses  if  certain   qualitative  and  quantitative   individual  and  Company
performance  criteria are achieved  during fiscal 2005.  These criteria  include
earnings  per share and other  operating  targets,  which the  Company  does not
publish  because  doing so would  disclose  confidential  business  information.
