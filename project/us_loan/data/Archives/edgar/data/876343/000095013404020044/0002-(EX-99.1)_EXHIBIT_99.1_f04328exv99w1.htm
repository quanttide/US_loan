limited to designing such clinical and laboratory studies as may be required,
selecting the hospitals at which clinical studies will be conducted, selecting
the physicians who will be the lead investigators for the clinical studies, and
selecting the statistical analysts who will prepare reports of the outcome of
the clinical studies (the &#147;Development Plan&#148;). The Development Plan will be
based upon information obtained by Summit from BioTime and from Summit&#146;s
consultations with doctors and other medical advisors, hospital administrators,
and representatives of government agencies from which Regulatory Approval must
be obtained. The Development Plan will include a timetable for commencing and
completing clinical trials, preparing and submitting an application for
Regulatory Approval, and obtaining Regulatory Approval of Hextend in the
Territory.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;Within six months after this Agreement is signed by the parties,

approved by BioTime. Summit shall use commercially reasonable and diligent
efforts to complete all clinical and laboratory studies and to file all
applications, reports, and documents, and shall pay all filing fees and other
fees required to obtain Regulatory Approval of Hextend in the Territory within
the Development Plan timetable. BioTime and Summit shall agree upon a time
schedule for Summit to conduct seek and obtain Regulatory Approval for
PentaLyte in the Territory (including clinical and laboratory studies), but

in the United States have been disclosed to Summit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;Summit shall send BioTime written progress reports every six months
after the Development Plan is approved. The progress reports will summarize in
reasonable detail the work performed by Summit and the results of such work
under the Development Plan during the period covered. Each progress report
shall include in reasonable detail any proposed changes to the Development Plan
or the Development Plan timetable. Summit&#146;s progress reports will include
copies of correspondence with regulatory authorities and, to the extent
available, data obtained from clinical studies. If BioTime requests additional
information concerning any progress report or the actions taken by Summit under
the Development Plan, Summit will provide such information within two weeks.

BioTime&#146;s consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld, provided
that the changes are
suggested by Summit in good faith for the purpose of obtaining Regulatory
Approval of Hextend in an expeditious and commercially reasonable and medically
prudent manner.

government authority concerning clinical trials or Regulatory Approval, and (B)
any adverse outcomes in clinical trials or other developments that could
reasonably warrant a change in the Development Plan or could result in a
material delay in implementing or completing any aspect of the Development

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Within ten (10)&nbsp;days after approving the Development Plan, BioTime
shall pay Summit a one-time fee of One Hundred Thirty Thousand Dollars
($130,000) for Summit&#146;s services in preparing the Development Plan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Revenue Sharing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Summit may sublicense a portion of its rights for the co-development
and/or marketing of the Products in the Territory, provided, that after any
such sublicense (i)&nbsp;Summit and BioTime together retain effective power to make
all decisions that, without any such sublicense, would be made by Summit and
BioTime together, (ii)&nbsp;Summit rather than any assignee, licensee or sublicense
of Summit will retain any and all power and authority that Summit may have to
make any determinations and agreements, and to give or withhold any approvals,
that may arise under its agreement with BioTime, such that (A)&nbsp;BioTime may deal
directly and exclusively with Summit, (B)&nbsp;Summit shall not have delegated its
powers and authority under its agreements with BioTime, and (C)&nbsp;any such
determination, agreement, or approval by Summit shall be binding on its
assignees, licensees or sublicensees, and (iii)&nbsp;BioTime retains the right and
power to enforce its rights as licensor and to enforce the obligations of the
licensee under any license granted by BioTime. In the event the potential
co-development sublicensee requests marketing and or sale rights, as well,
Summit shall inform BioTime and shall decide to appoint such sublicensee only
after obtaining the consent of BioTime.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;When the Products are licensed and sold in the Territory, the revenues
from licensing fees, royalties, and net sales, and any other payments made for
the right to co-develop with Summit, manufacture, market, or sell any of the
Products in the Territory, shall be shared between BioTime and Summit as
follows: 40% to BioTime and 60% to Summit. Net sales means the gross revenues
from the sale of a Product, less rebates, discounts, returns, transportation
costs, sales taxes and import/export duties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;BioTime will pay to Summit 8% of all net royalties actually received
by BioTime from the sale of PentaLyte in the United States plus 8% of any
license fees that BioTime receives in consideration of granting a license to
develop, manufacture and market PentaLyte in the United States. Net royalties
means royalty payments received during a calendar year, minus the following
costs and expenses incurred during such calendar year: (a)&nbsp;all taxes assessed
(other than taxes determined with reference to BioTime net income) and credits
given or owed by BioTime in connection with the receipt of royalties on the
sale of PentaLyte in the United States, and (b)&nbsp;all fees and expenses payable
by BioTime to the United States Food and Drug Administration (directly or as a
reimbursement of any licensee) with respect to a PentaLyte. In the case of
license fees received from Hospira, Inc. based upon the combined sale of
PentaLyte and Hextend, the portion of such license fee that will be deemed to
be a paid on account of the sale of PentaLyte will be determined by multiplying
the total license fee paid by a fraction, the numerator of which will be the
total net sales of PentaLyte in the United States for the applicable period and
the denominator of which shall be the total net sales of Hextend and PentaLyte
in the United States for the same period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Confidentiality. Neither party shall disclose any Confidential
