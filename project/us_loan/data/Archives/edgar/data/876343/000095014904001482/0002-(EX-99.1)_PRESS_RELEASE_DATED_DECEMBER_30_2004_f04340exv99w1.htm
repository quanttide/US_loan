<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<br>
December&nbsp;30, 2004</B>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>BIOTIME ANNOUNCES AGREEMENT TO DEVELOP HEXTEND</B><SUP>&#174;</SUP> <B>AND<BR>
PENTALYTE</B><SUP>&#174;</SUP> <B>IN JAPAN</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>BERKELEY, CA, December&nbsp;30, 2004 &#150; BioTime, Inc. (AMEX: BTX) </B>announced today that it has
entered into an agreement with Summit Pharmaceuticals International Corporation, an affiliate of
Sumitomo Corporation, to develop Hextend and PentaLyte for the Japanese market. Hextend and
PentaLyte are physiologically balanced blood plasma volume expanders designed for the treatment of
hypovolemia. Hypovolemia is a condition caused by low blood volume, often from blood loss during
surgery or from injury. Plasma volume expanders maintain circulatory system fluid volume and blood
pressure and keep vital organs perfused during surgery. Hextend and PentaLyte are similar
formulations, except that PentaLyte contains a lower molecular weight hydroxyethyl starch than
Hextend, and is more quickly metabolized. PentaLyte is designed for use when shorter lasting
volume expansion is desirable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under the Agreement, which was signed December&nbsp;24, 2004, Summit will pay BioTime $900,000 in three
installments as partial reimbursement of BioTime&#146;s development costs of Hextend and PentaLyte.
BioTime has already received the first installment of $300,000. In addition, BioTime will pay
Summit a one-time fee of $130,000 for Summit&#146;s services in preparing a development plan for those
products in Japan. Moreover, Summit will apply for regulatory approval to manufacture and market
Hextend and PentaLyte in Japan for use at body temperatures above 12 Centigrade. Summit will begin
by preparing a development plan for Hextend. Summit will fund all laboratory, preclinical and
clinical testing and developmental activities regarding the products, and will pay all application
filing and similar fees for purposes of obtaining and maintaining regulatory approvals in Japan.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;Licensing and marketing BioTime&#146;s products in international markets is a top priority for our
Company and the agreement with Summit Pharmaceuticals International Corporation is a logical
extension of BioTime&#146;s global expansion strategy,&#148; said Judith Segall, BioTime Vice President of
Operations, Office of the President. &#147;We believe Summit&#146;s financial strength and local market
acumen coupled with BioTime&#146;s novel and innovative blood volume expanders, creates an ideal
partnership to optimize marketing opportunities for our products in Japan.&#148;

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">BioTime and Summit do not plan to manufacture and market Hextend and PentaLyte themselves.
Instead, they will seek to license manufacturing and marketing rights to a third party such as a
pharmaceutical company. When Hextend and PentaLyte are licensed and sold in Japan, BioTime will
receive 40% of the revenues from licensing fees, royalties, and net sales, and any other payments
made for co-development, manufacturing, or marking rights, and Summit will be entitled to the
remaining 60%. BioTime will pay to Summit 8% of all net royalties actually received by BioTime
from the sale of PentaLyte in the United States plus 8% of any license fees that BioTime receives
in consideration of granting a license to develop, manufacture and market PentaLyte in the United
States.
