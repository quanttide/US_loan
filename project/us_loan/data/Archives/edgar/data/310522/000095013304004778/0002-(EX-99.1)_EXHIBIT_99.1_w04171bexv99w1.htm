<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We were previously principal accountants for Fannie Mae (formally, the Federal National Mortgage
Association) and, under the date of January&nbsp;20, 2004, we reported on the financial statements of
Fannie Mae as of and for the years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 and 2002. As described in Fannie Mae&#146;s
Form 8-K referred to below, Fannie Mae concluded that their previously filed interim and audited
financial statements and the independent auditors reports thereon for the periods from January&nbsp;2001
through the second quarter of 2004 should no longer be relied upon because such financial
statements were prepared applying accounting practices that did not comply with generally accepted
accounting principles. On December&nbsp;21, 2004, we were notified by the Audit Committee of
the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae that we were dismissed as the company&#146;s independent auditor.
We have read Fannie Mae&#146;s statements included under
Item&nbsp;4.01 of its Form&nbsp;8-K dated December
28, 2004, and we agree with such statements, except that we are not in a position to agree or
disagree with the penultimate sentence of the fifth paragraph.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Very truly yours,
