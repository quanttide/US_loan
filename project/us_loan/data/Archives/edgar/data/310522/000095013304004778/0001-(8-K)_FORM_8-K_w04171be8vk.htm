<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Item&nbsp;4.01 Changes in Registrant&#146;s Certifying Accountant.</I></B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae
(formally, the Federal National Mortgage Association) dismissed the firm of KPMG LLP as the
company&#146;s independent auditors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
reports of KPMG on Fannie Mae&#146;s financial statements for the
past two fiscal years did not contain an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion and were not qualified or modified as to
uncertainty, audit scope, or accounting principles. During the period
from January&nbsp;1, 2002 through December&nbsp;21, 2004, there were
no disagreements with KPMG on any matters of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope and
procedures which, if not resolved to the satisfaction of KPMG, would
have caused  KPMG to make reference to the matter in its report. On
December&nbsp;22, 2004, Fannie Mae filed a Form 8-K with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) reporting
that the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Fannie Mae had
concluded  that Fannie Mae&#146;s previously filed interim and
audited financial statements and the independent auditor&#146;s reports
thereon for the periods from January&nbsp;2001 through the second
quarter of 2004  should no longer be relied upon because such
financial statements were prepared applying accounting practices
that did not comply with generally accepted accounting principles.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On September&nbsp;20, 2004, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (&#147;OFHEO&#148;) delivered its
report to Fannie Mae&#146;s Board of Directors of its findings to date of the agency&#146;s special
examination. Among other matters, the OFHEO report raised a number of questions and concerns about
Fannie Mae&#146;s accounting policies and practices with respect to Financial Accounting Standard No.
91, <I>Accounting for Nonrefundable Fees and Costs Associated with Originating or Acquiring Loans and
Initial Direct Costs of Leases </I>(&#147;FAS 91&#148;) and Financial Accounting Standard No.&nbsp;133, <I>Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities </I>(&#147;FAS 133&#148;), management integrity, and the
effectiveness of internal controls. With respect to FAS 91 and FAS 133, Fannie Mae requested the
Office of the Chief Accountant (&#147;OCA&#148;) of the SEC to review
Fannie Mae&#146;s application of these standards for consistency with generally accepted accounting
principles. As disclosed in a Form 8-K filed with the SEC on December&nbsp;16, 2004, OCA determined
that Fannie Mae&#146;s application of FAS 91 and FAS 133 did not comply in material respects with the
accounting requirements of those standards. In addition, a special committee of Fannie Mae&#146;s Board
of Directors engaged the law firm of Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton &#038; Garrison LLP (&#147;Paul Weiss&#148;) to
review the allegations detailed in OFHEO&#146;s report and related matters.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the OFHEO
report and the Paul Weiss review, KPMG notified Fannie Mae that it
was expanding the scope of the procedures for its review of Fannie Mae&#146;s interim financial
statements for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, and its audit of the annual financial
statements for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2004 and internal
control over financial reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. With
respect to the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 and its audit of
the financial statements for the year ending December&nbsp;31, 2004
and management&#146;s assessment of internal control over financial
reporting as of December&nbsp;31, 2004, KPMG notified Fannie Mae that KPMG would require
the completion of Paul Weiss&#146; review related to accounting,
internal control, and financial reporting matters (including all management integrity and related allegations), and discussions and review of
materials pertaining to Fannie Mae&#146;s internal review of its accounting policies and practices. KPMG
also indicated that they would perform additional procedures related to items raised in the OFHEO
report. In addition, KPMG notified Fannie Mae that the completion of its review of the restated
financial statements for the quarters ended March&nbsp;31, 2004 and
2003 and June&nbsp;30, 2004 and 2003, and the completion of the audit procedures related to the restatement of the financial statements for the
years ended December&nbsp;31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, would require the completion of the same procedures
addressed in the immediately preceding sentence. Due to the dismissal of KPMG, KPMG was
unable to complete the additional procedures described above.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KPMG
also notified the company that there existed strong indicators of
material weaknesses in  internal control over financial reporting,
which included OFHEO&#146;s determination of weaknesses in such
controls, OCA&#146;s determination that Fannie Mae&#146;s application
of FAS 91 and FAS 133 did not comply in material respects with the
accounting requirements of those standards, and observed deficiencies
in Fannie Mae&#146;s process of closing its accounting records for
the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 that resulted in
post-closing entries to the interim financial information. Fannie Mae
recorded those entries prior to the release of estimated operating
results in Fannie Mae&#146;s Form 12b-25 filed with the SEC on
November&nbsp;15, 2004. In addition, in connection with KPMG&#146;s
incomplete audit of internal control over financial
reporting pursuant to Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of
2002 and related SEC rules, KPMG communicated to Fannie Mae numerous
observations on our internal controls. Fannie Mae is assessing the
observations to determine which observations are deficiencies and
whether any deficiencies constitute significant deficiencies or
material weaknesses, either individually or in the aggregate. Due to
the dismissal of KPMG, KPMG is unable to complete its review of the
financial statements for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004
and its audit of Fannie Mae&#146;s internal control over financial
reporting.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors has discussed the above matters with KPMG. Fannie
Mae has authorized KPMG to respond fully to inquiries of Fannie Mae&#146;s successor independent
auditor concerning the above matters.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fannie Mae has requested KPMG to furnish it a
letter addressed to the SEC stating whether KPMG agrees with the above statements. A copy of
that letter, dated December&nbsp;28, 2004, is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 to this Form 8-K.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fannie
Mae is actively seeking to engage a successor independent auditor as
soon as practicable.
