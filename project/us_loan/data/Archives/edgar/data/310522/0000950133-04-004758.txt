<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.02. Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;21, 2004, Fannie Mae (formally the Federal National Mortgage Association) announced the
retirement of the company&#146;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Franklin D. Raines, and the
resignation of the company&#146;s Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, J. Timothy Howard.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As a result of his retirement, Mr.&nbsp;Raines&#146; employment under his employment agreement with Fannie
Mae and service on the Board of Directors terminated on December&nbsp;21, 2004. Mr.&nbsp;Howard&#146;s employment under his employment agreement with
Fannie Mae will terminate on January&nbsp;31, 2005. Mr.&nbsp;Howard
ceased his duties as Chief Financial Officer as of December&nbsp;21,
2004, upon the appointment of Robert J. Levin as interim Chief
Financial Officer as described in item 5.02 below. Mr. Howard will
serve on the Board of Directors until January 31, 2005. Copies of the agreements with Messrs.&nbsp;Raines
and Howard, as entered into in May&nbsp;2004 and amended on June&nbsp;30, 2004, were filed with Fannie Mae&#146;s
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30, 2004. The agreements were subsequently
amended in September&nbsp;2004, and copies of the amendments were filed as exhibits to a Form 8-K Fannie
Mae filed on September&nbsp;23, 2004. The Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight (&#147;OFHEO&#148;) approved the termination
benefits in the agreements with Mr.&nbsp;Raines and Mr.&nbsp;Howard
on November&nbsp;17, 2004 and December&nbsp;13, 2004, respectively.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, Fannie Mae received a letter from
OFHEO informing Fannie Mae that OFHEO would
review Mr.&nbsp;Raines&#146; and Mr.&nbsp;Howard&#146;s termination
benefits that accrue as a result of Mr.&nbsp;Raines&#146; retirement
and Mr.&nbsp;Howard&#146;s resignation and requesting information regarding those
benefits. OFHEO indicated that, among other matters, it is concerned with whether, at the time of
termination, there have been enhancements or modifications to
benefits since the termination package
was agreed upon. OFHEO also stated in the December 23
letter that Fannie Mae should not pay any termination benefits to Mr.
Raines or Mr. Howard until OFHEO has
completed its review thereof.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Fannie Mae will provide OFHEO the information it has
requested. Fannie Mae will also consider its legal and contractual obligations regarding payment of
compensation and benefits to Mr.&nbsp;Raines and Mr.&nbsp;Howard and will discuss these matters with OFHEO.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B><I>Agreement with Mr. Raines</I></B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In accordance with the terms of his employment agreement and
Fannie Mae&#146;s employee benefit plans, Mr.&nbsp;Raines is entitled to receive the compensation and
benefits described below.

to purchase a total of 1,628,071 shares of common stock at exercise prices ranging from
$60.3125 to $80.95 per share. Based on the closing price of Fannie
Mae&#146;s common stock on December
21, 2004 of $70.35, the market price of the shares underlying these options exceeded the
exercise price by an aggregate of $5,545,270. Upon Mr.&nbsp;Raines&#146; retirement, options to

stock at $80.95 per share were canceled. The market price of the shares underlying the
vesting options exceeded the exercise price by an aggregate of $215,095, based on the
December&nbsp;21, 2004 closing price. Under Fannie Mae&#146;s stock
compensation plans, all options
held at the time of retirement by any option holder who is at least 55&nbsp;years old and who
has at least 5&nbsp;years of service with Fannie Mae remain exercisable until their initial
expiration date, which is generally 10&nbsp;years after grant. As a result, Mr.&nbsp;Raines&#146; vested
options, including those vesting by reason of his retirement, will expire between May&nbsp;2008
and January&nbsp;2014.

    <TD>Performance Share Payouts. Under Fannie Mae&#146;s Performance Share program, as a member of
Fannie Mae&#146;s senior management Mr.&nbsp;Raines has previously received awards that entitle him
to receive shares of Fannie Mae common stock subject to meeting corporate performance objectives
over three-year periods. Each year, the Compensation Committee of Fannie Mae&#146;s Board of
Directors establishes an award cycle of three years. At the beginning of a cycle, Fannie
Mae&#146;s Board of Directors establishes program targets based on both financial and
non-financial goals, equally weighted. The financial goals currently are tied to growth in
core business earnings per share and the non-financial goals are tied to Fannie Mae&#146;s
strategic plan and mission. Fannie Mae will restate its previously issued financial
statements for 2001 through 2004 and re-evaluate previously issued non-GAAP financial
information, including core business earnings. The Compensation Committee of the Board will consider
the impact thereof on both unpaid performance shares and uncompleted performance share cycles.
For the performance cycle completed in 2003, Mr.&nbsp;Raines was determined in January
2004 to be entitled to receive 139,155 shares, of which he has been paid 69,577 shares in
accordance with the program. For the cycles concluding in 2004 through 2006, Mr.&nbsp;Raines
has been granted awards that would result in him receiving no shares
if the threshold goals are not attained or receiving
an amount of shares between the threshold and maximum numbers set forth in following table
based on attainment of the goals at or above the threshold.</TD>

of bonuses that may be paid under the Annual Incentive Plan to all eligible employees is

core business earnings per share growth. The Compensation Committee of the Board may adjust the goals, with Board approval, in certain specified
situations and has discretion to pay bonuses under the plan
for individual performance if financial goals are not achieved. Although corporate performance may result in the creation of
a bonus pool, the amount of an individual&#146;s bonus is based on
personal performance. Fannie Mae will restate its financial statements for periods from January&nbsp;2001 through the
second quarter of 2004 and will re-evaluate corresponding non-GAAP
financial information including core business earnings. The Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors

in bonus and salary. She also receives benefits under the company&#146;s compensation and benefit plans
that are generally available to Fannie Mae employees, including Fannie Mae&#146;s employee stock
purchase plan and employee stock ownership plan. The Enterprise
Systems Operations division does not report, nor has it ever
reported, to Mr. Levin.

with Messrs.&nbsp;Mudd and Levin</I></B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Fannie Mae previously entered into agreements with Mr.&nbsp;Mudd and Mr.&nbsp;Levin, and has previously filed
those agreements with the SEC. The company has not entered into new agreements with either of them
in connection with their interim appointments. The information below relates to their existing
agreements.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The employment agreements with Messrs.&nbsp;Mudd and Levin do not specify salary, bonus or other
compensation arrangements, except as described below. Compensation arrangements for Messrs.&nbsp;Mudd
and Levin are determined annually by the Compensation Committee of the Fannie Mae Board of
Directors. In addition to their base salary, Messrs.&nbsp;Mudd and Levin participate in the Annual
Incentive Plan and are eligible to receive variable long-term incentive awards, such as performance
shares and stock options, as described in Fannie Mae&#146;s proxy for its annual 2004 shareholders
meeting.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s employment agreement with Fannie Mae, as entered into in May&nbsp;2004 and amended on June
30, 2004, was filed with Fannie Mae&#146;s quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended June&nbsp;30,
2004. The agreement was subsequently amended in September&nbsp;2004. A copy of the September&nbsp;2004
amendment was filed as an exhibit to a Form 8-K Fannie Mae filed on September&nbsp;23, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s employment agreement
    with the company provides for employment through June&nbsp;30, 2007. Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s salary (currently
    $746,209) is subject to periodic review and possible increases, but not
    decreases, by the Board. Mr.&nbsp;Mudd is entitled to participate in the company&#146;s
    Executive Pension Plan but at age 46 and his current years of
service, he is not currently entitled
    to a retirement benefit under that plan. During the employment term, Mr.&nbsp;Mudd
    will also be eligible to be considered for awards under the company&#146;s
    stock option, restricted stock, annual incentive and performance share programs,
    and to receive life insurance benefits, all in accordance with the company&#146;s
    compensation philosophy and life insurance policies and programs. Mr.&nbsp;Mudd
    will also be eligible to receive certain fringe benefits specified in his
    employment agreement, including up to $25,000 in tax and investment assistance
    and advice per year, legal expenses incurred in negotiating his employment
    agreement, access to a car and driver for business related transportation,
    and a complete annual physical examination. He is also eligible to participate
    generally in company benefit programs.

  <P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s employment agreement provides that if Mr.&nbsp;Mudd is terminated by the company other than
for cause, or if Mr.&nbsp;Mudd terminates his employment because of a reduction in base salary, certain
changes adversely affecting his authority or position, or any of certain other specified &#147;Good
Reason&#148; events, he would be entitled to receive base salary for the period through June&nbsp;30, 2007 or
until the first anniversary of termination of his employment, if later (subject to offset for
income from other employment or self-employment, other than board service), a prorated Annual
Incentive Plan payment for the year of termination, a prorated Performance Share program payment
for any award cycle as to which at least 18&nbsp;months had elapsed as of the date of termination, full
vesting of any unvested restricted stock awarded on February&nbsp;23, 2000, continued vesting for any
other awards of restricted stock as if Mr.&nbsp;Mudd had remained
employed through June&nbsp;30, 2007, and, until June&nbsp;30, 2007, medical and dental coverage for Mr.
Mudd and his spouse and coverage for his dependents (so long as they
remain his dependents or, if
later, until they reach the age of 21), at no cost. The same benefits would be payable in the
event Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s employment were to terminate at the end of the employment term by reason of a
failure of the company to extend the agreement on comparable terms, or were to terminate by reason
of serious illness or disability, subject to an offset against salary continuation for any
employer-provided disability benefits. In the event of Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s death during the employment term,

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">his beneficiary would be
entitled to an Annual Incentive Plan award for any year ended prior
to his death plus a pro-rated award for the year of death, and a
pro-rated Performance Share program payment for any award cycle as to which at least 18&nbsp;months had elapsed as
of the date of death, in each case of pro-rated awards based on the Board&#146;s determination of the likelihood that
performance targets would have been achieved, plus vesting of any restricted stock on the same
basis as described above in the case of an involuntary termination other than for cause. If Mr.
Mudd were to terminate his employment voluntarily other than for &#147;Good Reason&#148; as defined in his
agreement or were to be terminated for cause, he would be entitled only to accrued but unpaid base
salary plus such vested benefits, if any, to which he would be entitled under the terms of separate
benefit programs in which he participates. Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s employment agreement with the company also
obligates him not to compete with the company in the United States, solicit any officer or employee
of the company or its affiliates to terminate his or her relationship with the company or to engage
in prohibited competition, or to assist others to engage in activities in which Mr.&nbsp;Mudd would be
prohibited from engaging, in each case for at least one year following termination or, in the case
of a termination without cause or a voluntary termination by Mr.&nbsp;Mudd with &#147;Good Reason,&#148; until
June&nbsp;30, 2007, if longer. Disputes arising under the employment agreement are to be resolved
through arbitration, with the company bearing Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s
legal expenses unless he does not prevail. OFHEO approved the
termination benefits in Mr.&nbsp;Mudd&#146;s agreement on
November&nbsp;17, 2004.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Under an agreement dated June&nbsp;19, 1990 between Mr.&nbsp;Levin and Fannie Mae, which was filed as Exhibit
10.5 to Fannie Mae&#146;s Form&nbsp;10 filed on March&nbsp;31, 2003, if Mr.&nbsp;Levin is terminated for reasons other
than for cause, he will continue to receive his base salary for a period of 12&nbsp;months from the date
of termination and will continue to be covered by Fannie Mae&#146;s life, medical, and long-term
disability insurance plans for a 12-month period, or until re-employment that provides certain
coverage, whichever occurs first. Any disability benefits that he receives during the 12-month
period will reduce the amount otherwise payable by Fannie Mae, but only to the extent the benefits
are attributable to payments made by Fannie Mae. For this purpose, a termination will be for cause
if it is based upon reasonable evidence Mr.&nbsp;Levin has materially breached his duties by engaging in
dishonest or fraudulent actions or willful misconduct.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2004, Fannie Mae&#146;s Board of Directors appointed Stephen B. Ashley to serve as
non-executive Chairman of the Board, effective immediately.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;21, 2004, the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (&#147;OFHEO&#148;) issued a
letter to Fannie Mae&#146;s Board of Directors stating that Fannie Mae was significantly
undercapitalized at September&nbsp;30, 2004. In accordance with the provisions of the Federal Housing
Enterprise Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992, Fannie Mae must submit a capital restoration
plan proposal to OFHEO for review and approval, and is prohibited from making any capital
distribution that would result in Fannie Mae being reclassified as critically undercapitalized. In
addition, even if a capital distribution would not cause the company to become critically
undercapitalized, the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">company is prohibited from making the capital distribution unless OFHEO provides prior
approval of the distribution after it finds that the distribution (i)&nbsp;will enhance the ability of
the company to meet its capital requirements promptly, (ii)&nbsp;will contribute to long term safety and
soundness, or (iii)&nbsp;is otherwise in the public interest. As a result, Fannie Mae must obtain
OFHEO&#146;s prior approval before it may, among other actions, pay dividends on shares of its common
stock. The letter further states that the reclassification to significantly undercapitalized may
lead to structural changes and restrictions on growth, as well as OFHEO directives to terminate or
modify any business activities that OFHEO believes pose excessive risk.<U> </U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;23, 2004, Fannie Mae announced that the company received a letter from OFHEO that
approved Fannie Mae&#146;s payment of dividends on all series of Fannie Mae preferred stock due to be
paid on December&nbsp;31, 2004. The letter also stated that, at this time, OFHEO is not prepared to
issue an approval for subsequent periods and will continue to review dividend payment requests for
each quarter based upon the facts and conditions existing at the time. Fannie Mae&#146;s news release
regarding this matter is filed as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 to this report and is incorporated herein by

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;22, 2004, Fannie Mae received a letter from our safety and soundness regulator, the
Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO), that approved Fannie Mae&#146;s payment of
dividends on all series of Fannie Mae preferred stock due to be paid on December&nbsp;31, 2004. In
rendering its decision, OFHEO in its letter stated that the December&nbsp;31 dividend payment would
enhance Fannie Mae&#146;s ability to restore capital to minimum required levels, enhance the long-term
safety and soundness of Fannie Mae, and is in the public interest.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">OFHEO also stated that, at this time, it is not prepared to issue an approval for subsequent
periods and will continue to review dividend payment requests for each quarter based upon the facts
and conditions existing at the time. OFHEO said that, in each case, OFHEO would continue to assess
the impact on safety and soundness, the impact on achievement and maintenance of appropriate
capital levels, and the public interest.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We are appreciative of OFHEO&#146;s quick review and responsiveness on this issue.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">December&nbsp;21, 2004


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Fannie Mae Board of Directors Announces Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Raines and Chief
Financial Officer Howard To Depart From Company, Selection of Interim CEO and CFO</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">WASHINGTON, DC &#151; Fannie Mae&#146;s (FNM/NYSE) Board of Directors announced today the retirement of
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer Franklin D. Raines and the resignation of Vice Chairman and
Chief Financial Officer J. Timothy Howard.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Effective immediately, board member Stephen B. Ashley will become the non-executive chairman of the
board, Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer Daniel H. Mudd will serve as interim chief
executive officer, and Executive Vice President Robert Levin will serve as interim chief financial
officer. The executive search firm Spencer Stuart has been retained to work with the board. The
board further announced that the audit committee has dismissed the firm KPMG LLP as the company&#146;s
independent auditors, and has initiated a search for a new independent auditor.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;Fannie Mae is a great company deeply committed to its mission of expanding the dream of
homeownership to all Americans and serving the nation&#146;s housing needs,&#148; said Ann Korologos, the
presiding director of the non-management members of the board. &#147;We appreciate the many
contributions of Frank Raines and Tim Howard, their devotion to Fannie Mae and their commitment to
its mission. Fannie Mae&#146;s Board of Directors takes these steps today to move the company forward to
serve its critical mission in a safe and sound manner.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are confident in the leadership ability of Dan Mudd and Rob Levin to work with the board as
well as the company&#146;s safety and soundness regulator, Congress, the housing industry, and all of
the company&#146;s stakeholders. Together, we will continue responding to the issues identified by OFHEO
to ensure that the Fannie Mae of tomorrow is safe, sound, stable and even more able to achieve its
mission,&#148; Korologos added.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mudd, as Vice Chairman and Chief Operating Officer, has been overseeing the company&#146;s
single-family, multifamily, credit, housing and community development, e-Business, technology,
corporate marketing and administrative divisions. Prior to joining Fannie Mae in 2000, he was
President and Chief Executive Officer of GE Capital, Japan.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Levin joined Fannie Mae in May&nbsp;1981, and has served as Executive Vice President in various roles at
the company since 1990. During this time, Levin has overseen Fannie Mae&#146;s single-family mortgage
business, multifamily mortgage business, and its mortgage-backed securities business. He also has
been responsible for mortgage capital markets transactions, and disposition of real estate-owned
properties. Among other various positions in the company, Levin served as senior vice president for
corporate finance. Currently, Levin heads the company&#146;s Housing and Community Development division.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ashley, a Fannie Mae board director since 1995, is a former president of the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, and has been Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of The Ashley Group, a
group of commercial and multifamily real estate, brokerage, and investment companies, since January
1997.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Board of Directors today further said it continues to move forward to comply with Fannie Mae&#146;s
September&nbsp;27, 2004 agreement with its safety and soundness regulator, the Office of Federal Housing
Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). Board member H. Patrick Swygert, who leads the board&#146;s compliance
committee that was established to oversee implementation of the OFHEO agreement, said, &#147;We are
mindful of our obligations under the agreement with OFHEO, we are working diligently in cooperation
with OFHEO to comply with the agreement, and we are making progress on implementing its terms.&#148;

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Providing an update on the company&#146;s efforts to date to comply with the agreement, the Board said
that measures taken so far include the hiring of independent organizational and compensation
consultants; submission and approval of a detailed implementation plan for the agreement; and
submission of detailed work plans for the organizational and compensation reviews. Board member
Donald B. Marron will continue leading the work on the company&#146;s capitalization plan.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;The Board will be moving expeditiously to implement the letter and spirit of the September&nbsp;27th
agreement and continuing to make regular reports to OFHEO, maintaining a positive, constructive and
candid dialogue with the regulator,&#148; Swygert said.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Board further said that the independent investigation commissioned by its Special Review
Committee is proceeding to look into the findings of OFHEO&#146;s September&nbsp;21, 2004 special examination
report. The investigation, led by former Senator Warren Rudman of the law firm of Paul, Weiss,
Rifkind, Wharton &#038; Garrison, is focused on: accounting issues, including accounting policies
procedures and controls regarding FAS 91 and FAS 133; organization, structure and governance,
including board oversight and management responsibilities and resources; and executive
compensation. Paul, Weiss&#146; work continues as it thoroughly examines these areas and other issues
that may arise in the course of their review, reporting regularly to the Board.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;The Board of Directors is confident that Fannie Mae, working with OFHEO, will resolve the matters
before us, make the necessary changes, and emerge as an even stronger company with an even greater
future working in the best interest of our shareholders and investors,&#148; Director Korologos said.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Fannie Mae is a New York Stock Exchange company and the largest non-bank financial services company
in the world. It operates pursuant to a federal charter and is the nation&#146;s largest source of
financing for home mortgages. Fannie Mae has pledged through its &#147;American Dream Commitment&#148; to
expand access to homeownership for millions of first-time home buyers; help raise the minority
homeownership rate to 55&nbsp;percent; make homeownership and rental housing a success for millions of
families at risk of losing their homes; and expand the supply of affordable housing where it is
needed most. Since 1968, Fannie Mae has provided $6.3 trillion of mortgage financing for 63&nbsp;million
families.</I>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Style Usage: Fannie Mae&#146;s Board of Directors has authorized the company to operate as &#147;Fannie Mae,&#148;
and the company&#146;s stock is now listed on the NYSE as &#147;FNM.&#148; In order to facilitate clarity and
avoid confusion, news organizations are asked to refer to the company exclusively as &#147;Fannie Mae.&#148;</I>
