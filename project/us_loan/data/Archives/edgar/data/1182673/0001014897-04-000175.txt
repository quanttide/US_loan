ITEM 4.   CHANGES IN CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

(a)  On December 1, 2004, Capital Tech's independent public accountant
resigned.

     James E. Scheifley & Associates, PC reports on Capital Tech's
financial statements for either of the past two years, December 31,
2002 and June 30, 2001 did not contain an adverse opinion or a
disclaimer of opinion or was qualified or modified as to uncertainty,
audit scope or accounting principles.

During Capital Tech's two most recent fiscal years, December 31, 2002
and December 31, 2001, and the subsequent period through the date of
resignation, there were no disagreements on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope of procedure which disagreement(s), if not resolved to the
satisfaction of the former accountant, would have caused it to make
reference to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection
with its report as described in Item 304 (a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-B.

(b)  On December 1, 2004, the board of directors of Capital Tech
engaged the accounting firm of Jewett, Schwartz & Associates, CPA as
principal accountants of Capital Tech for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003.   Capital Tech did not consult Jewett, Schwartz &
Associates, CPA regarding the application of accounting principles to a
specific completed or contemplated transaction, or the type of audit
opinion that might be rendered on Jewett, Schwartz & Associates, CPA
financial statements and neither written nor oral advice was provided
that was an important factor considered by Jewett, Schwartz &
Associates, CPA in reaching a decision as to the accounting, auditing
or financial reporting issue; or any matter that was the subject of a
disagreement or event identified in response to paragraph (a) (1)(iv)
of Item 304 of Regulation S-B.
