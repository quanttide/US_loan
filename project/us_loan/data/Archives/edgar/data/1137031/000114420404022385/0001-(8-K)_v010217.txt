      This Form 8-K and other reports filed by Brands Shopping Network, Inc.
(the "Registrant" or the "Company") from time to time with the Securities and
Exchange Commission (collectively the "Filings") contain forward looking
statements and information that are based upon beliefs of, and information
currently available to, the Registrant's management as well as estimates and
assumptions made by the Registrant's management. When used in the Filings the
words "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "future", "intend", "plan"
or the negative if these terms and similar expressions as they relate to the
Registrant or the Registrant's management identify forward looking statements.
Such statements reflect the current view of the Registrant with respect to
future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
factors relating to the Registrant's industry, operations and results of
operations and any businesses that may be acquired by the Registrant. Should one
or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those
anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.

      ITEM 5.01 CHANGES IN CONTROL TO REGISTRANT

      (b)   The Company entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger with United
            Fuel & Energy Corporation ("UFE") on August 6, 2004 providing for
            the merger of UFE with a wholly-owned subsidiary of the Company,
            with UFE being the survivor (the "Merger"). In connection with the
            Merger, the Company agreed to a 1-for-40 reverse stock split of its
            outstanding common stock prior to closing of the Merger. Following
            the reverse stock split and the Merger, all of the UFE shareholders
            would receive an aggregate of up to 10,650,000 shares of Company
            common stock, on a post-reverse stock split basis. Upon the
            consummation of the Merger, it is anticipated that the ownership
            interest of current Company stockholders will be reduced from 100%
            to approximately two percent. Also, in connection with the Merger
            the existing directors of the Company will be replaced by directors
            of UFE. As a result, if the Merger is consummated there will be a
            change in control of the Company. A copy of the Agreement and Plan
            of Merger is attached as an Exhibit to this Form 8-K.
