restated in connection with Kindred&#146;s emergence from bankruptcy on April 20, 2001, (b) the ability and willingness of Kindred to continue to meet and/or perform its obligation to indemnify and defend the Company for all litigation and other
claims relating to the healthcare operations and other assets and liabilities transferred to Kindred in the 1998 Spin Off, (c) the ability of Kindred and the Company&#146;s other operators, tenants and borrowers to maintain the financial strength
and liquidity necessary to satisfy their respective obligations and duties under the leases and other agreements with the Company, and their existing credit agreements, (d) the Company&#146;s success in implementing its business strategy and the

impact on the liquidity, financial condition and results of operations of Kindred and the Company&#146;s other operators resulting from increased operating costs and uninsured liabilities for professional liability claims, and the ability of Kindred
