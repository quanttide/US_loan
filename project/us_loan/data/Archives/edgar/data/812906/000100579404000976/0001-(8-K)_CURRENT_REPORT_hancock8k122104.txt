Item 1.01.  Entry Into Material Definitive Agreement

     On December 16, 2004,  Hancock Fabrics,  Inc. (the "Company")  entered into
the Third Amendment to the Credit  Agreement with Union Planters Bank,  National
Association  and  BancorpSouth  Bank  and the  Second  Amendment  to the  Credit
Agreement with Southtrust Bank.  Combined,  these two credit  agreements make up
the  Company's  $50  million  revolving  credit  agreement.  The  purpose of the
amendments was to modify the fixed charge  coverage  ratio covenant  required in
the  original  agreements.  The  Company  is not  currently  in  default of this
covenant in the original agreements;  however, management believed that it would
be prudent to amend the agreements to allow greater flexibility. At December 16,
2004 there was $28 million outstanding under these agreements.
