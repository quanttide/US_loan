                                    --------

     The parties hereto, along with Wachovia Bank, N.A.  ("Wachovia"),  executed
that certain Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") dated as of April 16, 1999.

     The Credit  Agreement  provided  for a  revolving  credit  facility  in the
principal amount of Sixty Million and No/100 Dollars ($60,000,000.00).

     The Credit  Agreement was amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit
Agreement  dated March 26,  2002,  by and among  Borrower,  Union  Planters  and
Bancorp (the "First Amendment").

     Pursuant to the First  Amendment,  Union Planters  agreed to serve as Agent
under the terms of the  Credit  Agreement,  the amount of the  revolving  credit
facility was reduced to $25,000,000.00  and South Trust Bank and Wachovia ceased
participation in the credit facility.

     The Credit Agreement was further amended by that certain Second  Amendment,
whereby,  among other things,  the Termination  Date of the Credit Agreement was
extended  to  March  26,  2007  and the  Guarantors  agreed  to  unconditionally
guarantee the obligation of Borrower to Union Planters and Bancorp.

     Section 5.06 of the Credit  Agreement  requires that Borrower  maintain the
ratio of Income  Available for Fixed Charges for the period of four  consecutive
Fiscal Quarters then ended to  Consolidated  Fixed Charges for such period to be
greater than 1.50 to 1.0.

     Borrower has requested that Section 5.06 be modified.

     Union Planters and Bancorp have agreed to the  modification  upon the terms
and conditions hereafter set forth.

     The parties have agreed to execute this Third  Amendment to set forth their
understandings  with  respect  to  the  modification  of  the  revolving  credit
facility.

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do mutually covenant and agree as follow

     1.35 to 1.00 for each Fiscal  Quarter  ending on or before January 31, 2006
