Item 1.01.  Entry Into Material Definitive Agreement

     On December 16, 2004,  Hancock Fabrics,  Inc. (the "Company")  entered into
the Third Amendment to the Credit  Agreement with Union Planters Bank,  National
Association  and  BancorpSouth  Bank  and the  Second  Amendment  to the  Credit
Agreement with Southtrust Bank.  Combined,  these two credit  agreements make up
the  Company's  $50  million  revolving  credit  agreement.  The  purpose of the
amendments was to modify the fixed charge  coverage  ratio covenant  required in
the  original  agreements.  The  Company  is not  currently  in  default of this
covenant in the original agreements;  however, management believed that it would
be prudent to amend the agreements to allow greater flexibility. At December 16,
2004 there was $28 million outstanding under these agreements.

                      SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT


     THIS SECOND AMENDMENT TO CREDIT AGREEMENT (the "Second  Amendment") is made

hereinafter defined).

     WHEREAS,  pursuant to that certain Credit  Agreement  between  Borrower and
Bank dated as of March 26, 2002 (the "Credit Agreement"), Bank made available to
Borrower,  subject to the terms and conditions thereof,  the Syndicated Loan and
the Money Market Loan in the aggregate principal amount of up to $25,000,000.00;
and

     WHEREAS,  pursuant to that  certain  First  Amendment  to Credit  Agreement
between Borrower and Bank dated as of October 14, 2004 (the "First  Amendment"),
the Credit Agreement was amended in order to provide for a temporary increase in
the Commitment from up to  $25,000,000.00  to up to  $30,000,000.00  (the Credit
Agreement,  as amended by the First  Amendment,  hereinafter  referred to as the
"Credit Agreement, as amended"); and

     WHEREAS,  Borrower and Bank have agreed to amend the Credit  Agreement,  as
amended, in order to amend certain of the financial covenants contained therein,
as more specifically hereinafter set forth.

     NOW,  THEREFORE,  in consideration of One Dollar ($1.00) and other good and
valuable   consideration,   the  receipt  and   adequacy  of  which  are  hereby
acknowledged, the parties agree that the Credit Agreement, as amended, is hereby
amended as of the date of this Second Amendment, as follows:

     1. The Credit Agreement,  as amended, is hereby amended by deleting Section
5.06 in its entirety, and by substituting the following new Section 5.06 in lieu

          SECTION  5.06.  Fixed  Charges  Coverage.  At the end of  each  Fiscal
     Quarter  from the Fiscal  Quarter  ending  January  31,  2005  through  and
     including the Fiscal  Quarter  ending January 31, 2006, the ratio of Income
     Available for Fixed Charges for the period of 4 consecutive Fiscal Quarters
     then ended to  Consolidated  Fixed  Charges for the period of 4 consecutive
     Fiscal Quarters then ended,  shall be greater than 1.35 to 1.00. At the end
     of each Fiscal Quarter thereafter,  the ratio of Income Available for Fixed
     Charges  for the  period of 4  consecutive  Fiscal  Quarters  then ended to
     Consolidated  Fixed Charges for the period of 4 consecutive Fiscal Quarters
     then ended, shall be greater than 1.40 to 1.00.

     2. As a  condition  to the  effectiveness  of  this  Second  Amendment  (a)
Borrower shall have paid to Bank a modification fee in the amount of $62,500.00;
(b)  Borrower  shall  have  provided  to Bank the  resolutions  of the  board of
directors of Borrower as to the  amendments  contemplated  herein;  (c) Borrower

preparation,  amendment,  modification or enforcement of this Second  Amendment,
the  Credit  Agreement,  as  amended,  and any and all  documents  executed  and
delivered in connection herewith or therewith;  (d) Borrower shall have executed
and  delivered  to Bank all further  documents  and perform all other acts which
Bank deems  necessary or  appropriate to perfect or protect its security for the
Loans;  and (e) Borrower shall have delivered to Bank such other  documentation,
if any, as may be requested by Bank to satisfy Bank that this Second  Amendment,
and all other documents and instruments  executed by Borrower in connection with
this Second  Amendment or in furtherance  hereof have each been duly authorized,
executed and delivered on behalf of Borrower,  and constitute  valid and binding
obligations of Borrower.

     3. Borrower  represents and warrants to Bank that all  representations  and
warranties given by Borrower in the Credit Agreement,  as amended,  are true and
correct as of the date  hereof,  except to the extent  affected  by this  Second
Amendment.  Borrower  represents  and warrants to Bank that  Borrower is in full
compliance  with  all of the  covenants  of  Borrower  contained  in the  Credit
Agreement, as amended, except to the extent affected by this Second Amendment.

     4. Except as heretofore or herein expressly  modified,  or as may otherwise
be inconsistent with the terms of this Second Amendment (in which case the terms
and conditions of this Second  Amendment shall govern),  all terms of the Credit
Agreement,  as amended, and all documents and instruments executed and delivered
in  furtherance  thereof  shall be and remain in full force and effect,  and the

                                    RECITALS
                                    --------

     The parties hereto, along with Wachovia Bank, N.A.  ("Wachovia"),  executed
that certain Credit Agreement ("Credit Agreement") dated as of April 16, 1999.

     The Credit  Agreement  provided  for a  revolving  credit  facility  in the
principal amount of Sixty Million and No/100 Dollars ($60,000,000.00).

     The Credit  Agreement was amended by that certain First Amendment to Credit

     Pursuant to the First  Amendment,  Union Planters  agreed to serve as Agent

and conditions hereafter set forth.

     The parties have agreed to execute this Third  Amendment to set forth their
understandings  with  respect  to  the  modification  of  the  revolving  credit
facility.

     NOW, THEREFORE, the parties do mutually covenant and agree as follow

<PAGE>

1. Amendment. Section 5.06 is hereby amended by striking the language thereof in
its entirety and substituting the following:

     Section 5.06.  Fixed Charges  Coverage.  At the end of each Fiscal Quarter,
     beginning  with the Fiscal  Quarter  ending  October 31, 2004, the ratio of
     Income  Available for Fixed Charges for the period of four (4)  consecutive
     Fiscal Quarters then ended to Consolidated  Fixed Charges for the period of
     four (4) consecutive  Fiscal Quarters then ended, shall be greater than (a)
     1.35 to 1.00 for each Fiscal  Quarter  ending on or before January 31, 2006
     and (b) 1.40 to 1.00 for each Fiscal Quarter thereafter.

2.  Terms of  Credit  Agreement.  All  terms  under  the  Credit  Agreement,  as
previously amended, and related loan documents not herein specifically  modified
or amended  shall remain in full force and effect and are hereby  reaffirmed  by
Borrower and  incorporated  herein by reference as if fully set forth.  Borrower
specifically  affirms that all  representations  and warranties made pursuant to
Article IV of the Credit  Agreement as well as all  covenants  made  pursuant to
Article V of the Credit Agreement, not herein amended, or previously amended are
true and accurate as if made as of the date hereof.

3. Fee. For and in consideration of modifying the Credit Agreement as herein set
out,  Borrower  agrees to pay Union  Planters  and  Bancorp  a  one-time  fee of
$62,500.00, due on the execution of this Amendment.

4.  Capitalized  Terms.  Except as otherwise set forth herein,  all  capitalized
terms shall have the meanings as set forth in the Credit Agreement, as amended.

5. Binding  Agreement.  This Third  Amendment to the Credit  Agreement  shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties  hereto,  their  respective
heirs, next of kin, successors, permitted assigns, transferees and grantees.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF,  the parties hereto have caused this Third Amendment to
