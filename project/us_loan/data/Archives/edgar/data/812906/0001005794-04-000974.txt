HANCOCK FABRICS ANNOUNCES APPOINTMENT OF JANE F. AGGERS
AS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

Hancock  Fabrics,  Inc.  (NYSE  symbol:  HKF),  today  announced  the  following
appointments to be effective January 31, 2005:

- -   Jane F. Aggers as President and Chief Executive Officer and to its Board of
    Directors
- -   Director Wellford L. Sanders, Jr. as Non-Executive Chairman of the Board

Larry G. Kirk, current Chairman and Chief Executive  Officer,  earlier announced
his plans to retire from these positions.

Jane  Aggers,  56,  is a proven  executive  in the  fabric  retailing  business,
including 24 years with Jo-Ann Stores,  Inc. As Chief  Marketing,  Merchandising
and Supply Chain  Officer,  Ms.  Aggers led all strategic  initiatives,  product
development, merchandising, sourcing, supply chain management and communications
strategies of the Jo-Ann brand.  She served on the company's  Executive and Real
Estate Committees and was responsible for strategic and annual operating plans.

Wellford  L.  Sanders,  Jr.,  59, has been a  Managing  Director  with  Wachovia
Securities, Inc. since 1997. His prior experience includes 20 years with McGuire
Woods,  LLP.  In  addition,  he has  served as a director  of several  companies
including retailers Peebles, Inc. and Catherine's Stores Corporation.

Commenting  on the  management  succession,  Kirk  stated,  "Jane is admired and
respected in our industry and among the ranks of our senior officer team for her
creative marketing,  merchandising and management abilities.  I've known her for
several years,  and I am pleased to be turning over the reins at Hancock to such
capable hands."

Speaking on behalf of the Board,  Director  Sanders  said,  "We are delighted to
have been able to attract an executive of Jane's caliber and level of experience
to Hancock  Fabrics.  We are  looking to Jane and our  management  team  working
together to achieve an appropriate  return for our shareholders on the Company's
recent significant  investments in our new distribution center and point of sale
merchandising systems in our stores.

                                       6

"Finally, we want to gratefully  acknowledge Larry Kirk's 33 years of service to
the Company.  During his eight-year tenure as Hancock's Chief Executive Officer,
Larry has  overseen the  reinvestment  in the Company to  reposition  almost 300
smaller,  low potential stores;  open or acquire 230 new stores;  and to upgrade
our merchandise, store and financial systems with the completion of the roll-out
of point of sale systems throughout our retail network.  Certainly, the capstone
of his career with Hancock has been the development of the Company's new 740,000
square   foot   distribution   center   and   headquarters    facility.    These
accomplishments,  and a strong  financial  condition,  leave  the  Company  well
positioned for future growth," concluded Sanders.

Hancock Fabrics,  Inc. is a retail and wholesale  merchant of fabric and related
home sewing and decorating  accessories.  The Company operates 434 retail fabric
stores in 42  states,  supplies  various  independent  wholesale  customers  and
operates an internet store under the domain name, www.hancockfabrics.com.
