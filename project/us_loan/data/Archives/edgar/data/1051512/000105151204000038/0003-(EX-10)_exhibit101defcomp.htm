<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Eligible executives may defer up to
100% of their annual bonus up to a maximum of $400,000 and receive TDS Common Stock Unit
Matches on the amounts deferred. Company Stock Unit Match amounts will depend on the
amount of annual bonus that the executive deferred into stock units and the price of TDS
stock on the date his/her bonus was determined by TDS. Executives will receive a 25%
Company Stock Unit Match for amounts deferred up to 50% of their total annual bonus and a
33% match for any amounts that they elect to defer that exceed 50% of their total annual
bonus award. The Company Stock Unit Matches will vest ratably over three years.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Erics Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>TDS will establish bookkeeping
accounts that reflect the executive&#146;s deferral amount(s), Company Stock Unit
Match(es) and any earned dividends. The value of the executive&#146;s accounts will
change in direct proportion to the performance of TDS Common Stock. However, the amounts
credited to an executive&#146;s accounts will not actually be invested in TDS stock. The
amounts credited to the executive&#146;s accounts will be distributed in stock to him/her
when 6 months after he/she separates from service or on such earlier date as the
executive may elect that is at least two years after the election date. If the executive
separates from service earlier than January 1<SUP>st </SUP>of the fourth year following
the performance year, and such separation from service is for a reason other than death
or &#147;Disability&#148;, a portion of the Company match will be lost.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Erics Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In November or December of each
year, the Corporate Vice President of Human Resources will send a Bonus Deferral Election
Form for the upcoming performance year to all eligible TDS
executives. Executives wishing to take advantage of this bonus deferral opportunity must
fill out this Form and return it (delivered, post marked or faxed with signature) to the
Corporate Vice President of Human Resources no later than December 30<SUP>th </SUP>(see
Administrative Ground Rules &#150; Taxes). Upon commencement of the performance year, the
elections made by the executive on the Bonus Deferral Election Form shall be irrevocable.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Erics Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Shortly before the first of each
year, the Corporate Vice President of Human Resources will confirm all election deferral
decisions with the executives making them, as well as advise the administrative personnel
who need to be aware of the specifics of these bonus deferral election decisions. Those
executives who elect to defer all or part of a bonus under this Program will not be able
to receive an advance on that bonus unless the executive is experiencing an &#147;Unforeseeable
Emergency&#148; as defined on page 5.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Erics Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>After a participating executive&#146;s
bonus award has been determined and the amount he/she has deferred is known, two separate
accounts will be established for each participating executive: (i) the &#147;Deferred
Compensation Stock Account&#148;, which will be credited with the bonus monies that the
executive has deferred under the Program, and (ii) the &#147;Stock Unit Match Account&#148;,
which will be credited with the Stock Unit Match awards.  </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Erics Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The value of each of these Accounts
will rise or fall in direct proportion to the price of TDS stock. All participating
executives will receive statements of the number of vested and unvested share units they
have in their Accounts as of each December 31<SUP>st</SUP>. These statements will be
sent out annually as early in the first quarter as possible.  </FONT></P>

the share units actually were outstanding shares of TDS), and dividing this sum by the
closing price of TDS stock on December 31<SUP>st</SUP> of that year. The result is the

In
the event of an Unforeseeable Emergency, an executive may request a payment of all or a
portion of the share units credited to his/her Deferred Compensation Stock Account and the
vested share units credited to his/her Stock Unit Match Account. Withdrawals will first
come from the vested Stock Unit Match Account. For purposes of this Program,
&#147;Unforeseeable Emergency&#148; shall mean a severe financial hardship to an executive
resulting from (i) an illness or accident of the executive or the executive&#146;s spouse
or dependent (as defined in section 152(a) of the Internal Revenue Code); (ii) loss of the
executive&#146;s property due to casualty; or (iii) other similar extraordinary and
unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the
executive. Payment may not exceed an amount necessary to satisfy such emergency plus
amounts necessary to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of such payment after
taking into account the extent to which the hardship may be relieved through reimbursement
or compensation by insurance or otherwise or by liquidation of the executive&#146;s assets
(to the extent the liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial
hardship). College expenses and expenses incurred in purchasing a residence do not qualify
as an Unforeseeable Emergency. </FONT></TD>

If,
for example, the total vested share units credited to the executive&#146;s Accounts is 500
share units on the distribution date, the executive will receive 500 shares of TDS stock
less any taxes TDS is required to withhold (taxes may be withheld in the form of shares).
In this example, the dollar value, which is taxable income, would be calculated by
multiplying the closing price of TDS stock on the distribution date of his/her
distribution by 500. </FONT></TD>
