<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>CHICAGO &#150; Dec. 22, 2004 &#150;
Telephone and Data Systems, Inc. [AMEX:TDS] today announced that it will restate its
Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for the nine months ended September 30, 2004. The
company&#146;s Consolidated Statements of Operations and Consolidated Balance Sheets will
not change. The restatement will reflect only a reclassification between Cash Flows From
Financing Activities and Cash Flows From Operating Activities. The restatement will have
no effect on TDS&#146;s Net increase in cash and cash equivalents. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Tad Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In the third quarter of 2004,
TDS&#146;s 82%-owned subsidiary, United States Cellular Corporation, repaid certain zero
coupon debt at its accreted value of $163.3 million. The entire amount was classified as
Repayment of U.S. Cellular long-term debt under Cash Flows From Financing Activities on
the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Tad Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In the restated Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows, $68.1 million will be reclassified from Repayment of U.S.
Cellular long term-debt under Cash Flows From Financing Activities to Accreted interest on
repayment of U.S. Cellular long-term debt under Cash Flows From Operating Activities. As a
result, Cash Flows From Financing Activities will increase by $68.1 million from $26.8
million to $94.9 million and Cash Flows From Operating Activities will decrease by $68.1
million from $543.6 million to $475.6 million. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Tad Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>All of the numbers discussed above
are rounded. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Tad Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>No other amounts in the
company&#146;s financial statements will change. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Tad Para Flush" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>As a result of the restatement, the
previously reported Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows for September 30, 2004 should
not be relied upon. The company intends to file an amendment to its Form 10-Q for the
period ended September 30, 2004 as promptly as possible. </FONT></P>
