<p align="center"><b><u>PPL Establishes 2005 Earnings Forecast; Announces Dividend
  Growth Policy</u></b></p>

<P>ALLENTOWN, Pa. (Dec. 20, 2004) - PPL Corporation (NYSE: PPL) today announced
  its preliminary 2005 earnings forecast of $3.80 to $4.20 per share from ongoing
  operations. The midpoint of this forecast represents an 8 percent increase over
  the midpoint of PPL's current 2004 forecast. In addition, the company projects
  the continuation of a strengthening balance sheet and an improving credit profile.</P>
<P>PPL also announced today a plan to more aggressively grow its common stock
  dividend, which currently is $1.64 per share on an annualized basis.</P>
<P> &quot;Given the company's sound financial position, we have adopted a dividend
  policy that provides for growing the common stock dividend in the future at
  a rate that exceeds the projected rate of growth in earnings per share from
  ongoing operations,&quot; said William F. Hecht, PPL chairman, president and
  chief executive officer. </P>
<P>Hecht said PPL plans to pursue this policy until the dividend payout ratio
  reaches the 50 percent level, subject to the board of directors' quarterly dividend
  declarations based on the company's financial position and other relevant considerations
  at the time.</P>
<P>&quot;We are continuing to build value for our shareowners,&quot; said Hecht.
  &quot;We have a reliable stream of revenues from our energy delivery businesses
  in the United States, Latin America and the United Kingdom. Our energy supply
  business continues to provide consistent earnings, with about 92 percent of
  our energy supply sales in 2005 expected to come from long-term contracts.&quot;</P>
<P>PPL's current 2004 forecast continues to be $3.60 to $3.80 per share in earnings
  from ongoing operations. Hecht said the company projects a compound annual earnings
  growth rate in the range of 3 to 5 percent over the longer term.</P>
<P>The key contributor to the projected increase in PPL's earnings per share from
  ongoing operations in 2005 compared with 2004 is the increase in PPL Electric
  Utilities' delivery charges for 1.3 million electricity customers in central
  and eastern Pennsylvania. This increase, which has been approved by Pennsylvania's
  Public Utility Commission, will take effect on Jan. 1, 2005. </P>
<P>PPL's current 2004 forecast for reported earnings is a range of $3.65 to $3.85
  per share. The difference between the 2004 per share forecasts for reported
  earnings and earnings from ongoing operations is due to the positive net impact
  of $0.05 per share from four unusual items recorded during the first half of
  2004. </P>
<P>PPL's previously announced agreement to sell its Sundance power plant in Arizona
  to the Arizona Public Service Company, if completed, would result in an unusual,
  non-cash charge of approximately $47 million, or $0.25 per share, after taxes.
  Completion of the transaction is subject to certain regulatory approvals and
  other factors. Depending on the status of regulatory approvals when PPL files
  its 2004 Form 10-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the charge could
  be recorded either in 2004 or 2005. </P>
<p align="center"><b>2005 Forecast</b></p>
<p>The 2005 forecast for earnings per share from ongoing operations includes specific
  key factors for each of PPL's three business segments. The 2005 forecast also
  reflects dilution from additional shares of common stock outstanding as a result
  of the conversion of Premium Equity Participating Security (PEPS<SUP>SM</SUP>)
  units to common stock in May 2004. </P>
<p align="center"><b>Supply Segment</b></p>
<p>PPL projects that 55 to 60 percent of its total earnings per share from ongoing
  operations in 2005 will come from its supply business segment, compared to about
  65 percent in 2004.</P>
<P>The company is projecting flat energy margins based on a combination of offsetting
  factors. An increase in the generation prices under the Pennsylvania Public
  Utility Commission-approved contract between PPL Electric Utilities and PPL
  EnergyPlus for customers who choose not to shop for an energy supplier, along
  with a full year benefit of the 45-megawatt increase in capacity from replacing
  the Unit 1 turbine at the Susquehanna nuclear plant in April 2004, are expected
  to be offset by increased fuel and purchased power costs. </P>
<P>In addition to projected flat energy margins, the following key factors are
  expected to have an impact on 2005 supply segment earnings: higher operations
  and maintenance expenses in 2005 for a larger number of planned outages in PPL's
  fleet of power plants; the absence, in 2005, of tax benefits recorded in 2004;
  and higher depreciation expense, including a full year of depreciation associated
  with PPL's natural gas-fired power plant at Lower Mount Bethel, in Pennsylvania,
  which went into service in May 2004.</P>
<p align="center"><b>International Segment</b></P>
<P>PPL projects that 20 to 25 percent of its total earnings per share from ongoing
  operations in 2005 will come from its international business segment, compared
  to about 25 percent in 2004.</P>
<P>Key factors that are expected to have an impact on 2005 international earnings
  are: the regulator's recent decision regarding price controls at PPL's electricity
  distribution company in the United Kingdom, Western Power Distribution (WPD),
  for the 12-month period beginning April 1, 2005; and<B> </B>an increase in pension
  cost at WPD due to a recent actuarial valuation of the plan, which reflects
  higher pension obligations. </P>
<p align="center"><b>Pennsylvania Delivery Segment</b></p>
<p>PPL projects that 20 to 25 percent of its total earnings per share from ongoing
  operations in 2005 will come from its Pennsylvania delivery business segment,
  compared to<B> </B>about 10 percent in 2004.</P>
<P>A key factor that will impact 2005 Pennsylvania delivery earnings is a combined
  7.1 percent increase in distribution rates and transmission charges beginning
  Jan. 1, 2005, the first rate relief for PPL Electric Utilities since 1995. This
  rate increase, along with projected modest load growth, is expected to be partially
  offset by the absence, in 2005, of tax benefits recorded in 2004 as well as
  by increases in operation and maintenance expenses.</P>
<p align="center"><b>Cash Flow </b></p>
<p>The following table reflects PPL's expected cash flows for 2004 and 2005. The
  2004 amounts exclude the $123 million in proceeds from the sale of its minority
  interest in a Chilean electric distribution company earlier in the year.</P>

<p align="center"><b>Equity Ratio</b></p>
<p>PPL's business plan projects growth in retained earnings that would result
  in an equity to total capitalization ratio of approximately 40 percent and an
  adjusted equity to total capitalization ratio approaching 55 percent in 2005.
  The adjusted ratio excludes non-recourse securitization and international debt.</P>
<P>&quot;In developing the company's dividend policy,&quot; said Hecht,<B> </B>&quot;we
  closely analyzed our credit metrics and other factors for 2005 and beyond. We
  determined that the strong growth in PPL's retained earnings not only supports
  the dividend policy but also provides the potential for stock buy-backs in future
  years, while sustaining PPL's overall credit quality.&quot;</P>

<p><b><i>PPL invites interested parties to listen to the live Internet webcast
  of management's teleconference with financial analysts about the preliminary
  2005 earnings forecast at 9 a.m. (EST) on Monday, Dec. 20. The teleconference
  is available online live, in audio format, on PPL's Internet Web site: www.pplweb.com.
  The webcast will be available for replay on the PPL Web site for 30 days. Interested
  individuals also can access the live conference call via telephone at 913-981-5543.</i></b></p>

<P><i>&quot;Earnings from ongoing operations&quot; excludes the impact of unusual
  items. Earnings from ongoing operations should not be considered as an alternative
  to net income, which is an indicator of operating performance determined in
  accordance with generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). PPL believes
  that earnings from ongoing operations, although a non-GAAP measure, is also
  useful and meaningful to investors because it provides them with PPL's underlying
  earnings performance as another criterion in making their investment decisions.
  PPL's management also uses earnings from ongoing operations in measuring certain
  corporate performance goals. Other companies may use different measures to present
  financial performance.</i></p>

<p><i>&quot;Free cash flow before dividends&quot; should not be considered as
  an alternative to cash flow from operations, which is determined in accordance
  with GAAP. PPL believes that free cash flow before dividends is an important
  measure to both management and investors since it is an indicator of the company's
  ability to sustain operations and growth without additional outside financing
  beyond the requirement to fund maturing debt obligations. Other companies may
  calculate free cash flow before dividends in a different manner.</i></P>

<P><i>&quot;Equity to total capitalization ratio&quot; includes as equity minority
  interest and preferred stock as well as all of the components of common equity
  as presented on the balance sheet. Total capitalization is calculated as equity
  plus short-term debt plus long-term debt as presented on the balance sheet.</i></P>

<P>&quot;Adjusted equity to total capitalization ratio&quot; excludes transition
  bonds issued by PPL Transition Bond Company, LLC, under the Pennsylvania Electricity
  Generation Customer Choice and Competition Act, excludes debt of international
  affiliates, which is non-recourse to PPL. The adjusted equity to total capitalization
  ratio should not be considered as an alternative to an equity to total capitalization
  ratio using debt and equity balances as reflected on the balance sheet. PPL
  believes that this adjusted equity ratio is useful to investors because it provides
  them with another indicator of credit quality. The adjusted equity to total
  capitalization ratio focuses primarily on debt that is recourse to PPL. Other
  companies may present adjusted equity ratios in a different manner. </P>

<P><i>Statements contained in this news release, including statements with respect
  to future earnings, energy prices, margins and sales, growth, revenues, expenses

  and generating capacity, are &quot;forward-looking statements&quot; within the
  meaning of the federal securities laws. Although PPL Corporation believes that
  the expectations and assumptions reflected in these forward-looking statements
  are reasonable, these statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties,
  and actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the statements.
  The following are among the important factors that could cause actual results
  to differ materially from the forward-looking statements: market demand and
  prices for energy, capacity and fuel; weather conditions affecting customer
  energy usage; competition in retail and wholesale power markets; the effect
  of any business or industry restructuring; the profitability and liquidity of
  PPL Corporation and its subsidiaries; new accounting requirements or new interpretations
  or applications of existing requirements; operating performance of plants and
