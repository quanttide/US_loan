<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;During fiscal 2004, initiatives to broaden the markets we serve and accelerate
our growth began to pay off in substantial revenue to PSC,&#148; stated Joseph
Alsop, co-founder and chief executive officer of PSC.&#148; Our newer companies,
DataDirect, ObjectStore and Sonic Software, now account for 30&nbsp;percent of our
software license revenue. We expect total revenue from these newer companies to
continue to grow at double-digit rates in fiscal 2005. At the same time,
revenue from our OpenEdge&#153; product line continues to grow, even after
factoring in the impact of favorable foreign exchange rates. The latest release
of the OpenEdge platform, OpenEdge 10, is being well received and adopted by
Progress customers and Application Partners (APs).&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Highlights</B>
