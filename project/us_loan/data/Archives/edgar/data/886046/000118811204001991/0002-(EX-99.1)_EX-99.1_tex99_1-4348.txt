Attached to this release is reconciliation to Generally Accepted Accounting
Principles, or GAAP, that presents the components of the items excluded in
determining the Company's income before tax, net income and diluted earnings per
share amounts in the above table. The following three paragraphs discuss these
excluded items.

     (1) In the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company incurred research
     and development expenses of $1.0 million, or $0.01 diluted earnings per
     share, for development of the second generation power system and controller
     for the Arrow LionHeart(TM), the Company's fully implantable Left
     Ventricular Assist System (LVAS). The Company's remaining investment in the
     LionHeart(TM) includes $3.0 million of components and open purchase
     commitments usable with either the first or second generation electronics
     and $2.3 million in manufacturing equipment.

     (2) In August 2004, the Company initiated the consolidation of its
     operations at its Winston-Salem, NC and San Antonio, TX facilities into
     existing manufacturing facilities. In November 2004, the Company decided to
     move its European Distribution Center. These steps are part of the overall
     manufacturing realignment and capacity increases announced in June 2004. As
     a result, the Company has accrued $0.4 million, or $0.01 per diluted
     earnings per share, which primarily consists of severance payments in the
     first quarter of fiscal year 2005.

     (3) Excludes $1.5 million, or $0.02 diluted earnings per share, for the
     step-up of inventory purchased from AB Medica S.p.A., which was recognized
     in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 as additional cost of sales.

Sales of the AutoCAT(R) 2 WAVE(TM) intra-aortic balloon pump and related
LightWAVE(TM) catheter system in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005 increased
by 8% over the sales of those products in the fourth quarter of fiscal year
2004. Mr. Anderson said, "We are encouraged by these early results; however, the
selling cycle for intra-aortic balloon pumps is long and involves a number of
decision makers in any given hospital. As a result, we are cautiously optimistic
that sales will accelerate in the third and fourth quarters of fiscal year
2005."

MANUFACTURING STRATEGY:

Mr. Anderson stated, "We are now in the execution phase of our manufacturing
strategy. Our objectives are to (1) add capacity to support our growing
business, (2) simplify a rather complex supply chain, and (3) continue to make
process improvements that will help ensure that we deliver the highest quality
product possible to our physician and hospital customers."

During the quarter, the Company completed the transfer of the manufacturing of
its Cannon Catheter(TM) split-tip hemodialysis catheters from its Winston-Salem,
NC facility to its Asheboro, NC manufacturing plant. The Company plans to
transfer manufacturing of its NEO?CARE(R) line of products to its manufacturing
plant in Mexico in the spring of 2005. The Company expects inventories will
increase during the period of this transition in manufacturing operations in
order to compensate for moving the product lines.

NEOPICC(R) VOLUNTARY RECALL:

As previously reported, on December 3, 2004, the Company announced that, after
consulting with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), it was voluntarily
initiating a nationwide recall of all of its NEOPICC(R) 1.9 FR Peripherally
Inserted Central Catheters (the "NeoPICC Catheters"). The Company sent recall
notices to approximately 700 hospitals and 16 dealers, but is unable at the
present time to estimate the number of NeoPICC Catheters that will eventually be
returned by customers in response to this voluntary recall. The Company is
cooperating with the FDA's review of this matter.

Mr. Anderson stated, "Arrow has always recognized the importance of making sure
that every one of the millions of products we make each year is of the highest
quality. We have an ongoing program at Arrow to continuously improve all our
processes which touch upon our quality system in some way. As part of this
program to achieve operational excellence, we are assessing, with the help of
outside consultants, all of our quality assurance systems and processes to
enable us to do all that we can to protect the patients who benefit from our
products and technology every day around the world."

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS:

Arrow has submitted portions of the design dossier for the second generation
LionHeart(TM) power system and controller to the Company's European Notified
Body, TUV Product Services of Munich, Germany. The Company anticipates all


                                       6
<PAGE>

required documentation to be submitted by February 2005 and receiving an
approval for use of these electronics in the device approximately three months
later, given that many of its components have not changed, no additional
clinical data is required, and the LionHeart(TM) quality system has already been
certified. Arrow's European marketing plan for the LionHeart(TM) is based upon
the receipt of this approval and the CE-marking of the second generation
electronics.

The Company has completed development of modifications to its CorAide(TM)
continuous flow ventricular assist device to resolve elevated levels of
hemolysis experienced in the first implant of the device. The Company expects
that European clinical trials of the CorAide(TM) device should resume in the
near future. The cardiac transplant center at Bad Oyenhausen, Germany is
currently screening patients for a suitable candidate.

The Company has also commissioned a study of its entire Left Ventricular Assist
System program by an outside consulting firm in order to provide additional
perspective on the long-term commercial opportunity for these products and
strategies for maximizing their potential.

INTERNATIONAL BUSINESS TRANSACTION:

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2005, the Company purchased certain assets
of one of its distributors in Italy, AB Medica S.p.A. (ABM), for a total
purchase price of approximately $8.4 million, with various installments due
thereafter on account of ongoing tender contract sales. ABM had been one of
Arrow's distributors in Italy since 1982. The agreement includes the purchase of
distributorship rights, customer lists, as well as the inventory and specified
tender contracts associated with the sale by ABM of Arrow products. Arrow began
selling directly in Italy through its subsidiary, Arrow Italy S.p.A., in the
first quarter of fiscal 2005. Included in the first quarter of fiscal year 2005
was a $1.5 million charge, or $1.0 million against net income, ($0.02 diluted
earnings per share) for the step-up of inventory purchased from ABM.

Fiscal Year 2005 Targets:

THE COMPANY'S SALES AND EARNINGS TARGETS ALONG WITH SOME OF THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS
UNDERLYING THESE TARGETS FOR THE SECOND QUARTER AND FULL FISCAL YEAR 2005 ARE

FULL PARTICIPATION, IN THE COMPANY'S RECENTLY ANNOUNCED VOLUNTARY EARLY
RETIREMENT PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY WILL INCUR A NON-CASH CHARGE FOR
ACCELERATED VESTING OF STOCK OPTIONS HELD BY PARTICIPANTS IN THIS PROGRAM. THE
CHARGE TO EARNINGS AND CREDIT TO ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL IS DETERMINED AT THE
DATE THE PARTICIPANT SIGNS THE ELECTION FORM COMMITTING HIM/HERSELF TO THE
VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT PROGRAM AND IS CALCULATED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN THE CLOSING PRICE OF ARROW`S COMMON STOCK ON THAT DATE AND THE EXERCISE
PRICE OF THE STOCK OPTIONS WHICH BECOME VESTED AS OF THE DATE OF THE
PARTICIPANT'S RETIREMENT.

</TABLE>

The targeted growth rate for diluted earnings per share for the second quarter
of fiscal year 2005 is lower than the growth targets for the third and fourth
quarters of fiscal year 2005 due to favorable comparisons to the third and
fourth quarters of the prior fiscal year.

SAFE HARBOR STATEMENT:

"Safe Harbor" Statement under the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995: This news release provides historical information and includes
forward-looking statements (including projections). Although the Company
believes that the expectations in such forward-looking statements are
reasonable, the Company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove
to have been correct. The forward-looking statements are based upon a number of
assumptions and estimates that, while presented with numerical specificity and
considered reasonable by the Company, are inherently subject to significant
business, economic and competitive risks, uncertainties and contingencies which
are beyond the control of the Company, and upon assumptions with respect to
future business decisions which are subject to change. Accordingly, the
forward-looking statements are only an estimate, and actual results will vary
from the forward-looking statements, and these variations may be material.
Consequently, the inclusion of the forward-looking statements should not be
regarded as a representation by the Company of results that actually will be
achieved. Forward-looking statements are necessarily speculative in nature, and
it is usually the case that one or more of the assumptions in the
forward-looking statements do not materialize. Investors are cautioned not to
place undue reliance on the forward-looking statements. In connection with the
"Safe Harbor" provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of
1995, the Company cautions the reader that, among others, the factors below,
which are discussed in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended August 31, 2004 and in its other filings with the Securities and
Exchange Commission, could cause the Company's results to differ materially from
those stated in the forward-looking statements. These factors include: (i)
stringent regulation of the Company's products by the U.S. Food and Drug
