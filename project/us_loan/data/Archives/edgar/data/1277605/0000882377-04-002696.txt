Item 2.01.        Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.
                  ------------------------------------

                  For a description of the Notes and the Mortgage Pool, refer to
the Indenture.

Item 8.01.        Other Events.
                  ------------

         On or about December 21, 2004, the Registrant will cause the issuance
and sale of approximately $3,510,634,000 initial principal amount of
Mortgage-Backed Notes, Series 2004-4 (collectively, the "Notes") pursuant to an
Indenture, dated as of December 21, 2004, between American Home Mortgage Trust
2004-4, as Issuer and The Bank of New York, as Indenture Trustee.

         In connection with the sale of the Notes by Bear, Strearns & Co.
Inc. Lehman Brothers Inc., Citigroup Global Markets Inc. and UBS Securities LLC
(the "Underwriters"), the Registrant has been advised that the Underwriters have
furnished to prospective investors certain yield tables and other computational
materials (the "Computational Materials") with respect to the Class I-A-1, Class
I-A-2, Class II-A-1, Class II-A-2, Class III-A, Class VI-A-1, Class VI-A-2,
Class M-1, Class VI-M-1, Class VI-M-2, Class VI-M-3, Class VI-B-1, Class VI-B-2
and Class VI-B-3 Notes following the effective date of Registration Statement
333-118302, which Computational Materials are being filed as exhibits to this
report.

         The Computational Materials have been provided by the Underwriters. The
information in the Computational Materials is preliminary and may be superseded
by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Notes and by any other information
subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The Computational Materials were prepared by the Underwriters at the
request of certain prospective investors, based on assumptions provided by, and
satisfying the special requirements of, such prospective investors. The
Computational Materials may be based on assumptions that differ from the
assumptions set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. The Computational Materials
may not include, and do not purport to include, information based on assumptions
representing a complete set of possible scenarios. Accordingly, the
Computational Materials may not be relevant to or appropriate for investors
other than those specifically requesting them.

         In addition, the actual characteristics and performance of the mortgage
loans underlying the Notes (the "Mortgage Loans") may differ from the
assumptions used in the Computational Materials, which are hypothetical in
nature and which were provided to certain investors only to give a general sense
of how the yield, average life, duration, expected maturity, interest rate
sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of a particular class of Notes might
vary under varying prepayment and other scenarios. Any difference between such
assumptions and the actual characteristics and performance of the Mortgage Loans
will affect the actual yield, average life, duration, expected maturity,
interest rate sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of the Notes.
