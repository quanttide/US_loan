Item 4.01.     Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant.

     On December 16, 2004, upon  recommendation and authorization from the Audit
Committee  of the  Board  of  Directors  of MFRI,  Inc.  (the  "Company"  or the
"Registrant"),  the Company dismissed  Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte") as the
Registrant's  independent  registered public accounting firm for its fiscal year
ended  January 31, 2005.  Deloitte had served as the  Company's  auditors  since
1992.  Grant  Thornton  LLP's  engagement  by the  Company  as  its  independent
registered  public  accounting  firm was  reported  in the  Company's  8-K dated
December 2, 2004.

     Deloitte's  reports on the  financial  statements  for the two most  recent
fiscal  years did not contain an adverse  opinion or  disclaimer  of opinion and
were not  qualified  or modified as to  uncertainty,  audit scope or  accounting
principles.

     In  connection  with their audits for the years ended  January 31, 2004 and
January  31,  2003 and  through  the date of this Form 8-K,  there  have been no
disagreements with Deloitte on any matter of accounting principles or practices,
financial   statement   disclosures,   or  auditing  scope  or  procedure  which
disagreement  if not  resolved to their  satisfaction  would have caused them to
make  reference to the subject  matter of the  disagreement  in connection  with
their report on the Company's  financial  statements  for such years;  and there
were no reportable events as defined in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

     The Registrant has requested Deloitte to furnish it with a letter addressed
to the Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether or not they agree with
the  statements  made by the  Registrant in response to this Item 4 and, if not,
stating  the  respects  in which  they do not  agree.  A copy of such  letter is
included as Exhibit 16 to this report.

Item 9.01.        Financial Statements and Exhibits

         (c)   Exhibits.
