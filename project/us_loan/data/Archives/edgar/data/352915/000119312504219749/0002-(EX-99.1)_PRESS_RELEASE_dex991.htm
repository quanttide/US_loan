continuing operations for the year ended December 31, 2004 are likely to be lower than our previous guidance of $2.75-$2.85. Earnings per diluted share from continuing operations for the eleven months ended November 30, 2004 were $2.48 per share.

acute care hospitals located in the U.S. and Puerto Rico are expected to remain relatively flat as compared to the comparable prior year quarter. Our provision for doubtful accounts, while substantially higher than the prior year, should remain
relatively consistent as a percentage of revenue with previously reported 2004 results. However, our facilities in certain markets have experienced increased operating challenges which will adversely affect our financial results. </FONT></P> <P

in the fourth quarter, contributing to a substantial decline in the profitability contribution of this market. Additional capacity at a physician owned hospital in the McAllen market opened within the past week, which may further erode some of our
hospital&#146;s existing business. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Lakewood Ranch Hospital,
which opened in Florida in September, continues to experience operating losses in the fourth quarter. It also has diverted some volumes and adversely impacted the profitability of Manatee Memorial Hospital, its sister hospital. Methodist Hospital in
East New Orleans, acquired early in 2004, also continues to experience operating losses in part due to an increasing burden of non-paying patients. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The continued softness in admissions to our acute care facilities will generally result in an operating margin contraction during the fourth quarter as it
becomes increasingly challenging for us to conform our operating strategies to reduce salaries and wages and operating expenses (a large portion of which are fixed in nature) quickly enough to match the volume declines experienced in certain
markets. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">We will hold a conference call for investors and
