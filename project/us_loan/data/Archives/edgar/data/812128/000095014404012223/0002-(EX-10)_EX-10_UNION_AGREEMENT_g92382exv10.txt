                                    SENIORITY

Section 1. Seniority is defined as the length of an employee's continuous
employment in the bargaining unit at the Company's Hammond, Louisiana, poultry
processing plant since the last permanent date of employment. For purposes of
layoff, recall, promotion, and vacation only, this shall include continuous
service which began prior to the acquisition of the plant by the Company.

Section 2. All newly hired or rehired employees shall be considered as
probationary employees for a period of ninety (90) days during which period they
shall not acquire seniority, and during which they may be discharged without
recourse to the grievance and arbitration procedures provided herein. If
retained as a regular employee upon satisfactory completion of the probationary
period, seniority shall be retroactive to the first day of employment.

Section 3. In matters of layoff, recall, and promotion, consideration will be
given to an employee's skill, ability, attendance, versatility, training,
physical fitness, and seniority; and when, in the opinion of the Company, the
factors other than seniority are relatively equal, seniority will be the
deciding factor.

Section 4. An employee's seniority shall be lost and employment considered
terminated by:

      (a) discharge for just cause;

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

      (b) failure to return from layoff within five (5) working days after
          written notice by certified mail is sent by the Company to the
          employee's last known address on the Company's books. Actual notice to
          the employee of recall by any other means shall satisfy the terms of
          this provision;

      (c) voluntary termination of employment;

      (d) failure to report after termination of a leave of absence approved by
          the Company in writing on the first scheduled day following the
          expiration of such leave of absence;

      (e) engaging in a gainful occupation while on leave of absence;

      (f) absence from work for three (3) consecutive working days without
          notice to the Company, which shall be considered as a voluntary quit,
          unless notice was prevented by a cause beyond the control of the
          employee;

      (g) separation from the Company's active payroll for any reason, exclusive
          of leaves of absence approved by the Company, for a period exceeding
          an employee's length of service in the Hammond plant, or three (3)
          months, whichever is less.

Section 5. For the purposes of this Agreement, layoffs shall be classified as
(a) "short term" and (b) "long term". A short term layoff is a layoff which will
not exceed ten (10) workdays in length. Short term layoffs may be made without
regard to seniority. A long term layoff is a layoff which will exceed ten (10)
workdays in length. Long term layoffs shall be made subject to Section 3 of this
Article.

Section 6. All permanent job vacancies in premium rated classifications shall be
posted for forty-eight (48) hours on the plant bulletin board. Employees in
lower rated classifications desiring promotion to such jobs shall sign a bid
sheet posted on the bulletin board. An employee who does not sign such bid sheet
shall have no right to consideration for the vacancy. However, the fact that an
employee did not sign the bid sheet will not

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

preclude that employee's selection for the job by the Company if none of the
signers is determined to be qualified. If no qualified employee bids on the
posted position, the Company may fill the position in its discretion. If, after
a reasonable period not to exceed thirty (30) days, the employee selected for
the posted position achieves an acceptable level of performance, the employee
shall receive the rate of the new position. If the employee fails to perform in
an acceptable manner, such employee shall return to a job in their former
classification and the premium job shall be posted again. An employee who
self-disqualifies shall return to the extra board at the line operator's rate of
pay and shall not be eligible for bidding on a premium job for a period of six
(6) months. Section 7. Assignments involving employees on the extra board shall
be in order of seniority. Within a department, no extra board employee shall be
retained over a permanently assigned employee.

                                   ARTICLE XI
                                LEAVES OF ABSENCE

Section 1. An employee who has completed the probationary period may be granted,
at the Company's discretion, a leave of absence without pay for a reasonable
period of time, not to exceed one (1) month, for the following reasons:

      (a) emergency personal business;

      (b) Union business, upon written request by the Union's Representative,
          provided that no more than three (3) employees shall be on such leave
          simultaneously.

Section 2. Employees who have completed their probationary period are eligible
for up to thirteen (13) weeks per year of unpaid family and medical treatment
leave for the

                                      -12-

required which states that the employee is unable to perform the functions of
the employee's position.

      (b) Family serious health condition -- spouse, parent, or child. A medical
certification will be required stating the employee is "needed to care for the
individual."

                             CHECK-OFF AUTHORIZATION

To:   Any Employer under contract with United Food and Commercial Workers Union,
      Local 455, AFL-CIO

      You are hereby authorized and directed to deduct from my wages, commencing
with the next payroll period, an amount equivalent to dues and initiation fees
as shall be certified by the Secretary-Treasurer of Local 455, of the United
Food and Commercial Workers International Union, AFL-CIO, and remit same to said
Secretary-Treasurer.

      This authorization and assignment is voluntary, made in consideration for
the cost of representation and collective bargaining and is not contingent upon
my present or future membership in the Union. This authorization and assignment
shall be irrevocable for a period of one (1) year from the date of execution or
until the termination date of the Agreement between the Employer and Local 455,
whichever occurs sooner, and from year to year thereafter, unless not less than
thirty (30) days and not more than forty-five (45) days prior to the end of any
subsequent yearly period, I give the Employer and Union written notice of
revocation bearing my signature thereto.

      The Secretary-Treasurer of Local 455 is authorized to deposit this
authorization with any Employer under contract with Local 455 and is further
authorized to transfer this authorization to any other Employer under contract
with Local 455 in the event that I should change employment.
