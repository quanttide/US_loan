<FONT SIZE=3><P>&#9;<B>Middleburg, VA</B> - Interstate General Company L.P. ("IGC" or the "Company") (AMEX: IGC; PCX) reported today that on December 16, 2004, it received notice that the staff of the American Stock Exchange ("AMEX") had determined to proceed with the filing of an application with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") to strike IGC's common units from listing and registration on the AMEX.  The AMEX staff determined that the Company is not in compliance with Section 1003(a)(iii) of the AMEX Company Guide in that it has shareholders' equity of less than $6,000,000 and losses from continued operations and/or net losses in its five most recent fiscal years.</FONT></TD>

<FONT SIZE=3><P>The Company will not appeal the determination by the AMEX staff.  In response to an earlier notice from the AMEX dated December 10, 2004, that IGC was not in compliance with the continued listing standards of the AMEX, the Company informed the AMEX staff that it does not have available resources to bring the Company into compliance with the AMEX's listing qualifications, and that it was therefore not in a position to submit a plan to bring it into compliance within 12 months as required by the AMEX Company Guide.  The determination by the AMEX staff will become final on December 22, 2004.  The AMEX staff will suspend trading in the Company's units and submit the application to the SEC to strike the Company's units from listing and registration on the AMEX.  It is expected that such suspension of trading and application will be made on or about December 28, 2004, and the application will become effective on or after January 8, 2005.  As stated in the Company's press release dated December 14, 
2004, announcing that it had received notice from the AMEX of non-compliance with its listing requirements, the Company's management and board of directors are considering steps to be taken to protect the unitholders' equity in the Company following the de-listing of its units.</FONT></TD>
