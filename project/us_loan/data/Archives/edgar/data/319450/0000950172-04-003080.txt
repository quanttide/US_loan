Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On December 20, 2004, ZiLOG, Inc. (the "Registrant") entered into an
employment offer letter ("Offer Letter") with Ramesh G. Ramchandani for the
position of the Registrant's Executive Vice President of Marketing. The Offer
Letter confirms the terms of Mr. Ramchandani's employment with the Registrant
including his receiving a salary of $320,000 annually and a sign-on bonus of
$65,000 and his participation in the Registrant's health, insurance and
employee benefit plans. Under the Offer Letter, Mr. Ramchandani will also be
eligible for Quarterly Incentive Plan bonus awards based on achievement of
financial objectives pursuant to the terms and conditions of the 2004
Incentive Program. In addition, in lieu of participation in the MBO Incentive
Plan within the 2004 Incentive Program the Registrant has guaranteed bonus
payments for the first two years of his employment equal to approximately
$80,000 for each six-month period of service, provided that Mr. Ramchandani
remains employed with the Registrant on the relevant bonus payment dates.

Furthermore, Mr. Ramchandani received options to purchase 160,000 shares of
the Registrant's common stock that will vest over four years and with an
exercise price equal to the closing price of the Registrant's common stock on
the date that the option was granted. Under the Offer Letter, on the first
anniversary of employment, at the subsequent scheduled Board of Directors
meeting, subject to satisfactory performance of Mr. Ramchandani's
responsibilities and approval of the Registrant's Board of Directors, the
Registrant will recommend that its Board grant Mr. Ramchandani an additional
40,000 options to purchase shares of the Registrant's common stock that will
vest over four years with an exercise price equal to the closing price of the
Registrant's common stock on the date that the option is granted.

The Offer Letter also confirms that in connection with his relocation to
California, Mr. Ramchandani received a payment of $112,751 for moving and
temporary living costs, which along with the sign-on bonus is subject to
reimbursement on a pro-rata basis if Mr. Ramchandani terminates his employment
prior to completing one year of service.

The foregoing description of the Offer Letter is qualified in its entirety by
the full text of the Offer Letter, which is attached as Exhibit 10.1 to this
Form 8-K and incorporated herein by reference.
