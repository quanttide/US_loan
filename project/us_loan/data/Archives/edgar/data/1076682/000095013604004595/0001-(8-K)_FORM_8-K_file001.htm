ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

     On December 22, 2004, Majesco Holdings Inc. (the "Company"), issued
8,200,000 shares of the Company's common stock, par value $.001 per share
("Common Stock") upon exercise of warrants (the "Warrants"). The Warrants, dated
February 26, 2004, were exercised at a reduced exercise price of $0.85 per
share, and were issued as part of the Company's February 2004 private placement,
originally exercisable at $1.00 per share. The Company offered certain qualified
institutional buyers and institutional accredited investors the reduction in
exercise price in order to induce them to exercise the Warrants. The Company
received $6.4 million in net proceeds from the exercise of the Warrants. In
connection with the exercise of the Warrants, and in accordance with a letter
agreement dated February 12, 2004, whereby JMP Securities LLC ("JMP") served as
placement agent in the Company's February 2004 private placement, the Company
paid approximately $488,000 from the proceeds of such exercise.

     At the time of issuance in February 2004, the Warrants and the Common Stock
issuable upon the exercise thereof had not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended, and therefore could not be offered or sold in the
United States in the absence of an effective registration statement or exemption
from registration requirements. The Company believes that the sale and issuance
of the Warrants and the underlying Common Stock upon exercise are exempt from
registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the "Act") by virtue
of satisfaction of the conditions of Section 4(2) of the Act. The resale of the
Common Stock underlying the Warrants was subsequently registered pursuant to a
resale registration statement that was declared effective by the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") on October 29, 2004. As a condition to receiving the
reduced exercise price, and pursuant to SEC regulations, the exercising
warrantholders agreed that the shares of Common Stock received by them upon the
exercise of the Warrants would be removed from such registration statement. The
Company agreed to file a resale registration statement registering the resale of
the shares underlying the Warrants by January 10, 2005, and filed such
registration statement on December 23, 2004. If such registration statement is
not declared effective by the SEC by February 15, 2005, the Company will be
required to pay a penalty equal to 1.5% of the exercise price for each two-week
period after such date that the registration statement is not declared
effective, subject to a 6% aggregate annual cap.

     The Company also agreed that to the extent that the warrantholders
exercised their warrants at the reduced exercise price, and the Company reduced
the exercise price of warrants held by other investors by more than $0.15 per
share, then the Company shall be obligated to pay the exercising warrantholders
in cash the amount of any such excess decrease offered to such other investors.

Item 3.02 is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K and is
incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

     On December 28, 2004, the Company announced that it plans to effectuate a
one-for-seven reverse stock split in accordance with the approval of the
Company's stockholders received on November 4, 2004. The Company's Common Stock
is expected to begin trading on a post-split basis on December 31, 2004. The
reverse stock split is being undertaken in connection with the Company's pending
application to list its stock on the Nasdaq National Market.

     As a result of the reverse stock split, every seven shares of Common Stock
will be combined into one share of Common Stock. The reverse stock split affects
all the Common Stock, stock options and warrants outstanding immediately prior
to the effective date of the reverse stock split. Any fractional share resulting
from the reverse stock split will be cancelled and exchanged for cash. The split
will reduce the number of the Company's outstanding shares of Common Stock from
approximately 116.5 million to approximately 16.6 million, which amount includes
the shares of Common Stock issued in connection with the Warrant exercise
described in Item 3.02 of this Current Report on Form 8-K.

     A copy of the press release announcing the reverse stock split described in
this Item 8.01 is furnished as Exhibit 99.1 to this Current Report on Form 8-K
and is incorporated herein by reference.
