FOR IIMMEDIATE RELEASE:

            MAJESCO TO EFFECT A ONE-FOR-SEVEN REVERSE STOCK SPLIT IN
                 CONNECTION WITH ITS NASDAQ LISTING APPLICATION

           RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $6.4 MILLION THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF
                                    WARRANTS

EDISON, N.J., December 28, 2004 - Majesco Holdings Inc. (OTC BB: MJSH), an
innovative provider of diversified products and content for digital
entertainment platforms, today announced that it plans to effect a one-for-seven
reverse stock split in accordance with the approval of the Company's
stockholders received on November 4, 2004. The company's common stock is
expected to begin trading on a post-split basis on December 31, 2004.

The reverse stock split is being undertaken in connection with the Company's
pending application to list its stock on the Nasdaq.

As a result of the reverse stock split, every seven shares of the Company's
common stock will be combined into one share of common stock. The reverse stock
split affects all the Company's common stock, stock options and warrants
outstanding immediately prior to the effective date of the reverse stock split.

Any fractional share resulting from the reverse stock split will be cancelled
and exchanged for cash. The split will reduce the number of the Company's
outstanding shares of common stock from 116.6 million to 16.7 million, including
the shares of common stock issued in connection with the warrant exercise
described below.

In addition, on December 22, 2004, the Company issued 8,200,000 shares of common
stock pursuant to the exercise of warrants at an exercise price of $0.85 per
share. The Company received approximately $6.4 million of net proceeds from the
exercise of these warrants. The warrants were issued in the Company's February
2004 private placement with an original exercise price of $1.00 per share. The
Company offered certain qualified institutional buyers and institutional
accredited investors the reduction in the exercise price in order to induce them
to exercise.

As a condition to receiving the reduced exercise price, and pursuant to SEC
regulations, the exercising warrantholders agreed that the shares received by
such warrantholders upon the exercise would be removed from the registration
statement previously declared effective on October 29, 2004. On December 24,
2004, the Company filed a new registration statement for
