Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

          On December 20, 2004, the Registrant and certain of its wholly-owned
          subsidiaries completed a five-year, $250 million unsecured revolving
          credit facility with a syndicate of U.S. and Canadian banks led by
          JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, including up to $65 million which
          may be reserved for letters of credit and up to CA$30 million which
          may be borrowed and shall be repaid in Canadian dollars. This facility
          replaced our $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The
          amount outstanding on the revolving credit facility on December 20,
          2004 was $17.4 million. Cash borrowings are charged interest based
          upon an index equal to the Eurodollar rate (in the case of borrowings
          in US Dollars) or the bankers' acceptance rate quoted by JP Morgan
          Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch (in the case of borrowings in
          Canadian Dollars), plus a margin (ranging from 42.5 to 107.5 basis
          points) based upon the financial performance of the Registrant and
          certain of its subsidiaries. The companies are also charged a facility
          fee on the entire amount of the lending commitment (ranging from 12.5
          to 30 basis points, based upon company performance), and a usage
          premium (ranging from 7.5 to 12.5 basis points, based upon company
          performance) at times when borrowings exceed $125 million.

          A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10(i) to this
          Current Report.

         2.1 Commitments of the Lenders and the Swingline Facility.

                  (a) U.S. Syndicated Advances. Each U.S. Lender agrees, for
itself only, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, to make U.S.
Syndicated Loans to the Company pursuant to Section 2.6 and Section 3.3 and to
participate in Letter of Credit Advances to the Company pursuant to Section 2.6
and Swingline Loans from time to time from and including the Effective Date to

at any time outstanding the amount determined pursuant to Section 2.1(d).

                  (b) Canadian Syndicated Loans. Each Canadian Lender agrees,

Section 3.3 and to participate in Letter of Credit Advances to the Canadian
Borrower from time to time from and including the Effective Date to but
excluding the Termination Date not to exceed in aggregate principal amount at
any time outstanding the amount determined pursuant to Section 2.1(d).

                  (c) Swingline Loans. (i) The Company may request the Agent to
make, and the Agent may, in its sole discretion, make Swingline Loans to the
Company from time to time on any Business Day during the period from the
Effective Date until the Termination Date in an aggregate principal amount not
to exceed at any time the lesser of (A) $30,000,000 (the "Swingline Facility")
and (B) the aggregate amount of U.S. Syndicated Advances that could be but are
not borrowed as of such date; provided, that the Agent shall not make a
Swingline Loan after it has received written notice from a Lender or the Company
referring to this Agreement and describing a Default or Event of Default and
stating that such notice is a "notice of default" and such Default or Event of
Default shall be continuing. Each U.S. Lender's U.S. Commitment shall be deemed
utilized by an amount equal to such Lender's Pro Rata Share of each Swingline
Loan for purposes of determining the amount of U.S. Syndicated Advances required
to be made by such Lender. Swingline Loans shall bear interest at a rate agreed
to by the Agent and the Company, provided that Swingline Loans shall bear
interest at the rate applicable to Floating Rate Loans at any time the Swingline
Loans are refunded by Floating Rate Loans or the U.S. Lenders are required to
purchase participations therein under Section 2.1(c)(iii). Within the limits of
the Swingline Facility, so long as the Agent, in its sole discretion, elects to
make Swingline Loans, the Company may borrow and reborrow under this Section
2.1(c)(i).

                  (ii) The Agent may at any time in its sole and absolute
discretion require that any Swingline Loan be refunded by a Floating Rate
Borrowing from the U.S. Lenders, and upon written notice thereof by the Agent to
such Lenders and the Company, the Company shall be deemed to have requested a
Floating Rate Borrowing in an amount equal to the amount of such Swingline Loan,
and such Floating Rate Borrowing shall be made to refund such Swing Line Loan.
Each such Lender shall be absolutely and unconditionally obligated to fund its
Pro Rata Share of such Floating Rate Borrowing or, if applicable, purchase a
participating interest in the Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 2.1(c)(iii)
and such obligation shall not be affected by any circumstance, including,
without limitation, (A) any set-off, counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other
right which such Lender has or may have against the Agent, or the Borrowers or
any of their Subsidiaries or anyone else for any reason whatsoever; (B) the
occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of Default, subject to
Section 2.1(c)(iii); (C) any Material Adverse Effect; (D) any breach of any Loan
Document by any other Lender, the Borrowers, or

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

any Guarantor; or (E) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing (including without limitation the
Borrowers' failure to satisfy any conditions contained in Article II or any
other provision of this Agreement).

                  (iii) If Floating Rate Loans may not be made by the U.S.
Lenders as described in Section 2.1(c)(ii) due to any Event of Default pursuant
to Section 6.1(i) or if the U.S. Lenders are otherwise legally prohibited from
making Floating Rate Loans, then effective on the date each such Floating Rate
Loan would otherwise have been made, each U.S. Lender severally agrees that it
shall unconditionally and irrevocably, without regard to the occurrence of any
Default or Event of Default or any other circumstances, in lieu of deemed
disbursement of Loans, to the extent of such Lender's Commitment, purchase a
participating interest in the Swingline Loans by paying its participation
percentage thereof. Each such Lender will immediately transfer to the Agent, in
Same Day Funds, the amount of its participation. After such payment to the
Agent, each Lender shall share based on its Pro Rata Share in any interest which
accrues thereon and in all repayments thereof. If and to the extent that any
such Lender shall not have so made the amount of such participating interest
available to the Agent, such Lender and the Company severally agree to pay to
the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for
each day from the date of demand by the Agent until the date such amount is paid
to the Agent, at (A) in the case of the Company, the interest rate specified
above and (B) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate for the first
five days after the date of demand by the Agent and thereafter at the interest
rate specified above.

                  (d) Limitation on Amount of Advances. Notwithstanding anything
in this Agreement to the contrary, (i) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the
aggregate principal amount of the U.S. Syndicated Loans, the Swingline Loans and
the Letters of Credit at any time outstanding to the Company shall not exceed
the aggregate U.S. Commitments of all Lenders as of the date any such Advance is
made, provided, however, that the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate

Pro Rata Share of the aggregate U.S. Syndicated Loans, the Swingline Loans and
the Letters of Credit of any U.S. Lender shall not exceed the U.S. Commitment of
such U.S. Lender, (iii) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate Canadian
Syndicated Loans of any Canadian Lender shall not exceed the Canadian Commitment
of such Canadian Lender, (iv) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate
Canadian Syndicated Loans of all Canadian Lenders will not exceed the amount of
the aggregate Canadian Commitments that the Canadian Borrower has designated to
the Agent as activated (the "Activated Aggregate Canadian Commitments"), and the
Canadian Borrower can activate or de-activate the Canadian Commitments at any
time provided that any such activation or de-activation shall be in increments
of $5,000,000 and shall not exceed $30,000,000 in aggregate amount, shall be
effective ten Business Days after notification by the Canadian Borrower to the
Agent and shall not reduce the Activated Aggregate Canadian Commitments below
the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate Canadian Syndicated Loans of all
Canadian Lenders, and (v) the aggregate principal amount of the U.S. Syndicated
Loans, the Swingline Loans and the Letters of Credit will not exceed the
difference of the aggregate U.S. Commitments minus the amount of the Activated
Aggregate Canadian Commitments. As of the Effective Date, the Activated
Aggregate Canadian Commitments are $15,000,000.

                  (e) Multicurrency Participation. Each U.S. Lender shall be
deemed to have unconditionally and irrevocably purchased from each Lender in its
capacity as a Canadian Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided
interest in and participation in each Canadian Syndicated Loan ratably in
accordance with such Lender's Pro Rata Share and each Lender in its capacity as
a Canadian Lender shall be deemed to have unconditionally and irrevocably
purchased from each U.S.

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

and (iii) each of the Canadian Lenders shall pay to the applicable U.S. Lenders

Lender, in U.S. Dollars, an amount equal to the undivided interest in and

                  (a) The Bid-Option. From the Effective Date to but excluding
the Termination Date, the Company may, as set forth in this Section 2.2, request
the Lenders to make offers to make Bid-Option Loans to the Company.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no more than five requests for
Bid-Option Loans in the aggregate may be requested by the Company in any month.
Each Lender may, but shall have no obligation to, make such offers and the
Company may, but shall have no obligation to, accept any such offers, in the
manner set forth in this Section 2.2; furthermore, each Lender may limit the
aggregate amount of Bid-Option Loans when quoting rates for more than one
Bid-Option Interest Period in any Bid-Option Quote, provided that such
limitation shall not be less than the minimum amounts required hereunder for
Bid-Option Loans and the Company may choose among the Bid-Option Loans if such
limitation is imposed; provided, that the aggregate outstanding principal amount
of Bid-Option Loans shall not at any time exceed the lesser of (i) the excess of
(A) the aggregate amount of the U.S. Commitments over (B) the sum of the
aggregate outstanding principal amount of Syndicated Advances and Swingline
Loans or (ii) $75,000,000;

                  (b) Bid-Option Quote Request. When the Company wishes to
request offers to make Bid-Option Loans under this Section 2.2, it shall
transmit to the Agent by telex or telecopy a Bid-Option Quote Request
substantially in the form of Exhibit E hereto so as to be received no later than
11:00 a.m. Chicago time (i) on the Business Day next preceding the date of the
Loan proposed therein, in the case of a Bid-Option Auction for Absolute Rate
Bid-Option Loans, or (ii) the fourth Business Day next preceding the date of the
Loan proposed therein, in the case of a Bid-Option Auction for Eurodollar Rate
Bid-Option Loans specifying:

                           (A) the proposed date of the Bid-Option Loan, which
shall be a Business Day;

                           (B) the aggregate amount of such Bid-Option Loan,
which shall be a minimum of $3,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000;

                           (C) whether the Borrowing is to be an Absolute Rate
Bid-Option Borrowing or a Eurodollar Rate Bid-Option Borrowing; and

                                      -22-

                           (D) the duration of the Interest Period applicable
thereto, subject to the provisions of the definition of Interest Period.

The Company may request offers to make Bid-Option Loans for more than one
Bid-Option Interest Period in a single Bid-Option Quote Request.

                  (c) Invitation for Bid-Option Quotes. Promptly upon receipt of
a Bid-Option Quote Request, the Agent shall send to the Lenders by telecopy (or
telephone promptly confirmed by telecopy) an Invitation for Bid-Option Quotes
substantially in the form of Exhibit F hereto, which shall constitute an
invitation by the Company to each such Lender to submit Bid-Option Quotes
offering to make the Bid-Option Loans to which such Bid-Option Quote Request
relates in accordance with this Section 2.2.

                  (d) Submission and Contents of Bid-Option Quotes. (i) Each
Lender may submit a Bid-Option Quote containing an offer or offers to make
Bid-Option Loans in response to any Invitation for Bid-Option Quotes. Each
Bid-Option Quote must comply with the requirements of this subsection (d) and
must be submitted to the Agent by telecopy (or by telephone promptly confirmed
by telecopy) at its office referred to in Section 8.2 not later than (A) 9:00
a.m. Chicago time on the proposed date of the Borrowing, in the case of a
Bid-Option Auction for Absolute Rate Bid-Option Loans, or (B) 9:00 a.m. Chicago
time on the third Business Day prior to the proposed date of the Borrowing, in
the case of a Bid-Option Auction for Eurodollar Rate Bid-Option Loans; provided
that Bid-Option Quotes submitted by the Agent (or any Affiliate of the Agent) in
the capacity of a Lender may be submitted, and may only be submitted, if the
Agent or such Affiliate notifies the Company of the terms of the offer or offers
contained therein not later than (A) 8:45 a.m. Chicago time on the proposed date
of such Borrowing, in the case of a Bid-Option Auction for Absolute Rate
Bid-Option Loans or (B) 8:45 a.m. Chicago time on the third Business Day prior
to the proposed date of the Borrowing, in the case of a Bid-Option Auction for
Eurodollar Rate Bid-Option Loans. Subject to Section 3.8 and Article VI, any
Bid-Option Quote so made shall be irrevocable except with the written consent of
the Agent given on the instructions of the Company.

                           (ii) Each Bid-Option Quote shall be in substantially
the form of Exhibit G hereto, but may be submitted to the Agent by telephone
with prompt confirmation by delivery to the Agent of such written Bid-Option
Quote, and shall in any case specify:

                                    (A) the proposed date of the Borrowing;

                                    (B) the principal amount of the Bid-Option
Loan for which each such offer is being made, which principal amount (x) must be
in a minimum of $3,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000, and (y) may not
exceed the principal amount of the Bid-Option Loans for which offers were
requested;

                                    (C) whether the Bid-Option Loans for which
the offers are made are Absolute Rate Bid-Option Loans or Eurodollar Rate
Bid-Option Loans, which must match the type of Borrowing stated in the related
Invitation for Bid-Option Quotes;

                                    (D) the Interest Period(s) for which each
such Bid-Option Absolute Rate or Bid-Option Eurodollar Rate Margin, as the case
may be, is offered;

                                    (E) in the case of a Bid-Option Auction for
Absolute Rate Bid-Option Loans, the rate of interest per annum (rounded to the
nearest 1/1000 of 1%) (the "Bid-Option Absolute Rate") offered for each such
Bid-Option Loan;

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

                                    (F) in the case of a Bid-Option Auction for
Eurodollar Rate Bid-Option Loans, the applicable margin, which may be positive
or negative (the "Bid-Option Eurodollar Rate Margin") expressed as a percentage
(rounded to the nearest 1/1000 of 1%), offered for each such Bid-Option Loan;
and

                                    (G) the identity of the quoting Lender.

                           (iii) Any Bid-Option Quote shall be disregarded if
it:

                                    (A) is not substantially in the form of
Exhibit G hereto (or submitted by telephone to the Agent with prompt written
confirmation to follow) or does not specify all of the information required by
clause (ii) of this subsection (d);

                                    (B) contains qualifying, conditional or
similar language;

                                    (C) proposes terms other than or in addition
to those set forth in the applicable Invitation for Bid-Option Quotes; or

                                    (D) arrives after the time set forth in
Section 2.2(d)(i);

provided that a Bid-Option Quote shall not be disregarded pursuant to clause (B)
or (C) above solely because it contains an indication that an allocation that
might otherwise be made to it pursuant to Section 2.2(g) would be unacceptable.
The Agent shall notify the Company of any disregarded Bid-Option Quote.

                  (e) Notice to Company. The Agent shall promptly notify the
Company of the terms of any Bid-Option Quote submitted by a Lender that is in
accordance with Section 2.2(d). Any Bid-Option Quote not made in accordance with
Section 2.2(d) shall be disregarded by the Agent. The Agent's notice to the
Company shall specify (i) the aggregate principal amount of Bid-Option Loans for
which offers have been received for each Bid-Option Interest Period specified in
the related Bid-Option Quote Request, and (ii) the respective principal amounts
and respective Bid-Option Absolute Rates or Bid-Option Eurodollar Rate Margins,
as the case may be, so offered.

                  (f) Acceptance and Notice by Company. Not later than 11:00
a.m. Chicago time on (i) the proposed date of a Borrowing, in the case of a
Bid-Option Auction for Absolute Rate Bid-Option Loans or (ii) the third Business
Day prior to the proposed date of the Borrowing, in the case of a Bid-Option
Borrowing for Eurodollar Rate Bid-Option Loans, the Company shall notify the
Agent of its acceptance or non-acceptance of the offers so notified to it
pursuant to subsection (e) of this Section and the Agent shall, promptly upon
receiving such notice from the Company, notify each Lender whose Bid-Option
Quote has been accepted. In the case of acceptance, such notice (a "Notice of
Bid-Option Loan") shall specify the aggregate principal amount of offers for the
applicable Interest Period(s) that have been accepted. The Company may accept
any Bid-Option Quote in whole or in part; provided that:

                           (i) the aggregate principal amount of each Bid-Option
Loan may not exceed the applicable amount set forth in the related Bid-Option
Quote Request for the applicable Bid-Option Interest Period;

                           (ii) the principal amount of each Bid-Option Loan
must be $3,000,000 or a larger multiple of $1,000,000;

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

                           (iii) acceptance of offers may only be made on the
basis of ascending Bid-Option Absolute Rates or Bid-Option Eurodollar Rate
Margins, as the case may be provided, however, to the extent necessary to comply
with clause (i) above and notwithstanding any indication in any such Bid-Option
Quote that an allocation of the type contemplated under Section 2.2(g) would be
unacceptable, the Borrower may accept Bid-Option Quotes at the same Bid-Option
Absolute Rates or Bid-Option Eurodollar Rate Margins, as the case may be, in
part, which acceptance, in the case of multiple Bid-Option Quotes, shall be made
pro rata in accordance with the amount of each such Bid-Option Quote; and

                           (iv) the Company may not accept any offer that is
described in Section 2.2(d)(iii) or that otherwise fails to comply with the
requirements of this Agreement.

                  (g) Allocation by Agent. If offers are made by two or more
Lenders with the same Bid-Option Absolute Rates or Bid-Option Eurodollar Rate
Margins, as the case may be, for a greater aggregate principal amount than the
amount in respect of which offers are accepted for the related Interest Period,
the principal amount of Bid-Option Loans in respect of which such offers are
accepted shall be allocated by the Agent among such Lenders as nearly as
possible (in such multiples, not greater than $100,000, as the Agent may deem
appropriate) in proportion to the aggregate principal amount of such offers.
Determinations by the Agent of the amounts of Bid-Option Loans shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

         2.3 Effect on Commitments. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement
to the contrary, the sum of the aggregate principal amount of all Syndicated
Loans, all Letter of Credit Advances (being the maximum amount available to be
drawn under the related Letters of Credit plus the amount of any draws under
Letters of Credit that have not been reimbursed), all Swingline Loans and all
Bid-Option Loans shall not at any time exceed the aggregate amount of the U.S.
Commitments of all Lenders. Each Lender's obligation to make its Pro Rata Share
of any subsequently requested Syndicated Loan or Letter of Credit Advance shall
not be affected by the making by such Lender of a Bid-Option Loan, and the
Lender which has outstanding Bid-Option Loans may be obligated to exceed its
Commitment, provided that, as stated above, the aggregate principal amount of
all Syndicated Loans, all Letters of Credit Advances, all Swingline Loans and
all Bid-Option Loans shall not at any time exceed the aggregate amount of the
U.S. Commitments of all Lenders.

         2.4 Termination and Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Company shall
have the right to terminate or reduce the U.S. Commitments at any time and from
time to time at its option and the Canadian Borrower shall have the right to
terminate or reduce the Canadian Commitments at any time and from time to time
at its option, provided that (i) the relevant Borrower shall give three days'
prior written notice of such termination or reduction to the Agent specifying
the amount and effective date thereof, (ii) each partial reduction of the U.S.
Commitments shall be in a minimum amount of $10,000,000 and in an integral
multiple of $1,000,000 thereafter and shall reduce the U.S. Commitments of all
of the U.S. Lenders proportionately in accordance with their respective U.S.
Commitment, (iii) each partial reduction of the Canadian Commitments shall be in
a minimum amount of $5,000,000 and in an integral multiple of $1,000,000
thereafter and shall reduce the Canadian Commitments of all of the Canadian
Lenders proportionately in accordance with their respective Canadian Commitment,
(iv) no such termination or reduction shall be permitted with respect to any
portion of the Commitments as to which a request for a Borrowing pursuant to
Section 2.6 is then pending, (v) the U.S. Commitments may not be terminated if
any U.S. Syndicated Advances are then outstanding and may not be reduced below
the principal amount of U.S. Syndicated Advances then outstanding and (vi) the
Canadian Commitments may not be terminated if any

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

Canadian Syndicated Loans are then outstanding and may not be reduced below the
principal amount of Canadian Syndicated Loans then outstanding.

         The Commitments or any portion thereof terminated or reduced pursuant
to this Section 2.4(a), whether optional or mandatory, may not be reinstated.
The Company shall immediately prepay the U.S. Syndicated Advances to the extent
they exceed the reduced aggregate U.S. Commitments pursuant hereto and the
Canadian Borrower shall immediately prepay the Canadian Syndicated Loans to the
extent they exceed the reduced aggregate Canadian Commitments pursuant hereto,
and any reduction hereunder shall reduce the applicable Commitment amount of
each Lender proportionately in accordance with the respective applicable
Commitment amounts for each such Lender set forth on the signature pages hereof
next to the name of each such Lender.

                  (b) For purposes of this Agreement, a Letter of Credit Advance
(i) shall be deemed outstanding in an amount equal to the sum of the maximum
amount available to be drawn under the related Letter of Credit on or after the
date of determination and on or before the stated expiry date thereof plus the
amount of any draws under such Letter of Credit that have not been reimbursed as
provided in Section 3.3 and (ii) shall be deemed outstanding at all times on and
before such stated expiry date or such earlier date on which all amounts
available to be drawn under such Letter of Credit have been fully drawn, and
thereafter until all related reimbursement obligations have been paid pursuant
to Section 3.3. As provided in Section 3.3, upon each payment made by the Agent
in respect of any draft or other demand for payment under any Letter of Credit,
the amount of any Letter of Credit Advance outstanding immediately prior to such
payment shall be automatically reduced by the amount of each Syndicated Loan
deemed advanced in respect of the related reimbursement obligation of the
Company.

         2.5 Fees. (a) The Company agrees to pay to the U.S. Lenders a facility
fee on the amount of the U.S. Commitments, whether used or unused, for the
period from the Effective Date to but excluding the Termination Date, at a rate
equal to the Applicable Margin per annum. Accrued facility fees shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December, commencing on the first such Business Day occurring after the date of
this Agreement, and on the Termination Date.

                  (b) The Company agrees (i) to pay to the U.S. Lenders a fee at
a rate equal to the Applicable Margin per annum, on the maximum amount available
to be drawn from time to time under each Letter of Credit for the period from
and including the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit (or from and
including the Effective Date in the case of Existing Letters of Credit) to and
including the termination of such Letter of Credit, which fees shall be payable
quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and
December and on the Termination Date, based upon the Applicable Margin at the
time each such quarterly installment is paid, and (ii) to pay an additional fee
to the Agent for its own account computed at the rate of 0.125% per annum of
such maximum amount for such period, which fees shall be payable quarterly in
arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June, September and December and
on the Termination Date. The Company further agrees to pay to the Agent, on
demand, such other customary administrative fees, charges and expenses of the
Agent in respect of the issuance, negotiation, acceptance, amendment, transfer
and payment of such Letter of Credit or otherwise payable pursuant to the
application and related documentation under which such Letter of Credit is
issued.

                  (c) For each day on which the aggregate principal amount of
the outstanding Advances is greater than 50% of the aggregate amount of the U.S.
Commitments, the Company further agrees to pay to the Agent for the account of
each Lender a usage fee on the principal amount of each Advance for each such
day at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin. Accrued usage fees shall

                                      -26-
<PAGE>

be payable quarterly in arrears on the last Business Day of each March, June,
September and December, commencing on the first such Business Day occurring
after the date of this Agreement, and on the Termination Date.

                  (d) The Borrowers agree to pay to the Agent and the Arranger
such fees for their services as Agent and Arranger under this Agreement in such
amounts as may from time to time be agreed upon by the Borrowers, the Agent, and
the Arranger.

         2.6 Disbursement of Syndicated Advances. (a) A Borrower shall give the
Agent notice of its request for each Syndicated Advance in substantially the
form of Exhibit H hereto not later than 10:00 a.m. Chicago time (i) three
Business Days prior to the date such Advance is requested to be made if such
Borrowing is to be made as a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loan, (ii) three
Business Days prior to the day such Advance is requested to be made if such
Borrowing is to be made as a BA Rate Syndicated Loan, (iii) two Business Days
prior to the date any Letter of Credit Advance is requested to be made and (iv)
on the date such Syndicated Loan is requested to be made in all other cases,
which notice shall specify whether a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loan, Floating
Rate Loan, BA Rate Syndicated Loan, or a Letter of Credit Advance is requested
and, in the case of each requested Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loan or BA Rate
Syndicated Loan, the Interest Period to be initially applicable to such Loan.
The Company shall give the Agent notice of its request for each Swingline Loan
in such form requested by the Agent not later than 11:00 a.m. Chicago time on
the same Business Day such Swingline Loan is requested to be made. The Agent, on
the same day any such notice is given, shall provide notice of each such
requested U.S. Syndicated Loan to each U.S. Lender and of each such Canadian
Syndicated Loan to each Canadian Lender. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this Agreement, the proceeds of each such requested Syndicated Loan and
Swingline Loan shall be made available to each Borrower by depositing the
proceeds thereof, in Same Day Funds, in an account maintained and designated by
such Borrower at the applicable Agent Payment Office. Subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Agent shall, on the date any Letter of Credit
Advance is requested to be made, issue the related Letter of Credit on behalf of
the Lenders for the account of the Company; provided, that the Agent shall not
issue, and shall not be required to issue, any Letter of Credit Advance after it
has received written notice from a Lender or the Company referring to this
Agreement and describing a Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default" and such Default or Event of Default shall be
continuing. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Agent may
decline to issue any requested Letter of Credit on the basis that the
beneficiary, the purpose of issuance or the terms or the conditions of drawing
are unacceptable to it based upon any legal, policy or ethical concerns in its
reasonable discretion. Each U.S. Syndicated Loan shall be made in U.S. Dollars
from the U.S. Lenders in accordance with their Pro Rata Share and shall be
Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loans or Floating Rate Loans. Each Canadian
Syndicated Loan shall be made in Canadian Dollars from the Canadian Lenders in
accordance with their Pro Rata Share and shall be BA Rate Syndicated Loans or
Floating Rate Loans.

                  (b) Subject to Section 2.6(g), each U.S. Lender, on the date
any U.S. Syndicated Loan is requested to be made, shall make its Pro Rata Share
of such U.S. Syndicated Loan available in Same Day Funds for disbursement to the
Company pursuant to the terms and conditions of this Agreement at the applicable
Agent Payment Office. Unless the Agent shall have received notice from any
Lender prior to the date such U.S. Syndicated Loan is requested to be made under
this Section 2.6 that such Lender will not make available to the Agent such U.S.
Lender's Pro Rata Share of such Loan, the Agent may assume that such Lender has
made such portion available to the Agent on the date such Loan is requested to
be made in accordance with this Section 2.6. If and to the extent such U.S.
Lender shall not have so made such Pro Rata Share available to the Agent, the
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make such amount available to the
Company, and such U.S. Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand
such

                                      -27-
<PAGE>

amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date such amount is
made available to the Company by the Agent until the date such amount is repaid
to the Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the Federal Funds Rate then in effect
for the first three Business Days and at the Floating Rate thereafter. If such
U.S. Lender shall pay such amount to the Agent together with interest, such
amount so paid shall constitute a U.S. Syndicated Loan by such Lender as part of
the related Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement. The failure of any Lender
to make its Pro Rata Share of any such Borrowing available to the Agent shall
not relieve any other Lender of its obligation to make available its Pro Rata
Share of such Loan on the date such Loan is requested to be made, but no Lender
shall be responsible for failure of any other Lender to make such Pro Rata Share
available to the Agent on the date of any such Loan.

                  (c) Each Canadian Lender, on the date any Canadian Syndicated
Loan is requested to be made, shall make such Canadian Syndicated Loan available
in Same Day Funds for disbursement to the Canadian Borrower pursuant to the
terms and conditions of this Agreement at the applicable Agent Payment Office.
Unless the Agent shall have received notice from a Canadian Lender prior to the
date such Canadian Syndicated Loan is requested to be made under this Section
2.6 that such Canadian Lender will not make available to the Agent such Canadian
Syndicated Loan, the Agent may assume that such Canadian Lender has made such
Canadian Syndicated Loan to the Agent on the date such Loan is requested to be
made in accordance with this Section 2.6. If and to the extent a Canadian Lender
shall not have so made such Canadian Syndicated Loan available to the Agent, the
Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) make such Loan available to the
Canadian Borrower, and such Canadian Lender agrees to pay to the Agent forthwith
on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
such amount is made available to the Canadian Borrower by the Agent until the
date such amount is repaid to the Agent, at a rate per annum equal to the cost
of funds rate determined by the Agent for the first three Business Days and
thereafter at the Floating Rate. If a Canadian Lender shall pay such amount to
the Agent together with interest, such amount so paid shall constitute a
Canadian Syndicated Loan by such Canadian Lender as part of the related
Borrowing for purposes of this Agreement.

                  (d) All Syndicated Loans shall be evidenced by the Revolving
Credit Notes and all Swingline Loans shall be evidenced by the Swingline Note,
and all such Loans shall be due and payable and bear interest as provided in
Article III. Each Lender is hereby authorized by the Borrowers to record on the
schedule attached to the Notes, or in its books and records, the date, amount
and type of each Loan and the duration of the related Interest Period (if
applicable), the amount of each payment or prepayment of principal thereon, and
the other information provided for on such schedule, which schedule or books and
records, as the case may be, shall constitute prima facie evidence of the
information so recorded, provided, however, that failure of any Lender to
record, or any error in recording, any such information shall not relieve a
Borrower of its obligation to repay the outstanding principal amount of the
Loans, all accrued interest thereon and other amounts payable with respect
thereto in accordance with the terms of the Notes and this Agreement. Subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Company may borrow U.S.
Syndicated Loans and Swingline Loans under this Section 2.6 and under Section
3.3, prepay Syndicated Loans and Swingline Loans pursuant to Section 3.1 and
reborrow Syndicated Loans and Swingline Loans under this Section 2.6 and under
Section 3.3. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the Canadian
Borrower may borrow Canadian Syndicated Loans under this Section 2.6, prepay
Canadian Syndicated Loans pursuant to Section 3.1 and reborrow Canadian
Syndicated Loans under this Section 2.6.

                  (e) All Bid-Option Loans shall be in U.S. Dollars and shall be
disbursed directly by the Lender making such Bid-Option Loan to the Company by
1:30 p.m. Chicago time on the date such Bid-Option Loan is requested to be made
via wire transfer in Same Day Funds to JPMCB, 611

Woodward Avenue, Detroit, Michigan 48226, ABA Number 072000326, Reference:
Universal Forest Products, Inc. confirm to Agency Administration, or as
otherwise directed by the Company.

                  (f) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to require or
authorize any Lender to issue any Letter of Credit, it being recognized that the
Agent has the sole obligation under this Agreement to issue Letters of Credit on
behalf of the Lenders, and the Commitment of each Lender with respect to Letter
of Credit Advances is expressly conditioned upon the Agent's performance of such
obligations. Upon such issuance by the Agent (or on the Effective Date in the
case of the Existing Letters of Credit), each Lender shall automatically acquire
a risk participation interest in such Letter of Credit Advance based on its Pro
Rata Share. If the Agent shall honor a draft or other demand for payment
presented or made under any Letter of Credit, the Agent shall provide notice
thereof to each Lender on the date such draft or demand is honored unless the
applicable Borrower shall have satisfied its reimbursement obligation under
Section 3.3 by payment to the Agent on such date. Each Lender, on such date,
shall make its Pro Rata Share of the amount paid by the Agent available in Same
Day Funds at the applicable Agent Payment Office for the account of the Agent.
If and to the extent such Lender shall not have made such Pro Rata Share
available to the Agent, such Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree
to pay to the Agent forthwith on demand such amount together with interest
thereon, for each day from the date such amount was paid by the Agent until such
amount is so made available to the Agent at a per annum rate equal to the
Federal Funds Rate. If such Lender shall pay such amount to the Agent together
with such interest, such amount so paid shall constitute a Syndicated Loan by
such Lender as part of the Advance disbursed in respect of the reimbursement
obligation of the applicable Borrower under Section 3.3 for purposes of this
Agreement. The failure of any Lender to make its Pro Rata Share of any such
amount paid by the Agent available to the Agent shall not relieve any other
Lender of its obligation to make available its Pro Rata Portion of such amount,
but no Lender shall be responsible for failure of any other Lender to make such
Pro Rata Portion available to the Agent.

                  (g) If on any proposed date of an Advance the Canadian
Borrower has requested Canadian Syndicated Loans (the "Requested Canadian
Syndicated Loans"), (i) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the aggregate principal
amount of the Requested Canadian Syndicated Loans exceeds the Aggregate
Available Canadian Commitments on such date (before giving effect to the making
and payment of any Loans required to be made pursuant to this clause (g) on such
date) and (ii) the U.S. Dollar Equivalent of the amount of such excess is less
than or equal to the Aggregate Available U.S. Commitments of all Canadian
Lenders (before giving effect to the making and payment of any Loans pursuant to
this clause (g) on such date), each U.S. Lender shall make a U.S. Syndicated
Loan to the Company on such date, and the proceeds of such Loans shall be
simultaneously applied to repay outstanding U.S. Syndicated Loans of the
Canadian Lenders, in amounts such that, after giving effect to (1) such
borrowings and repayments and (2) the borrowing from the Canadian Lenders of the
Requested Canadian Syndicated Loans, the Aggregate Syndicated Outstandings of
each Lender will equal (as nearly as possible) its Pro Rata Share. To effect
such borrowings and repayments, (x) not later than 10:00 a.m., Chicago time, on
such date, the proceeds of such U.S. Syndicated Loans shall be made available by
each U.S. Lender to the Agent at its applicable Agent Payment Office in Same Day
Funds and the Agent shall apply the proceeds of such U.S. Syndicated Loans
toward repayment of outstanding U.S. Syndicated Loans of the Canadian Lenders
and (y) concurrently with the repayment of such outstanding U.S. Syndicated
Loans of such Canadian Lender on such date, (1) such Canadian Lenders shall, in
accordance with the applicable provisions hereof, make the Canadian Syndicated
Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the amount so requested (but not in any
event greater than the amount allowed under Section 2.1(d)) after giving effect
to the making and repayment of any Loans on such date and (2) the relevant
Borrower shall pay to the Agent for the account of the Lenders whose Loans to
such Borrower are paid on such date pursuant to this clause (g) all interest
accrued on the amounts repaid to the date of such

                                      -29-

repayment. If any borrowing of U.S. Syndicated Loans is required pursuant to
this clause (g), the Company shall notify the Agent in the manner provided for
U.S. Syndicated Loans in Section 2.6(a).

satisfaction of the following conditions precedent:

                  (a) The representations and warranties contained in Article IV
hereof and in any other Loan Document shall be true and correct in all material
respects on and as of the date such Advance is made, continued or converted
(both before and after such Advance is made, continued or converted) as if such
representations and warranties were made on and as of such date; and

                  (b) No Event of Default and no Default shall exist or shall

<PAGE>

warranties contained in Section 4.6 hereof shall be deemed made with respect
to the most recent financial statements delivered pursuant to Section
5.1(d)(iii).

         2.9 Subsequent Elections as to Borrowings. The Company may elect (a) to
continue a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing of one type, or a portion
thereof, as a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing of the then existing type, or
(b) may elect to convert a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing, or a portion
thereof, to a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing of another type or (c) elect
to convert a Floating Rate Borrowing, or a portion thereof, to a Eurodollar Rate
Syndicated Borrowing, and the Canadian Borrower may elect (i) to continue a BA
Rate Borrowing of one type, or a portion thereof, as a BA Rate Borrowing of the
then existing type, or (ii) may elect to convert a BA Rate Borrowing, or a
portion thereof, to a BA Rate Borrowing of another type or (iii) elect to
convert a Floating Rate Borrowing, or a portion thereof, to a BA Rate Borrowing,
in each case by giving notice thereof to the Agent in substantially the form of
Exhibit L hereto not later than 10:00 a.m. Chicago time (A) three Business Days
prior to the date any such continuation of or conversion to a Eurodollar Rate
Syndicated Borrowing is to be effective, (B) three Business Days prior to the
date any such continuation of or conversion to a BA Rate Borrowing is to be
effective, and (C) the date such continuation or conversion is to be effective
in all other cases, provided that an outstanding Eurodollar Rate Syndicated
Borrowing and BA Rate Syndicated Loan may only be converted on the last day of
the then current Interest Period with respect to such Borrowing unless the
Company has paid break funding costs as set forth in Section 3.9, and provided,
further, if a continuation of a Borrowing as, or a conversion of a Borrowing to,
a Fixed Rate Borrowing is requested, such notice shall also specify the Interest
Period to be applicable thereto upon such continuation or conversion. The Agent,
on the day any such notice is given, shall provide notice of such election to
the Lenders. If a Borrower shall not timely deliver such a notice with respect
to any outstanding Fixed Rate Syndicated Borrowing, such Borrower shall be
deemed to have elected to convert such Fixed Rate Syndicated Borrowing to a
Floating Rate Borrowing on the last day of the then current Interest Period with
respect to such Borrowing.

         2.10 Limitation of Requests and Elections. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, if, upon receiving a request for a
Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.6, or a request for a
continuation of a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing as a Eurodollar Rate
Syndicated Borrowing of the then existing type, or a request for conversion of a
Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing of one type to a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated
Borrowing of another type, or a request for a conversion of a Floating Rate
Borrowing to a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing pursuant to Section 2.9, (a)
in the case of any Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing, deposits in U.S.
Dollars for periods comparable to the Interest Period elected by the Company are
not available to any Lender in the relevant interbank or secondary market and
such Lender has provided to the Agent and the Company a certificate prepared in
good faith to that effect, or (b) any Lender reasonably determines that the
Eurodollar Base Rate will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to such
Lender of making, funding or maintaining the related Eurodollar Rate Syndicated
Loan and such Lender has provided to the Agent and the Company a certificate
prepared in good faith to that effect, or (c) by reason of national or
international financial, political or economic conditions or by reason of any
applicable law, treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or
hereafter in effect, or the interpretation or administration thereof by any
governmental authority charged with the interpretation or administration
thereof, or compliance by any Lender with any directive of such authority
(whether or not having the force of law), including without limitation exchange
controls, it is impracticable, unlawful or impossible for any Lender (i) to make
or fund the relevant Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing or (ii) to continue
such Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Borrowing as a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated
Borrowing of the then existing type or (iii) to convert a Loan to such a
Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loan, and such Lender has provided to the Agent and
the Company a certificate prepared in good faith to that effect, then,
notwithstanding any other provision herein, (A) the

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

Commitment of such Lender to make or continue Eurodollar Rate Syndicated
Borrowings or to convert Floating Rate Loans to Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loans
shall forthwith be canceled until such time as such Lender shall no longer be
subject to such circumstances preventing it from making or maintaining the
affected Loans, and (B) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurodollar Rate
Syndicated Loans, if any, shall be converted automatically to Floating Rate
Loans on the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with
respect thereto or within such earlier period as may be required by law. If any
such conversion of a Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loan occurs on a day which is
not the last day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the
Company shall pay to such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required under
Section 3.9.

         2.11 Minimum Amounts; Limitation on Number of Borrowings. Except for
(a) Borrowings and conversions thereof which exhaust the entire remaining amount
of the Commitments, and (b) conversions or payments required pursuant to Section
3.1(c) or Section 3.8, each Syndicated Advance, each continuation or conversion
pursuant to Section 2.9 and each prepayment thereof shall be in a minimum amount
of $3,000,000 and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 for Advances denominated
In U.S. Dollars and in a minimum amount of C$3,000,000 and in integral multiples
of C$1,000,000 for Advances denominated in Canadian Dollars, or such lesser
amount agreed to by the Agent.

         2.12 Notes. The Borrowers agree that, upon the request of the Agent or
any Lender, the Borrowers will execute and deliver to such Lender Notes for such
Lender, provided that the delivery of such Notes shall not be a condition
precedent to the making of any Advances.

         2.13 Security and Collateral To secure or guarantee the payment when
due of all Lender Obligations, the Borrowers shall execute and deliver, or cause
to be executed and delivered, to the Lenders and the Agent Loan Documents
granting the following, subject to any Intercreditor Agreement:

         (a) Pledges, pursuant to Pledge Agreements, of the Required Percentage
of the present and future Capital Stock of certain present and future Foreign
Subsidiaries and Guaranties of certain present and future Domestic Subsidiaries
such that, at all times, the Domestic Subsidiaries which are not Guarantors and
the Foreign Subsidiaries that do not have the Required Percentage of their
Capital Stock pledged pursuant to Pledge Agreements do not, if considered in the
aggregate as a single Subsidiary, constitute a Significant Subsidiary. As used
herein, "Required Percentage" means, with respect to any Foreign Subsidiary, (i)
if such Foreign Subsidiary is not a "controlled foreign corporation" as defined
in the Code, 100% and (ii) if such Foreign Subsidiary is a "controlled foreign
corporation" as defined in the Code, 65% of the total voting power of all
classes of issued and outstanding voting Capital Stock of such Foreign or in
excess of such percentage of the total voting power which as a result of changes
enacted after the date hereof in the Code or for any other reason may be pledged
without constituting the pledge an investment of earnings in the United States
property under section 956 of the Code.

         (b) All other security and collateral described in the Pledge
Agreements.

         (c) Agent and each of the Lenders agrees that at any time or from time
to time, provided no Default or Event of Default then exists or would be caused
thereby, the Agent shall upon the request of the Company release one or more
Domestic Subsidiaries that are Guarantors from any and all liability under their
respective Guaranties, and/or release the Capital Stock of one or more Foreign
Subsidiaries from the lien granted under the Pledge Agreements, but only to the
extent that the Agent, in its reasonable discretion, shall have determined that
the requirements of the first sentence of Section 2.13(a) shall continue to be
satisfied following the requested release.

         2.14 Increases in Aggregate Commitment. (i) Subject to the conditions
set forth

                                      -33-

   effective date with the same effect as if made on and as of such date (other
   than those representations and warranties that by their terms speak as of a
   particular date, which representations and warranties shall be true and
   correct as of such particular date);

         (c) the amount of such increase in the aggregate amount of the U.S.
   Commitments shall not be greater than $50,000,000, and shall not cause the
   aggregate amount of all U.S. Commitments to exceed $300,000,000, and the
   amount of such increase in the aggregate amount of the Canadian Commitments
   shall not be greater than $20,000,000, and shall not cause the aggregate
   amount of all Canadian Commitments to exceed $50,000,000;

         (d) The Borrowers and the Lender or lender not theretofore a Lender,
   shall execute and deliver to the Agent, a Lender Addition and Acknowledgement
   Agreement, in form and substance satisfactory to the Agent and acknowledged

   Agreement");

         (e) no existing Lender shall be obligated in any way to increase any of
   its Commitment; and

         (f) the Borrowers shall have complied with such other conditions in
   connection with such increase as may be required by the Agent.

forth and all the rights and obligations of a Lender with such a Commitment or
Commitments hereunder.

   (iii) Upon its receipt of a Lender Addition and Acknowledgement Agreement
together with any Note or Notes, if requested, subject to such addition and

be designated by the Company as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, provided that (a) no
Subsidiary that has an equity Investment in the Company or a Restricted
Subsidiary may be designated as an Unrestricted Subsidiary and (b) immediately
after giving effect to such designation (i) no Event of Default or Default
exists or would be caused thereby, on a pro forma basis acceptable to the Agent,
(ii) neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall be liable, directly
or indirectly, for any of the indebtedness, obligations or other liabilities of
any kind of such Unrestricted Subsidiary or for any Contingent Liabilities with
respect to any Unrestricted Subsidiary except to the extent such indebtedness,
obligation or other liability is included in Total Debt, and (iii) the ratio of
the consolidated total assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to
the consolidated total assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, the ratio of
the consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to the
consolidated EBITDA of the Company and its Subsidiaries (based on the most
recent four consecutive fiscal quarters) and the ratio of the total consolidated
gross revenues of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to the total
consolidated gross revenues of the Company and its Subsidiaries (based on the
most recent four consecutive fiscal quarters) equals not less than 90%. Any
Unrestricted Subsidiary may be designated as a Restricted Subsidiary by the

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, during the
continuance of a Default or Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their
option, by notice to the Borrowers (which notice may be revoked at the option of
the Required Lenders notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.1 requiring
unanimous consent of the Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that no
Advance may be made as or converted into a Fixed Rate Loan or, at the end of any
existing Interest Period, continued as a Fixed Rate Loan. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, during the continuance of
an Event of Default the Required Lenders may, at their option, by notice to the
Borrowers (which notice may be revoked at the option of the Required Lenders
notwithstanding any provision of Section 8.1 requiring unanimous consent of the
Lenders to changes in interest rates), declare that each Borrower pay interest
on demand at the Overdue Rate on the outstanding principal amount of any Loan
owing by it and any other amount payable by it hereunder (other than interest),
provided that, during

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

the continuance of an Event of Default under Section 6.1(i), the Overdue Rate as
described above shall be applicable without any election or action on the part
of the Agent or any Lender.

         3.3 Letter of Credit Reimbursement Payments. (a)(i) The applicable
Borrower agrees to pay to the Lenders, on the day on which the Agent shall honor
a draft or other demand for payment presented or made under any Letter of
Credit, an amount equal to the amount paid by the Agent in respect of such draft
or other demand under such Letter of Credit and all expenses paid or incurred by
the Agent relative thereto. Unless the applicable Borrower shall have made such
payment to the Lenders on such day, upon each such payment by the Agent, the
Agent shall be deemed to have disbursed to the applicable Borrower for whose
benefit the Letter of Credit was issued, and the applicable Borrower shall be
deemed to have elected to satisfy its reimbursement obligation by, a Syndicated
Loan bearing interest at the Floating Rate for the account of the Lenders in an
amount equal to the amount so paid by the Agent in respect of such draft or
other demand under such Letter of Credit. Such Syndicated Loan shall be
disbursed notwithstanding any failure to satisfy any conditions for disbursement
of any Loan set forth in Article II hereof and, to the extent of the Syndicated
Loan so disbursed, the reimbursement obligation of the applicable Borrower under
this Section 3.3 shall be deemed satisfied; provided, however, that nothing in
this Section 3.3 shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any Default or Event
of Default caused by the failure to the conditions for disbursement or
otherwise.

                           (ii) If, for any reason (including without limitation
as a result of the occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the any
Borrower pursuant to Section 6.1(i)), Floating Rate Loans may not be made by the
Lenders as described in Section 3.3(a)(i), then (A) each Borrower agrees that
each reimbursement amount not paid pursuant to the first sentence of Section
3.3(a)(i) shall bear interest, payable on demand by the Agent, at the interest
rate then applicable to Floating Rate Loans, and (B) effective on the date each
such Floating Rate Loan would otherwise have been made, each Lender severally
agrees that it shall unconditionally and irrevocably, without regard to the
occurrence of any Default or Event of Default, in lieu of deemed disbursement of
loans, to the extent of such Lender's Commitment, purchase a participating
interest in each reimbursement amount. Each Lender will immediately transfer to
the Agent, in Same Day Funds, the amount of its participation. Each Lender shall
share, based on its Pro Rata Share, in any interest which accrues thereon and in
all repayments thereof. If and to the extent that any Lender shall not have so
made the amount of such participating interest available to the Agent, such
Lender and the applicable Borrower severally agree to pay to the Agent forthwith
on demand such amount together with interest thereon, for each day from the date
of demand by the Agent until the date such amount is paid to the Agent, at (x)
in the case of the applicable Borrower, the interest rate then applicable to
Floating Rate Loans and (y) in the case of such Lender, the Federal Funds Rate.

                  (b) The reimbursement obligation of each Borrower under this
Section 3.3 shall be absolute, unconditional and irrevocable and shall remain in
full force and effect until all obligations of such Borrower to the Lenders
hereunder shall have been satisfied, and such obligations of the Borrowers shall
not be affected, modified or impaired upon the happening of any event, including
without limitation, any of the following, whether or not with notice to, or the
consent of, any Borrower:

                           (i) Any lack of validity or enforceability of any
Letter of Credit or any documentation relating to any Letter of Credit or to any
transaction related in any way to such Letter of Credit (the "Letter of Credit
Documents");

                           (ii) Any amendment, modification, waiver, consent, or
any substitution, exchange or release of or failure to perfect any interest in
collateral or security, with respect to any of the Letter of Credit Documents;

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

                           (iii) The existence of any claim, setoff, defense or
other right which any Borrower may have at any time against any beneficiary or
any transferee of any Letter of Credit (or any Persons or entities for whom any
such beneficiary or any such transferee may be acting), the Agent or any Lender
or any other Person or entity, whether in connection with any of the Letter of
Credit Documents, the transactions contemplated herein or therein or any
unrelated transactions;

                           (iv) Any draft or other statement or document
presented under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid
or insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
inaccurate in any respect;

                           (v) Payment by the Agent to the beneficiary under any
Letter of Credit against presentation of documents which do not comply with the
terms of the Letter of Credit, including failure of any documents to bear any
reference or adequate reference to such Letter of Credit;

                           (vi) Any failure, omission, delay or lack on the part
of the Agent or any Lender or any party to any of the Letter of Credit Documents
to enforce, assert or exercise any right, power or remedy conferred upon the
Agent, any Lender or any such party under this Agreement or any of the Letter of
Credit Documents, or any other acts or omissions on the part of the Agent, any
Lender or any such party;

                           (vii) Any other event or circumstance that would, in
the absence of this clause, result in the release or discharge by operation of
law or otherwise of any Borrower from the performance or observance of any
obligation, covenant or agreement contained in this Section 3.3.

No setoff, counterclaim, reduction or diminution of any obligation or any
defense of any kind or nature which any Borrower has or may have against the
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit shall be available hereunder to any Borrower
against the Agent or any Lender. Nothing in this Section 3.3 shall limit the
liability, if any, of the Lenders to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 8.5.

         3.4 Applicable Lending Office; Payment Method. (a) Each Lender will
book its Loans at the appropriate Applicable Lending Office listed on
administrative information sheets provided to the Agent (or as established by
the Agent from time to time in the case of JPMCB, which shall be JPMCB Canada in
the case of Loans to the Canadian Borrower) in connection herewith or such other
Applicable Lending Office designated by such Lender in accordance with the final
sentence of this Section 3.4(a). All terms of this Agreement shall apply to any
such Applicable Lending Office and the Loans and any Notes issued hereunder
shall be deemed held by each Lender for the benefit of any such Applicable
Lending Office. Each Lender may, by written notice to the Agent and the
Borrowers, designate replacement or additional Applicable Lending Office through
which Loans will be made by it and for whose account Loan payments are to be
made.

                  (b) All payments to be made by the Company hereunder will be
made to the Agent at its applicable Agent Payment Office for the account of the
Lenders in U.S. Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 1:00 p.m. (Chicago
time) on the date on which such payment shall be due. All payments to be made by
the Canadian Borrower with respect to Canadian Syndicated Loans hereunder will
be made to the Agent at its applicable Agent Payment Office the account of the
Canadian Lenders in Canadian Dollars and in Same Day Funds not later than 1:00
p.m. (Toronto time) on the date on which such payment shall be due. Payments
received after 1:00 p.m. at the place for payment shall be deemed to be payments
made prior to 1:00 p.m. at the place for payment on the next succeeding Business
Day. The

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

Borrowers hereby authorize the Agent to charge their respective accounts with
the Agent in order to cause timely payment of amounts due hereunder to be made
(subject to sufficient funds being available in such account for that purpose).

                  (c) At the time of making each such payment, each Borrower
shall, subject to the other terms and conditions of this Agreement, specify to
the Agent that Borrowing or other obligation of such Borrower hereunder to which
such payment is to be applied. In the event that such Borrower fails to so
specify the relevant obligation or if an Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, the Agent may apply such payments as it may determine in its
sole discretion to obligations of such Borrower to the Lenders arising under the
Loan Documents.

                  (d) On the day such payments are deemed received, the Agent
shall remit to the Lenders their Pro Rata Share of such payments in Same Day
Funds, to the Lenders at their respective Applicable Lending Offices.

         3.5 No Setoff or Deduction. Subject to Section 3.11, all payments of
principal of and interest on the Loans and other amounts payable by the
Borrowers hereunder shall be made by the Borrowers without setoff or
counterclaim, and free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for,
or on account of, any present or future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees,
assessments, or other charges of whatever nature, imposed by any governmental
authority, or by any department, agency or other political subdivision or taxing
authority, unless required by applicable laws. If any such taxes, levies,
imposts, duties, fees, assessments, or other charges are required to be withheld
from any amounts payable hereunder with respect to any Advance, the amounts so
payable shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to the payee thereof
the interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates and in the
amounts specified in this Agreement.

         3.6 Payment on Non-Business Day; Payment Computations. Except as
otherwise provided in this Agreement to the contrary, whenever any installment
of principal of, or interest on, any Loan outstanding hereunder or any other
amount due hereunder becomes due and payable on a day which is not a Business
Day, the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
and, in the case of any installment of principal, interest shall be payable
thereon at the rate per annum determined in accordance with this Agreement
during such extension. Computations of interest and other amounts due under this
Agreement shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for the actual number
of days elapsed, including the first day but excluding the last day of the
relevant period, provided that the computation of interest at the Floating Rate
shall be made on the basis of a year of 365 days for the actual number of days
elapsed, including the first day but excluding the last day of the relevant
period. For the purposes of the Interest Act (Canada) hereunder (i) whenever
interest payable pursuant to this Agreement is calculated with respect to any
monetary obligation relating to Loans to the Canadian Borrower on the basis of a
period other than a calendar year (the "Calculation Period"), each rate of
interest determined pursuant to such calculation expressed as an annual rate is
equivalent to such rate as so determined, multiplied by the actual number of
days in the calendar year in which the same is to be ascertained and divided by
the number of days in the Calculation Period; (ii) the principle of deemed
reinvestment of interest with respect to any monetary obligation relating to
Loans in Canadian Dollars shall not apply to any interest calculation under this
agreement, and (iii) the rates of interest with respect to any monetary
obligation relating to Loans to the Canadian Borrower stipulated in this
Agreement are intended to be nominal rates and not effective rates or yields.

         3.7 Additional Costs. (a) If the adoption of or any change in any law,
treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) applicable to any
Lender or the Agent, or in any interpretation,

                                      -39-
<PAGE>

application or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged with
the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender or the
Agent with any directive of any such authority (whether or not having the force
of law) made subsequent to the Effective Date, shall (i) affect the basis of
taxation of payments to any Lender or the Agent of any amounts payable by a
Borrower under this Agreement (other than taxes imposed on the overall net
income of the Lender or the Agent, by the jurisdiction, or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority of any such jurisdiction, in which any Lender or
the Agent, as the case may be, has its principal office or is otherwise
advancing or booking any Loan hereunder), or (ii) shall impose, modify or deem
applicable any reserve, special deposit or similar requirement against assets
of, deposits with or for the account of, or credit extended by any Lender or the
Agent, as the case may be, or (iii) shall impose any other condition with
respect to this Agreement, the Commitments, the Notes or the Advances, and the
result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any Lender or the
Agent, as the case may be, of making, funding or maintaining any Fixed Rate Loan
or to reduce the amount of any sum receivable by any Lender or the Agent,
thereon, then such Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the Agent, as the case
may be, from time to time, upon request by such Lender (with a copy of such
request to be provided to the Agent) or the Agent, additional amounts sufficient
to compensate such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, for such increased
cost or reduced sum receivable to the extent, such Lender or the Agent, as the
case may be, is not compensated therefor in the computation of the interest rate
applicable to such Loan. Each Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, seeking
compensation hereunder shall deliver to such Borrower a statement setting forth
such increased cost or reduced sum receivable as such Lender or the Agent, as
the case may be, has calculated in good faith. Such statement as to the amount
of such increased cost or reduced sum receivable, prepared in good faith and in
reasonable detail by such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, and submitted
by such Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, to such Borrower, shall be
conclusive and binding for all purposes absent manifest error in computation.

                  (b) If the adoption of or any change in any law, treaty, rule
or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) applicable to any Lender or the
Agent, but applicable to banks or financial institutions generally, or in any
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged
with the interpretation, application or administration thereof, or compliance by
any Lender or the Agent with any directive of any such authority (whether or not
having the force of law), including any risk-based capital guidelines made
subsequent to the Effective Date, affects the amount of capital required or
expected to be maintained by such Lender or the Agent (or any corporation
controlling such Lender or the Agent) and such Lender or the Agent, as the case
may be, determines that the amount of such capital is increased by or based upon
the existence of such Lender's or the Agent's obligations hereunder to any
Borrower and such increase has the effect of reducing the rate of return on such
Lender's or the Agent's (or such controlling corporation's) capital as a
consequence of such obligations hereunder to a level below that which such
Lender or the Agent (or such controlling corporation) could have achieved but
for such circumstances (taking into consideration its policies with respect to
capital adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or the Agent to be
material, then such Borrower shall pay to such Lender or the Agent, as the case
may be, from time to time, upon request by such Lender (with a copy of such
request to be provided to the Agent) or the Agent, additional amounts sufficient
to compensate such Lender or the Agent (or such controlling corporation) for any
reduced rate of return which such Lender or the Agent reasonably determines to
be allocable to the existence of such Lender's or the Agent's obligations
hereunder. Each Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, seeking compensation
hereunder shall deliver to each such Borrower a statement setting forth such
increased cost or reduced sum receivable as such Lender or the Agent, as the
case may be, has calculated in good faith. Such statement as to the amount of
such compensation, prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail by such
Lender or the Agent, as the case may be, and submitted by such Lender or the
Agent to such Borrower, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent
manifest error in computation.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Each Lender will promptly notify the affected Borrower and
the Agent of any event of which it has actual knowledge occurring after the date
hereof which will entitle to such Lender to compensation pursuant to this
Section 3.7 and will designate a different Applicable Lending Office if such
designation will avoid the need for, or reduce the amount of, such compensation
and will not, in the judgment of such Lender, be otherwise disadvantageous to
such Lender or contrary to its policies.

         3.8 Illegality and Impossibility. In the event that any applicable law,
treaty, rule or regulation (whether domestic or foreign) now or hereafter in
effect and whether or not presently applicable to any Lender, or any
interpretation or administration thereof by any governmental authority charged
with the interpretation or administration thereof, or compliance by any Lender
with any directive of such authority (whether or not having the force of law),
including without limitation exchange controls, shall make it unlawful or
impossible for any Lender to maintain any Fixed Rate Loan under this Agreement
or shall make it impracticable, unlawful or impossible for, or shall in any way
limit or impair the ability of, a Borrower to make or any Lender to receive any
payment under this Agreement at the place specified for payment hereunder, or to
freely convert any amount paid into U.S. Dollars at market rates of exchange or
to transfer any amount paid or so converted to the address of its principal
office specified in Section 8.2, such Borrower shall upon receipt of notice
thereof from such Lender, repay in full the then outstanding principal amount of
each Fixed Rate Loan so affected, together with all accrued interest thereon to
the date of payment and all amounts owing to such Lender under Section 3.9, (a)
on the last day of the then current Interest Period applicable to such Loan if
such Lender may lawfully continue to maintain such Loan to such day, or (b)
immediately if such Lender may not continue to maintain such Loan to such day.

         3.9 Indemnification. If a Borrower makes any payment of principal with
respect to any Fixed Rate Loan on any other date than the last day of an
Interest Period applicable thereto (whether pursuant to Section 3.8 or Section
6.2 or otherwise), or if a Borrower fails to borrow or continue any Fixed Rate
Loan, or convert any Floating Rate Loan to a Fixed Rate Loan, after notice has
been given to the Lenders in accordance with Section 2.6 or 2.9, as applicable,
such Borrower shall reimburse each Lender on demand for any resulting net loss
or expense incurred by each such Lender after giving credit for any earnings or
other quantifiable financial benefit to such Lender from such Lender's
investment or other amounts prepaid or not reborrowed, including without
limitation any loss incurred in obtaining, liquidating or employing deposits
from third parties, whether or not such Lender shall have funded or committed to
fund such Loan. A statement as to the amount of such loss or expense, prepared
in good faith and in reasonable detail by such Lender and submitted by such
Lender to such Borrower, shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes absent
manifest error in computation. Calculation of all amounts payable to such Lender
under this Section 3.9 shall be made as though such Lender shall have actually
funded or committed to fund the relevant Fixed Rate Loan through the purchase of
an underlying deposit in an amount equal to the amount of such Loan and having a
maturity comparable to the related Interest Period; provided, however, that such
Lender may fund any Fixed Rate Loan in any manner it sees fit and the foregoing
assumption shall be utilized only for the purpose of calculation of amounts
payable under this Section 3.9.

         3.10 Substitution of Lender. If (a) the obligation of any Lender to
make or maintain Eurodollar Rate Syndicated Loans has been suspended pursuant to
Section 3.8 or 2.10 when not all Lenders obligations have been suspended, (b)
any Lender has demanded compensation under Section 3.7 or (c) any Lender is a
Defaulting Lender, the Borrowers shall have the right, if no Default or Event of
Default then exists, to replace such Lender (a "Replaced Lender") with one or
more other Lenders (collectively, the "Replacement Lender") acceptable to the
Agent, provided that (i) at the time of any replacement pursuant to this Section
3.10, the Replacement Lender shall enter into one or more Assignment and
Acceptances, pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire the
Commitments and outstanding Advances and

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

other obligations of the Replaced Lender and, in connection therewith, shall pay
to the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the sum of (A) the
amount of principal of, and all accrued interest on, all outstanding Loans of
the Replaced Lender, (B) the amount of all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, fees
owing to the Replaced Lender under Section 2.3 and (C) the amount which would be
payable by the Borrowers to the Replaced Lender pursuant to Section 3.9 if the
Borrowers prepaid at the time of such replacement all of the Loans of such
Replaced Lender outstanding at such time and (ii) all obligations of the
Borrowers then owing to the Replaced Lender (other than those specifically
described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment purchase price
has been, or is concurrently being, paid) shall be paid in full to such Replaced
Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon the execution of the respective
Assignment and Acceptances, the payment of amounts referred to in clauses (i)
and (ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender, delivery to the
Replacement Lender of the appropriate Note or Notes, if any, executed by the
Borrowers, the Replacement Lender shall become a Lender hereunder and the
Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender hereunder. The provisions of
this Agreement (including without limitation Sections 3.9 and 8.5) shall
continue to govern the rights and obligations of a Replaced Lender with respect
to any Advances made or any other actions taken by such Lender while it was a
Lender. Nothing herein shall release any Defaulting Lender from any obligation
it may have to the Borrowers, the Agent or any other Lender.

         3.11 Taxes. (a) At least five Business Days prior to the first date on
which interest or fees are payable hereunder for the account of any U.S. Lender,
each U.S. Lender that is not incorporated under the laws of the United States of
America or a state thereof agrees that it will deliver to each of the Company
and the Agent two duly completed copies of United States Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI and Form W-8 or W-9 and any additional forms
necessary for claiming complete exemption from United States withholding taxes
(or any successor or substitute forms), certifying in either case that such U.S.
Lender is entitled to receive payments under this Agreement and the Loans
without deduction or withholding of any United States federal income taxes. Each
U.S. Lender which so delivers a Form W-8BEN or W-8ECI and a Form W-8 or W-9 and
any additional forms necessary for claiming complete exemption from United
States withholding taxes (or any successor or substitute forms) further
undertakes to deliver to each of the Company and the Agent two additional copies
of such forms (or any successor or substitute forms) on or before the date that
such form expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event
requiring a change in the most recent form so delivered by it, and such
amendments thereto or extensions or renewals thereof as may be reasonably
requested by the Company or the Agent to the extent it may lawfully do so, in
each case certifying that such U.S. Lender is entitled to receive payments under
this Agreement and the Loans without deduction or withholding of any United
States federal income taxes, unless an event (including without limitation any
change in treaty, law or regulation) has occurred prior to the date on which any
such delivery would otherwise be required which renders all such forms
inapplicable or which would prevent such U.S. Lender from duly completing and
delivering any such form with respect to it and such U.S. Lender advises the
Company and the Agent that it is not capable of receiving payments without any
deduction or withholding of United States federal income tax.

         (b) Each Canadian Lender that is created or organized under the laws of
a jurisdiction other than Canada or a Province thereof making Canadian
Syndicated Loans shall deliver, or have its Applicable Lending Office to be used
to make Canadian Syndicated Loans deliver, to the Borrowers and the Agent on the
Effective Date (or on the date on which such Canadian Lender or such Applicable
Lending Office becomes a Lender hereunder), evidence that either (i) such
Canadian Lender or its Applicable Lending Office is an authorized foreign bank
and that any payments received by such Canadian Lender or its Applicable Lending
Office under the Canadian Syndicated Loans is in respect of such entity's
Canadian banking business, all for the purposes of subsection 112(13.3) of the
Income Tax Act (Canada), or (ii) the

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

Minister of National Revenue is satisfied that payments made to such Lender
hereunder are not subject to Canadian withholding taxes pursuant to Regulation
805(2) of the Income Tax Act (collectively, "Evidence of Canadian Tax
Exemption"). In addition, from time to time after the Effective Date (or the
date on which such Canadian Lender becomes a Lender hereunder) upon the
reasonable request of the Borrowers or the Agent, each such Canadian Lender
further agrees to deliver to the Borrowers and the Agent further Evidence of
Canadian Tax Exemption, unless any change in treaty, law, regulation or official
interpretation thereof prevents such Lender from duly providing same.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.11 to the contrary, the Borrowers
shall not have any obligation to pay any withholding taxes or to indemnify any
Canadian Lender for any withholding taxes to the extent that such taxes result
from the failure of such Lender to comply with its obligations under this
paragraph.

         (c) If any governmental authority of any jurisdiction asserts a claim
that the Agent did not properly withhold tax from amounts paid to or for the
account of any Lender (because the appropriate form was not delivered or was not
properly executed, or because such Lender failed to notify the Agent of a change
in circumstances which rendered the exemption from, or reduction of, withholding
tax ineffective, or for any other reason) such Lender shall indemnify the Agent
fully for all amounts paid, directly or indirectly, by the Agent as tax or
otherwise, including penalties and interest, and including any taxes imposed by
any jurisdiction on the amounts payable to the Agent under this Section,
together with all costs and expenses (including attorney costs). The obligations
of the Lenders under this subsection shall survive the payment of all Loans.

                                   ARTICLE IV.
                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

         Each Borrower represents and warrants to the Agent and the Lenders
that:

         4.1 Corporate Existence and Power. It is a corporation duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the state, province or
other political subdivision of its jurisdiction of incorporation or
organization, as the case may be, and is duly qualified to do business, and is
in good standing, in all additional jurisdictions where such qualification is
necessary under applicable law, except where the failure to be so qualified
would not have a Material Adverse Effect. It has all requisite corporate and
other power to own or lease the properties used in its business and to carry on
its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be conducted, and to
execute and deliver this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a
party and to engage in the transactions contemplated by the Loan Documents.

         4.2 Corporate Authority. The execution, delivery and performance by it
of the Loan Documents to which it is a party have been duly authorized by all
necessary corporate action and are not in contravention of any material law,
rule or regulation, or any judgment, decree, writ, injunction, order or award of
any arbitrator, court or governmental authority, or of the terms of its charter
or by-laws, or of any material contract or undertaking to which it is a party or
by which it or its property is bound or affected and do not result in the
imposition of any Lien except for Permitted Liens.

         4.3 Binding Effect. The Loan Documents to which it is a party are the
legal, valid and binding obligations of it enforceable against it in accordance
with their respective terms; except as such enforceability may be limited by
bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to creditors' rights and except that the remedy of specific performance
and injunctive and other

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

forms of equitable relief are subject to equitable defenses and to the
discretion of the court before which any proceedings may be brought.

         4.4 Subsidiaries. Schedule 4.4 hereto correctly sets forth the
corporate name, jurisdiction of organization and ownership of each Subsidiary of
the Company. Each Restricted Subsidiary and each Person becoming a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company after the date hereof is and will be duly organized,
validly existing and in good standing under the laws of its jurisdiction of
organization and is and will be duly qualified to do business in each additional
jurisdiction where such qualification is or may be necessary under applicable
law, except where the failure to be so qualified would not have a Material
Adverse Effect. Each Restricted Subsidiary of the Company has and will have all
requisite corporate power to own or lease the properties used in its business
and to carry on its business as now being conducted and as proposed to be
conducted. All outstanding shares of Capital Stock of each Restricted Subsidiary
of the Company have been and will be validly issued and are and will be fully
paid and nonassessable and, except as otherwise indicated in Schedule 4.4 hereto
or disclosed in writing to the Agent from time to time, are and will be owned,
beneficially and of record, by the Company or another Restricted Subsidiary of
the Company free and clear of any Liens.

         4.5 Litigation and Contingent Obligations. Except as set forth in
Schedule 4.5 hereto, there is no action, suit or proceeding pending or, to the
best of the Company's knowledge, threatened against or affecting the Company or
any of its Restricted Subsidiaries before or by any court, governmental
authority or arbitrator, which is reasonably likely to result either
individually or collectively, in a Material Adverse Effect and, to the best of
the Company's knowledge, there is no basis for any such action, suit or
proceeding. Other than any liability incident to any litigation, arbitration or
proceeding which (i) could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect or (ii) is set forth on Schedule 4.5, neither the Company nor any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries has any material contingent obligations not provided for
or disclosed in the financial statements referred to in Section 4.6.

         4.6 Financial Condition. The consolidated balance sheet of the Company
and its Subsidiaries and the consolidated statements of income, and cash flows
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the fiscal year ended December 27, 2003
and reported on by Ernst & Young LLP, independent certified public accountants,
and the interim consolidated balance sheet and interim consolidated statements
of income and cash flows of the Company and its Subsidiaries, as of or for the
six month period ended on September 26, 2004, copies of which have been
furnished to the Lenders, fairly present, and the financial statements of the
Company and its Subsidiaries delivered pursuant to Section 5.1(d) will fairly
present the consolidated financial position of the Company and its Subsidiaries
as at the respective dates thereof, and the consolidated results of operations
of the Company and its Subsidiaries for the respective periods indicated, all in
accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles consistently applied
(subject, in the case of said interim statements, to year-end audit
adjustments). There has been no Material Adverse Effect since the date of the
consolidated balance sheet of the Company delivered to the Lenders prior to the
Effective Date.

         4.7 Use of Loans. The Borrowers will use the proceeds of the Advances
for their working capital requirements and general corporate purposes. Neither
the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries extends or maintains, in the ordinary
course of business, credit for the purpose, whether immediate, incidental, or
ultimate, of buying or carrying margin stock (within the meaning of Regulations
T, U or X of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System), and no part
of the proceeds will be used in violation of Regulations T, U or X or any other
law or regulation. After applying the proceeds of each Loan, such margin stock

such taxes or establish such reserves would not have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.10 Title to Properties. Except as otherwise disclosed in the latest
balance sheet delivered pursuant to this Agreement, the Company or one or more
of its Restricted Subsidiaries have good and marketable fee simple title to all

or is licensed to use, all patents, trademarks, trade names, service marks,
copyrights, technology, know-how and processes necessary for the conduct of its
business as currently conducted and as contemplated to be conducted (the

liability, determined in accordance with Section 4001(a)(18) of ERISA, with
respect to any Plan of the Company, its Restricted Subsidiaries or their ERISA

not for the payment of money) shall be rendered against or shall affect the
Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries which causes or could cause a
Material Adverse Effect, and either (i) such judgment or order shall have

expiration of the applicable period of limitations for taking such action or, if
such action shall have been taken, a final order denying such stay shall have
been rendered, or (ii) enforcement proceedings shall have been commenced by any

are not wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries of the Company or Guarantors and if
all such non wholly owned Restricted Subsidiaries do not, if considered in the
aggregate as a single Subsidiary, constitute a Significant Subsidiary; or

declare the outstanding principal of, and accrued interest on, the Notes and
Advances and all other amounts owing under this Agreement to be immediately due
and payable, or (iii) demand immediate delivery of cash collateral, and the
Borrowers agree to deliver such cash collateral upon demand, in an amount equal
to the maximum amount that may be available to be drawn at any time prior to the
stated expiry of all outstanding Letters of Credit, or any one or more of the
foregoing, whereupon the Commitments shall terminate forthwith and all such
amounts, including cash collateral, shall become immediately due and payable,
provided that in the case of any event or condition described in Section 6.1(i)
with respect to the Borrowers, the Commitments shall automatically terminate
forthwith and all such amounts, including cash collateral, shall automatically
become immediately due and payable without notice; in all cases without demand,
presentment, protest, diligence, notice of dishonor or other formality, all of
which are hereby expressly waived. Such cash collateral delivered in respect of
outstanding Letters of Credit shall be deposited in a special cash collateral
account to be held by the Agent as collateral security for the payment and
performance of the Borrowers' obligations under this Agreement to the Lenders
and the Agent.

                  (b) The Agent upon being directed to do so by the Required
Lenders, shall, in addition to the remedies provided in Section 6.2(a), exercise
and enforce any and all other rights and remedies available to it or the
Lenders, whether arising under the Loan Documents or under applicable law, in
any manner deemed appropriate by the Agent, including suit in equity, action at
law, or other appropriate proceedings, whether for the specific performance (to
the extent permitted by law) of any covenant or agreement contained in the Loan
Documents or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the Loan Documents.

                  (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
Event of Default, each Lender may at any time and from time to time exercise any
of its rights of set off or bankers lien that it may possess by common law or
statute without prior notice to the Borrowers, provided that each Lender may
also set off against any deposit whether or not it is then matured. Each Lender
agrees to promptly notify the Borrowers after any such setoff and application,
provided that the failure to give such notice shall not effect the validity of
such setoff and application. The rights of such Lender under this Section 6.2(c)
are in addition to other rights and remedies which such Lender may have.

                  (d) All proceeds of any realization on the collateral pursuant
to the Pledge Agreements and any payments received by the Agent or any Lender
pursuant to the Guaranties subsequent to and during the continuance of any Event
of Default, subject to any Intercreditor Agreement, shall be allocated and
distributed by the Agent as follows:

                           (i) First, to the payment of all reasonable costs and
expenses, including without limitation all reasonable attorneys' fees, of the

Guaranties and otherwise administering this Agreement;

                           (ii) Second, to the payment of all fees required to
be paid under any

                                      -58-
<PAGE>

Loan Document including facility fees, owing to the Lenders and Agent pursuant
to the Lender Obligations on a pro rata basis in accordance with the Lender
Obligations consisting of fees owing to the Lenders and Agent under the Lender
Obligations, for application to payment of such liabilities;

                           (iii) Third, to the Lenders and Agent on a pro rata
basis in accordance with the Lender Obligations consisting of interest owing to
the Lenders and Agent under the Lender Obligations, and obligations and
liabilities relating to Rate Hedging Agreements owing to the Lenders and the
Agent under the Lender Obligations for application to payment of such
liabilities;

                           (iv) Fourth, to the Lenders and the Agent on a pro
rata basis in accordance with the Lender Obligations consisting of principal
(including without limitation any cash collateral for any outstanding Letters of
Credit), for application to payment of such liabilities;

                           (v) Fifth, to the payment of any and all other
amounts owing to the Lenders and the Agent and secured by the Pledge Agreements
on a pro rata basis in accordance with the total amount of such Indebtedness
owing to each of the Lenders and the Agent, for application to payment of such
liabilities; and

                           (vi) Sixth, to the applicable Borrower, their
Restricted Subsidiaries or such other Person as may be legally entitled thereto.

For the purposes of the above payments and distributions, the full amount of
Lender Obligations on account of any Letter of Credit then outstanding but not
drawn upon shall be deemed to be then due and owing. Amounts distributable to
the Lenders or Agent on account of such Lender Obligations under such Letters of
Credit shall be deposited in a separate collateral account in the name of and
under the control of the Agent and held by the Agent first as security for such
Letter of Credit Lender Obligations and then as security for all other Lender
Obligations and the amount so deposited shall be applied to the Letter of Credit
Lender Obligations at such times and to the extent that such Letter of Credit
Lender Obligations become absolute liabilities and if and to the extent that the
Letter of Credit Lender Obligations fail to become absolute Lender Obligations
because of the expiration or termination of the underlying Letters of Credit
without being drawn upon then such amounts shall be applied to the remaining
Lender Obligations in the order provided in this Section 6.2(d). The Company
hereby grants to the Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders and Agent, a lien and
security interest in all such funds deposited in such separate collateral
account, as security for all the Lender Obligations as set forth above.

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
payments of principal, interest or fees delivered to the Agent for the account
of any Defaulting Lender shall be delivered by the Agent to such Defaulting
Lender. Instead, such payments shall, for so long as such Defaulting Lender
shall be a Defaulting Lender, be held by the Agent, and the Agent is hereby
authorized and directed by all parties hereto to hold such funds in escrow and
apply such funds as follows:

                           (i) First, if applicable to any payments due from
such Defaulting Lender to the Agent, and

                           (ii) Second, Loans required to be made by such
Defaulting Lender on any borrowing date to the extent such Defaulting Lender
fails to make such Loans.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the termination of all Commitments and the
payment and performance of all of the Advances and other obligations owing
hereunder (other than those owing to a Defaulting

<PAGE>

Lender), any funds then held in escrow by the Agent pursuant to the preceding
sentence shall be distributed to each Defaulting Lender, pro rata in proportion
to amounts that would be due to each Defaulting Lender but for the fact that it
is a Defaulting Lender.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                            THE AGENT AND THE LENDERS

         7.1 Appointment; Nature of Relationship. JPMCB is hereby appointed by
each of the Lenders as its contractual representative (herein referred to as the
"Agent") hereunder and under each other Loan Document, and each of the Lenders
irrevocably authorizes the Agent to act as the contractual representative of
such Lender with the rights and duties expressly set forth herein and in the
other Loan Documents. The Agent agrees to act as such contractual representative
upon the express conditions contained in this Article VII. Notwithstanding the
use of the defined term "Agent," it is expressly understood and agreed that the
Agent shall not have any fiduciary responsibilities to any Lender by reason of
this Agreement or any other Loan Document and that the Agent is merely acting as
the contractual representative of the Lenders with only those duties as are
expressly set forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. In its
capacity as the Lenders' contractual representative, the Agent (i) does not
hereby assume any fiduciary duties to any of the Lenders, (ii) is a
"representative" of the Lenders within the meaning of the term "secured party"
as defined in the Uniform Commercial Code and (iii) is acting as an independent
contractor, the rights and duties of which are limited to those expressly set
forth in this Agreement and the other Loan Documents. Each of the Lenders hereby
agrees to assert no claim against the Agent on any agency theory or any other
theory of liability for breach of fiduciary duty, all of which claims each
Lender hereby waives.

         7.2 Powers. The Agent shall have and may exercise such powers under the
Loan Documents as are specifically delegated to the Agent by the terms of each
thereof, together with such powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. The
Agent shall have no implied duties to the Lenders, or any obligation to the
Lenders to take any action thereunder except any action specifically provided by
the Loan Documents to be taken by the Agent.

         7.3 General Immunity. Neither the Agent nor any of its directors,
officers, agents or employees shall be liable to the Borrowers, the Lenders or
any Lender for any action taken or omitted to be taken by it or them hereunder
or under any other Loan Document or in connection herewith or therewith except
to the extent such action or inaction is determined in a final non-appealable
judgment by a court of competent jurisdiction to have arisen from the gross
negligence or willful misconduct of such Person.

         7.4 No Responsibility for Loans, Recitals, etc. Neither the Agent nor
any of its directors, officers, agents or employees shall be responsible for or
have any duty to ascertain, inquire into, or verify (a) any statement, warranty
or representation made in connection with any Loan Document or any borrowing
hereunder; (b) the performance or observance of any of the covenants or
agreements of any Obligor under any Loan Document, including, without
limitation, any agreement by an Obligor to furnish information directly to each
Lender; (c) the satisfaction of any condition specified in Article II; (d) the
existence or possible existence of any Default or Event of Default; (e) the
validity, enforceability, effectiveness, sufficiency or genuineness of any Loan
Document or any other instrument or writing furnished in connection therewith;
(f) the value, sufficiency, creation, perfection or priority of any Lien in any
collateral security; or (g) the financial condition of any Borrower or any
Guarantor of any of the Lender Obligations or of any such Borrowers' or any such
Guarantor's respective Subsidiaries. The

                                      -60-
<PAGE>

Agent shall have no duty to disclose to the Lenders information that is not
required to be furnished by the Borrowers to the Agent at such time, but is
voluntarily furnished by the Borrowers to the Agent (either in its capacity as
Agent or in its individual capacity).

         7.5 Action on Instructions of Lenders. The Agent shall in all cases be
fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, hereunder and under any
other Loan Document in accordance with written instructions signed by the
Required Lenders, and such instructions and any action taken or failure to act
pursuant thereto shall be binding on all of the Lenders. The Lenders hereby
acknowledge that the Agent shall be under no duty to take any discretionary
action permitted to be taken by it pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement
or any other Loan Document unless it shall be requested in writing to do so by
the Required Lenders. The Agent shall be fully justified in failing or refusing
to take any action hereunder and under any other Loan Document unless it shall
first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the Lenders pro rata against any and
all liability, cost and expense that it may incur by reason of taking or
continuing to take any such action.

         7.6 Employment of Agents and Counsel. The Agent may execute any of its
duties as Agent hereunder and under any other Loan Document by or through
employees, agents, and attorneys-in-fact and shall not be answerable to the
Lenders, except as to money or securities received by it or its authorized
agents, for the default or misconduct of any such agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care. The Agent shall be entitled to advice of
counsel concerning the contractual arrangement between the Agent and the Lenders
and all matters pertaining to the Agent's duties hereunder and under any other
Loan Document.

         7.7 Reliance on Documents; Counsel. The Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon any notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telegram, statement,
paper or document believed by it to be genuine and correct and to have been
signed or sent by the proper Person or Persons, and, in respect to legal
matters, upon the opinion of counsel selected by the Agent, which counsel may be
employees of the Agent.

         7.8 Agent's Reimbursement and Indemnification. The Lenders agree to
reimburse and indemnify the Agent ratably in proportion to their respective
Commitments (or, if the Commitments have been terminated, in proportion to their
Commitments immediately prior to such termination) (i) for any amounts not
reimbursed by the Borrowers for which the Agent is entitled to reimbursement by
the Borrowers under the Loan Documents, (ii) for any other expenses incurred by
the Agent on behalf of the Lenders, in connection with the preparation,
execution, delivery, administration and enforcement of the Loan Documents
(including, without limitation, for any expenses incurred by the Agent in
connection with any dispute between the Agent and any Lender or between two or
more of the Lenders) and (iii) for any liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby (including, without limitation, for any such
amounts incurred by or asserted against the Agent in connection with any dispute
between the Agent and any Lender or between two or more of the Lenders), or the
enforcement of any of the terms of the Loan Documents or of any such other
documents, provided that no Lender shall be liable for any of the foregoing to
the extent any of the foregoing is found in a final non-appealable judgment by a
court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of the Agent. The obligations of the Lenders under this
Section 7.8 shall survive payment of the Lender Obligations and termination of
this Agreement.

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

         7.9 Notice of Default. The Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless
the Agent has received written notice from a Lender or the Company referring to
this Agreement describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default". In the event that the Agent receives such a
notice, the Agent shall give prompt notice thereof to the Lenders.

         7.10 Rights as a Lender. In the event the Agent is a Lender, the Agent
shall have the same rights and powers hereunder and under any other Loan
Document with respect to its Commitment and its Loans as any Lender and may
exercise the same as though it were not the Agent, and the term "Lender" or
"Lenders" shall, at any time when the Agent is a Lender, unless the context
otherwise indicates, include the Agent in its individual capacity. The Agent and
its Affiliates may accept deposits from, lend money to, and generally engage in
any kind of trust, debt, equity or other transaction, in addition to those
contemplated by this Agreement or any other Loan Document, with a Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries in which such Borrower or such Subsidiary is not
restricted hereby from engaging with any other Person.

         7.11 Lender Credit Decision. Each Lender acknowledges that it has,
independently and without reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other
Lender and based on the financial statements prepared by the Borrowers and such
other documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own
credit analysis and decision to enter into this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents. Each Lender also acknowledges that it will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, the Arranger or any other Lender and based on such
documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to
make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

         7.12 Successor Agent. The Agent may resign at any time by giving
written notice thereof to the Lenders and the Borrowers, such resignation to be
effective upon the appointment of a successor Agent or, if no successor Agent
has been appointed, forty-five days after the retiring Agent gives notice of its
intention to resign. The Agent may be removed at any time with or without cause
by written notice received by the Agent from the Required Lenders, such removal
to be effective on the date specified by the Required Lenders. Upon any such
resignation or removal, the Required Lenders shall have the right to appoint, on
behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor Agent, provided that, if no
Default or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, such appointment
shall be made in consultation with the Borrowers. If no successor Agent shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders within thirty days after the
resigning Agent's giving notice of its intention to resign, then the resigning
Agent may appoint, on behalf of the Borrowers and the Lenders, a successor
Agent. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, the Agent may at any time without
the consent of the Borrowers or any Lender, appoint any of its Affiliates which
is a commercial bank as a successor Agent hereunder. If the Agent has resigned
or been removed and no successor Agent has been appointed, the Lenders may
perform all the duties of the Agent hereunder and the Borrowers shall make all
payments in respect of the Lender Obligations to the applicable Lender and for
all other purposes shall deal directly with the Lenders. No successor Agent
shall be deemed to be appointed hereunder until such successor Agent has
accepted the appointment. Any such successor Agent shall be a commercial bank
having capital and retained earnings of at least $100,000,000. Upon the
acceptance of any appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor Agent, such
successor Agent shall thereupon succeed to and become vested with all the
rights, powers, privileges and duties of the resigning or removed Agent. Upon
the effectiveness of the resignation or removal of the Agent, the resigning or
removed Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations hereunder and
under the Loan Documents. After the effectiveness of the resignation or removal
of an Agent, the provisions of this Article VII shall continue in effect for the
benefit of such

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

Agent in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was
acting as the Agent hereunder and under the other Loan Documents. In the event
that there is a successor to the Agent by merger, or the Agent assigns its
duties and obligations to an Affiliate pursuant to this Section 7.12, then the
term "Prime Rate" as used in this Agreement shall mean the base rate, prime rate
or other analogous rate of the new Agent.

         7.13 Delegation to Affiliates. The Borrowers and the Lenders agree that
the Agent may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to any of its
Affiliates. Any such Affiliate (and such Affiliate's directors, officers, agents
and employees) which performs duties in connection with this Agreement shall be
entitled to the same benefits of the indemnification, waiver and other
protective provisions to which the Agent is entitled under the Loan Documents.

         7.14 Sharing of Payments. The Lenders agree among themselves that, in
the event that any Lender shall obtain payment in respect of any Advance or any
other obligation owing to the Lenders under this Agreement (other than payments
received pursuant to Section 3.7, payments of principal or interest on
Bid-Option Loans at a time when no Event of Default or Default is continuing,
pro rata payments of principal or interest to all Canadian Lenders on Canadian
Syndicated Loans at a time when no Event of Default or Default is continuing and
pro rata payments of principal or interest to all U.S. Lenders on U.S.
Syndicated Loans at a time when no Event of Default or Default is continuing)
through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim or
otherwise in excess of its ratable share of payments received by all of the
Lenders on account of the Advances and other obligations (or if no Advances are
outstanding, ratably according to the respective amounts of the Commitments),
such Lender shall promptly purchase from the other Lenders participations in
such Advances and other obligations in such amounts, and make such other
adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end that all of the
Lenders share such payment in accordance with such ratable shares. The Lenders
further agree among themselves that if payment to a Lender obtained by such
Lender through the exercise of a right of set-off, banker's lien, counterclaim
or otherwise as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored, each
Lender which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by repurchase
of participations theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit to each
Lender whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored. The
Borrowers agree that any Lender so purchasing such a participation may, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including
set-off, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Lender were a holder of such Advance or other obligation in the
amount of such participation. The Lenders further agree among themselves that,
in the event that amounts received by the Lenders and the Agent hereunder are
insufficient to pay all such obligations or insufficient to pay all such
obligations when due, the fees and other amounts owing to the Agent in such
capacity shall be paid therefrom before payment of obligations owing to the
Lenders under this Agreement. Except as otherwise expressly provided in this
Agreement, if any Lender or the Agent shall fail to remit to the Agent or any
other Lender an amount payable by such Lender or the Agent to the Agent or such
other Lender pursuant to this Agreement on the date when such amount is due,
such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for each date from
the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to the Agent or
such other Lender at a rate per annum equal to the rate at which borrowings are
available to the payee in its overnight federal funds market. It is further
understood and agreed among the Lenders and the Agent that if the Agent or any
Lender shall engage in any other transactions with the Borrowers and shall have
the benefit of any collateral or security therefor which does not expressly
secure the obligations arising under this Agreement except by virtue of a
so-called dragnet clause or comparable provision, the Agent or such Lender shall
be entitled to apply any proceeds of such collateral or security first in
respect of the obligations arising in connection with such other transaction
before application to the obligations arising under this Agreement.

         7.15 Execution of Collateral Documents. The Lenders hereby empower and
authorize the Agent to execute and deliver to the Obligors on their behalf the
Pledge Agreements and all related documents or instruments as shall be necessary
or appropriate to effect the purposes of the Pledge Agreements. The Lenders
further empower and authorize the Agent to execute and deliver on their behalf
the Intercreditor Agreement and all related documents or instruments as shall be
necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of the Intercreditor Agreement,
provided that the form of the Intercreditor Agreement has been approved by the
Required Lenders, and each Lender shall be bound by the terms and provisions of
the Intercreditor Agreement so executed by the Agent.

         7.16 Collateral Releases. The Lenders hereby empower and authorize the
Agent to execute and deliver to the Obligors on their behalf any agreements,
documents or instruments as shall be necessary or appropriate to effect any
releases of collateral which shall be permitted by the terms hereof, including
without limitation any collateral held under the Pledge Agreements which is
permitted to be sold under the terms of this Agreement, or of any other Loan
Document or which shall otherwise have been approved by the Required Lenders
(or, if required, all of the Lenders) in writing.

         7.17 Co-Agents, Syndication Agent, Documentation Agents, etc. Neither
any of the Lenders identified in this Agreement or otherwise as a "co-agent" nor
the Syndication Agent nor the Documentation Agents shall have any right, power,
obligation, liability, responsibility or duty under this Agreement other than
those applicable to all Lenders as such. Without limiting the foregoing, none of
such Lenders shall have or be deemed to have a fiduciary relationship with any
Lender. Each Lender hereby makes the same acknowledgments with respect to such
Lenders as it makes with respect to the Agent in Section 7.11.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         8.1 Amendments, Etc. (a) No amendment, modification, termination or
waiver of any provision of this Agreement nor any consent to any departure
therefrom shall be effective unless the same shall be in writing and signed by
the Borrowers and the Required Lenders and, to the extent any rights or duties
of the Agent may be affected thereby, the Agent, and to the extent the
obligations of the Canadian Lenders are affected thereby, the Required Canadian
Lenders, provided, however, that no such amendment, modification, termination,
waiver or consent shall, without the consent of the Agent and each Lender
affected, (i) authorize or permit the extension of time for, or any reduction of
the amount of, any payment of the principal of, or interest on, the Notes or any
Letter of Credit reimbursement obligation, or any fees or other amount payable
hereunder, (ii) except as provided herein, increase the respective Commitment of
any Lender or modify the provisions of this Section regarding the taking of any
action under this Section or the definition of Required Lenders or Required
Canadian Lenders, (iii) provide for the discharge of any Guarantor except as a
result of a transaction otherwise permitted by this Agreement, (iv) change
Section 7.14 in a manner that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments
required thereby, or (v) provide for the release of all or substantially all of
the collateral subject to the Pledge Agreements except as a result of a
transaction otherwise permitted by this Agreement.

                  (b) Any such amendment, waiver or consent shall be effective
only in the specific instance and for the specific purpose for which given.

                                      -64-
<PAGE>

                  (c) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Defaulting Lender shall be entitled to vote (whether to consent or to withhold
its consent) with respect to any amendment, modification, termination or waiver
of any provision of this Agreement or any departure therefrom or any direction
from the Lenders to the Agent, and, for purposes of determining the Required
Lenders at any time when any Lender is in default under this Agreement, the
Commitments and Advances of such defaulting Lenders shall be disregarded.

                  (d) In addition to the above, the Company may change the
Canadian Borrower (provided that the proposed substitute Canadian Borrower
qualifies as a Canadian Borrower under the definition of such term) hereto at
any time upon (i) the execution and delivery by the Company, the existing
Canadian Borrower, the new Canadian Borrower and the Agent of a joinder and
assumption agreement in form satisfactory to the Agent providing for such
Restricted Subsidiary to become the Canadian Borrower, (ii) the execution and
delivery by the Company of a Guaranty, or the confirmation of the existing
Guaranty, with respect to such new Canadian Borrower, (iii) the delivery to the
Agent of such legal opinions, resolutions and corporate documents as requested
by the Agent, (iv) the delivery of such other documents with respect thereto as
the Agent shall reasonably request and (v) the written approval of the Agent.
Upon the substitution of a new Canadian Borrower hereunder and the payment in
full of all Advances and all other obligations and liabilities owing hereunder
or any other Loan Document by the existing Canadian Borrower (or the assumption
thereof by the new Canadian Borrower in a manner acceptable to the Agent), the
existing Canadian Borrower shall no longer be deemed a Borrower hereunder.

         8.2 Notices. (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.2(c) hereof,
all notices and other communications hereunder shall be sent to the Borrowers at
2801 East Beltline NE, Grand Rapids, Michigan 49505, Attention: Chief Financial

respective addresses and numbers for notices set forth on the signatures pages

prepaid, to such address, on the third day after the date of mailing, or if
deposited prepaid with Federal Express or other nationally recognized overnight
delivery service prior to the deadline for next day delivery, on the Business
Day next following such deposit, provided, however, that notices to the Agent
shall not be effective until received.

                  (b) Notices by any Borrower to the Agent with respect to
terminations or reductions of the Commitments pursuant to Section 2.4, requests
for Advances pursuant to Section 2.6, requests for continuations or conversions
of Loans pursuant to Section 2.9 and notices of prepayment pursuant to Section
3.1 shall be irrevocable and binding on such Borrower.

                  (c) Any notice to be given by the Borrowers to the Agent
pursuant to Sections 2.6 or 2.9 and any notice to be given by the Agent or any
Lender hereunder, may be given by telephone, and all such notices given by the
Borrowers must be immediately confirmed in writing in the manner provided in
Section 8.2(a). Any such notice given by telephone shall be deemed effective
upon receipt thereof by the party to whom such notice is to be given.

         8.3 No Waiver By Conduct; Remedies Cumulative. No course of dealing on
the part of the Agent or any Lender, nor any delay or failure on the part of the
Agent or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder shall
operate as a waiver of such right, power or privilege or otherwise prejudice the
Agent's or such Lender's rights and remedies hereunder; nor shall any single or
partial exercise thereof preclude any further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege. No right

                                      -65-
<PAGE>

or remedy conferred upon or reserved to the Agent or any Lender under this
Agreement or the Loan Documents is intended to be exclusive of any other right
or remedy, and every right and remedy shall be cumulative, and in addition to
every other right or remedy granted thereunder or now or hereafter existing
under any applicable law. Every right and remedy granted by the Loan Documents
or by applicable law to the Agent or any Lender may be exercised from time to
time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Agent or any Lender and,
unless contrary to the express provisions of the Loan Documents, irrespective of
the occurrence or continuance of any Default or Event of Default.

         8.4 Reliance on and Survival of Various Provisions. All terms,
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the Borrowers or any
Guarantor made herein, in any Guaranty or in any certificate, report, financial
statement or other document furnished by or on behalf of the Borrowers or any
Guarantor in connection with this Agreement shall be deemed to be material and
to have been relied upon by the Lenders, notwithstanding any investigation
heretofore or hereafter made by any Lender or on such Lender's behalf, and those
covenants and agreements of the Borrowers set forth in Sections 3.7, 3.9 and 8.5
hereof shall survive the repayment in full of the Advances and the termination
of the Commitments for a period of one year from such repayment or termination.

         8.5 Expenses. (a) The Borrowers agree to pay, or reimburse the Agent
for the payment of, on demand, (i) the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel
to the Agent, including without limitation the reasonable fees and expenses of
Dickinson Wright PLLC in connection with the preparation, execution, delivery
and administration of the Loan Documents and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, and in connection with advising the Agent as
to its rights and responsibilities with respect thereto, and in connection with
any amendments, waivers or consents in connection therewith, and (ii) all stamp
and other taxes and fees payable or determined to be payable in connection with
the execution, delivery, filing or recording of the Loan Documents and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, and any and all
liabilities with respect to or resulting from any delay in paying or omitting to
pay such taxes or fees, and (iii) all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent
and any Lender (including without limitation reasonable fees and expenses of
counsel, including without limitation counsel who are employees of the Agent or
any Lender, and whether incurred through negotiations, legal proceedings or
otherwise) in connection with any Default or Event of Default or the enforcement
of, or the exercise or preservation of any rights under, the Loan Documents, and
(iv) all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Arranger, whether
incurred prior to or subsequent to the Effective Date, in investigation,
preparation, negotiation, documentation, syndication, administration and
collection, for the account of the Borrowers, including without limitation
expenses of and fees for advisors and professionals engaged by the Agent or the
Arranger, and (v) all reasonable costs and expenses of the Agent and the Lenders
(including reasonable fees and expenses of counsel) in connection with any
action or proceeding relating to a court order, injunction or other process or
decree restraining or seeking to restrain the Agent from paying any amount
under, or otherwise relating in any way to, any Letter of Credit and any and all
costs and expenses which any of them may incur relative to any payment under any
Letter of Credit.

                  (b) Each Borrower hereby indemnifies and agrees to hold
harmless the Lenders and the Agent, and their respective officers, directors,
employees, agents and advisors, harmless from and against any and all claims,
damages, losses, liabilities, costs or expenses of any kind or nature whatsoever
which the Lenders or the Agent or any such Person may incur or which may be
claimed against any of them by reason of or in connection with any Letter of
Credit issued for the account of such Borrower, and neither any Lender nor the
Agent or any of their respective officers, directors, employees or agents shall
be liable or responsible for: (i) the use which may be made of any Letter of
Credit or for any acts or omissions of any beneficiary in connection therewith;
(ii) the validity, sufficiency or genuineness of documents or of any endorsement
thereon, even if such documents should in fact prove to be in any or all

                                      -66-
<PAGE>

respects invalid, insufficient, fraudulent or forged; (iii) payment by the Agent
to the beneficiary under any Letter of Credit against presentation of documents
which do not comply with the terms of any Letter of Credit, including failure of
any documents to bear any reference or adequate reference to such Letter of
Credit; (iv) any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,
dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in
connection with any Letter of Credit; or (v) any other event or circumstance
whatsoever arising in connection with any Letter of Credit; provided, however,
that the applicable Borrower shall not be required to indemnify the Lenders and
the Agent and such other Persons, and the Agent shall be liable to the
applicable Borrower to the extent, but only to the extent, of any direct, as
opposed to consequential or incidental, damages suffered by the applicable
Borrower which were caused by (A) the Agent's wrongful dishonor of any Letter of
Credit after the presentation to it by the beneficiary thereunder of a draft or
other demand for payment and other documentation strictly complying with the
terms and conditions of such Letter of Credit, to the extent, but only to the
extent, that such dishonor constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct of
the Agent as determined by a final non-appealable order of a court of competent
jurisdiction, or (B) the Agent's payment to the beneficiary under any Letter of
Credit against presentation of documents which do not comply with the terms of
the Letter of Credit, to the extent, but only to the extent, that such payment
constitutes gross negligence or willful misconduct of the Agent as determined by
a final non-appealable order of a court of competent jurisdiction. It is
understood that in making any payment under a Letter of Credit the Agent will
rely on documents presented to it under such Letter of Credit as to any and all
matters set forth therein without further investigation and regardless of any
notice or information to the contrary, and such reliance and payment against
documents presented under a Letter of Credit substantially complying with the
terms thereof shall not be deemed gross negligence or willful misconduct of the
Agent in connection with such payment.

                  (c) Each Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender, the Agent
and each of their respective officers, directors, employees, agents and advisors
(collectively, the "Indemnified Parties") and hold each Indemnified Party
harmless from and against any and all liabilities, losses, damages, costs and
expenses of any kind at any time, including, without limitation, the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel, which may be incurred by any Indemnified
Party in connection with any investigative, administrative or judicial
proceeding (whether or not such Indemnified Party shall be designated a party
thereto) (collectively, the "Indemnified Liabilities") at any time relating to
(whether before or after the execution of this Agreement) any of the following:

                           (i) any actual or proposed use of the Advances
hereunder by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any transaction financed
or to be financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds
of any Advance;

                           (ii) the entering into and performance of this
Agreement and any other Loan Document by any of the Indemnified Parties
(including any action brought by or on behalf of the Borrower as the result of
any determination by any Lender not to make any Advance);

                           (iii) any investigation, litigation or proceeding
related to any Acquisition or proposed Acquisition by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries of all or any portion of the stock or assets of any Person or to
the issuance of, or any other matter relating to, any Subordinated Debt, whether
or not any Indemnified Party is a party thereto;

                           (iv) any investigation, litigation or proceeding
related to any environmental cleanup, audit, compliance or other matter relating
to any release by such Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of any hazardous
material or any violations of Environmental Laws; or

                                      -67-
<PAGE>

                           (v) the presence on or under, or the escape, seepage,
leakage, spillage, discharge, emission, discharging or releases from, any real
property owned or operated by the Borrower or any Subsidiary thereof of any
hazardous material (including any losses, liabilities, damages, injuries, costs,
expenses or claims asserted or arising under any Environmental Law), regardless
of whether caused by, or within the control of, the Borrower or such Subsidiary,
except for any such Indemnified Liabilities arising for the account of a
particular Indemnified Party by reason of the activities of the Indemnified
Party on the property of the Borrower conducted subsequent to a foreclosure on
such property by any Indemnified Party or by reason of the relevant Indemnified
Party's gross negligence or willful misconduct or breach of this Agreement, and
if and to the extent that the foregoing undertaking may be unenforceable for any
reason, the Borrower hereby agrees to make the maximum contribution to the
payment and satisfaction of each of the Indemnified Liabilities which is
permissible under applicable law. The Borrower shall be obligated to indemnify
the Indemnified Parties for all Indemnified Liabilities subject to and pursuant
to the foregoing provisions, regardless of whether the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries had knowledge of the facts and circumstances giving rise to such
Indemnified Liability; or

                           (vi) any other liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements
of any kind and nature whatsoever which may be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against the Agent in any way relating to or arising out of the Loan
Documents or any other document delivered in connection therewith or the
transactions contemplated thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms of the
Loan Documents or of any such other documents.

Provided that no Indemnified Party shall have the right to be indemnified
hereunder for its own gross negligence or willful misconduct as determined by a
final, non-appealable judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. The
obligations under this Section 8.5 shall survive payment of the Lender
Obligations and termination of this Agreement.

         8.6 Successors and Assigns. (a) This Agreement shall be binding upon
and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns, provided that the Borrowers may not, without the prior consent of
the Lenders, assign their respective rights or obligations hereunder or under
the Loan Documents and the Lenders shall not be obligated to make any Advance
hereunder to any entity other than the Borrowers.

                  (b) Any Lender may sell to any financial institution or
institutions, and such financial institution or institutions may further sell, a
participation interest (undivided or divided) in, the Loans and such Lender's
rights and/or obligations under the Loan Documents, and to the extent of that
participation interest such participant or participants shall have the same
rights and benefits against the Borrowers under Section 3.7, 3.9 and 6.2(c) as
it or they would have had if such participant or participants were the Lender
making the Loans to the Borrowers hereunder, provided, however, that (i) such
Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unmodified and fully
effective and enforceable against such Lender, (ii) such Lender shall remain
solely responsible to the other parties hereto for the performance of such
obligations, (iii) such Lender shall remain the holder of its Notes and Advances
for all purposes of this Agreement, (iv) the Borrowers, the Agent and the other
Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, (v)
such Lender shall not grant to its participant (other than any participant which
is an Affiliate of such Lender) any rights to consent or withhold consent to any
action taken by such Lender or the Agent under this Agreement other than action
requiring the consent of all of the Lenders hereunder, and (vi) no participant
shall be entitled to receive any greater amount pursuant to Sections 3.5, 3.7,
3.9 or 6.2(c) than the transferor Lender would have been entitled to receive in
respect of the amount of the participation transferred by such transferor Lender
to such participant had no such transfer occurred.

                  (c) The Agent from time to time in its sole discretion may
appoint agents for the purpose of servicing and administering this Agreement and
the transactions contemplated hereby and enforcing or exercising any rights or
remedies of the Agent provided under the Loan Documents or otherwise. In
furtherance of such agency, the Agent may from time to time direct that the
Borrowers provide notices, reports and other documents contemplated by this
Agreement (or duplicates thereof) to such agent. Each Borrower hereby consents
to the appointment of such agent and agrees to provide all such notices, reports
and other documents and to otherwise deal with such agent acting on behalf of
the Agent in the same manner as would be required if dealing with the Agent
itself.

                  (d) Each Lender may, with the prior consent of the Borrowers
(which consent may not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be
required upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any Event of Default
or if such assignment is to another Lender or an Affiliate of a Lender) and the
Agent, assign to one or more banks or other entities all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement (including, without limitation, all
or a portion of its Commitment, the Advances owing to it and the Note or Notes
held by it); provided, however, that (i) each such assignment shall be of a
uniform, and not a varying, percentage of all rights and obligations, (ii)
except in the case of an assignment of all of a Lender's rights and obligations
under this Agreement, (A) the amount of the Commitment of the assigning Lender
being assigned pursuant to each such assignment (determined as of the date of
the Assignment and Acceptance with respect to such assignment) shall in no event
be less than $5,000,000, and in integral multiples of $1,000,000 thereafter, or
such lesser amount as to which the Borrowers and the Agent may consent, and (B)
after giving effect to each such assignment (unless the assignment is for the
entire amount of such Lender's Commitment), the amount of the Commitment of the
assigning Lender shall in no event be less than $5,000,000 or such lesser amount
as to which the Borrowers and the Agent may consent, (iii) the parties to each
such assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent, for its acceptance and
recording in the Register, an Assignment and Acceptance in the form of Exhibit M
hereto (an "Assignment and Acceptance"), together with any Note or Notes subject
to such assignment and a processing and recordation fee of $3,500, and (iv) any
Lender may without the consent of the Borrowers or the Agent, and without paying
any fee, assign or sell a participation interest to any Affiliate of such Lender
that is a bank or financial institution all or a portion of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement. Upon such execution, delivery, acceptance and
recording, from and after the effective date specified in such Assignment and
Acceptance, (x) the assignee thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the
extent that rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned to it pursuant
to such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
hereunder and (y) the Lender assignor thereunder shall, to the extent that
rights and obligations hereunder have been assigned by it pursuant to such
Assignment and Acceptance, relinquish its rights and be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the remaining portion of an assigning Lender's rights
and obligations under this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party
hereto).

                  (e) By executing and delivering an Assignment and Acceptance,
the Lender assignor thereunder and the assignee thereunder confirm to and agree
with each other and the other parties hereto as follows: (i) other than as
provided in such Assignment and Acceptance, such assigning Lender makes no
representation or warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to any
statements, warranties or representations made in or in connection with this
Agreement or the execution, legality, validity, enforceability, genuineness,
sufficiency or value of this Agreement or any other instrument or document
furnished pursuant hereto; (ii) such assigning Lender makes no representation or
warranty and assumes no responsibility with respect to the financial condition
of the Borrowers or the performance or observance by the Borrowers of any of its
obligations under this Agreement or any other instrument or document furnished
pursuant hereto; (iii) such assignee confirms that it has received a copy of
this

                                      -69-
<PAGE>

Agreement, together with copies of the financial statements referred to in
Section 4.6 and such other documents and information as it has deemed
appropriate to make its own credit analysis and decision to enter into such
Assignment and Acceptance; (iv) such assignee will, independently and without
reliance upon the Agent, such assigning Lender or any other Lender and based on
such documents and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time,
continue to make its own credit decisions in taking or not taking action under
this Agreement; (v) such assignee appoints and authorizes the Agent to take such
action as agent on its behalf and to exercise such powers and discretion under
this Agreement as are delegated to the Agent by the terms hereof, together with
such powers and discretion as are reasonably incidental thereto; and (vi) such
assignee agrees that it will perform and assume in accordance with their terms
all of the obligations that by the terms of this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents are required to be performed or assumed by it as a Lender.

                  (f) The Agent shall maintain at its address designated on the
signature pages hereof a copy of each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to and
accepted by it and a register for the recordation of the names and addresses of
the Lenders and the Commitment of, and principal amount of the Loans owing to,
each Lender from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register
shall be conclusive and binding for all purposes, absent manifest error, and the
Borrowers, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register as a Lender hereunder for all purposes of this
Agreement. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrowers or
any Lender at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

                  (g) Upon its receipt of an Assignment and Acceptance executed
by an assigning Lender and an assignee, together with any Note or Notes subject
to such assignment, the Agent shall, if such Assignment and Acceptance has been
completed, (i) accept such Assignment and Acceptance, (ii) record the
information contained therein in the Register and (iii) give prompt notice
thereof to the Borrowers. Within five Business Days after its receipt of such
notice, the Borrowers, at their own expense, shall execute and deliver to the
Agent in exchange for the surrendered Note or Notes a new Note to the order of
such assignee in an amount equal to the Commitment assumed by it pursuant to
such Assignment and Acceptance and, if the assigning Lender has retained a
Commitment hereunder, a new Note to the order of the assigning Lender in an
amount equal to the Commitment retained by it hereunder. Such new Note or Notes
shall be in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of such surrendered Note or Notes, shall be dated the effective date of
such Assignment and Acceptance and shall otherwise be in substantially the form
of Exhibit M hereto.

                  (h) The Borrowers shall not be liable for any costs or
expenses of any Lender in effectuating any participation or assignment under
this Section 8.6.

                  (i) The Lenders may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Section
8.6, disclose to the assignee or participant or proposed assignee or participant
(each a "Transferee") any information relating to any Borrower or its
Subsidiaries; provided that each Transferee agrees to be bound by the terms of
Section 8.16.

                  (j) Notwithstanding any other provision set forth in this
Agreement, any Lender may at any time create a security interest in, or assign,
all or any portion of its rights under this Agreement (including, without
limitation, the Loans owing to it and the Note or Notes held by it) in favor of
any Federal Reserve Lender in accordance with Regulation A of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System; provided that such creation of a
security interest or assignment shall not release such Lender from its
obligations under this Agreement.

         8.7 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in any number of
counterparts, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the same
instrument and any of the parties hereto may execute this Agreement by signing
any such counterpart.

         8.8 Governing Law. This Agreement is a contract made under, and shall
be governed by and construed in accordance with, the law of the State of
Michigan applicable to contracts made and to be performed entirely within such
State and without giving effect to choice of law principles of such State.

         8.9 Table of Contents and Headings. The table of contents and the
headings of the various subdivisions hereof are for the convenience of reference
only and shall in no way modify any of the terms or provisions hereof.

         8.10 Construction of Certain Provisions. If any provision of this
Agreement refers to any action to be taken by any Person, or which such Person
is prohibited from taking, such provision shall be applicable whether such
action is taken directly or indirectly by such Person, whether or not expressly
specified in such provision.

         8.11 Integration and Severability. The Loan Documents embody the entire
agreement and understanding among the Borrowers and the Agent and the Lenders,
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, relating to the subject
matter hereof. In case any one or more of the obligations of the Borrowers under
the Loan Documents shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining
obligations of the Borrowers shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby, and such invalidity, illegality or unenforceability in one jurisdiction
shall not affect the validity, legality or enforceability of the obligations of
the Borrowers under the Loan Documents in any other jurisdiction.

         8.12 Independence of Covenants. All covenants hereunder shall be given
independent effect so that if a particular action or condition is not permitted
by any such covenant, the fact that it would be permitted by an exception to, or
would be otherwise within the limitations of, another covenant shall not avoid
the occurrence of a Default or an Event of Default if such action is taken or
such condition exists.

         8.13 Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding any provisions of this
Agreement or the Notes, in no event shall the amount of interest paid or agreed
to be paid by the Borrowers exceed an amount computed at the highest rate of
interest permissible under applicable law. If, from any circumstances
whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this Agreement or the Notes at the
time performance of such provision shall be due, shall involve exceeding the
interest rate limitation validly prescribed by law which a court of competent
jurisdiction may deem applicable hereto, then, ipso facto, the obligations to be
fulfilled shall be reduced to an amount computed at the highest rate of interest
permissible under applicable law, and if for any reason whatsoever any Lender
shall ever receive as interest an amount which would be deemed unlawful under
such applicable law such interest shall be automatically applied to the payment
of principal of such Lender's Advances outstanding hereunder (whether or not
then due and payable) and not to the payment of interest, or shall be refunded
to the Borrowers if such principal and all other obligations of the Borrowers to
such Lender have been paid in full.

         8.14 Acknowledgments. Each Borrower hereby acknowledges that:

         (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

                                      -71-
<PAGE>

         (b) none of the Agent or any Lender has any fiduciary relationship with
or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or
any of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Agent and the
Lenders, on the one hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection
herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

         (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan Documents
or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated hereby among the
Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.

         8.15 Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each Borrower hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

         (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it
is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect
thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of any United States federal
or Michigan state court sitting in Detroit, Michigan and appellate courts from
any thereof;

         (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in such
courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to the venue
of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such action or
proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not to plead or claim
the same;

         (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding may
be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail (or any
substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the Borrower at the
address specified in Section 8.2, or at such other address of which the Agent
shall have been notified pursuant thereto;

         (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect service
of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the right to sue
in any other jurisdiction; and

         (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right it
may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred to in
this subsection any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential damages.

         8.16 Confidentiality. Each Lender agrees to hold any confidential
information which it may receive from the Borrowers pursuant to this Agreement
in confidence, except for disclosure (i) to its Affiliates and to other Lenders
and their respective Affiliates, (ii) to legal counsel, accountants, and other
professional advisors to such Lender or Affiliate or to a Transferee, (iii) to
regulatory officials, (iv) to any Person as requested pursuant to or as required
by law, regulation, or legal process, (v) to any Person in connection with any
legal proceeding to which such Lender is a party, (vi) to such Lenders' direct
or indirect contractual counterparties in swap agreements or to legal counsel,
accountants and other professional advisors to such counterparties, and (vii)
permitted by Section 8.6(i).

         8.17 WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. THE LENDERS AND THE AGENT AND THE BORROWERS,
AFTER CONSULTING OR HAVING HAD THE OPPORTUNITY TO CONSULT WITH COUNSEL,
KNOWINGLY, VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVE ANY RIGHT ANY OF THEM MAY HAVE TO
A TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LITIGATION BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF ANY LOAN DOCUMENT
OR ANY RELATED INSTRUMENT OR AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
BY THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY COURSE

                                      -72-
<PAGE>

OF CONDUCT, DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER ORAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF EITHER
OF THEM. NEITHER ANY LENDER, THE AGENT NOR THE BORROWERS SHALL SEEK TO
CONSOLIDATE, BY COUNTERCLAIM OR OTHERWISE, ANY SUCH ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL CANNOT BE OR HAS NOT
BEEN WAIVED. THESE PROVISIONS SHALL NOT BE DEEMED TO HAVE BEEN MODIFIED IN ANY
RESPECT OR RELINQUISHED BY ANY PARTY HERETO EXCEPT BY A WRITTEN INSTRUMENT
EXECUTED BY SUCH PARTY.

         8.18 USA PATRIOT ACT NOTIFICATION. The following notification is
provided to the Borrowers pursuant to Section 326 of the USA Patriot Act of
2001, 31 U.S.C. Section 5318:

IMPORTANT INFORMATION ABOUT PROCEDURES FOR OPENING A NEW ACCOUNT. To help the
government fight the funding of terrorism and money laundering activities,
Federal law requires all financial institutions to obtain, verify, and record
information that identifies each person or entity that opens an account,
including any deposit account, treasury management account, loan, other
extension of credit, or other financial services product. What this means for a
Borrower: When a Borrower opens an account, if a Borrower is an individual,
Agent and the Lenders will ask for such Borrower's name, residential address,
tax identification number, date of birth, and other information that will allow
Agent and the Lenders to identify such Borrower, and, if such Borrower is not an
individual, Agent and the Lenders will ask for such Borrower's name, tax
identification number, business address, and other information that will allow
Agent and the Lenders to identify such Borrower. Agent and the Lenders may also
ask, if a Borrower is an individual, to see such Borrower's driver's license or
other identifying documents, and, if a Borrower is not an individual, to see
such Borrower's legal organizational documents or other identifying documents.

                                      -73-

         IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to be
