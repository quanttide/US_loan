Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

          On December 20, 2004, the Registrant and certain of its wholly-owned
          subsidiaries completed a five-year, $250 million unsecured revolving
          credit facility with a syndicate of U.S. and Canadian banks led by
          JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as agent, including up to $65 million which
          may be reserved for letters of credit and up to CA$30 million which
          may be borrowed and shall be repaid in Canadian dollars. This facility
          replaced our $200 million unsecured revolving credit facility. The
          amount outstanding on the revolving credit facility on December 20,
          2004 was $17.4 million. Cash borrowings are charged interest based
          upon an index equal to the Eurodollar rate (in the case of borrowings
          in US Dollars) or the bankers' acceptance rate quoted by JP Morgan
          Chase Bank, N.A., Toronto Branch (in the case of borrowings in
          Canadian Dollars), plus a margin (ranging from 42.5 to 107.5 basis
          points) based upon the financial performance of the Registrant and
          certain of its subsidiaries. The companies are also charged a facility
          fee on the entire amount of the lending commitment (ranging from 12.5
          to 30 basis points, based upon company performance), and a usage
          premium (ranging from 7.5 to 12.5 basis points, based upon company
          performance) at times when borrowings exceed $125 million.

          A copy of the Credit Agreement is attached as Exhibit 10(i) to this
          Current Report.
