<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;In fiscal year 2004, we delivered solid performance throughout the company. We saw revenue
growth in every region and from an operational perspective &#150; excluding the effects of purchase
accounting &#150; profitability was up significantly. Additionally, we experienced a dramatic
improvement in the operating cash flow of the company,&#148; said Mr.&nbsp;Alfonso Romo, Chairman of the
Board and Chief Executive Officer.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are also leveraging the capabilities of our supply chain, market intelligence systems and
research. We continue to support our efforts in Asia as evidenced by the opening of a new
operations center and a research facility in China, while expanding and upgrading existing
infrastructure and systems in all regions. But most importantly, we continue to lead innovation in
our industry. Every day, Seminis scientists are making technological advances that expand the
horizons of plant breeding in vegetables and fruits. As a result, we were issued nine
patents and received 44 Plant Variety Protection certificates in FY2004,&#148; said Mr.&nbsp;Romo.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;Given the company&#146;s strong performance, our corporate bonds have traded at a premium throughout
the year. We take this as a vote of confidence that Seminis is on the right path to deliver
dependable, long-term returns,&#148; he said.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In September&nbsp;2003, in connection with the acquisition transactions, Seminis became a privately held
company. As a result, its financial statements have been materially impacted by non-cash charges
due to the application of the purchase accounting method, which includes amortization of inventory
write-up that negatively impacts the gross profit that is expected to continue until March&nbsp;2005,
and the reduction of amortization and depreciation of intangible and fixed assets that positively
impact the operating expenses.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REVIEW OF FY2004 PERFORMANCE</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Total sales for fiscal year 2004 increased 10.1% to $525.8&nbsp;million from $477.4&nbsp;million during the
same period last year. Continued growth was seen across all sales regions, led by EMEA (Europe,
Middle East and Africa) and West Asia which posted increases of 13.5% and 15.7%, respectively.
Product mix and pricing improvements continue to be the main drivers of sales growth worldwide. New
product sales continue to represent a larger potion of overall sales growth. At constant exchange
rates (CER), total sales increased 5.5% to $503.7&nbsp;million from $477.4&nbsp;million the previous year
with increases seen across all regions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Gross margin percentage decreased to 55.2% for the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 from 62.0%
for the fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2003. A negative impact of 9&nbsp;percentage points resulted
from the non-cash amortization of $47.4&nbsp;million of inventory step-up under purchase accounting
treatment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As a percentage of sales, total operating expenses for fiscal year 2004 decreased to 48.3% from
61.0% of sales in the prior year. Total operating expenses was $253.9&nbsp;million, down 12.8% from
$291.3&nbsp;million for the same period last year. The decrease was primarily the result of various
one-time charges related to the merger and privatization transaction that occurred during fiscal
year 2003 that did not impact fiscal year 2004 operating expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Income from operations for fiscal year 2004 increased to $40.5&nbsp;million compared with $6.5&nbsp;million
for the previous year. The 2004 result was negatively impacted by the above-mentioned purchase
accounting net effect of $44.8&nbsp;million, while the 2003 number was negatively impacted by merger and
privatization related charges as well as purchase accounting effects totaling $56.5&nbsp;million.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Net loss for fiscal year 2004 was $16.3&nbsp;million compared with a net loss of $31.7&nbsp;million the
previous year. This number was negatively impacted by the above-mentioned purchase accounting net
effect of $44.8&nbsp;million and $56.5&nbsp;million, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;During 2004, we continued to improve our product mix &#151; a reflection of our market-oriented
research strategy,&#148; said Dr.&nbsp;Bruno Ferrari, President and Chief Operating Officer. &#147;Combined with
effective inventory management, this has simplified the management of working capital and
contributed to the increase in company-wide profitability,&#148; Dr.&nbsp;Ferrari said.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Dr.&nbsp;Ferrari reported that the portfolio of products has been reduced by 42% since fiscal year 2000
while revenue-per-product has increased at a CAGR of 19.9% over the same period. Likewise, sales of
new products represent 21% of total seed sales in FY 2004.

$124.7&nbsp;million the previous year. Fourth-quarter sales of fiscal year 2004 include $2.5&nbsp;million in
seed orders that were expected in the third quarter of 2004, but delayed due to a change in export

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Gross margin percentage increased to 65.6% for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 from 58.9%
for the three months ended September&nbsp;30, 2003. The fourth quarter margin percentage was negatively
impacted by the net non-cash amortization of $2.4&nbsp;million of inventory step-up under purchase
accounting treatment, included in the net non cash inventory step-up amortization was a $9.1
million positive impact on gross margin due to a revision of an estimated 16-month inventory turn
to an actual 18-month inventory turn. The net non cash amortization of $2.4&nbsp;million had a negative
impact of 1.8&nbsp;percentage points on the company&#146;s gross margin. New products continue to represent a
larger portion of overall sales, which is driving margins higher.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">As a percentage of sales, operating expenses decreased to 50.6% of sales compared with 85.3% of
sales for the previous year. Total operating expenses for the fourth quarter were $66.3&nbsp;million,
down 37.7% from $106.4&nbsp;million during the same period last year. The decrease was primarily the
result of the fact that fourth quarter 2003 operating expenses were impacted by various charges
related to the privatization and merger transaction that did not impact fourth quarter 2004
operating expense.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Income from operations for the fourth quarter was $20.3&nbsp;million compared to an operating loss of
$32.5&nbsp;million for the prior year. The fourth quarter result was negatively impacted by $2.4&nbsp;million
which included a non-cash purchase accounting net benefit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">For the fourth quarter of 2004, net income was $5.8&nbsp;million compared with a $40.6&nbsp;million loss in
