ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.

      Quality Dining, Inc. (the "Company") is filing this Form 8-K to update the
following sections from its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended October 26,
2003, which was filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on January 23,
2004: "Item 6. Selected Financial Data," "Item 7. Management's Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations," and "Item 8.
Financial Statements and Supplementary Data." The Company is recasting the
financial information contained in those sections to reflect the retroactive
presentation of FASB Interpretation No. 46, "Consolidation of Variable Interest
Entities", as amended (FIN 46R), and pursuant to Statement of Financial
Accounting Standard ("SFAS") No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal
of Long-Lived Assets" to recast its previously reported financial information
for the presentation of discontinued operations. The Company elected to update
the financial information at this time because such information will be
contained in the Company's preliminary proxy statement filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to the previously announced going
private transaction.

      The updated financial information is contained in Exhibit 99 attached
hereto, and is incorporated by reference herein.
