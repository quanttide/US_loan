ITEM 4.02 NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR A RELATED
          AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW

(a)     On December 22, 2004, Quality Dining, Inc. (the "Company") concluded
that there was an error in the allocation of tax expense (benefit) between
continuing operations and discontinued operations in the Company's financial
statements for the sixteen weeks ended February 15, 2004 included in the
Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended February 15, 2004, in the
Company's financial statements for the twelve and twenty-eight weeks ended May
9, 2004 included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended May
9, 2004 and in the Company's financial statements for the twelve and forty weeks
ended August 1, 2004 included in the Company's Form 10-Q for the quarterly
period ended August 1, 2004. This error did not affect the Company's reported
financial position or net income but did affect the Company's income tax
provision, net income (loss) from continuing operations and net income (loss)
from discontinued operations for the affected fiscal periods. The error also
affected the allocation of basic and diluted net income per share between
continuing operations and discontinued operations for the affected fiscal
periods.

        Accordingly, the Company's management and Audit Committee have concluded
that the financial statements in the Company's Forms 10-Q for the quarterly
periods ended February 15, 2004, May 9, 2004 and August 1, 2004, should no
longer be relied upon. Based on this decision, the Company will revise its
financial statements for the sixteen weeks ended February 15, 2004 and February
16, 2003, the twelve and twenty-eight weeks ended May 9, 2004 and May 11, 2003,
and the twelve and forty weeks ended August 1, 2004 and August 3, 2003, to
reflect the proper income tax provision, income (loss) from continuing
operations, income (loss) from discontinued operations, basic and diluted net
income per share from continuing operations and basic and diluted net income per
share from discontinued operations. The Company will file an amendment to each
of the applicable Forms 10-Q to reflect the proper amounts for the affected 2004
and 2003 fiscal periods. These amended filings will present the following:
