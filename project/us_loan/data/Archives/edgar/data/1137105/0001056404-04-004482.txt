     265330888     Bwr is requesting debt relief due to cash flow problems resulting from the largest
                   tenant's (Oracle Corp) lease expiring

     265330852     Dominion Paving and Sealing was awarded the contract for repair, sealing and restripe the
                   entire parking lot ($263,000). Work is about 60% completed. A prospect lease for the
                   vacant 40,000 SF still under negotiation with Ollie's, a retailer of closeout merchandise.
                   Owner received no objection from TJX tenant for Ollie's. A lease renewal at $4.50 psf for
                   three years was executed by Salvation Army (15,000 SF).

     265330833     Loan is delinquent.  Have not received requested information from borrower.  Legal counsel
                   has been retained and the pre-foreclosure work is being completed.  The title report has
                   been received.  The complaint is being filed.

     265330940     The loan was transferred to Lennar for monitoring after the Borrower requested debt relief
                   because the Property is having cash flow problems.  The loan is current and the Borrower
                   is paying on time.

     265330875     The judge denied our motion for relief from stay, stating that there was a small amount of
                   equity.  A valuation hearing has been set for 1/11/05.

     265330982     The loan was transferred to Lennar due to monetary default after the Borrower failed to
                   make the June 1st payment.  Legal counsel was retained to initiate a foreclosure action.
