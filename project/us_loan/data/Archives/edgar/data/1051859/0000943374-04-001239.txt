EXHIBIT 99.1

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE:                     CONTACT:  Dwayne Powell, CEO
                                                           870-802-1700

           POCAHONTAS BANCORP, INC. ANNOUNCES FOURTH QUARTER EARNINGS

Jonesboro,   Arkansas  -  December   23,  2004  -   Pocahontas   Bancorp,   Inc.
(Nasdaq-NMS:PFSL)  announced  earnings for the fourth quarter of the fiscal year
ended September 30, 2004. Among the highlights:

     o    The Company  reported a net loss of $0.3 million for the quarter ended
          September  30,  2004,  compared to net income of $1.9  million for the
          same period in 2003.

     o    Basic and  diluted  loss per share  was  $0.06 for the  quarter  ended
          September 30, 2004  compared to basic  earnings per share of $0.43 and
          diluted earnings per share of $0.42 for the same period last year.

     o    Net interest  income  increased to $4.7 million for the quarter  ended
          September 30, 2004, compared to $4.6 million for the quarter in 2003.

     o    Total  operating  expenses  decreased $0.9 million to $4.0 million for
          the quarter  ended  September  30, 2004 compared to the same period in
          2003.

Net interest  income  before  provision  for loan loss during the quarter  ended
September 30, 2004 was substantially the same as the prior year as a decrease in
interest  expense of $0.7  million or 14.6% was offset by a decrease in interest
income of $0.6 million or 6.4%. The Company's net interest rate spread was 2.98%
for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 compared to 2.83% for the quarter ended
September  30,  2003.  Net  interest  margin  was  2.90% for the  quarter  ended
September 30, 2004 compared to 2.75% for the quarter ended September 30, 2003.

Provision  for loan losses for the  quarter  ended  September  30, 2004 was $2.8
million  compared to $1.1  million for the quarter  ended  September  30,  2003.
Approximately one half of the current quarter's  provision  resulted from a loss
on a large commercial loan following  management's  determination that the value
of the loan's  collateral was inadequate to fully secure the loan. The remaining
half of the provision  resulted from  management's  determination  of collateral
value inadequacies on loans to various other borrowers.  Management periodically
reviews  the  credit  quality  of the loan  portfolio  in order to  establish  a
sufficient  allowance  for losses on loans.  The provision for loan loss for the
quarters ended  September 30, 2004 and 2003 reflected  management's  estimate of
the amount of allowance for loan losses required based on  management's  current
judgments about the credit quality of individual  loans and segments of the loan
portfolio; changing economic and other conditions may require future adjustments
to the allowance for loan losses.

Non-interest  income  decreased to $1.4 million for the quarter ended  September
30,  2004 from $3.9  million for the  quarter  ended  September  30,  2003.  The
decrease in non-interest  income was primarily due to a $1.9 million gain on the
sale of a branch  recognized  during the quarter  ended  September  30, 2003. In
addition,  gain on the sale of loans  decreased  $0.5 million,  or 62.5% for the
quarter ended  September 30, 2004 from the quarter ended September 30, 2003 as a
subdued  refinancing  environment  during 2004 resulted in a decreased number of
loans originated and subsequently sold.

Net income for the year ended  September 30, 2004 was $3.5 million,  compared to
net income of $5.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2003. Basic earnings
per share was $0.77 and diluted  earnings per share was $0.75 for the year ended
September  30, 2004  compared to basic  earnings  per share of $1.22 and diluted
earnings per share of $1.20 for the year ended September 30, 2003.

Net interest income before  provision for loan loss for the year ended September
30,  2004 was  $19.4  million  compared  to  $17.8  million  for the year  ended
September  30, 2003.  The increase was  primarily  due to a decrease in interest
expense of $2.6  million or 13.5%  which was  partially  offset by a decrease in


<PAGE>


interest  income of $1.0 million or 2.7%. The Company's net interest rate spread
was 3.04% for the year ended  September  30, 2004 compared to 2.98% for the year
ended  September  30,  2003.  Net  interest  margin was 2.96% for the year ended
September 30, 2004 compared to 2.91% for the year ended September 30, 2003.

Provision for loan losses for the year ended September 30, 2004 was $3.9 million
compared to $2.6 million for the year ended  September  30, 2003.  Approximately
one  third  of the  current  year  provision  resulted  from a loss  on a  large
commercial  loan  following  management's  determination  that the  value of the
loan's  collateral was  inadequate to secure the loan.  The remaining  provision
resulted from  management's  determination of collateral  value  inadequacies on
loans to various other borrowers. The provision for loan loss for the year ended
September  30, 2004 and 2003  reflected  management's  estimate of the amount of
allowance for loan losses required based on management's current judgments about
the credit  quality of  individual  loans and  segments  of the loan  portfolio;
changing  economic and other  conditions may require  future  adjustments to the
allowance for loan losses.

Non-interest  income  decreased to $5.7 million for the year ended September 30,
2004 from $10.6  million for the year ended  September  30,  2003.  The decrease
primarily  was  due to a $2.3  million  decrease  in the  gain  on the  sale  of
branches, as well as a decrease of $2.1 million in the gain on sale of loans for
the year ended  September  30, 2004  compared  to the same  period in 2003.  The
subdued  refinancing  environment  during 2004 resulted in a decreased number of
loans originated and subsequently  sold, which resulted in both lower fee income
and a lower gain on sale of loans.

Total operating expense was $16.3 million for the year ended September 30, 2004,
a decrease of $1.8 million, or 9.9% from the level of operating expense incurred
during the same period a year ago.  Compensation expense decreased $0.9 million,
or 8.7%,  primarily  due to a decrease  in the number of  employees,  as well as
recognition of $0.2 million in additional  expense in 2003 related to a deferred
compensation  agreement entered into with a retiring officer of the Company. The
lower  operating  expense  also  reflected a $0.2  million or 33.3%  decrease in
advertising  expenses  during the year ended  September 30, 2004, as the Company
handled the advertising internally.

"The  decrease in total  operating  expense also was the result of  management's
ongoing  efforts to monitor  expenses  and  increase  efficiency,"  said  Dwayne
Powell, chief executive officer.

Total assets were $719.9  million at September  30, 2004, a 5.7%  decrease  from
$763.5  million at September 30, 2003.  The decrease was primarily the result of
the sale and call of $92.7 million of  securities,  and  principal  payments and
maturities  of $69.9  million in  securities,  which was partly offset by $112.6
million in  securities  purchases,  resulting  in a net  decrease in  investment
securities of $52.1 million or 17.4%.  During the year ended September 30, 2004,
the  Company  analyzed  the   classification   of  securities  and  subsequently
transferred   $86.1   million   of   securities   from   available-for-sale   to
held-to-maturity.  The yield on  average  interest  earning  assets for the year
ended  September  30,  2004  was  5.50%  compared  to 6.05%  for the year  ended
September 30, 2003.

Total loans  receivable  were  $383.8  million at  September  30,  2004,  a 1.3%
decrease  from  $389.0  million at  September  30,  2003.  During the year ended
September  30,  2004,  the  Company  sold $27.4  million of loans held for sale,
compared to $60.4 million sold during the year ended  September 30, 2003.  Total
nonperforming  loans  decreased 16.1% to $4.7 million at September 30, 2004 from
$5.6 million at September 30, 2003.

Total  deposits  decreased to $491.1  million at September  30, 2004 from $586.1
million at  September  30,  2003.  Recent  efforts to control  cost of funds and
manage  interest  rate risk have  caused  the  Company to  decrease  certificate
accounts in favor of  lower-rate  Federal  Home Loan Bank (FHLB)  advances.  The
decrease in deposits was also  partially the result of the sale of $12.7 million
in  deposits  associated  with  the  sale of the  Company's  branch  located  in
Strawberry,  Arkansas. Total Federal Home Loan Bank advances increased to $153.9
million at September  30, 2004 from $100.7  million at September  30, 2003.  The
Company used  advances to offset the decrease in deposits,  and fund  investment
purchases and loan disbursements.
