                  Re:   Pocahontas Bancorp, Inc.:  Notice of Non-Compliance
                        ---------------------------------------------------

Dear Ms. Owens:

         On behalf of Pocahontas Bancorp, Inc. (the "Company"), the common stock
of which is listed on the Nasdaq National Market System, we hereby notify you
that the Company has become aware of the Company's material non-compliance with
the requirements of Nasdaq Rule 4350.

         As discussed with Mr. Eric Wasiuta of the Nasdaq staff, management of
the Company recently learned that a member of the Company's Audit Committee
failed to meet the criteria for independence set forth in Rule 10A-3(b)(i) under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. The non-compliance related to certain
compensation paid to the director under a consulting agreement that preceded by
three years his appointment to the Audit Committee. The director has resigned
from the Company's Audit Committee, effective December 22, 2004. As a result,
the Company is now in compliance with the Nasdaq's corporate governance
requirements, including the requirement that all Audit Committee members meet
the criteria for independence as defined under Nasdaq Rule 4200(a)(15) and Rule
10A.

         Any questions with regard to this notice should be directed to the
undersigned at (202) 274-2011.

                                            Respectfully,

                                            /s/ Robert B. Pomerenk

                                            Robert B. Pomerenk

cc:      Eric Wasiuta, Esq.
