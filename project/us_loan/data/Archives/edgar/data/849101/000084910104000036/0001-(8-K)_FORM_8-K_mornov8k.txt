     On February,  4, 2004, Avado Brands, Inc. (the "Company") filed a voluntary
petition under Chapter 11 of the United States  Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy
Code") in the United States  Bankruptcy Court for the Northern District of Texas
(the  "Bankruptcy  Court").  Honorable  Chief Judge Steven A.  Felsenthal of the
Bankruptcy Court was assigned to preside over the case, which is administered as
Case No. 04-31555.  Pursuant to the United States Bankruptcy Code, the Company's
monthly  operating  report for the period ended November 21, 2004 (the "Report")
was filed with the Bankruptcy Court on December 16, 2004. The Report is attached
to this Current Report on Form 8-K as exhibit 99.1.

     The Report contains  financial  statements and other financial  information
that have not been  audited or  reviewed  by  independent  accountants,  are not

be subject to future reconciliation and adjustments.

furnished solely pursuant to Item 2.02 of this Form 8-K. Consequently, it is not
deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Securities  Exchange Act of
1934, or otherwise  subject to the  liabilities of that section.  It may only be
incorporated by reference in another filing under the Exchange Act or Securities
Act of 1933 if such subsequent filing specifically references this Form 8-K.
