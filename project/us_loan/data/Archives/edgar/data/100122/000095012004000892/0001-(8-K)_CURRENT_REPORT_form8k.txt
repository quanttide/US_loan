ITEM 1.02 TERMINATION OF A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
- --------------------------------------------------------

     In November 2003, UniSource Energy Corporation (UniSource Energy) entered
into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the Agreement) with Saguaro Acquisition
Corp. (Saguaro), an affiliate of Saguaro Utility Group L.P. (Saguaro LP), that
provided for the acquisition of all of UniSource Energy's outstanding common
stock for $25.25 per share by Saguaro. Saguaro LP is an Arizona limited
partnership whose general partner is Sage Mountain, L.L.C. and whose limited
partners include investment funds associated with Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co.,
L.P., J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC and Wachovia Capital Partners.

     On December 21, 2004, the Arizona Corporation Commission (ACC) voted, at
the end of a special open meeting, to deny the application seeking its approval
of the proposed acquisition.

     The Agreement provides that in the event that the ACC denies the
acquisition, Saguaro or UniSource Energy may terminate the Agreement, and
UniSource Energy is obligated to reimburse up to $7 million of Saguaro's
expenses.

     On December 30, 2004, Saguaro exercised its right to terminate the
Agreement and UniSource Energy paid Saguaro $7 million to cover Saguaro's
expenses, pursuant to the terms of the Agreement.
