SECTION 1.  REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

Item 1.01.  Entry Into a Definitive Material Agreement

         On December 23, 2004, the Company and Affymetrix, Inc. agreed to terms
of an amendment of their Agreement effective January 1, 2002 concerning the
Company's purchase of microarrays, instrumentation, reagents and services from
Affymetrix. The Amendment affects the following changes to the terms of the
original Agreement:

     o    The annual subscription fee payable to Affymetrix for calendar year
          2005 is reduced from $4.0 million to $0.5 million;

     o    Pricing is established for probe array products for the period July 1,
          2003 to December 31, 2005; pricing is also established for probe
          arrays used for upgrades/re-runs in 2005 if volume commitments are
          met;

     o    The Company agrees to purchase from Affymetrix, in December 2004, a
          minimum of $0.5 million of products and services; and

     o    The Company agrees to purchase from Affymetrix, in calendar year 2005,
          a minimum of $9.5 million of probe arrays, reagents, services under
          maintenance and service agreements and/or instrumentation or, in any
          event, to pay to Affymetrix by the end of 2005 the difference between
          $9.5 million and amounts purchased in 2005.

         The separate royalty payable by the Company to Affymetrix, based on
subscriptions to the Company's BioExpress and ToxExpress Systems, expected to
begin in calendar year 2005, is not affected by this Amendment.
