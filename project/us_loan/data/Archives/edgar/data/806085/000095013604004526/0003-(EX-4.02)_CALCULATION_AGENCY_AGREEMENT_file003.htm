         calculate and announce a Closing Index Level on any date, (c)
         adjustments to the Index, the Successor Index or the Closing Index
         Level if the method of calculating any of these items changes in a
         material respect or if the Index or Successor Index is in any other way
         modified so that it does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent,
         fairly represent the value of the Index, or Successor Index, as the
         case may

         obligations herein set out upon the terms and conditions hereof,
         including the following, to all of which the Company agrees:

                  (a) in acting under this Agreement, the Calculation Agent is
         acting solely as an independent expert of the Company and does not
         assume any obligation toward, or any relationship of agency or trust
         for or with, any of the holders of the Securities;

                  (b) unless otherwise specifically provided herein, any order,
         certificate, notice, request, direction or other communication from the
         Company or the Trustee made or given under any provision of this
         Agreement shall be sufficient if signed by any person whom the
         Calculation Agent reasonably believes to be a duly authorized officer
         or attorney-in-fact of the Company or the Trustee, as the case may be;

                  (c) the Calculation Agent shall be obliged to perform only
         such duties as are set out specifically herein and any duties
         necessarily incidental thereto;

                  (d) the Calculation Agent, whether acting for itself or in any
         other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities with the
         same rights as it would have had if it were not acting hereunder as
         Calculation Agent; and

                  (e) the Calculation Agent shall incur no liability hereunder
         except for loss sustained by reason of its gross negligence or willful
         misconduct.

                  6. Resignation; Removal; Successor. (a) The Calculation Agent
         may at any time resign by giving written notice to the Company of such
         intention on its part, specifying the date on which its desired
         resignation shall become effective, subject to the appointment of a
         successor Calculation Agent and acceptance of such appointment by such
         successor Calculation Agent, as hereinafter provided. The Calculation
         Agent hereunder may be removed at any time by the filing with it of an
         instrument in writing signed by or on behalf of the Company and

                                                                               3


         specifying such removal and the date when it shall become effective.
         Such resignation or removal shall take effect upon the appointment by
         the Company, as hereinafter provided, of a successor Calculation Agent
         and the acceptance of such appointment by such successor Calculation
         Agent. In the event a successor Calculation Agent has not been
         appointed and has not accepted its duties within 90 days of the
         Calculation Agent's notice of resignation, the Calculation Agent may
         apply to any court of competent jurisdiction for the designation of a
         successor Calculation Agent.

                  (b) In case at any time the Calculation Agent shall resign, or
         shall be removed, or shall become incapable of acting, or shall be
         adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or make an assignment for the benefit
         of its creditors or consent to the appointment of a receiver or
         custodian of all or any substantial part of its property, or shall
         admit in writing its inability to pay or meet its debts as they mature,
         or if a receiver or custodian of it or all or any substantial part of
         its property shall be appointed, or if any public officer shall have
         taken charge or control of the Calculation Agent or of its property or
         affairs, for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or
         liquidation, a successor Calculation Agent shall be appointed by the
         Company by an instrument in writing, filed with the successor
         Calculation Agent. Upon the appointment as aforesaid of a successor
         Calculation Agent and acceptance by the latter of such appointment, the
         Calculation Agent so superseded shall cease to be Calculation Agent
         hereunder.

                  (c) Any successor Calculation Agent appointed hereunder shall
         execute, acknowledge and deliver to its predecessor, to the Company and
         to the Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder and
         agreeing to be bound by the terms hereof, and thereupon such successor
         Calculation Agent, without any further act, deed or conveyance, shall
         become vested with all the authority, rights, powers, trusts,
         immunities, duties and obligations of such predecessor with like effect
         as if originally named as Calculation Agent hereunder, and such
         predecessor, upon payment of its charges and disbursements then unpaid,
         shall thereupon become obligated to transfer, deliver and pay over, and
         such successor Calculation Agent shall be entitled to receive, all
         moneys, securities and other property on deposit with or held by such
         predecessor, as Calculation Agent hereunder.

                  (d) Any corporation into which the Calculation Agent hereunder
         may be merged or converted or any corporation with which the
         Calculation Agent may be consolidated, or any corporation resulting
         from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Calculation
         Agent shall be a party, or any corporation to which the Calculation
         Agent shall sell or otherwise transfer all or substantially all of the
         assets and business of the Calculation Agent shall be the successor
         Calculation Agent under this Agreement without the execution or filing
         of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties
         hereto.

                  7. Certain Definitions. Terms not otherwise defined herein or

         Securities.

                  8. Indemnification. The Company will indemnify the Calculation
         Agent against any losses or liability which it may incur or sustain in
         connection with its appointment or the exercise of its powers and
         duties hereunder except such as may result from the gross negligence or
         willful misconduct of the Calculation Agent or any of its agents or
         employees.

<PAGE>


                                     ANNEX A

               1. The Index.

                  The Index is the Russell 2000 Index (the "Index"), as
calculated, published and disseminated by Frank Russell Company ("Russell").

               2. Determination of the Maturity Payment Amount.

                  The Calculation Agent shall, at the request of the Trustee,
determine the amount payable on the Stated Maturity Date for each $1,000
principal amount of Securities (the "Maturity Payment Amount").

                  The Maturity Payment Amount shall be the following:

                  o   If the Final Index Level is greater than or equal to the
                      Initial Index Level, the sum of:

                      (1) $1,000; and

                                                    Final Index   Initial Index
                                      Upside          Level     -      Level
                      (2) $1,000 x Participation x  ---------------------------
                                       Rate              Initial Index Level




                  o   If the Final Index Level is less than the Initial Index
                      Level and the Closing Index Level is at or above the
                      Threshold Level on all Exchange Business Days during the
                      Measurement Period, $1,000.

                  o   If the Final Index Level is less than the Initial Index
                      Level and the Closing Index Level has fallen below the
                      Threshold Level on any Exchange Business Day during the
                      Measurement Period, the product of:

                      (1) $1,000; and

                      (2)  Final Index Level
                          -------------------
                          Initial Index Level


                3. Discontinuance of the Index.

                  (a) If Russell discontinues publication of the Index and
Russell or another entity publishes a successor or substitute index (the
"Successor Index") that the Calculation Agent determines, in its sole discretion
exercised in good faith, to be comparable to the discontinued Index, then the
Calculation Agent shall determine the Closing Index Level to be used for
purposes of (a) determining whether the Closing Index Level has fallen below the
threshold level on any Exchange Business Day during the measurement period and
(b) computing the Maturity Payment Amount by reference to the Closing Index
Level of such Successor Index on the date that the Final Index Level is to be
determined.


<PAGE>
                                                                               2


                  (b) Upon any selection by the Calculation Agent of a Successor
Index, the Company shall promptly give notice to the holders of the Securities.

                  (c) If Russell discontinues publication of the Index and the
Calculation Agent determines that no Successor Index is available at such time,
or if Russell (or the publisher of any Successor Index) fails to calculate and
announce a Closing Index Level for the Index (or a Successor Index) on any date
when it would ordinarily do so in accordance with its customary practice, the
Calculation Agent will determine the Closing Index Level to be used for purposes
of (a) determining whether the Closing Index Level has fallen below the
threshold level on any Exchange Business Day during the measurement period and
(b) computing the amount payable on the Stated Maturity Date. In such
circumstances, the Closing Index Level will be computed by the Calculation Agent
in accordance with the formula for and method of calculating the Index (or any
Successor Index) last in effect prior to such discontinuance, using the Closing
Index Level (or, if trading in any of the relevant securities has been
materially suspended or materially limited, its good faith estimate of the
Closing Index Level that would have prevailed but for such suspension or
limitation) at the close of the principal trading session on such date of each
security most recently comprising the Index (or any Successor Index) on the
Relevant Exchange on which such Security trades.

               4. Alteration of Method of Calculation.

                  If at any time the method of calculating the Index, any
Successor Index, or the Closing Index Level on any particular day, is changed in
a material respect, or if the Index or a Successor Index is in any other way
modified so that such Index does not, in the opinion of the Calculation Agent,
fairly represent the value of the Index or such Successor Index had such changes
or modifications not been made, then, from and after such time, the Calculation
Agent will, at the Close of Trading of the Relevant Exchanges on which the
securities comprising the Index or such Successor Index traded on any date the
Closing Index Level is to be determined, make such calculations and adjustments
as, in the good faith judgment of the Calculation Agent, may be necessary in
order to arrive at a level of a stock index comparable to the Index or such
Successor Index, as the case may be, as if such changes or modifications had not
been made. The Calculation Agent will calculate the Closing Index Level on any
particular day and the Maturity Payment Amount with reference to the Index or
such Successor Index, as adjusted. Accordingly, if the method of calculating the
Index or a Successor Index is modified so that the level of such index is a
fraction of what it would have been if it had not been modified (for example,
due to a split in the index), then the Calculation Agent shall adjust such index
in order to arrive at a level of the Index or such Successor Index as if it had
not been modified (for example, if such split had not occurred).

               5. Definitions.

                  Set forth below are the terms used in the Agreement and in

relevant percentage contribution of a security to the level of the Index or any
Successor Index will be based on a comparison of (x) the portion of the level of
the Index attributable to that security and (y) the overall level of the Index,
