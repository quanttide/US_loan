                               Reverse of Security

                  This Security is one of a duly authorized series of Securities
of the Company designated as Index-Plus Notes Due December 23, 2009, Performance
Linked to Russell 2000(R) Index (RTY) (herein called the "Securities"). The
Company may, without the consent of the holders of the Securities, create and
issue additional notes ranking equally with the Securities and otherwise similar
in all respects so that such further notes shall be consolidated and form a
single series with the Securities; provided that no additional notes can be
issued if an Event of Default has occurred with respect to the Securities. This
series of Securities is one of an indefinite number of series of debt securities
of the Company, issued and to be issued under an indenture, dated as of
September 1, 1987, as amended (herein called the "Indenture"), duly executed and
delivered by the Company and Citibank N.A., as trustee (herein called the
"Trustee", which term includes any successor trustee under the Indenture), to
which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made
for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of the
Securities.

                  The Maturity Payment Amount, at the request of the Trustee,
shall be determined by the Calculation Agent pursuant to the Calculation Agency
Agreement.

                  All percentages resulting from any calculation with respect to
the Securities will be rounded at the Calculation Agent's discretion.

                  The Trustee shall fully rely on the determination by the
Calculation Agent of the Maturity Payment Amount and shall have no duty to make
any such determination.

                  This Security is not subject to any sinking fund.

                  If an Event of Default with respect to the Securities shall
occur and be continuing, the amounts payable on all of the Securities may be
declared due and payable in the manner and with the effect provided in the
Indenture. The amount payable to the Holder hereof upon any acceleration
permitted under the Indenture will be equal to the Maturity Payment Amount
calculated as though the date of acceleration was the Stated Maturity Date and
the date three Business Days prior thereto was the Valuation Date.

                  The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and
the Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than 66 2/3% in
aggregate principal amount of each series of Securities at the time Outstanding
to be affected (each series voting as a class), evidenced as in the Indenture
provided, to execute supplemental indentures adding any provisions to, or
changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or
of any supplemental indenture or modifying in any manner the rights of the
holders of the Securities of all such series; provided, however, that no such
supplemental indenture shall, among other things, (i) change the fixed maturity
of any Security, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce the rate or
extend the time of payment of interest thereon, if any, or reduce any premium
payable on redemption, or make the principal thereof, or premium, if any, or
interest thereon, if any, payable in any coin or currency other than that
hereinabove provided, without the consent of

                                                                               5


the holder of each Security so affected, or (ii) change the place of payment on
any Security, or impair the right to institute suit for payment on any Security,
or reduce the aforesaid percentage of Securities, the holders of which are
required to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of
the holders of each Security so affected. It is also provided in the Indenture
that, prior to any declaration accelerating the maturity of any series of
Securities, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Securities of such series Outstanding may on behalf of the holders of all the
Securities of such series waive any past default or Event of Default under the
Indenture with respect to such series and its consequences, except a default in
the payment of interest, if any, or the principal of, or premium, if any, on any
of the Securities of such series, or in the payment of any sinking fund
installment or analogous obligation with respect to Securities of such series.
Any such consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive
and binding upon such Holder and upon all future holders and owners of this
Security and any Securities which may be issued in exchange or substitution
hereof, irrespective of whether or not any notation thereof is made upon this
Security or such other Securities.

                  No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal amount with
respect to this Security.

                  The Securities are issuable in denominations of $1,000 and any
whole multiples of $1,000.

                  The Company, the Trustee, and any agent of the Company or of
the Trustee may deem and treat the registered holder (the "Holder") hereof as
the absolute owner of this Security (whether or not this Security shall be
overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing hereon),
for the purpose of receiving payment hereof, or on account hereof, and for all
other purposes and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any agent of the
Company or of the Trustee shall be affected by any notice to the contrary. All
such payments made to or upon the order of such registered holder shall, to the
extent of the sum or sums paid, effectually satisfy and discharge liability for
moneys payable on this Security.

                  No recourse for the payment of the principal of, premium, if
any, or interest on this Security, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in
respect hereof, and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or
agreement of the Company in the Indenture or any indenture supplemental thereto
or in any Security, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented
thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, officer or
director, as such, past, present or future, of the Company or of any successor
corporation, either directly or through the Company or any successor
corporation, whether by virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by
the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability
being, by the acceptance hereof and as part of the consideration for the issue
hereof, expressly waived and released.

                  As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Security is registrable in
the Security Register, upon surrender of this Security for registration of
transfer at the Corporate Trust Office or agency in a Place of Payment for this
Security, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by a written instrument of transfer
in form
