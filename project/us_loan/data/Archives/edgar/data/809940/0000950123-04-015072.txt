Except as provided in the following paragraph, the attached tables and other
statistical analyses (the "Computational Materials") are privileged and
confidential and are intended for use by the addressee only. These Computational
Materials are furnished to you solely by Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner & Smith
Incorporated ("Merrill Lynch") and not by the issuer of the securities. The
issuer of these securities has not prepared or taken part in the preparation of
these materials. None of Merrill Lynch, the issuer of the securities nor any of
their affiliates makes any representation as to the accuracy or completeness of
the information herein. The information herein is preliminary, and will be
superseded by the applicable Prospectus Supplement and by any other information
subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Except as
provided in the following paragraph, the information herein may not be provided
by the addressees to any third party other than the addressee's legal, tax,
financial and/or accounting advisors for the purposes of evaluating said
material.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, except to the extent
necessary to comply with applicable securities laws, any recipient of these
Computational Materials (and each employee, representative or other agent of the
recipient) may disclose to any and all persons, without limitation of any kind,
the federal income tax treatment and tax structure of the issuer and the
certificates, any fact relevant to understanding the federal tax treatment or
tax structure of the issuer or the certificates, and all materials of any kind
(including opinions and other tax analyses) relating to such federal tax
treatment or tax structure other than the identity of the issuer and information
that would permit the identification of the issuer.

Numerous assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials which
may or may not be stated therein. As such, no assurance can be given as to the
accuracy, appropriateness or completeness of the Computational Materials in any
particular context; or as to whether the Computational Materials and/or the
assumptions upon which they are based reflect present market conditions or
future market performance. These Computational Materials should not be construed
as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or accounting
advice.

Any yields or weighted average lives shown in the Computational Materials are
based on prepayment assumptions and actual prepayment experience may
dramatically affect such yields or weighted average lives. In addition, it is
possible that prepayments on the underlying assets will occur at rates slower or
faster than the rates assumed in the attached Computational Materials.
Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, the Computational Materials assume no
losses on the underlying assets and no interest shortfall. The specific
characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the
Computational Materials due to differences between the actual underlying assets
and the hypothetical assets used in preparing the Computational Materials. The
principal amount and designation of any security described in the Computational
Materials are subject to change prior to issuance.

Although a registration statement (including the prospectus) relating to the
securities discussed in this communication has been filed with the Securities
and Exchange Commission and is effective, the final prospectus supplement
relating to the securities discussed in this communication has not been filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission. This communication shall not
constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of any offer to buy nor shall
there be any sale of the securities discussed in this communication in any state
in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to
registration or qualification under the securities laws of any such state.
