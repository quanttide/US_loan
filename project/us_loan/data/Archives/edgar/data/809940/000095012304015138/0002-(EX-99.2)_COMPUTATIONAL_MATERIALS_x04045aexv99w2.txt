                         SERIES 2004-FFC

OPTIONAL          The Trustee will be required to effect an auction of the
TERMINATION       assets of the Trust Fund when the aggregate stated principal
                  balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than or equal to 10% of
                  the aggregate stated principal balance of the Mortgage Loans
                  as of the Cut-Off Date. The auction will be effected via a
                  solicitation of bids from at least three bidders. Any such
                  auction will result in the termination of the Trust Fund only
                  if the highest bid received is at least equal to the sum of
                  (i) the aggregate outstanding principal balance of the
                  Certificates, plus accrued interest on the Certificates, (ii)
                  any unreimbursed out-of-pocket costs and expenses and the
                  principal portion of Advances, in each case previously
                  incurred by the Servicer in the performance of its servicing
                  obligations, (iii) certain amounts described in the Prospectus
                  Supplement, and (iv) the costs incurred by the Trustee in
                  connection with such auction.

MORTGAGE LOANS    As of the Cut-Off Date, the mortgage pool will consist
                  of fixed rate, fully amortizing and balloon, second lien
                  residential mortgage loans ("Mortgage Loans") serviced by
                  Wilshire Credit Corporation. The information described herein
                  is based on a pool of Mortgage Loans having an aggregate
                  principal balance of approximately $397,867,023, as of the
                  Cut-Off Date.

TOTAL DEAL SIZE   Approximately $357,682,000

ADMINISTRATIVE    The Servicer and Trustee will be paid fees aggregating 52 bps
FEES              per annum (payable monthly) on the stated principal balance of
                  the Mortgage Loans.

CREDIT            1.  Excess interest
ENHANCEMENTS      2.  Over-Collateralization
                  3.  Subordination

EXCESS INTEREST   Excess interest cashflow will be available as credit
                  enhancement.

OVER-             The over-collateralization ("O/C") amount is equal to the
COLLATERALIZATION excess of the aggregate principal balance of the Mortgage
                  Loans over the aggregate principal balance of the
                  Certificates. On the Closing Date, the over-collateralization
                  amount will equal approximately 3.25% of the aggregate
                  principal balance of the Mortgage Loans. On each distribution
                  date, the trust fund will apply some or all of the Excess

INTEREST ACCRUAL  Interest will initially accrue from the Closing Date to (but
                  excluding) the first Distribution Date, and thereafter, from
                  the prior Distribution Date to (but excluding) the current
                  Distribution Date.

COUPON STEP UP    If the 10% optional termination does not occur prior
                  to the first distribution date on which it is possible, (i)
                  the margin on the Class A Certificates will increase to 2x its
                  respective margin, and (ii) the margin on each of the Class M
                  and Class B Certificates will increase to 1.5x its respective
                  margin.

AVAILABLE         The pass-through rates of the Certificates will be subject to
FUNDS CAP         the "Available Funds Cap" which is a per annum rate equal to
                  12 times the quotient of (x) the total scheduled interest on
                  the mortgage loans based on the net mortgage rates in effect
                  on the related due date, divided by (y) the aggregate
                  principal balance of the Certificates as of the first day of
                  the applicable accrual period multiplied by 30 and divided by
                  the actual number of days in the related accrual period.
                  Reimbursement for shortfalls arising as a result of the
                  application of the Available Funds Cap will be paid only on a
                  subordinated basis. "Net Mortgage Rate" means, with respect to
                  any mortgage loan the mortgage rate less the administrative
                  fees.

(1)The subordination includes the target over-collateralization level of
approximately 6.25%.

NET WAC           For any Distribution Date, a per annum rate equal to 12
                  times the quotient obtained by dividing (x) the total
                  scheduled interest on the mortgage loans based on the net
                  mortgage rates in effect on the related due date, by (y) the
                  aggregate stated principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of
                  the preceding Distribution Date.

SHORTFALL         If on any Distribution Date the pass-through rate of any Class
REIMBURSEMENT     is limited by the Available Funds Cap, the excess of (i) the
                  amount of interest such Class was entitled to receive on such
                  Distribution Date had the applicable Pass-Through Rate not
                  been subject to the Available Funds Cap, over (ii) the amount
                  of interest such Class of Certificates was entitled to receive
                  on such Distribution Date based on the Available Funds Cap,
                  together with the aggregate of such shortfalls from previous
                  Distribution Dates together (and accrued interest thereon at
                  the applicable pass-through rate, without giving effect to the
                  Available Funds Cap) will be carried over to the next
                  Distribution Date until paid (herein referred to as
                  "Carryover"). Such reimbursement will be paid only on a
                  subordinated basis. No such Carryover with respect to a Class
                  will be paid to such Class once the Certificate principal
                  balance thereof has been reduced to zero.

PRINCIPAL PAYDOWN

IF THE SUBORDINATE CLASS PRINCIPAL DISTRIBUTION TEST IS NOT MET:

      All scheduled and unscheduled principal received from the Mortgage Loans
      plus excess spread to the extent distributable as principal to replenish
      O/C to the required level will be paid to the Class A Certificates.

      After the Certificate principal balance of the Class A Certificates has
      been reduced to zero, the amounts remaining referred to above, will be
      distributed sequentially to the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class
      M-4, Class B-1, Class B-2, Class B-3 and Class B-4 Certificates.

IF THE SUBORDINATE CLASS PRINCIPAL DISTRIBUTION TEST IS MET:

All Certificates will be entitled to receive payments of principal, in the
following order of priority: first to the Class A Certificates, second to the
Class M-1 Certificates, third to the Class M-2 Certificates, fourth to the Class
M-3 Certificates, fifth to the Class M-4 Certificates, sixth to the Class B-1
Certificates, seventh to the Class B-2 Certificates, eighth to the Class B-3
Certificates, and ninth to the Class B-4 Certificates in each case up to amounts
necessary to maintain the subordination for each class at its required level.
Such required levels of subordination are approximately as follows:

<TABLE>
<S>               <C>
CLASS A           72.30%*
CLASS M-1         51.70%*

The tables below display the Constant Default Rate ("CDR"), and the related
cumulative collateral loss, that can be sustained without the referenced Class
incurring a writedown. Calculations are run to maturity at both static (1ML =
2.2581%) and forward LIBOR. Other assumptions include: (1) prepayment speed at
30% CPR, (2) 0 month lag from default to loss, (3) 100% P&I advancing, (4)
triggers fail (i.e., no stepdown), (5) 100% loss severity:

                                  EXCESS SPREAD

The table below displays excess spread in bps. Calculations are run to call at
both static (1ML = 2.2581%) and forward LIBOR. Excess spread means the per annum
rate equal to 12 times the quotient of (x) the difference between (a) the total
scheduled interest of the mortgage loans based on the Net Mortgage Rates in
effect on the related due date minus (b) the total interest due on the
Certificates, divided by (y) the aggregate principal balance of the Certificates
as of the first day of the applicable accrual period multiplied by 30 and
divided by the actual number of days in the related accrual period. Other
assumptions include: (1) prepayment speed is 30% CPR, (2) no defaults and no
losses:
