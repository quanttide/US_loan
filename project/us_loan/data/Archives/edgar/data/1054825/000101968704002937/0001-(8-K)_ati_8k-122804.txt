ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS

LTDnetwork, Inc. ("LTDN"), a subsidiary of Advanced Technology Industries, Inc.
("ATI"), recently signed a licensing agreement with V2 Records, Inc. ("V2"), one
of the United Kingdom's largest independent record labels and a member of the
Virgin group of companies, that provides for V2's extensive library of music
files to be available for download on LTDN's Qtrax service.

ATI believes that Qtrax, a unique music file sharing technology based Internet
service, will be the first music file sharing application that provides
consumers the ability, at no charge, to download music files from the Gnutella
peer to peer network with the permission of the record companies that own the
rights to such music to the extent that such record companies have executed
licensing agreements with LTDN. This revolutionary free service will allow a
consumer to play the music files only on the computer such consumer uses to
download such music files. QTrax will also operate as an online music store
where a consumer can purchase music files as a permanent download so that the
consumer can play such music files on any device that plays MP3 files. Through
the integration of LTDN's innovative Xpeer software application as part of the
Qtrax service, LTDN will be able to offer online e-tailers, advertising, media
and marketing companies the ability to provide highly targeted advertising,
promotional and other marketing information to consumers who may have a strong
interest in such advertisers' products. For example, if a consumer downloads
music files of a particular artist, Xpeer will display books, music and other
products that feature such artist.

It is currently anticipated that the Qtrax service will officially be launched
in January 2005.
