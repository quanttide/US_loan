ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
ITEM 2.03.  CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL  OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN
            OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.
ITEM 3.02.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         On December 14, 2004,  Tarrant  Apparel Group  completed its previously
announced  $10  million  financing  through  the  issuance  of  (i)  6%  Secured
Convertible  Debentures and (ii) Warrants to purchase up to 1,250,000  shares of
our Common Stock.  Prior to maturity,  the investors may convert the  Debentures
into shares of our Common Stock at a price of $2.00 per share. The Warrants have
a term of five years and an exercise  price of $2.50 per share.  The  Debentures
bear interest at a rate of 6% per annum and have a term of three years.

         We sold these securities to the following investors: The Runnels Family
Trust DTD 1-11-2000, High Tide, LLC, Bear Stearns Securities Corp. Custodian FBO
J. Steven  Emerson Roth IRA,  Bear Stearns  Securities  Corp.  Custodian  FBO J.
Steven Emerson IRA II, Bristol Investment Fund, Ltd., MM & B Holdings,  Freedman
Leff  Investment  Partnership,  Bank  Insinger de Beaufort  Safe Custody NV, JMG
Triton Offshore Fund, Ltd., JMB Capital Partners and JMG Capital Partners LP. No
other  material  relationships  exist  between  the  Company  and  each of these
investors.

         The  Debentures  contain  customary  events of  default  and permit the
holders thereof to accelerate the maturity of the full principal amount together
with  interest and other  amounts  owing upon the  occurrence  of such events of
default.  Additionally,  upon a holder's election to accelerate  payment, we are
obligated to pay 120% of the principal  amount of the Debenture plus all accrued
and unpaid  interest  thereon,  or, in the  absence of certain  conditions,  the
greater of the  preceding  amount and the amount such holder  would  receive had
such holder  converted the Debenture and sold the underlying  shares at the then
current  market price.  The  Debentures  are secured by a  subordinated  lien on
certain of our accounts receivable and related assets.

         We have agreed to file with the SEC a  registration  statement  for the
resale of the restricted  shares of our Common Stock issuable upon conversion of
the Secured Convertible Debentures and exercise of the Warrants.

         T. R. Winston & Company acted as placement agent in the financing.  For
its services,  we paid the placement agent an aggregate of $600,000 in cash, and
issued to them five-year warrants to purchase up to 200,000 shares of our common
stock at an exercise price of $2.50 per share.

         Each of the  investors  in the  financing  and T. R.  Winston & Company
represented  to us that  such  party was an  "accredited  investor"  within  the
meaning of Rule 501 of Regulation D under the  Securities  Act of 1933, and that
such investor was receiving the  securities for investment and not in connection
with a  distribution  thereof.  The  issuance and sale of these  securities  was
exempt  from  the  registration  and  prospectus  delivery  requirements  of the
Securities  Act  pursuant  to Section  4(2) of the  Securities  Act and Rule 506
thereunder as a transaction not involving any public offering.
