                          COMMON STOCK PURCHASE WARRANT

                  To Purchase 200,000 Shares of Common Stock of

                              TARRANT APPAREL GROUP

                  THIS COMMON STOCK PURCHASE  WARRANT (the "WARRANT")  certifies
that,  for value  received,  T.R.  Winston &  Company,  LLC (the  "HOLDER"),  is
entitled,  upon the terms and subject to the  limitations  on  exercise  and the
conditions  hereinafter  set forth,  at any time on or after June 14,  2005 (the
"INITIAL  EXERCISE  DATE") and on or prior to the close of  business on the five
year anniversary of the Initial Exercise Date (the  "TERMINATION  Date") but not
thereafter,  to  subscribe  for and  purchase  from  Tarrant  Apparel  Group,  a
California  corporation  (the "COMPANY"),  up to Two Hundred Thousand  (200,000)
shares (the "WARRANT  SHARES") of Common Stock,  no par value per share,  of the
Company (the "COMMON  STOCK").  The purchase  price of one share of Common Stock
under this Warrant shall be equal to the Exercise  Price,  as defined in Section
2(b).

         SECTION  1.  DEFINITIONS.  Capitalized  terms  used  and not  otherwise
defined  herein shall have the  meanings  set forth in that  certain  Securities
Purchase Agreement (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), dated December 6, 2004, among the
Company and the purchasers signatory thereto.

         SECTION 2.   EXERCISE.

                  a)       EXERCISE OF WARRANT.  Exercise of the purchase rights
         represented  by this  Warrant  may be made at any  time or  times on or
         after the Initial  Exercise Date and on or before the Termination  Date
         by  delivery to the Company of a duly  executed  facsimile  copy of the
         Notice of Exercise Form annexed  hereto (or such other office or agency
         of  the  Company  as it may  designate  by  notice  in  writing  to the
         registered  Holder at the address of such Holder appearing on the books
         of the Company);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, within 5 Trading Days of the date
         said Notice of Exercise is delivered  to the Company,


<PAGE>


         the Holder shall have  surrendered  this Warrant to the Company and the
         Company shall have received payment of the aggregate  Exercise Price of
         the shares thereby  purchased by wire transfer or cashier's check drawn
         on a United States bank.

                  b)       EXERCISE  PRICE.  The  exercise  price of the  Common
         Stock  under  this  Warrant  shall  be  $2.50,  subject  to  adjustment
         hereunder (the "EXERCISE PRICE").

                  c)       CASHLESS EXERCISE. If at any time after one year from
         the date of issuance of this Warrant there is no effective Registration
         Statement  registering  the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder,
         then  this  Warrant  may also be  exercised  at such time by means of a
         "cashless  exercise" in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a
         certificate  for the number of  Warrant  Shares  equal to the  quotient
         obtained by dividing [(A-B) (X)] by (A), where:

                  (A) =    the VWAP on the Trading Day immediately preceding the
                           date of such election;

                  (B) =    the Exercise Price of this Warrant, as adjusted; and

                  (X) =    the number of Warrant Shares  issuable upon  exercise
                           of this Warrant in accordance  with the terms of this
                           Warrant  by means of a cash  exercise  rather  than a
                           cashless exercise.

                  Notwithstanding  anything  herein  to  the  contrary,  on  the
         Termination  Date,  this Warrant shall be  automatically  exercised via
         cashless exercise pursuant to this Section 2(c).

                  d)       EXERCISE LIMITATIONS.

                           i.       HOLDER'S RESTRICTIONS.  The Holder shall not
                  have the  right  to  exercise  any  portion  of this  Warrant,
                  pursuant  to Section  2(c) or  otherwise,  to the extent  that
                  after  giving  effect to such  issuance  after  exercise,  the
                  Holder (together with the Holder's  affiliates),  as set forth
                  on the applicable Notice of Exercise,  would  beneficially own
                  in excess of 4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock
                  outstanding  immediately after giving effect to such issuance.
                  For purposes of the foregoing  sentence,  the number of shares
                  of  Common  Stock  beneficially  owned by the  Holder  and its
                  affiliates  shall include the number of shares of Common Stock
                  issuable  upon  exercise of this Warrant with respect to which
                  the  determination  of such sentence is being made,  but shall
                  exclude  the number of shares of Common  Stock  which would be
                  issuable  upon (A)  exercise  of the  remaining,  nonexercised
                  portion of this  Warrant  beneficially  owned by the Holder or
                  any of its  affiliates  and (B) exercise or  conversion of the
                  unexercised or nonconverted portion of any other securities of
                  the  Company  (including,   without   limitation,   any  other
                  Debentures or Warrants)  subject to a limitation on conversion
                  or  exercise  analogous  to the  limitation  contained  herein
                  beneficially  owned by the  Holder  or any of


                                        2
<PAGE>


                  its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding sentence,
                  for purposes of this  Section  2(d)(i),  beneficial  ownership
                  shall be calculated  in  accordance  with Section 13(d) of the
                  Exchange Act, it being acknowledged by Holder that the Company
                  is not  representing  to Holder  that such  calculation  is in
                  compliance  with Section  13(d) of the Exchange Act and Holder
                  is solely  responsible for any schedules  required to be filed
                  in  accordance  therewith.  To the extent that the  limitation
                  contained in this Section 2(d)(i) applies,  the  determination
                  of whether this Warrant is  exercisable  (in relation to other
                  securities owned by the Holder) and of which a portion of this
                  Warrant is exercisable shall be in the sole discretion of such
                  Holder,  and the  submission of a Notice of Exercise  shall be
                  deemed  to be such  Holder's  determination  of  whether  this
                  Warrant is exercisable (in relation to other  securities owned
                  by such  Holder)  and of  which  portion  of this  Warrant  is
                  exercisable, in each case subject to such aggregate percentage
                  limitation, and the Company shall have no obligation to verify
                  or confirm the accuracy of such determination. For purposes of
                  this Section 2(d)(i), in determining the number of outstanding
                  shares of Common  Stock,  the Holder may rely on the number of
                  outstanding  shares of Common  Stock as  reflected  in (x) the
                  Company's  most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as the case may
                  be, (y) a more recent  public  announcement  by the Company or
                  (z) any other notice by the Company or the Company's  Transfer
                  Agent  setting  forth the  number  of  shares of Common  Stock
                  outstanding.  Upon the written or oral  request of the Holder,
                  the Company  shall within two Trading Days confirm  orally and
                  in writing to the Holder the number of shares of Common  Stock
                  then  outstanding.  In any case,  the  number  of  outstanding
                  shares of Common Stock shall be determined after giving effect
                  to the  conversion  or exercise of  securities of the Company,
                  including this Warrant,  by the Holder or its affiliates since
                  the date as of which  such  number  of  outstanding  shares of
                  Common  Stock was  reported.  The  provisions  of this Section
                  2(d)(i) may be waived by the Holder  upon,  at the election of
                  the  Holder,  not  less  than 61  days'  prior  notice  to the
                  Company,  and the  provisions  of this Section  2(d)(i)  shall
                  continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later date,  as
                  determined  by the Holder,  as may be specified in such notice
                  of waiver).

                           ii.      [INTENTIONALLY DELETED]

                  e)       MECHANICS OF EXERCISE.

                           i.       AUTHORIZATION OF WARRANT SHARES. The Company
                  covenants that all Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the
                  exercise of the purchase  rights  represented  by this Warrant
                  will, upon exercise of the purchase rights represented by this
                  Warrant,  be duly authorized,  validly issued,  fully paid and
                  nonassessable  and free from all taxes,  liens and  charges in
                  respect of the issue  thereof  (other than taxes in respect of
                  any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such issue).

                           ii.      DELIVERY  OF  CERTIFICATES   UPON  EXERCISE.
                  Certificates   for  shares   purchased   hereunder   shall  be
                  transmitted by the transfer agent of the Company to the Holder
                  by crediting the account of the Holder's prime broker with the
                  Depository Trust Company through its Deposit  Withdrawal Agent
                  Commission  ("DWAC") system if the Company is a participant in
                  such system, and otherwise by physical delivery to the address
                  specified  by the  Holder in the Notice of  Exercise  within 3
                  Trading Days from the delivery to the Company of the Notice of
                  Exercise  Form,  surrender  of this Warrant and payment of the
                  aggregate  Exercise Price as set forth above  ("WARRANT  SHARE
                  DELIVERY  DATE").  This  Warrant  shall be deemed to have been
                  exercised  on the date the  Exercise  Price is received by the
                  Company.  The  Warrant  Shares  shall be  deemed  to have been
                  issued,  and Holder or any other  person so  designated  to be
                  named  therein  shall be  deemed  to have  become a holder  of
                  record of such  shares  for all  purposes,  as of the date the
                  Warrant  has been  exercised  by payment to the Company of the
                  Exercise  Price  and  all  taxes  required  to be  paid by the
                  Holder,  if any,  pursuant to Section  2(e)(vii)  prior to the
                  issuance of such shares, have been paid.

                           iii.     DELIVERY OF NEW WARRANTS UPON  EXERCISE.  If
                  this Warrant  shall have been  exercised in part,  the Company
                  shall,   at  the  time  of  delivery  of  the  certificate  or
                  certificates  representing Warrant Shares, deliver to Holder a
                  new Warrant  evidencing  the rights of Holder to purchase  the
                  unpurchased  Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant,  which
                  new Warrant shall in all other respects be identical with this
                  Warrant.

                           iv.      RESCISSION  RIGHTS.  If the Company fails to
                  cause  its  transfer   agent  to  transmit  to  the  Holder  a
                  certificate or  certificates  representing  the Warrant Shares
                  pursuant  to  this  Section  2(e)(iv)  by  the  Warrant  Share
                  Delivery Date,  then the Holder shall be entitled,  by written
                  notice to the  Company at any time on or before  the  Holder's
                  receipt of such certificate or  certificates,  to rescind such
                  exercise.

                           v.       COMPENSATION FOR BUY-IN ON FAILURE TO TIMELY
                  DELIVER  CERTIFICATES UPON EXERCISE.  In addition to any other
                  rights available to the Holder,  if the Company fails to cause
                  its transfer  agent to transmit to the Holder a certificate or
                  certificates  representing  the Warrant Shares  pursuant to an
                  exercise  on or before the fourth  Trading Day  following  the
                  Warrant Share Delivery Date, and if after such date the Holder
                  is  required  by its  broker to  purchase  (in an open  market
                  transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in
                  satisfaction  of a sale by the  Holder of the  Warrant  Shares
                  which the Holder  anticipated  receiving upon such exercise (a
                  "BUY-IN"),  then  the  Company  shall  (1)  pay in cash to the
                  Holder the  amount by which (x) the  Holder's  total  purchase
                  price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares
                  of Common Stock so purchased  exceeds (y) the amount  obtained
                  by multiplying (A)


                                       4
<PAGE>


                  the number of Warrant  Shares that the Company was required to
                  deliver to the Holder in connection with the exercise at issue
                  times  (B) the price at which the sell  order  giving  rise to
                  such purchase  obligation was executed,  and (2) at the option
                  of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and
                  equivalent  number of Warrant  Shares for which such  exercise
                  was not  honored or deliver to the Holder the number of shares
                  of Common  Stock that would have been  issued had the  Company
                  timely  complied  with its exercise  and delivery  obligations
                  hereunder.  For example,  if the Holder purchases Common Stock
                  having a total  purchase  price of  $11,000  to cover a Buy-In
                  with  respect  to an  attempted  exercise  of shares of Common
                  Stock  with  an  aggregate  sale  price  giving  rise  to such
                  purchase  obligation  of  $10,000,  under  clause  (1)  of the
                  immediately  preceding  sentence the Company shall be required
                  to pay the Holder $1,000. The Holder shall provide the Company
                  written notice indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in
                  respect of the Buy-In, together with applicable  confirmations
                  and  other  evidence  reasonably  requested  by  the  Company.
                  Nothing  herein  shall  limit a  Holder's  right to pursue any
                  other remedies available to it hereunder,  at law or in equity
                  including,   without   limitation,   a  decree   of   specific
                  performance  and/or  injunctive  relief  with  respect  to the
                  Company's failure to timely deliver certificates  representing
                  shares  of  Common  Stock  upon  exercise  of the  Warrant  as
                  required pursuant to the terms hereof.

                           vi.      NO FRACTIONAL SHARES OR SCRIP. No fractional
                  shares or scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued
                  upon the  exercise of this  Warrant.  As to any  fraction of a
                  share which  Holder  would  otherwise  be entitled to purchase
                  upon such exercise, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in
                  respect  of such  final  fraction  in an amount  equal to such
                  fraction multiplied by the Exercise Price.

                           vii.     CHARGES,  TAXES AND  EXPENSES.  Issuance  of
                  certificates  for Warrant  Shares shall be made without charge
                  to  the  Holder  for  any  issue  or  transfer  tax  or  other
                  incidental   expense  in  respect  of  the  issuance  of  such
                  certificate,  all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by
                  the Company, and such certificates shall be issued in the name
                  of the Holder or in such name or names as may be  directed  by
                  the Holder; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that in the event certificates
                  for  Warrant  Shares are to be issued in a name other than the
                  name of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise
                  shall be accompanied by the  Assignment  Form attached  hereto
                  duly executed by the Holder; and the Company may require, as a
                  condition  thereto,   the  payment  of  a  sum  sufficient  to
                  reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto.

                           viii.    CLOSING OF BOOKS. The Company will not close
                  its stockholder  books or records in any manner which prevents
                  the timely  exercise  of this  Warrant,  pursuant to the terms
                  hereof.

                  f)       CALL  PROVISION.  Subject to the  provisions  of this
         Section  2(f),  if after  the 12 month  anniversary  of the date of the
         Purchase  Agreement,  (i) the VWAP for each of 20  consecutive  Trading
         Days (the "MEASUREMENT  PERIOD",  which period shall not have commenced
         until after the Effective Date) exceeds $4.00 (the  "THRESHOLD  PRICE")
         and (ii) the average  daily  trading  volume for the  Threshold  Period
         exceeds  100,000  shares (both  adjusted for any stock splits,  reverse
         splits and the like occurring after the Initial  Exercise  Date),  then
         the Company  may,  within two Trading  Days of the end of such  period,
         call for cancellation of all or any portion of this Warrant for which a
         Notice of Exercise has not yet been  delivered  (such right, a "CALL").
         To exercise  this  right,  the  Company  must  deliver to the Holder an
         irrevocable  written notice (a "CALL NOTICE"),  indicating  therein the
         portion of  unexercised  portion of this  Warrant to which such  notice
         applies.  If the conditions set forth below for such Call are satisfied
         from the period from the date of the Call Notice  through and including
         the Call Date (as  defined  below),  then any  portion of this  Warrant
         subject to such Call  Notice for which a Notice of  Exercise  shall not
         have been received by the Call Date will be cancelled at 6:30 p.m. (New
         York City time) on the tenth Trading Day after the date the Call Notice
         is received by the Holder (such date, the "CALL DATE"). Any unexercised
         portion of this  Warrant to which the Call Notice does not pertain will
         be unaffected by such Call Notice. In furtherance  thereof, the Company
         covenants  and agrees that it will honor all  Notices of Exercise  with
         respect to Warrant  Shares  subject to a Call Notice that are  tendered
         through  6:30 p.m.  (New York City time) on the Call Date.  The parties
         agree that any Notice of  Exercise  delivered  following  a Call Notice
         shall first reduce to zero the number of Warrant Shares subject to such
         Call Notice prior to reducing the remaining  Warrant  Shares  available
         for purchase under this Warrant.  For example, if (x) this Warrant then
         permits  the Holder to acquire 100  Warrant  Shares,  (y) a Call Notice
         pertains  to 75 Warrant  Shares,  and (z) prior to 6:30 p.m.  (New York
         City time) on the Call Date the Holder  tenders a Notice of Exercise in
         respect of 50 Warrant Shares, then (1) on the Call Date the right under
         this  Warrant  to  acquire  25  Warrant  Shares  will be  automatically
         cancelled,  (2) the Company, in the time and manner required under this
         Warrant, will have issued and delivered to the Holder 50 Warrant Shares
         in respect of the exercises  following receipt of the Call Notice,  and
         (3) the Holder may, until the Termination  Date,  exercise this Warrant
         for 25 Warrant  Shares  (subject to adjustment  as herein  provided and
         subject to subsequent Call Notices). Subject again to the provisions of
         this Section 2(f), the Company may deliver  subsequent Call Notices for
         any  portion  of this  Warrant  for  which  the  Holder  shall not have
         delivered  a  Notice  of  Exercise.  Notwithstanding  anything  to  the
         contrary set forth in this Warrant,  the Company may not deliver a Call
         Notice or require the cancellation of this Warrant (and any Call Notice
         will be  void),  unless,  from the  beginning  of the 20th  consecutive
         Trading  Days used to  determine  whether the Common Stock has achieved
         the Threshold  Price through the Call Date,  (i) the Company shall have
         honored in  accordance  with the terms of this  Warrant  all Notices of
         Exercise  delivered by 6:30 p.m. (New York City time) on the Call Date,
         (ii) the  Registration  Statement  shall be effective as to all Warrant
         Shares and the  prospectus  thereunder  available for use by the Holder
         for the resale of all such  Warrant  Shares and (iii) the Common  Stock
         shall be  listed or quoted  for  trading  on the  Trading  Market.  The
         Company's  right to Call the Warrant  shall be exercised  ratably among
         the Holders  based on each  Holder's  initial  purchase of Common Stock
         pursuant to the Purchase Agreement.

         SECTION 3. CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS.

         a)       STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SPLITS. If the Company,  at any time while
this  Warrant is  outstanding:  (A) pays a stock  dividend or  otherwise  make a
distribution or  distributions on shares of its Common Stock or any other equity
or equity equivalent  securities  payable in shares of Common Stock (which,  for
avoidance  of doubt,  shall not include any shares of Common Stock issued by the
Company pursuant to this Warrant),  (B) subdivides  outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a larger number of shares, (C) combines  (including by way of reverse
stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
or (D) issues by  reclassification  of shares of the Common  Stock any shares of
capital  stock of the  Company,  then in each case the  Exercise  Price shall be
multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of shares of
Common Stock (excluding  treasury shares, if any) outstanding  before such event
and of which the  denominator  shall be the  number  of  shares of Common  Stock
outstanding  after such event and the number of shares issuable upon exercise of
this Warrant shall be proportionately  adjusted. Any adjustment made pursuant to
this Section 3(a) shall become effective  immediately  after the record date for
the  determination  of  stockholders   entitled  to  receive  such  dividend  or
distribution and shall become effective  immediately after the effective date in
the case of a subdivision, combination or re-classification.

         b)       SUBSEQUENT  EQUITY SALES. From the Initial Exercise Date until
the 18 month anniversary of the date of the Purchase  Agreement,  if the Company
or any  Subsidiary  thereof,  as  applicable,  at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding,  shall offer,  sell, grant any option to purchase or offer, sell or
grant any right to reprice its securities,  or otherwise dispose of or issue (or
announce any offer,  sale, grant or any option to purchase or other disposition)
any Common Stock or Common  Stock  Equivalents  entitling  any Person to acquire
shares of  Common  Stock,  at an  effective  price per share  less than the then
Exercise  Price (such lower  price,  the "BASE SHARE  PRICE" and such  issuances
collectively,  a "DILUTIVE  ISSUANCE"),  as adjusted hereunder (if the holder of
the  Common  Stock or Common  Stock  Equivalents  so  issued  shall at any time,
whether by operation of purchase price adjustments,  reset provisions,  floating
conversion,  exercise  or  exchange  prices or  otherwise,  or due to  warrants,
options or rights per share which is issued in  connection  with such  issuance,
but excluding  adjustments  resulting from customary  price-based  anti-dilution
provisions,  be entitled to receive shares of Common Stock at an effective price
per share which is less than the Exercise  Price,  such issuance shall be deemed
to have occurred for less than the Exercise  Price),  then,  the Exercise  Price
shall be reduced by multiplying the Exercise Price by a fraction,  the numerator
of which is the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  issued  and  outstanding
immediately  prior to the Dilutive  Issuance plus the number of shares of Common
Stock which the aggregate consideration received or receivable by the Company in
connection  with such Dilutive  Issuance  would  purchase at the then  effective
Exercise  Price,  and the denominator of which shall be the sum of the number of
shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately prior to the Dilutive
Issuance  plus the  number of shares of Common  Stock so issued or  issuable  in
connection with the Dilutive Issuance;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, prior to the date the
Company  obtains   Shareholder   Approval  in  accordance  with  the  rules  and
regulations  of the  Trading  Market,  in no event shall the  Exercise  Price be


                                       7
<PAGE>


adjusted  under this Section 3(b) to less than $1.95,  subject to adjustment for
reverse and forward stock splits, stock dividends,  stock combinations and other
similar  transactions  of the Common  Stock  that  occur  after the date of this
Agreement (the "FLOOR  PRICE").  The Company shall notify the Holder in writing,
no later than the third  Trading Day  following the issuance of any Common Stock
or Common Stock  Equivalents  subject to this  section,  indicating  therein the
applicable  issuance  price,  or of  applicable  reset  price,  exchange  price,
conversion  price and other pricing  terms (such notice the  "DILUTIVE  ISSUANCE
NOTICE").  For purposes of clarification,  whether or not the Company provides a
Dilutive  Issuance  Notice pursuant to this Section 3(b), upon the occurrence of
any Dilutive  Issuance,  after the date of such Dilutive  Issuance the Holder is
entitled to receive a number of Warrant  Shares  based upon the Base Share Price
regardless  of whether the Holder  accurately  refers to the Base Share Price in
the Notice of Exercise.

         c)       INTENTIONALLY OMITTED.

         d)       FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTION. If, at any time while this Warrant is
outstanding,  (A) the Company effects any merger or consolidation of the Company
with  or into  another  Person,  (B)  the  Company  effects  any  sale of all or
substantially all of its assets in one or a series of related transactions,  (C)
any tender offer or exchange offer (whether by the Company or another Person) is
completed  pursuant to which  holders of Common Stock are permitted to tender or
exchange their shares for other securities, cash or property, or (D) the Company
effects  any  reclassification  of the  Common  Stock  or any  compulsory  share
exchange  pursuant to which the Common Stock is  effectively  converted  into or
exchanged  for  other  securities,  cash  or  property  (in  any  such  case,  a
"FUNDAMENTAL  TRANSACTION"),  then,  upon  any  subsequent  conversion  of  this
Warrant, the Holder shall have the right to receive, for each Warrant Share that
would have been issuable upon such exercise absent such Fundamental Transaction,
at the option of the Holder,  (a) upon exercise of this  Warrant,  the number of
shares of Common  Stock of the  successor  or  acquiring  corporation  or of the
Company,  if  it is  the  surviving  corporation,  and  Alternate  Consideration
receivable upon or as a result of such reorganization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation  or  disposition  of assets by a Holder of the number of shares of
Common Stock for which this  Warrant is  exercisable  immediately  prior to such
event or (b) if the Company is acquired in an all cash  transaction,  cash equal
to the value of this Warrant as determined in accordance with the  Black-Scholes
option pricing formula (the "ALTERNATE CONSIDERATION"). For purposes of any such
exercise,  the  determination  of the  Exercise  Price  shall  be  appropriately
adjusted  to apply  to such  Alternate  Consideration  based  on the  amount  of
Alternate Consideration issuable in respect of one share of Common Stock in such
Fundamental  Transaction,  and the Company shall  apportion  the Exercise  Price
among the Alternate Consideration in a reasonable manner reflecting the relative
value of any different components of the Alternate Consideration.  If holders of
Common Stock are given any choice as to the  securities,  cash or property to be
received in a Fundamental  Transaction,  then the Holder shall be given the same
choice as to the Alternate  Consideration  it receives upon any exercise of this
Warrant  following  such  Fundamental  Transaction.  To the extent  necessary to
effectuate the foregoing  provisions,  any successor to the Company or surviving
entity in such Fundamental  Transaction  shall issue to the Holder a new warrant
consistent  with the foregoing  provisions  and evidencing the Holder's right to
exercise


                                       8
<PAGE>


such warrant into Alternate  Consideration.  The terms of any agreement pursuant
to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected shall include terms requiring any
such successor or surviving entity to comply with the provisions of this Section
3(d) and insuring that this Warrant (or any such  replacement  security) will be
similarly  adjusted upon any subsequent  transaction  analogous to a Fundamental
Transaction.

         e)       EXEMPT   ISSUANCE.    Notwithstanding   the   foregoing,    no
adjustments,  Alternate  Consideration nor notices shall be made, paid or issued
under this Section 3 in respect of an Exempt Issuance.

         f)       CALCULATIONS.  All calculations  under this Section 3 shall be
made to the nearest cent or the nearest  1/100th of a share, as the case may be.
The  number of shares of Common  Stock  outstanding  at any given time shall not
includes  shares  of Common  Stock  owned or held by or for the  account  of the
Company,  and the  description  of any such  shares  of  Common  Stock  shall be
considered on issue or sale of Common Stock. For purposes of this Section 3, the
number of shares of Common  Stock  deemed to be issued and  outstanding  as of a
given date shall be the sum of the number of shares of Common  Stock  (excluding
treasury shares, if any) issued and outstanding.

         g)       VOLUNTARY  ADJUSTMENT BY COMPANY.  The Company may at any time
during the term of this Warrant  reduce the then current  Exercise  Price to any
amount and for any period of time deemed  appropriate  by the Board of Directors
of the Company.

         h)       NOTICE TO HOLDERS.

                  i.       ADJUSTMENT TO EXERCISE  PRICE.  Whenever the Exercise
         Price  is  adjusted  pursuant  to this  Section  3, the  Company  shall
         promptly mail to each Holder a notice  setting forth the Exercise Price
         after such  adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts
         requiring such adjustment.

                  ii.      NOTICE  TO  ALLOW  EXERCISE  BY  HOLDER.  If (A)  the
         Company  shall  declare a dividend (or any other  distribution)  on the
         Common Stock; (B) the Company shall declare a special nonrecurring cash
         dividend on or a redemption of the Common Stock;  (C) the Company shall
         authorize  the  granting to all holders of the Common  Stock  rights or
         warrants to subscribe  for or purchase  any shares of capital  stock of
         any class or of any rights; (D) the approval of any stockholders of the
         Company shall be required in connection  with any  reclassification  of
         the Common Stock, any consolidation or merger to which the Company is a
         party, any sale or transfer of all or  substantially  all of the assets
         of the Company,  of any compulsory  share  exchange  whereby the Common
         Stock is converted  into other  securities,  cash or property;  (E) the
         Company  shall  authorize  the  voluntary or  involuntary  dissolution,
         liquidation or winding up of the affairs of the Company;  then, in each
         case,  the  Company  shall cause to be mailed to the Holder at its last
         addresses as it shall appear upon the Warrant  Register of the Company,
         at least 20 calendar days prior to the  applicable  record or effective
         date  hereinafter  specified,  a notice stating


                                       9
<PAGE>


         (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for the  purpose  of such
         dividend, distribution,  redemption, rights or warrants, or if a record
         is not to be taken,  the date as of which  the  holders  of the  Common
         Stock  of  record  to be  entitled  to  such  dividend,  distributions,
         redemption,  rights or warrants are to be determined or (y) the date on
         which such reclassification,  consolidation,  merger, sale, transfer or
         share exchange is expected to become  effective or close,  and the date
         as of which it is expected  that  holders of the Common Stock of record
         shall be  entitled  to exchange  their  shares of the Common  Stock for
         securities,    cash   or   other   property   deliverable   upon   such
         reclassification,   consolidation,  merger,  sale,  transfer  or  share
         exchange;  PROVIDED, that the failure to mail such notice or any defect
         therein or in the mailing  thereof shall not affect the validity of the
         corporate action required to be specified in such notice. The Holder is
         entitled to exercise this Warrant  during the 20-day period  commencing
         the date of such notice to the effective  date of the event  triggering
         such notice.

         SECTION 4. TRANSFER OF WARRANT.

         a)       TRANSFERABILITY.  Subject to  compliance  with any  applicable
securities  laws and the  conditions  set forth in Sections 5(a) and 4(d) hereof
and to the provisions of Section 4.1 of the Purchase Agreement, this Warrant and
all rights  hereunder are  transferable,  in whole or in part, upon surrender of
this Warrant at the  principal  office of the Company,  together  with a written
assignment  of this  Warrant  substantially  in the form  attached  hereto  duly
executed by the Holder or its agent or attorney and funds  sufficient to pay any
transfer  taxes payable upon the making of such  transfer.  Upon such  surrender
and, if required,  such  payment,  the Company  shall  execute and deliver a new
Warrant  or  Warrants  in the  name  of the  assignee  or  assignees  and in the
denomination or  denominations  specified in such instrument of assignment,  and
shall issue to the assignor a new Warrant evidencing the portion of this Warrant
not so assigned,  and this Warrant shall  promptly be cancelled.  A Warrant,  if
properly assigned,  may be exercised by a new holder for the purchase of Warrant
Shares without having a new Warrant issued.

         b)       NEW  WARRANTS.  This  Warrant may be divided or combined  with
other Warrants upon presentation  hereof at the aforesaid office of the Company,
together with a written notice  specifying the names and  denominations in which
new  Warrants  are to be issued,  signed by the Holder or its agent or attorney.
Subject  to  compliance  with  Section  4(a),  as to any  transfer  which may be
involved in such division or combination,  the Company shall execute and deliver
a new Warrant or Warrants in exchange  for the Warrant or Warrants to be divided
or combined in accordance with such notice.

         c)       WARRANT  REGISTER.  The Company  shall  register this Warrant,
upon records to be  maintained  by the Company for that  purpose  (the  "WARRANT
REGISTER"),  in the name of the  record  Holder  hereof  from time to time.  The
Company may deem and treat the registered Holder of this Warrant as the absolute
owner hereof for the purpose of any exercise  hereof or any  distribution to the
Holder, and for all other purposes, absent actual notice to the contrary.


                                       10
<PAGE>


         d)       TRANSFER  RESTRICTIONS.  If, at the time of the  surrender  of
this Warrant in connection  with any transfer of this  Warrant,  the transfer of
this  Warrant  shall not be  registered  pursuant to an  effective  registration
statement under the Securities Act and under applicable state securities or blue
sky laws, the Company may require,  as a condition of allowing such transfer (i)
that the Holder or transferee of this  Warrant,  as the case may be,  furnish to
the  Company a written  opinion  of  counsel  (which  opinion  shall be in form,
substance   and  scope   customary   for  opinions  of  counsel  in   comparable
transactions) to the effect that such transfer may be made without  registration
under the Securities Act and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws,
(ii) that the  holder or  transferee  execute  and  deliver  to the  Company  an
investment letter in form and substance acceptable to the Company and (iii) that
the transferee be an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a)(1), (a)(2),
(a)(3),  (a)(7),  or (a)(8)  promulgated under the Securities Act or a qualified
institutional buyer as defined in Rule 144A(a) under the Securities Act.

         SECTION 5. MISCELLANEOUS.

         a)       TITLE TO WARRANT. Prior to the Termination Date and subject to
compliance with applicable laws and Section 4 of this Warrant,  this Warrant and
all rights  hereunder  are  transferable,  in whole or in part, at the office or
agency of the  Company by the Holder in person or by duly  authorized  attorney,
upon surrender of this Warrant  together with the Assignment Form annexed hereto
properly  endorsed.  The transferee shall sign an investment  letter in form and
substance reasonably satisfactory to the Company.

         b)       NO RIGHTS AS SHAREHOLDER UNTIL EXERCISE. This Warrant does not
entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder  of the
Company prior to the exercise hereof. Upon the surrender of this Warrant and the
payment of the aggregate  Exercise  Price (or by means of a cashless  exercise),
the  Warrant  Shares  so  purchased  shall be and be deemed to be issued to such
Holder as the record  owner of such  shares as of the close of  business  on the
later of the date of such surrender or payment.

         c)       LOSS, THEFT, DESTRUCTION OR MUTILATION OF WARRANT. The Company
covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence  reasonably  satisfactory
to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant or any stock
certificate  relating  to the  Warrant  Shares,  and in case of  loss,  theft or
destruction,  of indemnity or security reasonably  satisfactory to it (which, in
the case of the  Warrant,  shall not include the posting of any bond),  and upon
surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock  certificate,  if mutilated,
the Company  will make and deliver a new  Warrant or stock  certificate  of like
tenor  and  dated  as of such  cancellation,  in lieu of such  Warrant  or stock
certificate.

         d)       SATURDAYS,  SUNDAYS,  HOLIDAYS,  ETC. If the last or appointed
day for the  taking of any action or the  expiration  of any right  required  or
granted herein shall be a Saturday,  Sunday or a legal holiday, then such action
may be taken or such right may be  exercised  on the next  succeeding  day not a
Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

         e)       AUTHORIZED SHARES.


                                       11
<PAGE>


                           The  Company  covenants  that  during  the period the
                  Warrant is  outstanding,  it will reserve from its  authorized
                  and unissued  Common  Stock a  sufficient  number of shares to
                  provide  for the  issuance  of the  Warrant  Shares  upon  the
                  exercise  of any  purchase  rights  under  this  Warrant.  The
                  Company  further  covenants  that its issuance of this Warrant
                  shall  constitute  full  authority  to its  officers  who  are
                  charged  with  the duty of  executing  stock  certificates  to
                  execute and issue the necessary  certificates  for the Warrant
                  Shares upon the  exercise of the  purchase  rights  under this
                  Warrant.  The Company will take all such reasonable  action as
                  may be  necessary  to assure that such  Warrant  Shares may be
                  issued as provided herein without  violation of any applicable
                  law or  regulation,  or of  any  requirements  of the  Trading
                  Market upon which the Common Stock may be listed.

                           Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by
                  the Holder,  the Company  shall not by any action,  including,
                  without limitation,  amending its certificate of incorporation
                  or   through   any   reorganization,   transfer   of   assets,
                  consolidation,   merger,   dissolution,   issue   or  sale  of
                  securities  or any other  voluntary  action,  avoid or seek to
                  avoid the  observance  or  performance  of any of the terms of
                  this  Warrant,  but will at all times in good faith  assist in
                  the  carrying  out of all such  terms and in the taking of all
                  such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the
                  rights  of  Holder  as  set  forth  in  this  Warrant  against
                  impairment.  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
                  the Company will (a) not increase the par value of any Warrant
                  Shares above the amount  payable  therefor  upon such exercise
                  immediately  prior to such increase in par value, (b) take all
                  such action as may be necessary or  appropriate  in order that
                  the  Company  may  validly  and  legally  issue fully paid and
                  nonassessable   Warrant  Shares  upon  the  exercise  of  this
                  Warrant, and (c) use commercially reasonable efforts to obtain
                  all  such  authorizations,  exemptions  or  consents  from any
                  public regulatory body having  jurisdiction  thereof as may be
                  necessary  to enable the  Company to perform  its  obligations
                  under this Warrant.

                           Before  taking any action  which  would  result in an
                  adjustment  in the  number of  Warrant  Shares  for which this
                  Warrant is exercisable or in the Exercise  Price,  the Company
                  shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions thereof, or
                  consents  thereto,   as  may  be  necessary  from  any  public
                  regulatory body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.

         f)       JURISDICTION.   All  questions  concerning  the  construction,
validity,  enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be determined in
accordance with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

         g)       RESTRICTIONS.  The Holder acknowledges that the Warrant Shares
acquired  upon the  exercise  of this  Warrant,  if not  registered,  will  have
restrictions upon resale imposed by state and federal securities laws.

         h)       NONWAIVER AND  EXPENSES.  No course of dealing or any delay or
failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of Holder shall operate as a
waiver of such right


                                       12

or otherwise prejudice Holder's rights, powers or remedies,  notwithstanding the
fact that all rights hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company
willfully  and  knowingly  fails to comply with any  provision of this  Warrant,
which  results in any material  damages to the Holder,  the Company shall pay to
Holder  such  amounts  as shall be  sufficient  to cover any costs and  expenses
including,  but not limited to, reasonable  attorneys' fees,  including those of
appellate proceedings, incurred by Holder in collecting any amounts due pursuant
hereto  or in  otherwise  enforcing  any  of  its  rights,  powers  or  remedies
hereunder.

         i)       NOTICES.  Any notice,  request or other  document  required or
permitted  to be  given or  delivered  to the  Holder  by the  Company  shall be
delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

         j)       LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  No provision  hereof, in the absence
of any affirmative action by Holder to exercise this Warrant or purchase Warrant
Shares, and no enumeration  herein of the rights or privileges of Holder,  shall
give rise to any liability of Holder for the purchase  price of any Common Stock
or as a stockholder  of the Company,  whether such  liability is asserted by the
Company or by creditors of the Company.

         k)       REMEDIES.  Holder,  in addition to being  entitled to exercise
all rights granted by law,  including  recovery of damages,  will be entitled to
specific  performance of its rights under this Warrant.  The Company agrees that
monetary  damages  would not be adequate  compensation  for any loss incurred by
reason of a breach by it of the  provisions of this Warrant and hereby agrees to
waive the defense in any action for  specific  performance  that a remedy at law
would be adequate.

         l)       SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. Subject to applicable securities laws,
this Warrant and the rights and obligations  evidenced hereby shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the  successors of the Company and the successors
and permitted assigns of Holder.  The provisions of this Warrant are intended to
be for the benefit of all Holders from time to time of this Warrant and shall be
enforceable by any such Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.

         m)       AMENDMENT.  This  Warrant  may be  modified  or amended or the
provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the Company and the Holder.

         n)       SEVERABILITY.   Wherever  possible,  each  provision  of  this
Warrant shall be  interpreted  in such manner as to be effective and valid under
applicable  law, but if any  provision of this Warrant shall be prohibited by or
invalid under  applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective to the extent
of such  prohibition or invalidity,  without  invalidating the remainder of such
provisions or the remaining provisions of this Warrant.

         o)       HEADINGS.  The  headings  used  in  this  Warrant  are for the
convenience of reference  only and shall not, for any purpose,  be deemed a part
of this Warrant.
