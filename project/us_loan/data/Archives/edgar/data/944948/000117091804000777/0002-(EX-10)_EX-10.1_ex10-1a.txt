of the portion of Registrable Securities included in clauses (i), (ii) and (iii)
of the definition thereof,  calculated as of such Filing Date for an offering to
be made on a continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415. The  Registration  Statement
shall be on Form S-3 (except if the Company is not then eligible to register for

shall be on another  appropriate form in accordance  herewith) and shall contain
(unless  otherwise   directed  by  the  Holders)   substantially  the  "PLAN  OF
DISTRIBUTION"  attached  hereto  as  ANNEX  A.  Subject  to the  terms  of  this
Agreement,  the  Company  shall use its best  efforts to cause the  Registration
Statement  to be  declared  effective  under the  Securities  Act as promptly as
possible  after the filing  thereof,  but in any event  prior to the  applicable
Effectiveness  Date,  and shall use its best  efforts to keep such  Registration
Statement  continuously effective under the Securities Act until all Registrable
Securities covered by such Registration  Statement have been sold or may be sold
without volume restrictions pursuant to Rule 144(k) as determined by the counsel
to the Company  pursuant to a written  opinion letter to such effect,  addressed
and  acceptable to the Company's  transfer  agent and the affected  Holders (the
"EFFECTIVENESS  PERIOD").  The Company shall immediately  notify the Holders via
facsimile or email of the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement on the
same day that the Company receives  notification of the  effectiveness  from the
Commission.  Failure to so notify  the  Holder by 9:00 p.m.  EST on the same day
that the  Company  receives  such  notification  shall be deemed an Event  under
Section 2(b).

         (b) If: (i) a  Registration  Statement  is not filed on or prior to its
Filing Date (if the Company files a Registration Statement without affording the
Holders the opportunity to review and comment on the same as required by Section
3(a),  the Company  shall not be deemed to have  satisfied  this clause (i)), or
(ii) the Company fails to file with the Commission a request for acceleration in
accordance with Rule 461 promulgated  under the Securities Act, within 5 Trading
Days of the date that the Company is notified  (orally or in writing,  whichever
is  earlier)  by  the  Commission  that a  Registration  Statement  will  not be
"reviewed,"  or  not  subject  to  further   review,   or  (iii)  prior  to  its
Effectiveness  Date,  the Company  fails to file a  pre-effective  amendment and
otherwise  respond in writing to comments  made by the  Commission in respect of
such  Registration  Statement  within 25  calendar  days  after the  receipt  of
comments by or notice from the  Commission  that such  amendment  is required in
order for a Registration


                                       3
<PAGE>


Statement to be declared  effective,  or (iv) a Registration  Statement filed or
required to be filed  hereunder is not declared  effective by the  Commission by
its  Effectiveness  Date, or (v) after the  Effectiveness  Date, a  Registration
Statement  ceases  for any  reason to remain  continuously  effective  as to all
Registrable Securities for which it is required to be effective,  or the Holders
are not permitted to utilize the Prospectus  therein to resell such  Registrable
Securities for 10  consecutive  Trading Days but no more than an aggregate of 15
Trading Days during any 12-month  period (which need not be consecutive  Trading
Days) (any such  failure or breach  being  referred  to as an  "EVENT",  and for
purposes  of clause  (i) or (iv) the date on which  such  Event  occurs,  or for
purposes of clause (ii) the date on which such 5 Trading Day period is exceeded,
or for  purposes of clause  (iii) the date which such 25 calendar  day period is
exceeded,  or for purposes of clause (v) the date on which such 10 or 15 Trading
Day period, as applicable,  is exceeded being referred to as "EVENT Date"), then
in  addition  to any  other  rights  the  Holders  may have  hereunder  or under
applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly  anniversary of each
such Event Date (if the applicable Event shall not have been cured by such date)
until the  applicable  Event is cured,  the Company  shall pay to each Holder an
amount in cash,  as partial  liquidated  damages and not as a penalty,  equal to
1.0%  of the  aggregate  purchase  price  paid by such  Holder  pursuant  to the
Purchase  Agreement for any Registrable  Securities then held by such Holder. If
the Company fails to pay any partial liquidated damages pursuant to this Section
in full within seven days after the date payable,  the Company will pay interest
thereon  at a rate of 15% per  annum  (or such  lesser  maximum  amount  that is
permitted to be paid by applicable  law) to the Holder,  accruing daily from the
date such partial liquidated  damages are due until such amounts,  plus all such
interest thereon,  are paid in full. The partial  liquidated damages pursuant to
the terms  hereof  shall  apply on a daily  pro-rata  basis for any portion of a
month prior to the cure of an Event.

         3.       REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

         In connection with the Company's  registration  obligations  hereunder,
the Company shall:

         (a) Not less  than  three  Trading  Days  prior to the  filing  of each
Registration  Statement or any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto,  the  Company  shall,  (i)  furnish to each  Holder  copies of all such
documents  proposed to be filed,  which documents (other than those incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated by reference) will be subject to the review of such
Holders,  and (ii) cause its officers  and  directors,  counsel and  independent
certified public accountants to respond to such inquiries as shall be necessary,
in the  reasonable  opinion  of  respective  counsel  to  conduct  a  reasonable
investigation  within the meaning of the  Securities  Act. The Company shall not
file the  Registration  Statement or any such  Prospectus  or any  amendments or
supplements  thereto  to which the  Holders  of a  majority  of the  Registrable
Securities shall reasonably object in good faith,  provided that, the Company is
notified  of such  objection  in writing no later than 2 Trading  Days after the
Holders have been so furnished  copies of such documents.  Each Holder agrees to
furnish to the Company a completed  Questionnaire  in the form  attached to this
Agreement as Annex B (a "SELLING SHAREHOLDER  QUESTIONNAIRE")  concurrently with
the execution and delivery of this Agreement.


                                       4
<PAGE>


         (b) (i) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments, including
post-effective  amendments,  to a Registration Statement and the Prospectus used
in  connection  therewith as may be necessary to keep a  Registration  Statement
continuously  effective  as to the  applicable  Registrable  Securities  for the
Effectiveness  Period and prepare and file with the Commission  such  additional
Registration Statements in order to register for resale under the Securities Act
all of the  Registrable  Securities;  (ii) cause the  related  Prospectus  to be
amended or supplemented by any required  Prospectus  supplement  (subject to the
terms of this Agreement), and as so supplemented or amended to be filed pursuant
to Rule 424;  (iii) respond as promptly as  reasonably  possible to any comments
received from the  Commission  with respect to a  Registration  Statement or any
amendment thereto and as promptly as reasonably possible, upon request,  provide
the  Holders  true and  complete  copies of all  correspondence  from and to the
Commission relating to a Registration Statement; and (iv) comply in all material
respects  with the  provisions of the  Securities  Act and the Exchange Act with
respect  to  the  disposition  of  all  Registrable   Securities  covered  by  a
Registration  Statement during the applicable  period in accordance  (subject to
the terms of this  Agreement)  with the intended  methods of  disposition by the
Holders  thereof set forth in such  Registration  Statement  as so amended or in
such Prospectus as so supplemented.

         (c) If during  the  Effectiveness  Period,  the  number of  Registrable
Securities  at any time exceeds 90% of the number of shares of Common Stock then
registered in a Registration  Statement,  then the Company shall file as soon as
reasonably  practicable but in any case prior to the applicable  Filing Date, an
additional Registration Statement covering the resale by the Holders of not less
than 125% of the number of such Registrable Securities.

         (d) Notify the  Holders of  Registrable  Securities  to be sold  (which
notice shall, pursuant to clauses (ii) through (vi) hereof, be accompanied by an
instruction  to suspend the use of the  Prospectus  until the requisite  changes
have been made) as promptly as reasonably possible following the day (i)(A) when
a Prospectus  or any  Prospectus  supplement  or  post-effective  amendment to a
Registration Statement is proposed to be filed; (B) when the Commission notifies
the Company whether there will be a "review" of such Registration  Statement and
whenever the Commission comments in writing on such Registration  Statement (the
Company  shall upon request  provide true and  complete  copies  thereof and all
written  responses  thereto to each of the  Holders);  and (C) with respect to a
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective;  (ii) of any request by the  Commission or any other Federal or state
governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement
or  Prospectus  or for  additional  information;  (iii) of the  issuance  by the
Commission  or any other  federal or state  governmental  authority  of any stop
order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration  Statement  covering any or
all of the Registrable  Securities or the initiation of any Proceedings for that
purpose;  (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with respect to
the suspension of the  qualification  or exemption from  qualification of any of
the Registrable  Securities for sale in any  jurisdiction,  or the initiation or
threatening  of any  Proceeding  for such purpose;  (v) of the occurrence of any
event or passage  of time that  makes the  financial  statements  included  in a
Registration Statement ineligible for inclusion therein or any statement made in
a Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to
be  incorporated  therein by reference  untrue in any  material  respect or that
requires  any  revisions  to  a  Registration  Statement,  Prospectus  or  other
documents so that, in the case of a


                                       5
<PAGE>


Registration  Statement  or the  Prospectus,  as the  case  may be,  it will not
contain any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,
in light of the  circumstances  under which they were made, not misleading;  and
(vi) the  occurrence  or existence  of any pending  corporate  development  with
respect to the Company that the Company  believes  may be material and that,  in
the  determination  of the  Company,  makes it not in the best  interest  of the
Company  to  allow  continued  availability  of the  Registration  Statement  or
Prospectus;  provided  that  any  and  all  of  such  information  shall  remain
confidential  to each Holder until such  information  otherwise  becomes public,
unless  disclosure  by  a  Holder  is  required  by  law;   PROVIDED,   FURTHER,
notwithstanding  each Holder's agreement to keep such information  confidential,
the Holders  make no  acknowledgement  that any such  information  is  material,
non-public information.

         (e) Use its best  efforts  to avoid the  issuance  of,  or, if  issued,
obtain  the  withdrawal  of (i) any  order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of a
Registration  Statement,  or  (ii)  any  suspension  of  the  qualification  (or
exemption from  qualification) of any of the Registrable  Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment.

         (f) Furnish to each Holder,  without charge, to the extent requested by
such Holder, at least one conformed copy of each such Registration Statement and
each amendment  thereto,  including  financial  statements  and  schedules,  all
documents  incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference to the
extent  requested  by such Person,  and all exhibits to the extent  requested by
such Person (including those previously furnished or incorporated by reference).

         (g) Promptly deliver to each Holder,  without charge, as many copies of
the Prospectus or  Prospectuses  (including  each form of  prospectus)  and each
amendment  or  supplement  thereto as such  Persons  may  reasonably  request in
connection with resales by the Holder of Registrable Securities.  Subject to the
terms  of  this  Agreement,  the  Company  hereby  consents  to the  use of such
Prospectus  and each  amendment  or  supplement  thereto by each of the  selling
Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the  Registrable  Securities
covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, except after
the giving on any notice pursuant to Section 3(d).

         (h) Prior to any resale of Registrable  Securities by a Holder, use its
commercially  reasonable  efforts to register or qualify or  cooperate  with the
selling  Holders  in  connection  with the  registration  or  qualification  (or
exemption from the Registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities
for the  resale  by the  Holder  under the  securities  or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions  within the United  States as any Holder  reasonably  requests  in
writing,  to keep each  registration or qualification  (or exemption  therefrom)
effective  during the  Effectiveness  Period and to do any and all other acts or
things reasonably  necessary to enable the disposition in such  jurisdictions of
the Registrable  Securities  covered by each Registration  Statement;  provided,
that the Company  shall not be required to qualify  generally  to do business in
any jurisdiction  where it is not then so qualified,  subject the Company to any
material tax in any such jurisdiction  where it is not then so subject or file a
general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction.


                                       6
<PAGE>


         (i)  If  requested  by the  Holders,  cooperate  with  the  Holders  to
facilitate  the timely  preparation  and delivery of  certificates  representing
Registrable   Securities  to  be  delivered  to  a  transferee   pursuant  to  a
Registration  Statement,  which  certificates  shall  be  free,  to  the  extent
permitted by the Purchase Agreement,  of all restrictive  legends, and to enable
such Registrable  Securities to be in such  denominations and registered in such
names as any such Holders may request.

         (j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by this Section 3, as
promptly as reasonably possible under the circumstances  taking into account the
Company's good faith  assessment of any adverse  consequences to the Company and
its stockholders of the premature disclosure of such event, prepare a supplement
or amendment,  including a post-effective amendment, to a Registration Statement
or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed
to be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so
that,  as  thereafter  delivered,  neither  a  Registration  Statement  nor such
Prospectus will contain an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state
a  material  fact  required  to be  stated  therein  or  necessary  to make  the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not misleading.  If the Company  notifies the Holders in accordance with clauses
(ii)  through  (v) of Section  3(d) above to suspend  the use of any  Prospectus
until the requisite  changes to such Prospectus have been made, then the Holders
shall suspend use of such  Prospectus.  The Company will use its best efforts to
ensure  that  the  use of  the  Prospectus  may be  resumed  as  promptly  as is
practicable.  The Company  shall be  entitled  to exercise  its right under this
Section  3(j) to  suspend  the  availability  of a  Registration  Statement  and
Prospectus,  subject to the payment of partial  liquidated  damages  pursuant to
Section 2(b),  for a period not to exceed 60 days (which need not be consecutive
days) in any 12 month period.

         (k) Comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission.

         (l) The  Company  may  require  each  selling  Holder to furnish to the
Company a  certified  statement  as to the  number  of  shares  of Common  Stock
beneficially  owned by such  Holder and the person  thereof  that has voting and
dispositive control over the Registrable Securities. During any periods that the
Company  is  unable  to meet  its  obligations  hereunder  with  respect  to the
registration  of the Registrable  Securities  solely because any Holder fails to
furnish such information within three Trading Days of the Company's request, any
liquidated  damages  that are accruing at such time as to such Holder only shall
be tolled and any Event that may  otherwise  occur solely  because of such delay
shall be suspended as to such Holder only,  until such  information is delivered
to the Company.

         4.       REGISTRATION  EXPENSES.  All fees and expenses incident to the
performance  of or compliance  with this Agreement by the Company shall be borne
by the Company  whether or not any  Registrable  Securities are sold pursuant to
the Registration  Statement.  The fees and expenses referred to in the foregoing
sentence shall include, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees

<PAGE>


Company  in  connection  with  Blue  Sky  qualifications  or  exemptions  of the
Registrable  Securities and  determination of the eligibility of the Registrable
Securities for investment  under the laws of such  jurisdictions as requested by
the  Holders) and (C) with respect to any filing that may be required to be made
by any  broker  through  which a Holder  intends  to make  sales of  Registrable
Securities with NASD Regulation, Inc. pursuant to the NASD Rule 2710, so long as
the  broker  is  receiving  no more than a  customary  brokerage  commission  in
connection  with  such  sale,  (ii)  printing   expenses   (including,   without
limitation,  expenses of printing certificates for Registrable Securities and of
printing prospectuses if the printing of prospectuses is reasonably requested by

(including,  without  limitation,  all salaries and expenses of its officers and
employees  performing  legal or  accounting  duties),  the expense of any annual

or other costs of the Holders.

         5.       INDEMNIFICATION

         (a) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY. The Company shall,  notwithstanding
any termination of this Agreement,  indemnify and hold harmless each Holder, the
officers,  directors,  agents and  employees  of each of them,  each  Person who
controls any such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act
or Section  20 of the  Exchange  Act) and the  officers,  directors,  agents and
employees of each such  controlling  Person,  to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable  law,  from  and  against  any  and  all  losses,  claims,   damages,
liabilities, costs (including,  without limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees)
and expenses (collectively,  "LOSSES"), as incurred,  arising out of or relating
to any untrue or alleged  untrue  statement  of a material  fact  contained in a
Registration  Statement,  any  Prospectus  or any form of  prospectus  or in any
amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising out
of or relating to any omission or alleged  omission of a material  fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of
any  Prospectus or form of prospectus  or  supplement  thereto,  in light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading,  except to the extent,
but only to the extent,  that (i) such untrue  statements or omissions are based
solely  upon  information  regarding  such  Holder  furnished  in writing to the
Company by such Holder  expressly  for use  therein,  or to the extent that such
information  relates  to  such  Holder  or  such  Holder's  proposed  method  of
distribution of Registrable  Securities and was reviewed and expressly  approved
in writing by such Holder  expressly for use in a Registration  Statement,  such
Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement  thereto
(it being  understood  that the  Holder  has  approved  Annex A hereto  for this
purpose) or (ii) in the case of an occurrence of an event of the type  specified
in Section  3(d)(ii)-(vi),  the use by such Holder of an  outdated or  defective
Prospectus  after the  Company  has  notified  such  Holder in writing  that the
Prospectus  is outdated or defective  and prior to the receipt by such Holder of
the Advice


                                       8
<PAGE>


contemplated  in Section 6(d). The Company shall notify the Holders  promptly of
the  institution,  threat or  assertion  of any  Proceeding  arising  from or in
connection  with the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement of which the
Company is aware.

         (b)  INDEMNIFICATION BY HOLDERS.  Each Holder shall,  severally and not
jointly,  indemnify  and hold  harmless the Company,  its  directors,  officers,
agents and employees,  each Person who controls the Company  (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the
directors,  officers,  agents or employees of such controlling  Persons,  to the
fullest  extent  permitted by applicable  law,  from and against all Losses,  as
incurred,  to the extent  arising out of or based solely upon: (x) such Holder's
failure to comply with the prospectus  delivery  requirements  of the Securities
Act or (y) any untrue or alleged  untrue  statement of a material fact contained
in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus,  or any form of prospectus, or in
any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising
out of or  relating  to any  omission  or alleged  omission  of a material  fact
required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the  statements  therein not
misleading (i) to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement
or omission is  contained  in any  information  so  furnished in writing by such
Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in such Registration  Statement
or such  Prospectus  or (ii) to the extent  that (1) such untrue  statements  or
omissions are based solely upon  information  regarding such Holder furnished in
writing to the  Company by such  Holder  expressly  for use  therein,  or to the
extent that such  information  relates to such Holder or such Holder's  proposed
method of distribution of Registrable  Securities and was reviewed and expressly
approved  in  writing  by such  Holder  expressly  for  use in the  Registration
Statement (it being  understood  that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for
this purpose), such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or in any amendment or
supplement  thereto or (2) in the case of an  occurrence of an event of the type
specified  in Section  3(d)(ii)-(vi),  the use by such  Holder of an outdated or
defective  Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that
the  Prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt by such Holder
of the Advice  contemplated  in Section 6(d). In no event shall the liability of
any selling Holder  hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities
giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

         (c) CONDUCT OF INDEMNIFICATION  PROCEEDINGS. If any Proceeding shall be
brought or asserted  against  any Person  entitled to  indemnity  hereunder  (an
"INDEMNIFIED  PARTY"),  such Indemnified  Party shall promptly notify the Person
from whom  indemnity is sought (the  "INDEMNIFYING  PARTY") in writing,  and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including
the employment of counsel  reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
the  payment  of all fees and  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  defense
thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve  the  Indemnifying  Party of its  obligations  or  liabilities
pursuant  to this  Agreement,  except  (and only) to the extent that it shall be
finally determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction (which determination is
not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.

         An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate counsel in
any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof,  but the fees and
expenses of such counsel


                                       9
<PAGE>


shall be at the expense of such  Indemnified  Party or Parties  unless:  (1) the
Indemnifying Party has agreed in writing to pay such fees and expenses;  (2) the
Indemnifying  Party  shall have  failed  promptly  to assume the defense of such
Proceeding and to employ counsel  reasonably  satisfactory  to such  Indemnified
Party in any such  Proceeding;  or (3) the named parties to any such  Proceeding
(including any impleaded  parties) include both such  Indemnified  Party and the
Indemnifying  Party, and such Indemnified Party shall reasonably  believe that a
material  conflict of interest  is likely to exist if the same  counsel  were to
represent such Indemnified  Party and the Indemnifying  Party (in which case, if
such Indemnified Party notifies the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects
to employ  separate  counsel  at the  expense  of the  Indemnifying  Party,  the
Indemnifying  Party shall not have the right to assume the  defense  thereof and
the reasonable fees and expenses of one separate counsel shall be at the expense
of the Indemnifying  Party).  The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any such Proceeding  effected without its written  consent,  which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any
pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party,  unless
such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.

         Subject  to the  terms  of this  Agreement,  all  reasonable  fees  and
expenses of the Indemnified Party (including reasonable fees and expenses to the
extent  incurred in connection  with  investigating  or preparing to defend such
Proceeding in a manner not inconsistent  with this Section) shall be paid to the
Indemnified  Party,  as  incurred,  within ten  Trading  Days of written  notice
thereof to the Indemnifying  Party;  provided,  that the Indemnified Party shall
promptly  reimburse  the  Indemnifying  Party for that  portion of such fees and
expenses  applicable  to such  actions for which such  Indemnified  Party is not
entitled to indemnification hereunder, determined based upon the relative faults
of the parties.

         (d) CONTRIBUTION.  If a claim for indemnification under Section 5(a) or
5(b) is  unavailable  to an  Indemnified  Party (by  reason of public  policy or
otherwise),   then  each  Indemnifying  Party,  in  lieu  of  indemnifying  such
Indemnified  Party,  shall  contribute  to the  amount  paid or  payable by such
Indemnified  Party  as a  result  of  such  Losses,  in  such  proportion  as is
appropriate  to  reflect  the  relative  fault  of the  Indemnifying  Party  and
Indemnified  Party in connection with the actions,  statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations.
The relative fault of such  Indemnifying  Party and  Indemnified  Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things,  whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue  statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to
information  supplied by, such Indemnifying  Party or Indemnified Party, and the
parties'  relative intent,  knowledge,  access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent  such  action,  statement  or  omission.  The amount  paid or
payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject
to the  limitations set forth in this  Agreement,  any reasonable  attorneys' or
other reasonable fees or expenses  incurred by such party in connection with any
Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or
expenses if the  indemnification  provided for in this Section was  available to
such party in accordance with its terms.


                                       10
<PAGE>


         The parties  hereto  agree that it would not be just and  equitable  if
contribution  pursuant  to  this  Section  5(d)  were  determined  by  pro  rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation  that does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), no Holder shall be required
to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the
proceeds  actually  received  by such  Holder  from the sale of the  Registrable
Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Holder has  otherwise  been  required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, except in the case of fraud by
such Holder.

         The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are
in  addition  to any  liability  that the  Indemnifying  Parties may have to the
Indemnified Parties.

         6.       MISCELLANEOUS

         (a)  REMEDIES.  In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder,
of any of their obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the Company, as
the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by
law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to
specific  performance of its rights under this  Agreement.  The Company and each
Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide  adequate  compensation for
any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this
Agreement  and  hereby  further  agrees  that,  in the event of any  action  for
specific  performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that
a remedy at law would be adequate.

         (b) NO PIGGYBACK ON REGISTRATIONS. Except as set forth on SCHEDULE 6(B)
attached hereto, neither the Company nor any of its security holders (other than
the Holders in such  capacity  pursuant  hereto) may include  securities  of the
Company in the Registration Statement other than the Registrable Securities. The
Company  shall  not file any other  registration  statements  until the  initial
Registration   Statement   required  hereunder  is  declared  effective  by  the
Commission,  provided that this Section 6(b) shall not prohibit the Company from
filing amendments to registration statements already filed.

         (c)  COMPLIANCE.  Each Holder  covenants and agrees that it will comply
with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to
it  in  connection  with  sales  of  Registrable   Securities  pursuant  to  the
Registration Statement.

         (d) DISCONTINUED DISPOSITION.  Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of
such  Registrable  Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company of
the occurrence of any event of the kind  described in Section 3(d),  such Holder
will forthwith  discontinue  disposition of such Registrable  Securities under a
Registration  Statement  until  such  Holder's  receipt  of  the  copies  of the
supplemented  Prospectus and/or amended Registration  Statement,  or until it is
advised in writing (the  "ADVICE") by the Company that the use of the applicable
Prospectus  may be resumed,  and, in either  case,  has  received  copies of any
additional  or  supplemental  filings  that are  incorporated  or  deemed  to be
incorporated  by reference in such  Prospectus or  Registration  Statement.  The
Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of the  Prospectus  may
be


                                       11
<PAGE>


resumed as promptly as it practicable.  The Company agrees and acknowledges that
any periods during which the Holder is required to discontinue  the  disposition
of the  Registrable  Securities  hereunder shall be subject to the provisions of
Section 2(b).

         (e) PIGGY-BACK  REGISTRATIONS.  If at any time during the Effectiveness
Period  there is not an  effective  Registration  Statement  covering all of the
Registrable  Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and file with
the  Commission  a  registration  statement  relating to an offering for its own
account or the account of others under the  Securities  Act of any of its equity
securities,  other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as  promulgated  under the
Securities Act) or their then  equivalents  relating to equity  securities to be
issued solely in connection  with any  acquisition  of any entity or business or
equity securities issuable in connection with the stock option or other employee
benefit  plans,  then the Company shall send to each Holder a written  notice of
such  determination  and, if within  fifteen days after the date of such notice,
any such Holder shall so request in writing,  the Company  shall include in such
registration  statement  all or any  part of such  Registrable  Securities  such
holder  requests to be  registered;  provided,  that,  the Company  shall not be
required to register any  Registrable  Securities  pursuant to this Section 6(e)
that are  eligible  for resale  pursuant  to Rule 144(k)  promulgated  under the
Securities  Act  or  that  are  the  subject  of a then  effective  Registration
Statement.

         (f) AMENDMENTS AND WAIVERS. The provisions of this Agreement, including
the provisions of this sentence,  may not be amended,  modified or supplemented,
and waivers or  consents to  departures  from the  provisions  hereof may not be
given,  unless the same shall be in writing  and signed by the  Company and each
Holder  of the then  outstanding  Registrable  Securities.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the provisions hereof with respect
to a matter that relates  exclusively to the rights of Holders and that does not
directly  or  indirectly  affect  the  rights of other  Holders  may be given by
Holders of all of the  Registrable  Securities  to which such  waiver or consent
relates;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the  provisions  of this sentence may not be
amended,  modified,  or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence.

         (g) NOTICES.  Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
required or permitted to be provided  hereunder  shall be delivered as set forth
in the Purchase Agreement.

         (h) SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS.  This Agreement  shall inure to the benefit
of and be  binding  upon the  successors  and  permitted  assigns of each of the
parties  and shall  inure to the  benefit of each  Holder.  The  Company may not
assign its rights or obligations  hereunder without the prior written consent of
all of the Holders of the then-outstanding  Registrable Securities.  Each Holder
may assign their respective rights hereunder in the manner and to the Persons as
permitted under the Purchase Agreement.

         (i) NO  INCONSISTENT  AGREEMENTS.  Neither  the  Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has entered, as of the date hereof, nor shall the Company or any of
its  subsidiaries,  on or  after  the  date of this  Agreement,  enter  into any
agreement  with  respect  to its  securities,  that  would  have the  effect  of
impairing  the rights  granted to the  Holders in this  Agreement  or  otherwise
conflicts  with the  provisions  hereof.  Except as set forth on SCHEDULE  6(i),
neither the Company nor any of


                                       12
<PAGE>


its  subsidiaries  has  previously  entered  into  any  agreement  granting  any
registration  rights with  respect to any of its  securities  to any Person that
have not been  satisfied in full and are not included in an existing,  effective
registration statement.

         (j) EXECUTION AND  COUNTERPARTS.  This Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts,  each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original  and, all of which taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
Agreement.   In  the  event  that  any   signature  is  delivered  by  facsimile
transmission,  such  signature  shall create a valid  binding  obligation of the
party  executing  (or on whose behalf such  signature is executed) the same with
the same  force and  effect as if such  facsimile  signature  were the  original
thereof.

         (k) GOVERNING LAW. All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement  and  interpretation  of this Agreement shall be determined with the
provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

         (l) CUMULATIVE  REMEDIES.  The remedies  provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

         (m) SEVERABILITY.  If any term,  provision,  covenant or restriction of
this  Agreement  is held by a court of  competent  jurisdiction  to be  invalid,
illegal,  void  or  unenforceable,  the  remainder  of  the  terms,  provisions,
covenants  and  restrictions  set forth  herein  shall  remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties
hereto  shall use their  commercially  reasonable  efforts to find and employ an
alternative  means to achieve the same or substantially  the same result as that
contemplated  by such term,  provision,  covenant or  restriction.  It is hereby
stipulated  and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have
executed the remaining terms,  provisions,  covenants and  restrictions  without
including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid,  illegal,  void or
unenforceable.

         (n) HEADINGS.  The headings in this  Agreement are for  convenience  of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

         (o)  INDEPENDENT  NATURE  OF  HOLDERS'   OBLIGATIONS  AND  RIGHTS.  The
obligations  of each  Holder  hereunder  are  several  and not  joint  with  the
obligations of any other Holder hereunder, and no Holder shall be responsible in
any way for the  performance of the  obligations of any other Holder  hereunder.
Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement or document  delivered at any
closing, and no action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto or thereto,  shall be
deemed to  constitute  the Holders as a  partnership,  an  association,  a joint
venture or any other kind of entity,  or create a  presumption  that the Holders
are in any way  acting  in  concert  with  respect  to such  obligations  or the
transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement.  Each Holder shall be entitled to
protect and enforce its rights,  including without limitation the rights arising
out of this Agreement,  and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be
joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

                              ********************

                              PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

         Each Selling  Stockholder  (the "SELLING  STOCKHOLDERS")  of the common
stock ("COMMON  STOCK") of Tarrant Apparel Group, a California  corporation (the
"COMPANY") and any of their pledgees,  assignees and successors-in-interest may,
from  time to time,  sell  any or all of their  shares  of  Common  Stock on the
Trading Market or any other stock exchange,  market or trading facility on which
the shares are traded or in private transactions. These sales may be at fixed or
negotiated  prices.  A  Selling  Stockholder  may  use  any  one or  more of the
following methods when selling shares:

         o        ordinary brokerage  transactions and transactions in which the
                  broker-dealer solicits purchasers;

         o        block trades in which the  broker-dealer  will attempt to sell
                  the shares as agent but may  position  and resell a portion of
                  the block as principal to facilitate the transaction;

         o        purchases by a  broker-dealer  as principal  and resale by the
                  broker-dealer for its account;

         o        an exchange  distribution  in accordance with the rules of the
                  applicable exchange;

         o        privately negotiated transactions;

         o        settlement  of short sales entered into after the date of this
                  prospectus;

         o        broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell
                  a specified  number of such shares at a  stipulated  price per
                  share;

         o        a combination of any such methods of sale;

         o        through the writing or  settlement of options or other hedging
                  transactions,   whether   through  an  options   exchange   or
                  otherwise; or

         o        any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.

         The Selling  Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "SECURITIES ACT"), if available,  rather
than under this prospectus.

         Broker-dealers  engaged by the  Selling  Stockholders  may  arrange for
other  brokers-dealers  to  participate  in sales.  Broker-dealers  may  receive
commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer
acts as agent for the purchaser of shares,  from the purchaser) in amounts to be
negotiated.  Each  Selling  Stockholder  does not expect these  commissions  and
discounts  relating  to its sales of shares to exceed what is  customary  in the
types of transactions involved.

         In connection  with the sale of our common stock or interests  therein,
the Selling Stockholders may enter into hedging transactions with broker-dealers
or other financial


                                       17

institutions, which may in turn engage in short sales of the common stock in the
course of hedging the positions they assume.  The Selling  Stockholders may also
sell shares of our common stock short and deliver these  securities to close out
their short positions, or loan or pledge the common stock to broker-dealers that
in turn may sell these securities.  The Selling Stockholders may also enter into
option or other transactions with broker-dealers or other financial institutions
or the creation of one or more derivative  securities which require the delivery
to such  broker-dealer or other financial  institution of shares offered by this
prospectus,  which shares such broker-dealer or other financial  institution may
resell pursuant to this  prospectus (as  supplemented or amended to reflect such
transaction).

         The  Selling  Stockholders  and any  broker-dealers  or agents that are
involved  in selling  the shares may be deemed to be  "underwriters"  within the
meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event,  any
commissions  received  by such  broker-dealers  or agents  and any profit on the
resale  of the  shares  purchased  by  them  may be  deemed  to be  underwriting
commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Each Selling  Stockholder has
informed  the  Company  that it does not have any  agreement  or  understanding,
directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute the Common Stock.

         The Company is required to pay certain  fees and  expenses  incurred by
the Company incident to the  registration of the shares.  The Company has agreed
to indemnify the Selling  Stockholders against certain losses,  claims,  damages
and liabilities, including liabilities under the Securities Act.

         Because Selling Stockholders may be deemed to be "underwriters"  within
the  meaning of the  Securities  Act,  they will be  subject  to the  prospectus
delivery requirements of the Securities Act. In addition, any securities covered
by this  prospectus  which  qualify  for sale  pursuant  to Rule 144  under  the
Securities  Act may be sold under Rule 144  rather  than under this  prospectus.
Each  Selling  Stockholder  has advised us that they have not  entered  into any
agreements, understandings or arrangements with any underwriter or broker-dealer
regarding the sale of the resale shares. There is no underwriter or coordinating
broker acting in  connection  with the proposed sale of the resale shares by the
Selling Stockholders.

         We agreed to keep this  prospectus  effective  until the earlier of (i)
the date on which the shares may be resold by the Selling  Stockholders  without
registration  and  without  regard to any volume  limitations  by reason of Rule
144(e) under the  Securities Act or any other rule of similar effect or (ii) all
of the shares have been sold  pursuant to the  prospectus  or Rule 144 under the
Securities  Act or any other rule of similar  effect.  The resale shares will be
sold only through  registered or licensed  brokers or dealers if required  under
applicable  state securities  laws. In addition,  in certain states,  the resale
shares may not be sold unless they have been registered or qualified for sale in
the applicable  state or an exemption  from the  registration  or  qualification
requirement is available and is complied with.

         Under  applicable  rules and  regulations  under the Exchange  Act, any
person engaged in the  distribution of the resale shares may not  simultaneously
engage in market making activities with respect to our common stock for a period
of two business days prior to the commencement of the distribution. In addition,
the  Selling  Stockholders  will be  subject  to  applicable  provisions  of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations  thereunder,  including Regulation M,
which may limit the timing of purchases  and sales of shares of our common stock
by the Selling  Stockholders  or any other  person.  We will make copies of this
prospectus  available to the Selling  Stockholders and have informed them of the
need to deliver a copy of this  prospectus to each  purchaser at or prior to the
time of the sale.
