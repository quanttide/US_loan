Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
- ------------------------------------------------------

On December 21, 2004, the Board of Directors of A.J. Smith Federal  Savings Bank
approved the adoption of the A. J. Smith  Federal  Savings Bank 2005  Executives
and Directors  Deferred  Compensation  Plan effective as of January 1, 2005. The
predecessor  of the plan was  frozen as to new  contributions  and/or  deferrals
earned following  December 31, 2004. Accrued benefits under the predecessor plan
will continue to be governed by the terms of the  predecessor  plan.  All future
benefit  accruals  will be governed by the plan  adopted on December 21, 2004. A
brief  description of the A. J. Smith Federal  Savings Bank 2005  Executives and
Directors Deferred Compensation Plan follows.

The A. J. Smith Federal  Savings Bank 2005  Executives  and  Directors  Deferred
Compensation Plan allows executive employees and directors to defer up to 20% of
their base  salary,  up to 50% of their  annual  bonus,  and up to 100% of their
director's  fees and have these amounts  credited to an account on their behalf.
Accounts  are  then  credited  with  interest  monthly  at a rate  equal  to two
percentage  points  above  the  prime  rate  until the  account  has been  fully
distributed to the participant. Under the plan, participants make an election to
receive  their  accounts  either in a lump sum  distribution,  or equal  monthly
installments  over a period  of 5, 10,  or 15 years at the time the  participant
commences  participation in the plan by completing a deferral  agreement with A.
J. Smith Federal  Savings Bank.  Amounts are  distributed to participants in the
plan  pursuant to a fixed  distribution  schedule at a  specified  date,  upon a
participant's separation from service, disability, or death, or upon a change in
control of A. J. Smith Federal Savings Bank or AJS Bancorp, Inc.
