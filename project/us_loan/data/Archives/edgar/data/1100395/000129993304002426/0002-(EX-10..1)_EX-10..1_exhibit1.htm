performance of the Services, if any. AOLA shall clearly and separately state any
applicable taxes on AOLA&#146;s invoice to AOL for corresponding Services. AOL shall pay
applicable taxes, if any, on the invoice or, in lieu of the payment of any such taxes,
AOL may provide AOLA with a certificate acceptable to the taxing authorities exempting
AOL from payment of these taxes. AOL shall not be liable for taxes based on AOLA&#146;s net
income, items of tax preference, net worth, capital stock, franchise, property or
conduct of business, or similarly-based taxes. AOLA shall pay all taxes collected from
AOL to the appropriate taxing authority. AOLA, and not AOL, shall be obligated to pay
any applicable taxes not so invoiced to AOL for corresponding Services, including
without limitation, any and all interest, penalties and attorneys&#146; fees. AOL will not
be responsible to AOLA or any governing body for any payroll-related taxes including

would determine to be of a confidential or proprietary nature. Each Party recognizes and
acknowledges that the other&#146;s Confidential Information (and the confidential nature thereof) is
critical to the business of the discloser and that the discloser would not enter into this
Agreement without assurance that its Confidential Information and the value thereof shall be
protected as provided in this Agreement.

disclosure.

otherwise in connection with this Agreement, it shall submit such request in writing to AOL. If
AOL does not respond within five (5)&nbsp;business days, AOLA shall have the right to escalate the issue

to indemnification by AOLA hereunder. AOLA agrees, should AOL&#146;s use of any service, program,
and/or other material furnished to AOL by AOLA be enjoined by any court, to promptly obtain &#151; at no
expense to AOL &#151; the right to continue to use the items so enjoined or, at no expense to AOL,
provide AOL promptly with substitute items that are functionally equivalent to the enjoined
products. If AOLA can not secure AOL&#146;s right to continue using such items or substitute such items
as provided herein, AOLA agrees to refund all sums earned under this Agreement relating to the
provision of such specific items. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not apply to any
Deliverables or Work created by the Dedicated Resources unless AOLA is otherwise required to
provide AOL with indemnification for such Deliverables and/or Work as set forth in this Section&nbsp;IV.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">AOL shall, at its expense, defend any action, suit or proceeding brought (other than by a
shareholder of AOLA or any AOLA affiliate) against AOLA or any AOLA affiliate, to the extent it
results from breach of a covenant or a representation or warranty by AOL under Section&nbsp;III of this
Exhibit&nbsp;B and AOL shall indemnify and hold AOLA and any AOLA affiliate harmless from and against
all Liabilities directly relating to or resulting from any such action, suit or proceeding,
provided, however, that AOL shall not settle any claim without AOLA&#146;s prior written approval, not
to be unreasonably withheld, delayed or conditioned.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>V.&nbsp;</B><U><B>RELATIONSHIP WITH AOL MEMBERS</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1.&nbsp;<U><B>Solicitation of Subscribers</B></U>. During the term of this Agreement and for a two (2)&nbsp;year
period thereafter, AOLA shall not use the AOL Network (including, without limitation, the email
network contained therein) to solicit AOL Members on behalf of another Interactive Service. More
generally, AOLA will not send unsolicited, commercial email (i.e., &#147;spam&#148;) or other online
communications through or into AOL&#146;s products or services, absent a Prior Business Relationship.
For purposes of this Agreement, a &#147;Prior Business Relationship&#148; will mean that the AOL Member to
whom commercial email or other online communication is being sent has voluntarily either (a)
engaged in a transaction with AOLA or (b)&nbsp;provided information to AOLA through a contest,
registration or other communication, which included clear notice to the AOL Member that the
information provided could result in commercial email or other online communications being sent to
that AOL Member by AOLA or its agents. Any commercial email or other online communications to AOL
Members which are otherwise permitted hereunder (i)&nbsp;will include a prominent and easy means to &#147;opt
out&#148; of receiving any future commercial communications from AOLA and (ii)&nbsp;shall also be subject to
AOL&#146;s then-standard restrictions on distribution of bulk email (e.g., related to the time and
manner in which such email can be distributed through or into the AOL product or service in
question).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">2.&nbsp;<U><B>Collection of Member Information</B></U>. AOLA shall ensure that its collection, use and
disclosure of information obtained from AOL Members under this Agreement (&#147;<B>Member Information</B>&#148;)
complies with (a)&nbsp;all applicable laws and regulations and (b)&nbsp;AOL&#146;s standard privacy policies,
available on the AOL Service at the keyword term &#147;Privacy.&#148; Except to the extent required by law,
rule, regulation or government or court order, AOLA will not disclose Member Information collected
hereunder to any third party in a manner that identifies AOL Members as end users of an AOL product
or service or use Member Information collected under this Agreement to market another Interactive
Service.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">3.&nbsp;<U><B>Email Newsletters</B></U>. Any email newsletters sent to AOL Members by AOLA or its agents
shall (a)&nbsp;be subject to AOL&#146;s policies on use of the email functionality, including but not limited
to AOL&#146;s policy on unsolicited bulk email; (b)&nbsp;be sent only to AOL Members requesting to receive
such newsletters; (c)&nbsp;not contain content which violates AOL&#146;s terms of service; and (d)&nbsp;not
contain any advertisements, marketing or promotion for any other Interactive Service.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">4.&nbsp;As used in this Agreement, &#147;<B>AOL Member</B>&#148; shall mean any user of the AOL Network, including
authorized users (including any sub-accounts under an authorized master account) of the AOL

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Force Majeure</B></U>. If and to the extent a party&#146;s performance of any of its obligations

of nature or acts of God, acts of war, terrorism, riots, civil disorders, rebellions or
revolutions, or any other similar cause beyond the reasonable control of such party (each, a &#147;<B>Force
Majeure Event</B>&#148;), and such non-performance, hindrance or delay could not have been prevented by
reasonable precautions, then the non-performing, hindered or delayed party shall be excused for
such non-performance, hindrance or delay, as applicable, of those obligations affected by the Force
Majeure Event for as long as such Force Majeure Event continues and such party continues to use its
best efforts to recommence performance whenever and to whatever extent possible without delay,
including through the use of alternate sources, workaround plans or other means. The party whose
performance is prevented, hindered or delayed by a Force Majeure Event shall immediately notify the
other party of the occurrence of the Force Majeure Event and describe in reasonable detail the
nature of the Force Majeure Event.

remedies under this Agreement must be in writing to be effective. Failure, neglect or delay by a
party to enforce the provisions of this Agreement or its rights or remedies at any time will not be
construed to be deemed a waiver of such party&#146;s rights under this Agreement and will not in any way
affect the validity of the whole or any part of this Agreement or prejudice such party&#146;s right to
take subsequent action.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Entire Agreement</B></U>. This Agreement (including the Exhibits and Schedules) contains the entire
agreement of the parties with respect to the subject matter of this Agreement and supercedes all
previous communications, representations, understandings and agreements, either oral or written,
between the parties with respect to said subject matter, including but not limited to, that certain
Letter Agreement dated June&nbsp;2, 2004, between AOL and AOLA, as amended. No modification of or
amendment to this Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under this Agreement, shall be effective
unless in writing signed by both parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Amendment</B></U>. No change, amendment or modification of any provision of this Agreement shall
be valid unless set forth in a written instrument signed by the Party subject to enforcement of
such amendment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Further Assurances</B></U>. AOLA shall take such action (including, but not limited to, the
execution, acknowledgment and delivery of documents) as may reasonably be requested by AOL for the
implementation or continuing performance of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Assignment</B></U>. AOLA shall not assign this Agreement or any right, interest or benefit under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of AOL. Assumption of the Agreement by any
successor to AOLA (including, without limitation, by way of merger, consolidation or sale of all or
substantially all of AOLA&#146;s stock or assets) shall be subject to AOL&#146;s prior written approval.
Subject to the foregoing, this Agreement shall be fully binding upon, inure to the benefit of and
be enforceable by the Parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Severability</B></U>. If any term, condition or provision in this Agreement is found to be
invalid, unlawful or unenforceable to any extent, the parties shall endeavor in good faith to agree
to such amendments that will preserve, as far as possible, the intentions expressed in this
Agreement. If the parties fail to agree on such an amendment, such invalid term, condition or
provision will be severed from the remaining terms, conditions and provisions, which will continue
to be valid and enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>Remedies</B></U>. Except where otherwise specified, the rights and remedies granted to a Party
under this Agreement are cumulative and in addition to, and not in lieu of, any other rights or
remedies which the Party may possess at law or in equity.

claim, dispute, controversy or disagreement (each a &#147;Dispute&#148;) between the Parties or any of their
respective subsidiaries, affiliates, successors and assigns under or related to this Agreement or
any document executed pursuant to this Agreement or any of the transactions contemplated hereby. If
the Parties cannot resolve the Dispute within such timeframe, the Dispute shall be submitted to the
Management Committee for resolution. For ten (10)&nbsp;days after the Dispute was submitted to the
Management Committee, the Management Committee shall have the exclusive right to resolve such
Dispute; provided further that the Management Committee shall have the final and exclusive right to
resolve Disputes arising from any provision of this Agreement which expressly or implicitly
provides for the Parties to reach mutual agreement as to certain terms. If the Management
Committee is unable to amicably resolve the Dispute during the ten (10)&nbsp;day period, then the
Management Committee will consider in good faith the possibility of retaining a third party
mediator to facilitate resolution of the Dispute. In the event the Management Committee elects not
to retain a mediator, the Dispute will be subject to the resolution mechanisms described below.
&#147;Management Committee&#148; shall mean a committee made up of a senior executive from each of the
Parties for the purpose of resolving Disputes under this Section and generally overseeing the

the Southern District of New York or in the state courts of New York) all Disputes which may arise
between the parties, out of, in relation to, or in connection with this Agreement, or the breach
thereof, shall be finally settled by binding arbitration pursuant to the Commercial Arbitration
Rules of the American Arbitration Association in effect as of the date the dispute arises. Any
such arbitration shall be under the rules and administration of the American Arbitration
Association&#146;s New York, New York office, and all hearings shall be held in New York, New York. The
arbitrator(s) shall enforce the express terms of this Agreement, shall follow the applicable law
where the Agreement is silent on a matter in dispute, and shall have no authority to award punitive
damages nor any damages expressly excluded by the terms of this Agreement. All proceedings in any
arbitration shall be conducted in the English language. The arbitrator&#146;s award may be enforced in

Resource</B>&#148;) devoted and 100% dedicated to the Content Programming Services during the term of
this Statement of Work. The Parties acknowledge and agree that the Work set forth in this
document that will be required to provide the Content Programming Services shall require the
following Dedicated Resources during the term of this Statement of Work.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:7%; font-size: 11pt">1. Two (2)&nbsp;programmers to support Entretenimiento;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:7%; font-size: 11pt">2. One (1)&nbsp;programmer to support Deportes;

<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">AOLA will screen, interview and assign Dedicated Resources, and will comply with any other
assignment criteria mutually agreed to by the Parties necessary to perform the Content
Programming Services.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">AOLA will manage all employment aspects of the Dedicated Resources assigned to AOL, to
include hiring, employment-based counseling, terminations, salary review, performance
evaluations, work schedules, orientation and placement. AOLA shall be solely responsible
for the payment of wages and incentives to the Dedicated Resources for work performed on the
Services hereunder, and will be solely responsible for applicable employment taxes.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">B. <I>Assignment</I>. If AOLA does not retain the Dedicated Resources as set forth in Section
II.A. above by the Hire Date, then the fees payable under this Schedule&nbsp;No.&nbsp;1 shall be
reduced on a pro rata basis for each person and each week during which there are any
Dedicated Resources not retained.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">C. <I>Flexibility of Dedicated Resources: </I>Upon sixty (60)&nbsp;days&#146; prior written notice, AOL may
reasonably require that AOLA reallocate the programmers included in the Dedicated Resources
to different channels within the AOL Latino Service or substitute one or more Dedicated
Resources with different skill sets. To the extent that AOLA incurs any direct
out-of-pocket costs for such substitution (e.g., severance and hiring costs) or reallocation
(e.g., training costs) of Dedicated Resources, AOLA shall notify AOL of such costs in
writing, and shall provide appropriate documentation; if AOL agrees to pay such costs, AOLA
shall substitute or reallocate the Dedicated Resources as reasonably required by AOL.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:4%; font-size: 11pt">D. <I>Replacement of Dedicated Resources</I>: If three (3)&nbsp;times in any thirty (30)&nbsp;day period, a
Dedicated Resource delivers Work that either (1)&nbsp;does not materially meet AOL&#146;s standards
and requirements, as provided by AOL from time to time (the &#147;<U>Standards</U>&#148;) and is not
cured as directed by AOL or (2)&nbsp;does not meet the delivery schedule for such work product
(each such event, an &#147;<U>Occurrence</U>&#148;), AOL shall notify AOLA in writing of the third
such Occurrence, and the parties will have a discussion within one week of the notice to try
to resolve any problems. If over the next 30&nbsp;days, there is another Occurrence, AOL shall
have the right to have AOLA replace such Dedicated Resource within thirty days by delivering
notice thereof to AOLA (a &#147;Dedicated Resource Replacement Notice&#148;). If AOLA is unable to
find a qualified replacement for any terminated Dedicated Resource within 30&nbsp;days of receipt
of a Dedicated Resource Replacement Notice, AOLA shall provide a temporary Dedicated
Resource that is fully dedicated to the Latino project until a permanent Dedicated Resource
is retained. If such temporary Dedicated Resource is not fully dedicated or does not meet
the Standards or delivery schedule over any two week period, the Service Fee shall be
reduced pro rata (retroactive to the start date of such temporary Dedicated Resource) for
each week such Dedicated Resource is not replaced. AOLA shall bear the costs related to
replacing any such Dedicated Resource, including, but not limited to severance costs and
hiring costs.
