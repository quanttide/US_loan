(a) Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures.<br><br>Section 404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("SOX 404") requires detailed review, documentation and testing of our internal controls over financial reporting.  This detailed review, documentation and testing includes an assessment of the risks that could adversely affect the timely and accurate preparation of our financial statements and the identification of internal controls that are currently in place to mitigate the risks of untimely or inaccurate preparation of these financial statements.  The Public Company Accounting Oversight Board has defined "material weakness" as "a significant deficiency or combination of significant deficiencies, that results in more than a remote likelihood that a material misstatement of the annual or interim financial statements will not be prevented or detected."  On December 21, 2004, management of Financial Institutions, Inc. (the "Company") advised the Audit Committee of our Board of Directors of certain condi
tions that it concluded constitute a material weakness in our internal controls relating to financial reporting, with which the Audit Committee concurs.  These conditions relate to findings pertaining to the commercial-related loan portfolios at Wyoming County Bank ("WCB") and National Bank of Geneva ("NBG") contained in recently completed loan review reports as of June 30, 2004 performed by the outside loan review firm retained by the Company to review the loan portfolios at all four of the Company&#x2019;s bank subsidiaries, and to similar findings contained in recently issued Reports of Examination ("ROEs") for NBG and Bath National Bank ("BNB") covering the period ending December 31, 2003 issued by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ("OCC") to the Boards of NBG and BNB.<br><br>The Company has taken various corrective actions to remediate these conditions.  By their nature such actions require a period of time to influence the entire portfolio.  It is important to note that the NBG and BNB ROEs
 are based on an "as of" date of December 31, 2003, the outside loan review reports are based on an "as of" date of June 30, 2004 and that significant efforts to increase the Company&#x2019;s supervision of the credit administration function at its banks and to improve training and hiring of bank personnel have been made in 2004.  During 2004, the Company has significantly increased the staff and resources available to its Chief Risk Officer and the centralized credit administration function that reports to him.  Corporate commercial risk officers with credit administration oversight responsibility have been added at the holding company level to support the Company&#x2019;s banking subsidiaries.  The position of Chief of Community Banking has been created and filled, to provide greater consistency and oversight of the commercial-related loan administration function at all four bank subsidiaries.  New Board members have been added at NBG and BNB, and the Board-level compliance committees have been reorganized
, with access to an outside consultant experienced in OCC compliance matters.  Centralized control has been implemented for all risk-rating reviews.  In addition, Corporate Credit Administration is in the process of completing a comprehensive special review of the commercial-related loan portfolio.  Also, notwithstanding the high level of criticized loans at both banks, many of these loans continue to perform in terms of the borrowers making timely principal and interest payments.<br><br>The outside loan review firm found the following with respect to the loan portfolios at WCB and NBG:  (i) a significant percentage of loans in the loan portfolios were identified as being improperly graded; (ii) in the case of WCB, new information pertinent to risk ratings was not acted upon in a timely manner; and (iii) there were deficiencies in loan portfolio administration at both banks, including incomplete or inaccurate credit analyses, poorly organized files and insufficient documentation of collateral.  <br><br>In th
e case of NBG, a number of the loan review report findings are consistent with the recently issued ROE.  In its reports for both NBG and BNB, the OCC concluded that some of the banks&#x2019; credit analysts and lenders were inexperienced and lacked adequate training and oversight and that there was an unacceptably high level of loan files with outdated, incomplete or inaccurate financial information.  In addition, in the case of NBG, the OCC found that credit risk remained high and was increasing, and that, during the period covered by the examination, NBG&#x2019;s Board and management supervision was unsatisfactory.  Overall, the OCC found that there was substantial noncompliance with the terms of the NBG Formal Agreement entered into in September 2003, and stated that until problem loan levels decrease, loan losses subside and reputation risk stabilizes, it is highly unlikely that it will approve any dividend in the near future.  Due to the OCC&#x2019;s overall rating, NBG&#x2019;s FDIC insurance premiums 
will increase significantly during 2005, with an estimated impact on 2005 earnings of approximately $.05 per share.<br><br>With respect to BNB, the OCC also found a substantial number of instances of noncompliance with the Formal Agreement entered into in September 2003, although the OCC found that the Board&#x2019;s compliance committee had strengthened its supervision and oversight since the prior examination.  As with NBG, the OCC found that credit risk at BNB remained high and was increasing, and stated that until the high level of criticized assets is effectively reduced, payment of dividends would not be considered prudent.  In light of this, it is unlikely that the OCC would approve payment of a dividend to the Company in the near future.<br><br>The Company&#x2019;s four subsidiary banks are the principal source of liquidity for the Company.  Under the terms of the Formal Agreements, NBG and BNB must obtain OCC approval of their capital plans prior to being able to pay any dividends, and neither bank 
has received approval for its capital plan.  Continued restrictions on the ability of NBG and BNB to pay dividends would adversely impact the Company&#x2019;s ability to maintain its current level of dividends.<br><br>A new examination cycle is scheduled to begin at NBG and BNB in early January 2005.  The Company&#x2019;s Chief Risk Officer will be closely coordinating the efforts of his office with the OCC examination teams at NBG and BNB to ensure complete communication and timely resolution of questions or issues identified by the OCC.  The Company believes that significant progress was made during the second half of 2004 (after both the OCC and outside loan review examinations closed) in addressing the most significant areas of noncompliance identified by the OCC.  Whether the OCC concurs will not be known until the completion of the next examination cycle and the issuance of exit findings by the OCC.  In addition, the Company is exploring options to reduce the levels of problem loans at WCB, BNB and NBG

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><FONT style="font-size: 16pt"><B>Financial Institutions, Inc. Reports on Material Weakness in Financial Reporting Controls</B></FONT>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 16pt"><FONT style="font-size: 12pt">WARSAW, N.Y., December&nbsp;28, 2004 &#151; Financial Institutions, Inc. (NASDAQ:FISI) today
reported that its management has advised the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of certain
conditions that it has concluded constitute a material weakness in its internal controls relating
to financial reporting. The Audit Committee has concurred with management&#146;s finding. The
conditions that led to the conclusion of a material deficiency in financial reporting are
associated with findings from recently issued reports from an outside loan review firm retained by
the Company and also by Reports of Examination (ROEs) from the Office of the Comptroller of the
Currency (&#147;OCC&#148;) recently issued to the Boards of National Bank of Geneva (&#147;NBG&#148;) and Bath National
Bank (&#147;BNB&#148;), both wholly owned subsidiaries of the Company.</FONT>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">The Company retained a loan review firm to review the loan portfolios at all four of the
Company&#146;s bank subsidiaries. The reports of the review, which were recently completed, were as of
June&nbsp;30, 2004, and contained findings pertaining to the commercial-related loan portfolios at
Wyoming County Bank (&#147;WCB&#148;) and NBG that were similar to the findings contained in the recently
issued ROEs for NBG and BNB covering the period ending December&nbsp;31, 2003.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 12pt"><U><B>Corrective Actions Implemented During 2004</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">The Company has taken various corrective actions to remediate these conditions. By their
nature such actions require a period of time to influence the entire portfolio. It is important to
note that the NBG and BNB ROEs are based on an &#147;as of&#148; date of December&nbsp;31, 2003, the outside loan
review reports were based on an &#147;as of&#148; date of June&nbsp;30, 2004 and that significant efforts to
increase the Company&#146;s supervision of the credit administration function at its banks and to
improve training and hiring of bank personnel have been made in 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">Peter Humphrey, Chairman, President and CEO stated, &#147;We have been diligently working to repair
the situations at NBG, BNB and WCB and believe we have made considerable progress through the
addition of new personnel and greater oversight of the loan portfolio activities by the Company&#146;s
management. It will take time before these changes positively impact the entire commercial loan
portfolios. We will continue to enforce the higher credit standards, centralized administration
and detailed inspections of loan records until we can surpass the standards expected of us by the
OCC.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">During 2004, the Company has measurably increased the staff and resources available to its
Chief Risk Officer and the centralized credit administration function that reports to him.
Corporate commercial risk officers with credit administration oversight responsibility have been
added at the holding company level to support the Company&#146;s banking subsidiaries. The position of
Chief of Community Banking has been created and filled, to provide greater consistency and
oversight of the commercial-related loan administration function at all four bank subsidiaries.
New Board members have been added at NBG and BNB, and the Board-level compliance committees have
been reorganized, with access to an outside consultant experienced in OCC compliance matters.
Centralized control has been implemented for all risk-rating reviews. Currently, Corporate Credit
Administration is in the process of completing a comprehensive special review of the
commercial-related loan portfolio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">Also, notwithstanding the high level of criticized loans at both banks, many of these
criticized loans continue to perform in terms of the borrowers making timely principal and interest
payments.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 12pt"><U><B>Findings by Outside Loan Review Firm</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">The outside loan review firm found the following with respect to the loan portfolios at WCB
and NBG:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">(i)&nbsp;A significant percentage of loans in the loan portfolios were identified as being
improperly graded;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">(ii)&nbsp;In the case of WCB, new information pertinent to risk ratings was not acted upon in a
timely manner; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">(iii)&nbsp;There were deficiencies in loan portfolio administration at both banks, including
incomplete or inaccurate credit analyses, poorly organized files and insufficient documentation of
collateral.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 12pt"><U><B>Reports of Examination</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">In the case of NBG, a number of the loan review report findings were consistent with its
recently issued ROE. In its reports for both NBG and BNB, the OCC concluded that some of the
banks&#146; credit analysts and lenders were inexperienced and lacked adequate training and oversight
and that there was an unacceptably high level of loan files with outdated, incomplete or inaccurate
financial information. In addition, in the case of NBG, the OCC found that credit risk remained
high and was increasing, and that, during the period covered by the examination, NBG&#146;s Board and
management supervision was unsatisfactory. Overall, the OCC found that there was substantial
noncompliance with the terms of the NBG Formal Agreement entered into in September&nbsp;2003, and stated
that until problem loan levels decrease, loan losses subside and reputation risk stabilizes, it is
highly unlikely that it will approve any dividend in the near future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">With respect to BNB, the OCC also found a substantial number of instances of noncompliance
with the Formal Agreement entered into in September&nbsp;2003, although the OCC found that the Board&#146;s
compliance committee had strengthened its supervision and oversight since the prior examination.
As with NBG, the OCC found that credit risk at BNB remained high and was increasing, and stated
that until the high level of criticized assets is effectively reduced, payment of dividends would
not be considered prudent. In light of this, it is unlikely that the OCC would approve payment of
a dividend to the Company in the near future.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 12pt"><U><B>Financial Impact</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">FII&#146;s four subsidiary banks are the principal source of liquidity for the Company. Under the
terms of the formal agreements entered into by BNB and NBG with the OCC, the banks must obtain OCC
approval of their capital plan prior to paying dividends, and neither bank has received approval
for its capital plan. Continued restrictions on the ability of NBG and BNB to pay dividends would
adversely impact the Company&#146;s ability to maintain its current level of dividends. Due to the
OCC&#146;s overall rating of NBG, the Company expects FDIC insurance premiums to be measurably higher,
with an estimated impact on 2005 earnings of approximately $.05 per share.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:2%; font-size: 12pt"><U><B>Looking Forward</B></U>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">A new examination cycle is scheduled to begin at NBG and BNB in early January&nbsp;2005. The
Company&#146;s Chief Risk Officer will be closely coordinating the efforts of his office with the OCC
examination teams at NBG and BNB to ensure complete communication and timely resolution of
questions or issues identified by the OCC.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 2%">Mr.&nbsp;Humphrey added, &#147;As I mentioned, we believe that we have made substantial progress during
the second half of 2004 to especially address the most significant areas of noncompliance
identified by the OCC. Whether the OCC concurs with our remediation efforts will not be known
until the completion of the next examination cycle, which will be as of the end of 2004, and the
issuance of their exit findings. In the meantime, we will continue to aggressively monitor and
test the controls in the areas of concern, as well as exploring options to reduce the levels of our
problem loans at WCB, BNB, and NBG.&#148;
