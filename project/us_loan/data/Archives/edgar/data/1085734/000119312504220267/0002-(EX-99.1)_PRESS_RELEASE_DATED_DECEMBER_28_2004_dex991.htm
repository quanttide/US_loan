Inc. (NYSE: BBI, BBI.B) today announced that it intends to commence a cash tender offer by mid-January to purchase all of the outstanding shares of Hollywood Entertainment Corporation (Nasdaq: HLYW) for $11.50 per share in cash, if Blockbuster is
unable to obtain substantial cooperation from Hollywood&#146;s Board of Directors that is likely to lead to an agreement for an acquisition of Hollywood by Blockbuster. Importantly, Blockbuster also reiterated its willingness to consider a higher
price if Hollywood&#146;s Board cooperates and if the financial and other information sought from Hollywood support such an increase. Blockbuster has not been given access to such Hollywood information. Following the completion of any tender offer,
Blockbuster intends to acquire any shares not purchased in the tender at the same per share cash price paid in the tender offer, pursuant to a merger by a subsidiary of Blockbuster with and into Hollywood. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Blockbuster&#146;s proposal represents a substantial premium over the price
provided in the current merger agreement between Hollywood and the buying group comprised of Leonard Green Partners and Hollywood&#146;s chairman, Mark Wattles, which is valued at $10.25 per share. The total value of the Blockbuster transaction,
including Hollywood&#146;s debt, would be approximately $1 billion. The proposed transaction would be immediately accretive to Blockbuster&#146;s earnings per share and cash flow. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;We believe that the proposal Blockbuster is prepared to make is clearly in the best interests of Hollywood and
Blockbuster shareholders as well as consumers,&#148; said John Antioco, Blockbuster Chairman and CEO. &#147;Additionally, as we have said before, we believe the proposed transaction will better position Blockbuster to compete in the rapidly changing
home entertainment marketplace.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The tender offer will be
subject to customary conditions, including the expiration or termination of the applicable waiting period under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (&#147;HSR&#148;), the termination of Hollywood&#146;s existing merger agreement for the
Leonard Green Partners transaction, certain actions to ensure that the Oregon control share acquisition statute and business combination statute are not applicable to Blockbuster following the tender offer, and the receipt of funds under
Blockbuster&#146;s financing arrangements that are being put in place for the tender offer. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Blockbuster believes that this proposed acquisition is pro-competitive, &#147; said Antioco. &#147;In recent years,
the home entertainment landscape has broadened considerably. Blockbuster today faces strong competitive challenges from the aggressive sale of DVDs by mass merchants and online retailers, as well as increasing penetration by premium cable and
satellite services. Additionally, we believe the strength of competition from these and other emerging sources, such as video-on-demand and computer downloading, is likely to increase significantly in the future.&#148; </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Blockbuster believes the combination with Hollywood will allow it to provide
a better overall customer experience. Blockbuster has taken important steps to deal with increasing competition by expanding its in-store offerings to include movie and game trading, store-in-store game boutiques, and an increased retail selection
of both new and used movies and games. The Company has also begun giving consumers new ways to rent through in-store movie, in-store game and online DVD rental subscription programs, which offer no due dates, no late fees and an unlimited number of
movie and game rentals, up to three at a time, depending on the program, for one low monthly fee. Additionally, Blockbuster recently reduced its online rental program to $14.99 per month and, in a groundbreaking move, eliminated late fees for all
U.S. company-operated stores as of Jan.1, 2005. As a result of the elimination of late fees, which in effect decreases its rental prices, Blockbuster previously announced its plans to reduce 2005 capital expenditures through fewer store openings and
remodels. An acquisition of Hollywood would allow Blockbuster to immediately accelerate its plans to bring its expanded array of offerings to more consumers through an accretive acquisition of stores. </FONT></P> <P
