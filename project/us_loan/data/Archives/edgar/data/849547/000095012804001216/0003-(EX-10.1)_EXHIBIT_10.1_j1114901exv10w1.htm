Acquisition Co. may waive compliance by any other party with any representation, agreement or

such party. The failure of any party hereto to exercise any right, power or remedy provided
under this Agreement or otherwise available in respect hereof at law or in equity, or to
insist upon compliance by any other party hereto with its obligations hereunder, and any
custom or practice of the parties at variance with the terms hereof, shall not constitute a
waiver by such party of its right to exercise any such or other right, power or remedy or to
demand such compliance.
