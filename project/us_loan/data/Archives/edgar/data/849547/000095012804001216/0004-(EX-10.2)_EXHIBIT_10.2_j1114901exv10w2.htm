<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">STOCK OPTION AGREEMENT



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Stock Option Agreement is made and entered into as of December&nbsp;20,
2004, by and among Black Box Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Parent&#148;), SF
Acquisition Co., a Minnesota corporation and a wholly-owned subsidiary of
Parent (&#147;Acquisition Co.&#148;), and Norstan, Inc., a Minnesota corporation (the
&#147;Company&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company, Parent and Acquisition Co. are entering into an
Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;) of even date herewith
providing for (a)&nbsp;a cash tender offer to purchase any and all outstanding
shares of (i)&nbsp;common stock, $.10 par value per share, of the Company (the
&#147;Common Stock&#148;) and the associated Rights (as defined in the Merger Agreement),
at the Per-Share Amount, as defined in the Merger Agreement, net to the seller
in cash without interest thereon, upon the terms and subject to the conditions
set forth in the Merger Agreement (the &#147;Offer&#148;); and (b)&nbsp;the merger (the
&#147;Merger&#148;) of Acquisition Co. with and into the Company; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, as a condition to the willingness of Parent and Acquisition Co.
to enter into the Merger Agreement and commence the Offer, Parent and
Acquisition Co. have requested, and the Company has agreed to grant Acquisition
Co., the option to purchase, as described herein, authorized but unissued
shares of Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants
and agreements set forth herein, and for other good and valuable consideration
the sufficiency of which is hereby acknowledged, the parties, intending to be
legally bound, agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Grant of Option. On the terms and subject to the conditions of this
Agreement, the Company hereby grants to Acquisition Co. an irrevocable option
(the &#147;Option&#148;) to purchase for the Per-Share Amount, as defined in the Merger
Agreement (the &#147;Purchase Price&#148;), shares of Common Stock, in such relative
amounts as shall be determined by Acquisition Co. in its sole and absolute
discretion, up to such number of shares which, upon exercise, would result in
Acquisition Co. owning in excess of ninety percent (90%) of the
then-outstanding shares of Common Stock on an as-converted, fully-diluted basis
(collectively, the &#147;Optioned Shares&#148;); provided, that the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable under the Option may not exceed the number of authorized
but unissued shares of Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Exercise of Option. Subject to the two immediately succeeding
sentences, the Option may be exercised by Acquisition Co., in whole or in part,
at any one time after the Offer Closing Date (as defined in the Merger
Agreement) and until the earlier of (a)&nbsp;immediately following the Closing Date
(as defined in the Merger Agreement) and (b)&nbsp;the termination of the Merger
Agreement in accordance with its terms. The exercise of the Option is
conditioned upon Acquisition Co. and the Parent owning in the aggregate,
immediately following such exercise, at least ninety percent (90%) of the
outstanding shares of Common Stock. The obligation of the Company to deliver
the Optioned Shares at the Option Closing is subject to the following
conditions: (i)&nbsp;any applicable waiting period under the HSR Act relating to the
issuance of the Optioned Shares will have expired or been terminated, (ii)&nbsp;no
provision of any applicable law or regulation and no judgment, injunction or
decree shall prohibit the exercise of the Option or the

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">delivery of the Optioned Shares in respect of such exercise and (iii)
Acquisition Co. shall have accepted for payment pursuant to the Offer shares of
Common Stock constituting at least 80% of the shares of Common Stock then
outstanding. In the event Acquisition Co. wishes to exercise the Option,
Acquisition Co. shall give a written notice (the &#147;Notice&#148;) to the Company of
its intention to exercise the Option, specifying the number of Optioned Shares
to be purchased. Such notice shall be delivered to the Company in accordance
with the requirements of Section&nbsp;7(d), and shall specify a date (which may be
the date of such notice) not more than three (3)&nbsp;business days from the date
such Notice is given for the purchase of the Optioned Shares. The closing (the
&#147;Option Closing&#148;) of the purchase of the Optioned Shares shall take place at
the offices of Buchanan Ingersoll PC, 301 Grant Street, One Oxford Centre, 20th
Floor, Pittsburgh, PA 15219, or at such other location as Acquisition Co. shall
elect. If any decree, injunction, order, law or regulation shall not permit
the purchase of the Optioned Shares to be consummated on the date specified in
such Notice, the date for the Option Closing shall be as soon as practicable
following the cessation of such restriction on consummation, but in any event
within two (2)&nbsp;business days thereof, and in no event shall such purchase be
consummated after the termination of this Option pursuant to Section&nbsp;2. The
Notice shall be revocable by Acquisition Co. at any time prior to the exercise
of the Option.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Payment and Delivery of Certificate(s). At the Option Closing
hereunder, (a)&nbsp;Acquisition Co. shall make payment to the Company of the
aggregate price for the par value of the Optioned Shares so purchased in
official bank check or by wire transfer to a bank designated in writing by the
Company; (b)&nbsp;Acquisition Co. shall deliver to the Company a Promissory Note
substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;A (the &#147;Note&#148;) for the
aggregate price for the Optioned Shares so purchased minus the amount paid in
accordance with clause 3(a); and (c)&nbsp;the Company shall deliver to Acquisition
Co. a certificate or certificates representing the number of Optioned Shares so
purchased registered in the name of Acquisition Co.. Certificates for Optioned
Shares delivered at the Option Closing may be endorsed with a restrictive
legend that shall read substantially as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;THE SECURITIES OFFERED HEREBY ARE SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS ON
TRANSFERABILITY AND RESALE AND MAY NOT BE TRANSFERRED OR RESOLD EXCEPT AS
PERMITTED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 AND APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES
LAWS, PURSUANT TO REGISTRATION OR EXEMPTION THEREFROM.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is understood and agreed that the reference to the resale restrictions
of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Act&#148;), in the above legend
shall be removed by delivery of substitute certificate(s) without such
reference if Parent shall have delivered to the Company a copy of an opinion of
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Company to the effect that registration
of the future resale of the Optioned Shares is not required and that such
legend is not required for purposes of the Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Representations and Warranties of the Company. The Company hereby
represents and warrants (such representations and warranties being deemed
repeated at and as of any Option Closing hereunder) to Parent and Acquisition
