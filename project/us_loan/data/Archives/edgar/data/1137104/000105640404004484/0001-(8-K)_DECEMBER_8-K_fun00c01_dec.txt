     265330800     The loan remains in payment default, and the debt has been accelerated with third party
                   reports in progress.  The borrower has engaged CBRE to market the property for sale.
                   Initial bids and best and final bids have been received and are being evaluated.  Given
                   that the borrower is turning over cash flow, continuing to operate the property
                   responsibly, and is making a serious effort to try to resolve the loan through a sale or
                   possible refinance, the foreclosure will be postponed to February 2005, in the  event no
                   sale is approved.


     265330743     The short term forbearance agreement terminated on November 30, 2004. Meanwhile, the
                   borrower has negotiated a discounted payoff of $9,500,000 by 12/31/04. The proposal has
                   been approved. The debtor is working toward a close. Occupancy is reported at 83% for the
                   units, collectively.

     265330586     Borrower remitted 12/1/04 payment.  The Borrower was informed more than 30 days ago that
                   the Trust would not consent to its request for relief from debt service.  The property
                   operations continue to adequately support the ability to service the debt per the loan
                   documents.  The loan is being submitted for return to the master servicer this month.

     265330740     The principal converted his personal bankruptcy from 11 to 7 and has effectively abandoned
                   the properties.  An appointment of a receiver was granted in early July.  Confirmation of
                   the Trust's security instruments was granted on 11/08/04.  Title is expected approx. 60
                   days after confirmation, however, the Marshall's office has not provided counsel with a
                   sale date.  The note has been listed for sale and bids are current under review to
                   determine whether taking title to the Property or selling the note will result in a
                   greater return to the certificateholders.
