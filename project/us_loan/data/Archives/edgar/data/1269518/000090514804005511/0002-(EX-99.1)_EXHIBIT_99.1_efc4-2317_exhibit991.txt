The analysis in this report is based on information provided by Deutsche
Mortgage Securities, Inc. (the "Seller"). Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
("DBSI" or the "Underwriter") makes no representations as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information contained herein. The information contained
herein is qualified in its entirety by the information in the prospectus and
prospectus supplement (collectively, the "Prospectus") for this transaction.
The information contained herein is preliminary as of the date hereof,
supersedes any previous information delivered to you by DBSI and will be
superseded by the applicable Prospectus and any other information subsequently
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These materials are subject
to change, completion, or amendment from time to time without notice, and DBSI
is under no obligation to keep you advised of such changes. These materials
are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or
sale of any security. Any investment decision with respect to the securities
should be made by you based upon the information contained in the Prospectus
relating to the securities. You should consult your own counsel, accountant,
and other advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related
aspects of a purchase of these securities.

The attached information contains certain tables and other statistical
analyses (the "Computational Materials") which have been prepared by DBSI in
reliance upon information furnished by the Seller. They may not be provided to
any third party other than the addressee's legal, tax, financial and/or
accounting advisors for the purposes of evaluating said material. Numerous
assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials which may or
may not be reflected herein. As such, no assurance can be given as to the
Computational Materials' accuracy, appropriateness or completeness in any
particular context; nor as to whether the Computational Materials and/or the
assumptions upon which they are based reflect present market conditions or
future market performance. These Computational Materials should not be
construed as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or
accounting advice. Any weighted average lives, yields and principal payment
periods shown in the Computational Materials are based on prepayment
assumptions, and changes in such prepayment assumptions may dramatically
affect such weighted average lives, yields and principal payment periods. In
addition, it is possible that prepayments on the underlying assets will occur
at rates slower or faster than the rates shown in the attached Computational
Materials. Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, the Computational Materials
assume no losses on the underlying assets and no interest shortfalls. The
specific characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the
Computational Materials due to differences between the actual underlying
assets and the hypothetical underlying assets used in preparing the
Computational Materials. The principal amount and designation of any security
described in the Computational Materials are subject to change prior to
issuance. Neither DBSI nor any of its affiliates makes any representation or
warranty as to the actual rate or timing of payments on any of the underlying
assets or the payments or yield on the securities.

An investor or potential investor in the securities (and each employee,
representative, or other agent of such person or entity) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transaction (as defined in United States Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4) and all related materials of any kind, including opinions or other
tax analyses, that are provided to such person or entity. However, such person
or entity may not disclose any other information relating to this transaction
unless such information is related to such tax treatment and tax structure.

THIS INFORMATION IS FURNISHED TO YOU SOLELY BY DBSI AND NOT BY THE ISSUER OF
THE SECURITIES OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES (OTHER THAN DBSI). DBSI IS ACTING AS
UNDERWRITER AND NOT ACTING AS AGENT FOR THE ISSUER IN CONNECTION WITH THE
PROPOSED TRANSACTION.

                             year fixed rate interest only loans.

                             principal and interest on the mortgage loans to the extent the Master Servicer believes that
                             the cash advances can be repaid from future payments on the mortgage loans.  These cash
                             advances are only intended to maintain a regular flow of scheduled interest and principal
                             payments on the certificates and are not intended to guarantee or insure against losses.

Compensating Interest:   o   On each Distribution Date, the Master Servicer is required to cover certain interest
                             shortfalls as a result of certain prepayments as more fully described in the prospectus
                             supplement.

Allocation of Losses:    o   Realized Losses on the Group II Mortgage  Loans will be allocated to the most junior class
                             of Certificates outstanding  beginning with the Class  B-5 Certificates, until the Certificate
                             Principal Balance of the Subordinate and Mezzanine Certificates has been reduced to zero.
                             Thereafter, Realized Losses on the Group II mortgage Loans will be allocated pro rata to the Class
                             II Senior Certificates.

                         o   Excess losses on the Mortgage Loans (bankruptcy, special hazard and fraud losses in excess of the
                             amounts established byt the rating agencies) will be allocated, pro rata, to the Class II Senior and
                             Subordinate Certificates.

The analysis in this report is based on information provided by Deutsche
Mortgage Securities, Inc. (the "Seller"). Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
("DBSI" or the "Underwriter") makes no representations as to the accuracy or
completeness of the information contained herein. The information contained
herein is qualified in its entirety by the information in the prospectus and
prospectus supplement (collectively, the "Prospectus") for this transaction.
The information contained herein is preliminary as of the date hereof,
supersedes any previous information delivered to you by DBSI and will be
superseded by the applicable Prospectus and any other information subsequently
filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission. These materials are subject
to change, completion, or amendment from time to time without notice, and DBSI
is under no obligation to keep you advised of such changes. These materials
are not intended as an offer or solicitation with respect to the purchase or
sale of any security. Any investment decision with respect to the securities
should be made by you based upon the information contained in the Prospectus
relating to the securities. You should consult your own counsel, accountant,
and other advisors as to the legal, tax, business, financial and related
aspects of a purchase of these securities.

The attached information contains certain tables and other statistical
analyses (the "Computational Materials") which have been prepared by DBSI in
reliance upon information furnished by the Seller. They may not be provided to
any third party other than the addressee's legal, tax, financial and/or
accounting advisors for the purposes of evaluating said material. Numerous
assumptions were used in preparing the Computational Materials which may or
may not be reflected herein. As such, no assurance can be given as to the
Computational Materials' accuracy, appropriateness or completeness in any
particular context; nor as to whether the Computational Materials and/or the
assumptions upon which they are based reflect present market conditions or
future market performance. These Computational Materials should not be
construed as either projections or predictions or as legal, tax, financial or
accounting advice. Any weighted average lives, yields and principal payment
periods shown in the Computational Materials are based on prepayment
assumptions, and changes in such prepayment assumptions may dramatically
affect such weighted average lives, yields and principal payment periods. In
addition, it is possible that prepayments on the underlying assets will occur
at rates slower or faster than the rates shown in the attached Computational
Materials. Furthermore, unless otherwise provided, the Computational Materials
assume no losses on the underlying assets and no interest shortfalls. The
specific characteristics of the securities may differ from those shown in the
Computational Materials due to differences between the actual underlying
assets and the hypothetical underlying assets used in preparing the
Computational Materials. The principal amount and designation of any security
described in the Computational Materials are subject to change prior to
issuance. Neither DBSI nor any of its affiliates makes any representation or
warranty as to the actual rate or timing of payments on any of the underlying
assets or the payments or yield on the securities.

An investor or potential investor in the securities (and each employee,
representative, or other agent of such person or entity) may disclose to any
and all persons, without limitation, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transaction (as defined in United States Treasury Regulation Section
1.6011-4) and all related materials of any kind, including opinions or other
tax analyses, that are provided to such person or entity. However, such person
or entity may not disclose any other information relating to this transaction
unless such information is related to such tax treatment and tax structure.

THIS INFORMATION IS FURNISHED TO YOU SOLELY BY DBSI AND NOT BY THE ISSUER OF
THE SECURITIES OR ANY OF ITS AFFILIATES (OTHER THAN DBSI). DBSI IS ACTING AS
UNDERWRITER AND NOT ACTING AS AGENT FOR THE ISSUER IN CONNECTION WITH THE
PROPOSED TRANSACTION.

Credit Enhancement:        o        Credit Enhancement for the Group I Certificates will be provided by a senior/subordinate
                                    shifting interest structure. The Mezzanine and Subordinate Certificates are
                                    cross-collateralized and provide credit enhancement for the related senior certificates.

Cap Contract:              o        Beginning with the February 2005 Distribution Date, the Class I-A-3 Certificates will have the
                                    benefit of an interest rate cap rate cap contract. With respect to each applicable Distribution
                                    date, the amount payable by the cap counterparty will equal the product of (i) the excess (if
                                    any) of One-Month LIBOR over 5.10% (subject to a ceiling of 9.10%), (ii) the lesser of (x) the
                                    Cap Contract Notional Balance (as shown in the table below) for such Distribution Date and (y)
                                    the Class Certificate Balance of the Class I-A-3 Certificates immediately prior to such
                                    Distribution Date and (iii) one-twelfth.

Advances:                  o        The Master Servicer will make cash advances with respect to delinquent payments of principal
                                    and interest on the mortgage loans to the extent the Master Servicer believes that the cash
                                    advances can be repaid from future payments on the mortgage loans. These cash advances are only
                                    intended to maintain a regular flow of scheduled interest and principal payments on the
                                    certificates and are not intended to guarantee or insure against losses.

Compensating Interest:     o        On each Distribution Date, the Master Servicer is required to cover certain interest shortfalls
                                    as a result of certain prepayments as more fully described in the prospectus supplement.

Allocation of Losses:      o        Realized Losses on the Group I Mortgage Loans will be allocated to the most junior class of
                                    Certificates outstanding beginning with the Class B-5 Certificates, until the Certificate
                                    Principal Balance of the Subordinate and Mezzanine Certificates has been reduced to zero.
                                    Thereafter, Realized Losses on the Group I Mortgage Loans will be allocated pro rata to the
                                    Class I Senior Certificates.

                           o        Excess losses on the Mortgage Loans (bankruptcy, special hazard and fraud losses in excess
                                    of the amounts established by the rating agencies) will be allocated, pro rata, to the Class I
                                    Senior and Subordinate Certificates.

Accretion Termination      o        The earlier to occur of (i) the distribution date on which the Certificate Principal Balance of

Accrual Distribution Amount:        On each distribution date preceding the Accretion Termination Date, an amount equal to the
                                    aggregate amount of Accrued Certificate Interest on the Class I-A-6 Certificate for such date
                                    which will be added to the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class I-A-6 Certificate to the
                                    extent such amount is required to be distributed to the holders of the Class I-A-5
                                    Certificate, as principal in reduction of the Certificate Principal Balances of the Class
                                    I-A-5 Certificates. The amount that is added to the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class
                                    I-A-6 Certificate will accrue interest at a rate of 5.50% per annum. On each distribution date
                                    on or after the Accretion Termination Date, the entire Accrued Certificate Interest on the
                                    Class I-A-6 Certificate for that date will be payable to the holders of the Class I-A-6
                                    Certificate as interest, to the extent not required to fully reduce the Certificate Principal
                                    Balances of the Class I-A-5 Certificate to zero on the Accretion Termination Date; provided,
                                    however, that if the Class I-A-6 Accretion Termination Date is the Credit Support Depletion
                                    Date, the entire Accrual Distribution Amount for that date will be payable as interest to the
                                    holders of the Class I-A-6 Certificate to the extent of Accrued Certificate Interest on that
                                    class of certificate on the related distribution date.
