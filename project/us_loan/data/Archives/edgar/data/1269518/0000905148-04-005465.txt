      It is expected that during December 2004, a single series of
certificates, entitled Alternative Loan Trust 2004-32CB, Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2004-32CB (the "Certificates"), will be issued pursuant
to a pooling and servicing agreement (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"),
to be entered into by and among CWALT, Inc., as depositor, Countrywide Home
Loans, Inc., as a seller, Park Granada LLC, as a seller, Countrywide Home
Loans Servicing LP, as master servicer and The Bank of New York, as trustee.
Certain classes of the Certificates (the "Underwritten Certificates") will be
registered under the Registrant's registration statement on Form S-3 (no.
333-117949) and sold to Countrywide Securities Corporation and Lehman Brothers
Inc. (the "Underwriters") pursuant to an underwriting agreement to be entered
into by and between the Registrant and the Underwriters.

      In connection with the expected sale of the Underwritten Certificates,
the Registrant has been advised that one or more of the Underwriters has
furnished to prospective investors certain information attached hereto as
Exhibit 99.1 that may be considered "Computational Materials" (as defined in
the no-action letter dated May 20, 1994 issued by the Division of Corporation
Finance of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") to
Kidder, Peabody Acceptance Corporation I, Kidder, Peabody & Co. Incorporated,
