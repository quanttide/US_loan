            Re:   CWALT, Inc.
                  Alternative Loan Trust 2004-30CB
                  Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates,
                  Series 2004-30CB
                  ------------------------------------

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      We have acted as special counsel for CWALT, Inc., a Delaware corporation
(the "Company"), in connection with the issuance of the Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates of the above-referenced Series (the "Certificates") pursuant to a
Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 1, 2004 (the "Pooling and
Servicing Agreement"), among the Company, as depositor, Countrywide Home
Loans, Inc., as a seller ("CHL"), Park Granada LLC, as a seller ("Park
Granada" and, together with CHL, the "Sellers"), Countrywide Home Loans
Servicing LP, as master servicer (the "Master Servicer"), and The Bank of New
York, as trustee (the "Trustee").

      The Certificates will represent the entire beneficial ownership interest
in Alternative Loan Trust 2004-30CB (the "Trust Fund"). The assets of the
Trust Fund will consist primarily of a pool of conventional fixed-rate
mortgage loans (the "Mortgage Loans") secured by first liens on one- to
four-family residential properties. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

      We have examined such documents and records and made such investigations
of such matters of law as we have deemed appropriate as a basis for the
opinions expressed below. Further, we have assumed the genuineness of all
signatures and the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as originals.


                                      5
<PAGE>

      Based upon the foregoing, we are of the opinion that:

1. The Pooling and Servicing Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
   delivered by the Company, the Sellers and the Master Servicer and, assuming
   due authorization, execution and delivery by the Trustee, constitutes a
   valid, legal and binding agreement of the Company, the Sellers and the
   Master Servicer, enforceable against the Company, the Sellers and the
   Master Servicer in accordance with its terms, subject, as to
   enforceability, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or
   other similar laws affecting creditors' rights generally and to general
   principles of equity regardless of whether enforcement is sought in a
   proceeding in equity or at law. In rendering this opinion, we have relied
   on the opinions of counsel of Sandor E. Samuels as to matters involving the
   due authorization, execution and delivery of the Pooling and Servicing
   Agreement by the Depositor, the Sellers and the Master Servicer.

2. Assuming that the Certificates have been duly executed and countersigned by
   the Trustee in the manner contemplated in the Pooling and Servicing
   Agreement, when delivered and paid for, the Certificates will be validly
   issued and outstanding and entitled to the benefits of the Pooling and
   Servicing Agreement.

3. Each REMIC described in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement will qualify as
   a real estate mortgage investment conduit within the meaning of Section
   860D of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the "Code"), the
   Regular Certificates will be treated as regular interests in the Master
   REMIC, the Class A-R Certificate will represent ownership of the sole
   class of residual interest in each REMIC described in the Pooling
   and Servicing Agreement, and the interests of the holders of the Class
   1-A-7, Class 1-A-10 and Class 2-A-1 Certificates with respect to Class
   1-A-7, Class 1-A-10 and Class 2-A-1 Yield Maintenance Amounts will
   represent, for federal income tax purposes, contractual rights coupled with
   regular interests within the meaning of Treasury regulation ss. 1.860G-2(i),
   assuming: (i) an election is made to treat the assets of each REMIC as a
   real estate mortgage investment conduit, (ii) compliance with the Pooling
   and Servicing Agreement and (iii) compliance with changes in the law,
   including any amendments to the Code or applicable Treasury regulations
   thereunder.

      The opinion set forth in paragraph 3 is based upon the current
provisions of the Code and Treasury regulations issued or proposed thereunder,
Revenue Rulings and other published releases of the Internal Revenue Service
and current case law, any of which can change at any time. Any such changes
could apply retroactively and could modify the legal conclusions upon which
our opinions are based. Our opinion is limited as described above, and we do
not express an opinion on any other tax aspect of the transactions
contemplated by the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the effect of such
transactions on Countrywide Financial Corporation, any member of its federal
consolidated group or any of its wholly owned affiliates.

      In rendering the foregoing opinions, we express no opinion on the laws
of any jurisdiction other than the federal tax laws of the United States
of America, the corporate laws of the State of Delaware and the laws of the
State of New York.


                                      6

We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Company's
Report on Form 8-K dated the date hereof.
