STATEMENT REGARDING ASSUMPTIONS AS TO SECURITIES, PRICING ESTIMATES AND OTHER
INFORMATION

The information contained in the attached materials (the "Information") may
include various forms of performance analysis, security characteristics and
securities pricing estimates for the securities addressed. Please read and
understand this entire statement before utilizing the Information. The
Information is provided solely by Bear Stearns, not as agent for any issuer,
and although it may be based on data supplied to it by an issuer, the issuer
has not participated in its preparation and makes no representations regarding
its accuracy or completeness. Should you receive Information that refers to
the "Statement Regarding Assumptions and Other Information", please refer to
this statement instead.

The Information is illustrative and is not intended to predict actual results
which may differ substantially from those reflected in the Information.
Performance analysis is based on certain assumptions with respect to
significant factors that may prove not to be as assumed. You should understand
the assumptions and evaluate whether they are appropriate for your purposes.
Performance results are based on mathematical models that use inputs to
calculate results. As with all models, results may vary significantly
depending upon the value of the inputs given. Inputs to these models include
but are not limited to: prepayment expectations (econometric prepayment
models, single expected lifetime prepayments or a vector of periodic
prepayments), interest rate assumptions (parallel and nonparallel changes for
different maturity instruments), collateral assumptions (actual pool level
data, aggregated pool level data, reported factors or imputed factors),
volatility assumptions (historically observed or implied current) and reported
information (paydown factors, rate resets and trustee statements). Models used
in any analysis may be proprietary making the results difficult for any third
party to reproduce. Contact your registered representative for detailed
explanations of any modelling techniques employed in the Information.

The Information addresses only certain aspects of the applicable security's
characteristics and thus does not provide a complete assessment. As such, the
Information may not reflect the impact of all structural characteristics of
the security, including call events and cash flow priorities at all prepayment
speeds and/or interest rates. You should consider whether the behavior of
these securities should be tested at assumptions different from those included
in the Information. The assumptions underlying the Information, including
structure and collateral, may be modified from time to time to reflect changed
circumstances. Any investment decision should be based only on the data in the
prospectus and the prospectus supplement or private placement memorandum
(Offering Documents) and the then current version of the Information. Offering
Documents contain data that is current as of their publication dates and after
publication may no longer be complete or current. Contact your registered
representative for Offering Documents, current Information or additional
materials, including other models for performance analysis, which are likely
to produce different results, and any further explanation regarding the
Information.

Any pricing estimates Bear Stearns has supplied at your request (a) represent
our view, at the time determined, of the investment value of the securities
between the estimated bid and offer levels, the spread between which may be
significant due to market volatility or illiquidity, (b) do not constitute a
bid by any person for any security, (c) may not constitute prices at which the
securities could have been purchased or sold in any market, (d) have not been
confirmed by actual trades, may vary from the value Bear Stearns assigns any
such security while in its inventory, and may not take into account the size
of a position you have in the security, and (e) may have been derived from
matrix pricing that uses data relating to other securities whose prices are
more readily ascertainable to produce a hypothetical price based on the
estimated yield spread relationship between the securities.

General Information: The data underlying the Information has been obtained
from sources that we believe are reliable, but we do not guarantee the
accuracy of the underlying data or computations based thereon. Bear Stearns
and/or individuals thereof may have positions in these securities while the
Information is circulating or during such period may engage in transactions
with the issuer or its affiliates. We act as principal in transactions with
you, and accordingly, you must determine the appropriateness for you of such
transactions and address any legal, tax or accounting considerations
applicable to you. Bear Stearns shall not be a fiduciary or advisor unless we
have agreed in writing to receive compensation specifically to act in such
capacities. If you are subject to ERISA, the Information is being furnished on
the condition that it will not form a primary basis for any investment
decision. The Information is not a solicitation of any transaction in
securities which may be made only by prospectus when required by law, in which
event you may obtain such prospectus from Bear Stearns.


STATEMENT REGARDING CBO PRICING

The security evaluation set forth above has been provided at your request as
an accommodation to you. We believe it represents an estimate of value given
stable market conditions and adequate time to work an order. However, by
providing this information, we are not representing that such evaluation has
been confirmed by actual trades or that a market exists or will exit for this
security now or in the future. You should understand that our evaluation does
not represent a bid by Bear Stearns or any other person and it may vary from
the value Bear Stearns assigns such security while in our inventory.
Additionally, you should consider that under adverse market conditions and/or
deteriorating credit conditions in the collateral underlying the CBO, a
distressed or forced sale of this instrument could result in proceeds that are
far less than the evaluation provided.
