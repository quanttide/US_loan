rights and preferences as the Board of Directors shall determine.

          FIFTH.      The Board of Directors of the Corporation is expressly
authorized to make, alter or repeal by-laws of the Corporation, but the
stockholders may make additional by-laws and may alter or repeal any by-law
whether adopted by them or otherwise.

          SIXTH.      Elections of directors need not be by written ballot

may adopt any re-capitalization affecting the outstanding securities of the
Corporation by effecting a forward or reverse split of all of the outstanding
securities of the Corporation, with appropriate adjustments to the
Corporation's capital accounts, provided that the re-capitalization does not
require any change in the Articles of Incorporation of the Corporation.

          NINTH.      The Board of Directors shall have the right to change
the name of the Corporation without shareholder approval to a name that
reflects the industry or business in which the Corporation's business

of Directors, in its sole discretion, deems appropriate.
