<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt .25pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Borrower
acknowledges that prepayment of such amount may result in Bank incurring
additional costs, expenses and/or liabilities, and that it is difficult to
ascertain the full extent of such costs, expenses and/or liabilities. Borrower,
therefore, agrees to pay the above-described prepayment fee and agrees that
said amount represents a reasonable estimate of the prepayment costs, expenses
and/or liabilities of Bank. If Borrower fails to pay any prepayment fee when due,
the amount of such prepayment fee shall thereafter bear interest until paid at
a rate per annum two percent (2.0%) above the Prime Rate in effect from time to
time (computed on the basis of a 360-day year, actual days elapsed). Each
change in the rate of interest on any such past due prepayment fee shall become
effective on the date each Prime Rate change is announced within Bank.</font></p>
