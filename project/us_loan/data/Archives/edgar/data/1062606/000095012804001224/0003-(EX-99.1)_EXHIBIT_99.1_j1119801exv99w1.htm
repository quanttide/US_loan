<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>VOTING AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Voting Agreement (this <I>&#147;Agreement&#148;</I>) is made and entered into as of
December&nbsp;22, 2004, between ServiceWare Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation <I>(&#147;Parent&#148;</I>), Kanisa Inc., a Delaware corporation (the <I>&#147;Company&#148;</I>) and
certain stockholders of Parent and the Company (each, a &#147;<I>Stockholder</I>&#148; and
together, the &#147;<I>Stockholders</I>&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RECITALS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, the Company
and SVCW Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent <I>(&#147;Merger Sub&#148;</I>), are entering into that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated of even date herewith (the <I>&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;</I>), which
provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the <I>&#147;Merger&#148;</I>).
Pursuant to the Merger, all shares of capital stock of the Company, par value
$0.01 per share will be converted into the right to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock and Parent Warrants on the basis described in the Merger
Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Stockholder is the record holder of such number of outstanding shares
of Parent or Company capital stock, as the case may be, and as indicated on the
signature page of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;As a material inducement to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent and
the Company desire Stockholder to agree, and Stockholder is willing to agree,
to vote the Shares (as defined below), and such other shares of capital stock
of the Parent or the Company, as the case may be, over which Stockholder has
voting power, so as to facilitate consummation of the Merger.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1. <I>Agreement to Vote Shares.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <I>Definitions. </I>For purposes of this Agreement:

notice of, and to vote at the meeting of the Stockholders of Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, called for the purpose of voting on the matters
referred to in Section&nbsp;1.2. Stockholder agrees that any shares of capital stock
of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, that Stockholder purchases or
with respect to which Stockholder otherwise acquires beneficial ownership or
over which Stockholder exercises voting power after the execution of this
Agreement and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section&nbsp;4 below shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
to the same extent as if they constituted Shares on the date hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<I>Subject Securities. </I>The term <I>&#147;Subject Securities&#148; </I>shall mean: (i)&nbsp;all
securities of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, including all shares
of common stock, preferred stock and all options, warrants and other rights to

this Agreement; and (ii)&nbsp;all additional securities of Parent or the Company, as

Agreement) or any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any
respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, under the Merger
Agreement or of Stockholder under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stockholder further agrees not to enter into any agreement or

with respect to the Subject Securities except as provided in this Agreement; or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;take any other action that would make any representation or warranty
of Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of
preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing its obligations under this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;To the extent Stockholder is, as of the date hereof, party to a
contract or agreement that requires Stockholder to Transfer Shares to another
person or entity (excluding a contract or agreement pledging Shares to Parent

Transfer unless and until the transferee agrees to be bound by and executes an

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned stockholder (the <I>&#147;Stockholder&#148;</I>) of ServiceWare
Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<I>Parent</I>&#148;) hereby irrevocably
appoints and constitutes each of Bruce Armstrong and Mark Angel (collectively,
the <I>&#147;Proxyholders&#148;</I>) of Kanisa Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<I>Company</I>&#148;), the
agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, to the full extent of the undersigned&#146;s rights
with respect to the shares of capital stock of Parent which are listed below
(the <I>&#147;Shares&#148;</I>), and any and all other shares or securities issued or issuable
in respect thereof on or after the date hereof and prior to the date this Proxy
terminates, to vote the Shares as follows: the Proxyholders named above are
empowered and directed at any time prior to termination of this Proxy to
exercise all voting and other rights (including, without limitation, the power
to execute and deliver written consents with respect to the Shares) of the
undersigned at every annual, special or adjourned meeting of Parent
stockholders, and in every written consent in lieu of such a meeting, or
otherwise, (i)&nbsp;in favor of adoption of that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004 (the <I>&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;</I>), by and among
Parent, SVCW Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent <I>(&#147;Merger Sub&#148;</I>) and the Company, and the approval of the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the <I>&#147;Merger&#148;</I>), and (ii)&nbsp;against
approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with
consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Offer (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any
action or agreement that would result in a breach in any respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
Parent under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholder under that certain
Voting Agreement, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004, by and between Parent, the
Company and the Stockholder (the <I>&#147;Voting Agreement </I>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proxyholders may not exercise this Proxy on any other matter. The
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all matters other than those set forth in
the immediately preceding paragraph. The proxy granted by the Stockholder to
the Proxyholders hereby is granted as of the date of this Irrevocable Proxy in
order to secure the obligations of the Stockholder set forth in Section&nbsp;1 of
the Voting Agreement, and is irrevocable and coupled with an interest in such
obligations and in the interests of Parent to be gained pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proxy will terminate upon the termination of the Voting Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Upon the execution hereof, all prior proxies given
by the undersigned with respect to the Shares and any and all other shares or
securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof
are hereby revoked and no subsequent proxies will be given until such time as
this Proxy shall be terminated in accordance with its terms. Any obligation of
the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the undersigned. The undersigned Stockholder authorizes the Proxyholders to
file this Proxy and any substitution or revocation of substitution with the
Secretary of Parent and with any Inspector of Elections at any meeting of the
Stockholders of Parent.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>(Company Stockholders)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned stockholder (the <I>&#147;Stockholder&#148;</I>) of Kanisa Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;<I>Company</I>&#148;) hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes each of
Kent Heyman and Scott Schwartzman (collectively, the <I>&#147;Proxyholders&#148;</I>) of
ServiceWare Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<I>Parent</I>&#148;), the agents,
attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, to the full extent of the undersigned&#146;s rights
with respect to the shares of capital stock of the Company which are listed
below (the <I>&#147;Shares&#148;</I>), and any and all other shares or securities issued or
issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof and prior to the date
this Proxy terminates, to vote the Shares as follows: the Proxyholders named
above are empowered and directed at any time prior to termination of this Proxy
to exercise all voting and other rights (including, without limitation, the
power to execute and deliver written consents with respect to the Shares) of
the undersigned at every annual, special or adjourned meeting of the Company
stockholders, and in every written consent in lieu of such a meeting, or
otherwise, (i)&nbsp;in favor of adoption of that certain Agreement and Plan of

merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the <I>&#147;Merger&#148;</I>), and (ii)&nbsp;against
approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with
consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Offer (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any
action or agreement that would result in a breach in any respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholder under that certain
Voting Agreement, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004, by and between Parent, the
Company and the Stockholder (the <I>&#147;Voting Agreement </I>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proxyholders may not exercise this Proxy on any other matter. The
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all matters other than those set forth in
the immediately preceding paragraph. The proxy granted by the Stockholder to
the Proxyholders hereby is granted as of the date of this Irrevocable Proxy in
order to secure the obligations of the Stockholder set forth in Section&nbsp;1 of
the Voting Agreement, and is irrevocable and coupled with an interest in such
obligations and in the interests of the Company to be gained pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proxy will terminate upon the termination of the Voting Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Upon the execution hereof, all prior proxies given
by the undersigned with respect to the Shares and any and all other shares or
securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof
are hereby revoked and no subsequent proxies will be given until such time as
this Proxy shall be terminated in accordance with its terms. Any obligation of
the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the undersigned. The undersigned Stockholder authorizes the Proxyholders to
file this Proxy and any substitution or revocation of substitution with the
Secretary of the Company and with any Inspector of Elections at any meeting of
the Stockholders of the Company.
