<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">ServiceWare Technologies, Inc. (&#147;ServiceWare&#148;), a provider of knowledge management (KM)&nbsp;solutions
for service and support, and Kanisa Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Kanisa&#148;), a provider of Service
Resolution Management (SRM)&nbsp;software applications, announced on December&nbsp;22, 2004, the signing of a
definitive agreement to merge in an all stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement,
Kanisa will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ServiceWare and upon completion of the transaction,
Kanisa stockholders are expected to own approximately 40% of ServiceWare&#146;s outstanding stock,
subject to an adjustment based upon the companies&#146; respective cash positions at closing. It is
currently estimated that the number of ServiceWare common stock shares to be issued will be
approximately 35,000,000. In addition, ServiceWare has agreed to issue warrants to purchase
4,239,231 shares of ServiceWare common stock (which warrants represent approximately 40% of the
combined companies warrants) at an exercise price of $0.72 per share to the Kanisa stockholders.
The warrants will expire in January&nbsp;2009. The Kanisa stockholders will receive shares and warrants
based on an exchange ratio determined in accordance with Kanisa&#146;s charter documents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Kanisa was founded in 1997 and has pioneered the use of a knowledge management platform for
customer service applications. In July&nbsp;2003, Kanisa acquired Jeeves Solutions, the enterprise
software division of Ask Jeeves, Inc. Kanisa is a privately held organization and its technology
has resulted in broad industry recognition and awards for its products and performance. Kanisa&#146;s
intellectual property includes two patents and approximately fifteen patents pending. Kanisa
currently has 68 employees and is headquartered in Cupertino, California.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certain directors, executive officers and stockholders of ServiceWare and Kanisa have signed an
agreement to vote their stock in favor of the merger. Both Kanisa&#146;s and ServiceWare&#146;s boards of
directors have unanimously approved the merger. The merger is subject to approval by ServiceWare
and Kanisa stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The merger is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Upon the completion of the merger, it is expected that Kent Heyman, who now serves as the chief
executive officer of ServiceWare, will become chairman of the board of directors of ServiceWare and
Bruce Armstrong, the chief executive officer of Kanisa, will become the chief executive officer of
ServiceWare. Scott Schwartzman, the current chief financial officer of ServiceWare, will take on
the role of chief operating officer of ServiceWare, while Mark Angel, the founder and chief
technology officer of Kanisa, will become the chief technology officer of ServiceWare. It is
anticipated that ServiceWare will be headquartered in Cupertino, California and change its name,
which new name has yet to be determined.

future financial results, operating results and prospects of the combined company and benefits of
the merger, and ServiceWare&#146;s plans, prospects, expectations, strategies, intentions, hopes and
beliefs are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts
and are only estimates or predictions. ServiceWare does not undertake any obligation to update any
of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 8-K.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Important risk factors affecting ServiceWare&#146;s business generally may be found in our periodic
reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at
www.sec.gov. Risk factors related to the subject matter of this Form 8-K include the possibilities
that the companies may not be successful in integrating their respective businesses or the
companies&#146; combined solutions will not be attractive to their customers; that the anticipated cost
savings from synergies will be less than expected; that depreciation, amortization and potential
impairment charges associated with the acquisition could adversely affect the combined company&#146;s
results of operations; that stockholder approval and governmental clearances needed to consummate
the merger may be delayed or withheld; that the parties&#146; partners, customers or investors may react
unfavorably to the merger; that if the acquisition is not completed, the parties&#146; businesses may be
harmed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the proposed merger, ServiceWare intends to file a proxy statement and other
relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING
DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION, STOCKHOLDERS OF SERVICEWARE ARE URGED TO READ
THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION
ABOUT THE PROPOSED MERGER. After filing with the SEC the proxy statement and other
relevant materials, and any other documents filed by ServiceWare, may be obtained free of charge at
the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov or at ServiceWare&#146;s website at www.serviceware.com/ir/.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">It is anticipated that the issuance of shares of ServiceWare common stock and warrants in
consideration for the merger will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933 (the &#147;Act&#148;) pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2) of the Act and Regulation&nbsp;D thereunder. Each
Kanisa stockholder to receive ServiceWare securities will be an &#147;accredited investor&#148; as that term
is defined in Regulation&nbsp;D under the Act and the issuance of the securities will meet the other
requirements of Regulation&nbsp;D.
