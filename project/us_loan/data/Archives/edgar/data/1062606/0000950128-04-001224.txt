<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">ServiceWare Technologies, Inc. (&#147;ServiceWare&#148;), a provider of knowledge management (KM)&nbsp;solutions
for service and support, and Kanisa Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;Kanisa&#148;), a provider of Service
Resolution Management (SRM)&nbsp;software applications, announced on December&nbsp;22, 2004, the signing of a
definitive agreement to merge in an all stock transaction. Under the terms of the agreement,
Kanisa will become a wholly owned subsidiary of ServiceWare and upon completion of the transaction,
Kanisa stockholders are expected to own approximately 40% of ServiceWare&#146;s outstanding stock,
subject to an adjustment based upon the companies&#146; respective cash positions at closing. It is
currently estimated that the number of ServiceWare common stock shares to be issued will be
approximately 35,000,000. In addition, ServiceWare has agreed to issue warrants to purchase
4,239,231 shares of ServiceWare common stock (which warrants represent approximately 40% of the
combined companies warrants) at an exercise price of $0.72 per share to the Kanisa stockholders.
The warrants will expire in January&nbsp;2009. The Kanisa stockholders will receive shares and warrants
based on an exchange ratio determined in accordance with Kanisa&#146;s charter documents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Kanisa was founded in 1997 and has pioneered the use of a knowledge management platform for
customer service applications. In July&nbsp;2003, Kanisa acquired Jeeves Solutions, the enterprise
software division of Ask Jeeves, Inc. Kanisa is a privately held organization and its technology
has resulted in broad industry recognition and awards for its products and performance. Kanisa&#146;s
intellectual property includes two patents and approximately fifteen patents pending. Kanisa
currently has 68 employees and is headquartered in Cupertino, California.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certain directors, executive officers and stockholders of ServiceWare and Kanisa have signed an
agreement to vote their stock in favor of the merger. Both Kanisa&#146;s and ServiceWare&#146;s boards of
directors have unanimously approved the merger. The merger is subject to approval by ServiceWare
and Kanisa stockholders and other customary closing conditions. The merger is expected to close in
the first quarter of 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Upon the completion of the merger, it is expected that Kent Heyman, who now serves as the chief
executive officer of ServiceWare, will become chairman of the board of directors of ServiceWare and
Bruce Armstrong, the chief executive officer of Kanisa, will become the chief executive officer of
ServiceWare. Scott Schwartzman, the current chief financial officer of ServiceWare, will take on
the role of chief operating officer of ServiceWare, while Mark Angel, the founder and chief
technology officer of Kanisa, will become the chief technology officer of ServiceWare. It is
anticipated that ServiceWare will be headquartered in Cupertino, California and change its name,
which new name has yet to be determined.

future financial results, operating results and prospects of the combined company and benefits of
the merger, and ServiceWare&#146;s plans, prospects, expectations, strategies, intentions, hopes and
beliefs are forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are not historical facts
and are only estimates or predictions. ServiceWare does not undertake any obligation to update any
of the forward-looking statements after the date of this Form 8-K.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Important risk factors affecting ServiceWare&#146;s business generally may be found in our periodic
reports and registration statements filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission at
www.sec.gov. Risk factors related to the subject matter of this Form 8-K include the possibilities
that the companies may not be successful in integrating their respective businesses or the
companies&#146; combined solutions will not be attractive to their customers; that the anticipated cost
savings from synergies will be less than expected; that depreciation, amortization and potential
impairment charges associated with the acquisition could adversely affect the combined company&#146;s
results of operations; that stockholder approval and governmental clearances needed to consummate
the merger may be delayed or withheld; that the parties&#146; partners, customers or investors may react
unfavorably to the merger; that if the acquisition is not completed, the parties&#146; businesses may be
harmed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the proposed merger, ServiceWare intends to file a proxy statement and other
relevant materials with the Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). BEFORE MAKING ANY VOTING
DECISION WITH RESPECT TO THE PROPOSED TRANSACTION, STOCKHOLDERS OF SERVICEWARE ARE URGED TO READ
THE PROXY STATEMENT AND OTHER RELEVANT MATERIALS BECAUSE THEY WILL CONTAIN IMPORTANT INFORMATION
ABOUT THE PROPOSED MERGER. After filing with the SEC the proxy statement and other
relevant materials, and any other documents filed by ServiceWare, may be obtained free of charge at
the SEC&#146;s website at www.sec.gov or at ServiceWare&#146;s website at www.serviceware.com/ir/.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The disclosures made in response to Item&nbsp;1.01 above are incorporated herein by reference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">It is anticipated that the issuance of shares of ServiceWare common stock and warrants in
consideration for the merger will be exempt from the registration requirements of the Securities
Act of 1933 (the &#147;Act&#148;) pursuant to Section&nbsp;4(2) of the Act and Regulation&nbsp;D thereunder. Each
Kanisa stockholder to receive ServiceWare securities will be an &#147;accredited investor&#148; as that term
is defined in Regulation&nbsp;D under the Act and the issuance of the securities will meet the other
requirements of Regulation&nbsp;D.

or certificates that immediately prior to the Effective Time represented
outstanding shares of Company Capital Stock which were converted into shares of
Parent Common Stock and Parent Warrants pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.6

such other provisions as Parent may reasonably specify), (ii)&nbsp;instructions in
effecting the surrender of the Certificates in exchange for certificates
representing shares of Parent Common Stock and Parent Warrants, and (iii)&nbsp;such
notification as may be required under the DGCL to be given to the holders of
Dissenting Shares. Upon surrender of Certificates for cancellation to the
Exchange Agent together with such letter of transmittal, duly completed and
validly executed in accordance with the instructions thereto, the holders of
such Certificates shall be entitled to receive in exchange therefor
certificates representing the number of whole shares of Parent Common Stock
into which their shares of Company Capital Stock were converted at the
Effective Time (less 10% of such shares, which shall be held in accordance with
the Escrow Agreement), payment in lieu of fractional shares that such holders
have the right to receive pursuant to Section&nbsp;1.7(d), and Parent Warrants
receivable hereunder, and the Certificates so surrendered shall forthwith be
canceled. Until so surrendered, outstanding Certificates will be deemed from

ownership of the number of full shares of Parent Common Stock into which such
shares of Company Capital Stock shall have been so converted (including the
right to receive shares of Parent Common Stock under the Escrow Agreement) and
Parent Warrants receivable hereunder and the right to receive an amount in cash
in lieu of the issuance of any fractional shares in accordance with Section
1.7(d). No interest will be paid or accrued on any cash in lieu of fractional
shares of Parent Common Stock. In the event of a transfer of ownership of
shares of Company Capital Stock that is not registered in the transfer records
of the Company, a certificate representing the proper number of shares of
Parent Common Stock and Parent Warrants may be issued to a transferee if the
Certificate representing such shares of Company Capital Stock is presented to
the Exchange Agent, accompanied by all documents required to evidence and
effect such transfer and by evidence that any applicable stock transfer taxes
have been paid.

Common Stock to be received by such holder) shall receive from Parent an amount
of cash (rounded to the nearest whole cent) equal to the product of (i)&nbsp;such
fraction, multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the volume weighted average sales price per share

required to be deducted or withheld therefrom under the Code or under any
provision of state, local or foreign tax law or under any other applicable

the Parent may file subsequent to the date hereof) are referred to herein as

Parent SEC Reports and (ii)&nbsp;did not at the time they were filed (or if
subsequently amended or superseded by a filing prior to the date of this
Agreement, then on the date of such subsequent filing) contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be

Parent and its subsidiaries as at the respective dates thereof and the
consolidated results of the Parent&#146;s operations and cash flows for the periods
indicated, except that the unaudited interim financial statements may not
contain all the footnotes required by GAAP for audited statements, and were or

not expect to be material, individually or in the aggregate. The balance sheet
of the Parent contained in the Parent SEC Report as of September&nbsp;30, 2004 is

statement filed by Parent under the Securities Act or any periodic or current
report filed by Parent under the Exchange Act should be restated, or that the
Parent should modify its accounting in future periods in a manner that would be
materially adverse to the Parent.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">INDEMNIFICATION FROM COMPANY STOCKHOLDERS



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.1 <I>Indemnification</I>. Notwithstanding the Closing and regardless of any
investigation made by or on behalf of the Parent, or any information known to
the Parent, the stockholders of the Company immediately prior to the Effective
Time (the &#147;<I>Company Stockholders</I>&#148;), subject to the terms and conditions of this
Article&nbsp;8, shall indemnify and hold the Parent harmless from and against any
and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities, costs, expenses or deficiencies
including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and other costs and
expenses reasonably incident to proceedings or investigations or the defense or
settlement of any claim or claims, incurred by or asserted against the Parent
due to or resulting from: (i)&nbsp;the breach of any representation or warranty of
the Company given in or pursuant to this Agreement; (ii)&nbsp;any breach or default
in the performance by the Company of any of its covenants, obligations or
agreements in or pursuant to this Agreement, including but not limited to any
excess in the Company&#146;s Transaction Fees provided in Section&nbsp;6.18 above,
subject to any offsets provided in Section&nbsp;8.2 below. The foregoing are
collectively referred to as &#147;<I>Indemnifiable Damages</I>.&#148; For the avoidance of
doubt, the remedies provided in this Article&nbsp;8 shall be the sole and exclusive
remedy for any breach of any representation or warranty of the Company given in
or pursuant to this Agreement or any breach or default in the performance by
the Company of any of its covenants, obligations or agreements in or pursuant
to this Agreement absent fraud.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.2 <I>Indemnification Limitations ; Offsets</I>. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Parent shall not be entitled to recover Indemnifiable Damages for any
matter unless and until the aggregate of all claims for Indemnifiable Damages
asserted exceeds $170,000, at which point the first dollar of such
Indemnifiable Damages shall be recoverable (the &#147;<I>Indemnification Threshold</I>&#148;);
provided that (a)&nbsp;any Parent Transaction Fees in excess of $800,000 shall serve
to offset such amount of Indemnifiable Damages and (b)&nbsp;any Company Transaction
Fees in excess of $800,00 shall increase the amount of Indemnifiable Damages.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the
aggregate amount of Indemnifiable Damages to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">which the Indemnitees shall be entitled pursuant to this Article&nbsp;8 exceed
the value of the Parent Common Stock being held in escrow under the Escrow
Agreement to secure the Company Stockholders&#146; indemnification obligations.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.3 <I>Procedures for Making Claims</I>. If and when the Parent desires to
assert a claim for Indemnifiable Damages against the Company Stockholders
pursuant to the provisions of this Article&nbsp;8 once meeting the Indemnification
Threshold, the Parent shall deliver to the Company Stockholders&#146; representative
(the &#147;<I>Representative</I>&#148;), within ten (10)&nbsp;business days after the Parent&#146;s
receipt of a claim or specific and affirmative awareness of a potential claim,
a certificate signed by an officer of Parent (as used in this Article&nbsp;8, the
&#147;<I>Notice of Claim</I>&#148;): (i)&nbsp;stating that the Parent has paid or accrued or
otherwise incurred Indemnifiable Damages meeting the Indemnification Threshold
to which Parent is entitled to indemnification pursuant to this Article&nbsp;8 and
the amount thereof (to the extent then known); and, (ii)&nbsp;specifying (A)&nbsp;the
individual items of loss, damage, liability, cost, expense or deficiency
included in the amount so stated, and (B)&nbsp;the basis upon which Indemnifiable
Damages are claimed. If the Representative shall object to such Notice of
Claim, the Representative shall deliver written notice of objection (as used in
this Article&nbsp;8, the &#147;<I>Notice of Objection</I>&#148;) with ten (10)&nbsp;business days after
the receipt of the Notice of Claim. The Notice of Objection shall set forth
the grounds upon which the objection is based and state whether the
Representative objects to all or only a portion of the matter described in the
Notice of Claim. If the Representative fails to deliver a Notice of Objection
on a timely basis during the period required above or if the Representative
does not object to the entire amount indicated in the Notice of Claim, then the
Notice of Claim (to the extent not objected to) shall be deemed to be agreed to
and the Parent shall have the right to direct the escrow agent under the Escrow
Agreement to deliver to the Parent a number of shares of Parent Common Stock
with a then market value equal to the amount set forth in the Notice of Claim
that is not objected to by the Representative. If such claim or claims shall
not have been resolved or compromised within sixty (60)&nbsp;days from the date of
delivery of the Notice of Objection, then such claims shall be settled by
arbitration pursuant to Section&nbsp;8.6 hereof. The arbitrator shall promptly
obtain such information regarding the matter as the arbitrator deems necessary
and shall decide the matter and render a written award which shall be delivered
to the Parent and the Representative. Any award shall be a conclusive
determination of the matter and shall be binding upon the Parent and the
Company Stockholders. If, by arbitration, it shall be determined that the
Parent shall be entitled to any Indemnifiable Damages by reason of its claim or
claims, the Indemnifiable Damages so determined shall be paid to the Parent in
the same manner as if the Representative had not delivered a Notice of
Objection. The name of the Representative and contact information thereof shall
be provided by the Company prior to the Closing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.4 <I>Participation in Defense of Third Party Claims</I>. If any third party
shall assert any claim against the Parent in connection with which Parent
intends to seek Indemnifiable Damages, the Representative, at the sole expense
of the Company Stockholders, may assume the primary defense thereof with
counsel reasonably acceptable to the Parent, but only if and so long as: (i)
the Representative diligently pursues the defense of such claim; and (ii)&nbsp;the
Representative acknowledges to the Parent in writing that the claim, if
resolved or settled adversely to the Parent, is one for which the Company
Stockholders are obligated to indemnify the Parent hereunder. If the
Representative fails or refuses to so elect to assume the primary defense of
any such claim, the Parent may (but need not) do so, in which event the Parent
may defend, settle or compromise the claim, at the expense and cost of the
Company Stockholders, in any such

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">
<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">manner as the Parent reasonably deems appropriate. The Parent shall
notify the Representative in writing of such a claim within ten (10)&nbsp;business
days of the receipt thereof, but the right to recover Indemnifiable Damages
shall not be affected by the failure to provide such notice within such
timeframe except to the extent the Company Stockholders shall be prejudiced
thereby.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.5 <I>Survival of Representations and Indemnification</I>. The Company
Stockholders&#146; obligation to pay Indemnifiable Damages shall survive the Closing
for the period of time equivalent to the Escrow Period. No claim for recovery
of Indemnifiable Damages arising out of Section&nbsp;8.1 or 8.4 hereof may be
asserted by the Parent after the expiration of such time period; provided,
however, that any claim first asserted by the giving of a Notice of Claim
within the survival period shall neither be abated nor barred.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.6 <I>Arbitration</I>. Any dispute, controversy or claim arising out of or
relating to Indemnifiable Damages shall be settled by a single arbitrator
mutually selected by Parent and the Representative in arbitration conducted in
New York, New York or in such other location to which the Parent and the
Representative may agree, in accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association, and judgment upon the award rendered
by the arbitrator may be entered in any court having jurisdiction thereof. The
arbitrator&#146;s decision shall be in writing and shall be final and nonappealable.
The arbitrator also shall make a determination regarding which party&#146;s legal
position in any such controversy or claim is more substantially correct (the
&#147;<I>Prevailing Party</I>&#148;) and the arbitrator shall require the other party to bear
the legal and other professional fees and costs incurred by the Prevailing
Party in connection with such arbitration proceeding and any necessary court
action.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>VOTING AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Voting Agreement (this <I>&#147;Agreement&#148;</I>) is made and entered into as of
December&nbsp;22, 2004, between ServiceWare Technologies, Inc., a Delaware
corporation <I>(&#147;Parent&#148;</I>), Kanisa Inc., a Delaware corporation (the <I>&#147;Company&#148;</I>) and
certain stockholders of Parent and the Company (each, a &#147;<I>Stockholder</I>&#148; and
together, the &#147;<I>Stockholders</I>&#148;).


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>RECITALS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A.&nbsp;Concurrently with the execution of this Agreement, Parent, the Company
and SVCW Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent <I>(&#147;Merger Sub&#148;</I>), are entering into that certain Agreement
and Plan of Merger, dated of even date herewith (the <I>&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;</I>), which
provides for the merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the <I>&#147;Merger&#148;</I>).
Pursuant to the Merger, all shares of capital stock of the Company, par value
$0.01 per share will be converted into the right to receive shares of Parent
Common Stock and Parent Warrants on the basis described in the Merger
Agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein shall have the
meanings set forth in the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;B.&nbsp;Stockholder is the record holder of such number of outstanding shares
of Parent or Company capital stock, as the case may be, and as indicated on the
signature page of this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;C.&nbsp;As a material inducement to enter into the Merger Agreement, Parent and
the Company desire Stockholder to agree, and Stockholder is willing to agree,
to vote the Shares (as defined below), and such other shares of capital stock
of the Parent or the Company, as the case may be, over which Stockholder has
voting power, so as to facilitate consummation of the Merger.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of the foregoing and the representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements set forth in this Agreement, the parties agree as
follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">1. <I>Agreement to Vote Shares.</I>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.1 <I>Definitions. </I>For purposes of this Agreement:

of capital stock of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, owned of record
or beneficially by Stockholder or over which Stockholder exercises voting
power, in each case, as of the record date for persons entitled to receive
notice of, and to vote at the meeting of the Stockholders of Parent or the
Company, as the case may be, called for the purpose of voting on the matters
referred to in Section&nbsp;1.2. Stockholder agrees that any shares of capital stock
of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, that Stockholder purchases or
with respect to which Stockholder otherwise acquires beneficial ownership or
over which Stockholder exercises voting power after the execution of this
Agreement and prior to the date of termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Section&nbsp;4 below shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement
to the same extent as if they constituted Shares on the date hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;<I>Subject Securities. </I>The term <I>&#147;Subject Securities&#148; </I>shall mean: (i)&nbsp;all
securities of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, including all shares
of common stock, preferred stock and all options, warrants and other rights to
acquire shares thereof, beneficially owned by Stockholder as of the date of
this Agreement; and (ii)&nbsp;all additional securities of Parent or the Company, as
the case may be, including all additional shares of common stock and preferred
stock and all additional options, warrants and other rights to acquire shares
thereof, of which Stockholder acquires ownership during the period from the

in accordance with the terms and provisions of the Merger Agreement (the

approval of the Merger and the other actions contemplated by the Merger
Agreement and any actions required in furtherance thereof; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;against approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in
competition with the consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation,
any Acquisition Proposal or Superior Offer (each as defined in the Merger
Agreement) or any action or agreement that would result in a breach in any
respect of any covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or
agreement of Parent or the Company, as the case may be, under the Merger
Agreement or of Stockholder under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stockholder further agrees not to enter into any agreement or
understanding with any person the effect of which would be inconsistent with or
violative of any provision contained in this Section&nbsp;1.2.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.3 <I>Transfer and Other Restrictions.</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Prior to the termination of this Agreement, Stockholder agrees not to,
directly or indirectly:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i)&nbsp;except pursuant to the terms of the Merger Agreement, offer for sale,

Transfer or other disposition of any or all of the Subject Securities or any
interest therein except as provided in Section&nbsp;1.2 hereof;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii)&nbsp;grant any proxy, power of attorney, deposit any of the Subject
Securities into a voting trust or enter into a voting agreement or arrangement
with respect to the Subject Securities except as provided in this Agreement; or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii)&nbsp;take any other action that would make any representation or warranty
of Stockholder contained herein untrue or incorrect or have the effect of
preventing or disabling Stockholder from performing its obligations under this
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;To the extent Stockholder is, as of the date hereof, party to a
contract or agreement that requires Stockholder to Transfer Shares to another
person or entity (excluding a contract or agreement pledging Shares to Parent
or the Company, as the case may be), Stockholder will not effect any such
Transfer unless and until the transferee agrees to be bound by and executes an
agreement in the form of this Agreement with respect to the Shares to be
Transferred.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned stockholder (the <I>&#147;Stockholder&#148;</I>) of ServiceWare
Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<I>Parent</I>&#148;) hereby irrevocably
appoints and constitutes each of Bruce Armstrong and Mark Angel (collectively,
the <I>&#147;Proxyholders&#148;</I>) of Kanisa Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;<I>Company</I>&#148;), the
agents, attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, to the full extent of the undersigned&#146;s rights
with respect to the shares of capital stock of Parent which are listed below
(the <I>&#147;Shares&#148;</I>), and any and all other shares or securities issued or issuable
in respect thereof on or after the date hereof and prior to the date this Proxy
terminates, to vote the Shares as follows: the Proxyholders named above are
empowered and directed at any time prior to termination of this Proxy to
exercise all voting and other rights (including, without limitation, the power
to execute and deliver written consents with respect to the Shares) of the
undersigned at every annual, special or adjourned meeting of Parent
stockholders, and in every written consent in lieu of such a meeting, or
otherwise, (i)&nbsp;in favor of adoption of that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004 (the <I>&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;</I>), by and among
Parent, SVCW Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent <I>(&#147;Merger Sub&#148;</I>) and the Company, and the approval of the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the <I>&#147;Merger&#148;</I>), and (ii)&nbsp;against
approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with
consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Offer (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any
action or agreement that would result in a breach in any respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
Parent under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholder under that certain
Voting Agreement, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004, by and between Parent, the
Company and the Stockholder (the <I>&#147;Voting Agreement </I>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proxyholders may not exercise this Proxy on any other matter. The
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all matters other than those set forth in
the immediately preceding paragraph. The proxy granted by the Stockholder to
the Proxyholders hereby is granted as of the date of this Irrevocable Proxy in
order to secure the obligations of the Stockholder set forth in Section&nbsp;1 of
the Voting Agreement, and is irrevocable and coupled with an interest in such
obligations and in the interests of Parent to be gained pursuant to the Merger
Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proxy will terminate upon the termination of the Voting Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Upon the execution hereof, all prior proxies given
by the undersigned with respect to the Shares and any and all other shares or
securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof
are hereby revoked and no subsequent proxies will be given until such time as
this Proxy shall be terminated in accordance with its terms. Any obligation of
the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the undersigned. The undersigned Stockholder authorizes the Proxyholders to
file this Proxy and any substitution or revocation of substitution with the
Secretary of Parent and with any Inspector of Elections at any meeting of the
Stockholders of Parent.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned stockholder (the <I>&#147;Stockholder&#148;</I>) of Kanisa Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the &#147;<I>Company</I>&#148;) hereby irrevocably appoints and constitutes each of
Kent Heyman and Scott Schwartzman (collectively, the <I>&#147;Proxyholders&#148;</I>) of
ServiceWare Technologies, Inc., a Delaware corporation (&#147;<I>Parent</I>&#148;), the agents,
attorneys-in-fact and proxies of the undersigned, with full power of
substitution and resubstitution, to the full extent of the undersigned&#146;s rights
with respect to the shares of capital stock of the Company which are listed
below (the <I>&#147;Shares&#148;</I>), and any and all other shares or securities issued or
issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof and prior to the date
this Proxy terminates, to vote the Shares as follows: the Proxyholders named
above are empowered and directed at any time prior to termination of this Proxy
to exercise all voting and other rights (including, without limitation, the
power to execute and deliver written consents with respect to the Shares) of
the undersigned at every annual, special or adjourned meeting of the Company
stockholders, and in every written consent in lieu of such a meeting, or
otherwise, (i)&nbsp;in favor of adoption of that certain Agreement and Plan of
Merger, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004 (the <I>&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;</I>), by and among
Parent, SVCW Acquisition, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly-owned
subsidiary of Parent <I>(&#147;Merger Sub&#148;</I>) and the Company, and the approval of the
merger of Merger Sub with and into the Company (the <I>&#147;Merger&#148;</I>), and (ii)&nbsp;against
approval of any proposal made in opposition to or in competition with
consummation of the Merger, including, without limitation, any Acquisition
Proposal or Superior Offer (each as defined in the Merger Agreement) or any
action or agreement that would result in a breach in any respect of any
covenant, representation or warranty or any other obligation or agreement of
the Company under the Merger Agreement or of the Stockholder under that certain
Voting Agreement, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004, by and between Parent, the
Company and the Stockholder (the <I>&#147;Voting Agreement </I>).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Proxyholders may not exercise this Proxy on any other matter. The
Stockholder may vote the Shares on all matters other than those set forth in
the immediately preceding paragraph. The proxy granted by the Stockholder to
the Proxyholders hereby is granted as of the date of this Irrevocable Proxy in
order to secure the obligations of the Stockholder set forth in Section&nbsp;1 of
the Voting Agreement, and is irrevocable and coupled with an interest in such
obligations and in the interests of the Company to be gained pursuant to the
Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Proxy will terminate upon the termination of the Voting Agreement in
accordance with its terms. Upon the execution hereof, all prior proxies given
by the undersigned with respect to the Shares and any and all other shares or
securities issued or issuable in respect thereof on or after the date hereof
are hereby revoked and no subsequent proxies will be given until such time as
this Proxy shall be terminated in accordance with its terms. Any obligation of
the undersigned hereunder shall be binding upon the successors and assigns of
the undersigned. The undersigned Stockholder authorizes the Proxyholders to
file this Proxy and any substitution or revocation of substitution with the
Secretary of the Company and with any Inspector of Elections at any meeting of
the Stockholders of the Company.
