other and further  documents that Mitchell  Entertainment may request to further

Intellectual  Property  now  owned or  hereafter  created  or  acquired  by such

media in which any of the items so  licensed  may be  recorded or stored and all

      6. Each Assignor supplementally agrees as follows respecting Receivables:

            (a) Mitchell Entertainment hereby authorizes any Assignor to collect
any  Receivables  in which  Mitchell  Entertainment  has been granted a security
interest  hereunder,  and each Assignor agrees to use its best efforts to effect
the prompt collection thereof.  Mitchell Entertainment hereby further authorizes
any Assignor to use the proceeds of any such  collections  in the conduct of its
business in the ordinary  course.  Each Assignor  agrees that  immediately  upon
Mitchell  Entertainment's  request following the occurrence of a potential Event
of Default (as determined by Mitchell  Entertainment),  each Assignor  shall, at
its sole  expense,  establish and maintain (i) an United States Post Office lock
box (the "Lock  Box"),  to which  Mitchell  Entertainment  shall have  exclusive
access. Each Assignor authorizes Mitchell  Entertainment,  from time to time, to
remove the contents of the Lock Box therefrom for disposition in accordance with
this Security Agreement.  Each Assignor agrees to notify all account debtors and
other  parties  obligated to any Assignor that all payments made to any Assignor
(other than payments by electronic  funds transfer)  shall be remitted,  for the
credit of each Assignor, to the Lock Box, and each Assignor shall include a like
statement of all invoices.  Each Assignor shall

                                       8
<PAGE>

also, at the request of Mitchell Entertainment at any time or from time to time,
execute and deliver to Mitchell  Entertainment an assignment or assignments,  in
form  satisfactory  to Mitchell  Entertainment,  of all of any  Assignor's  then
existing  Receivables and the proceeds thereof. If notwithstanding the giving of
any  notice,  any  account  debtor or other  obligor  shall make  payment to any
Assignor,  such  Assignor  shall hold all such  payments  in trust for  Mitchell
Entertainment  without commingling the same with other funds of any Assignor and
shall deliver the same to Mitchell  Entertainment or any such agent or designee,
immediately  upon  receipt  by any  Assignor  in the  identical  form  received,
together with any necessary endorsements.

            (b) If any Event of Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing,
with or without  notice to any Assignor and without  affecting  the liability of
any Assignor hereunder, any Receivables in which Mitchell Entertainment has been
granted a security  interest  hereunder  may be altered or  modified by Mitchell
Entertainment  in any respect,  and Mitchell  Entertainment  may: (i) settle and
adjust all disputes and claims  directly with the account debtor with respect to
any such Receivables,  (ii) alter, accelerate, extend or change the time, manner
and/or amount of any payments made or to be made by the account debtor under any
such  Receivable,  (iii) consent from time to time to the acceptance of security
or  additional  or  substituted  security of any kind for any  obligation of the
account  debtor  under  any such  Receivable  or to the  release,  surrender  or
alteration  of any such  security,  and (iv) deal as  aforesaid  or in any other
manner with the account debtor of any such Receivable.  Nothing herein contained
shall be construed as requiring or obligating Mitchell Entertainment or any such
agent or designee to make any demand, or to make any inquiry as to the nature or
sufficiency  of any  payment  received  by it or to present or file any claim or
notice or take any action with respect to any Collateral or the monies due or to
become due  thereunder  or to take any steps  necessary  to preserve  any rights
against prior parties.  Neither Mitchell Entertainment nor the agent or designee
of  Mitchell  Entertainment  shall have any  liability  to any  Assignor  on the
Collateral  for actions taken in good faith pursuant to this Section and without
gross negligence.

      7. As respects Stock Collateral:

            (a) So long as no  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing,  the  Assignors  shall  have  the  right  to  exercise  all  voting,
consensual and other powers of ownership  pertaining to the Stock Collateral for
all purposes not  inconsistent  with the terms of any Basic  Document,  provided
that the  Assignors  agree that they will not vote the Stock  Collateral  in any
manner that is inconsistent with the terms of the Purchase  Agreement,  the Note
or any Related Agreement.

            (b) So long as no  Event  of  Default  shall  have  occurred  and be
continuing,  the Assignors shall be entitled to receive and retain any dividends
on the Stock Collateral paid in cash.

            (c) If any Event of Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing,
and whether or not  Mitchell  Entertainment  exercises  any  available  right to
declare any  Obligation  due and  payable or seeks or pursues  any other  right,
remedy, power or privilege available to it under applicable law or this Security
Agreement,  all dividends and other  distributions on the Stock Collateral shall
be paid directly to Mitchell Entertainment and shall be deemed part of the Stock
Collateral,  subject to the terms of this Security  Agreement,  and, if Mitchell
Entertainment  shall so  request,  the  Assignors  shall  execute and deliver to
Mitchell Entertainment  appropriate additional dividend,  distribution and other
orders and  instruments  to that end,  provided that if such Event of Default is
cured, any such dividend or distribution paid to Mitchell Entertainment prior to
such cure shall,  upon request of the Assignors (except to the extent applied to
the Obligations), be returned by Mitchell Entertainment to the Assignors.

                                       9

      8. If any Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing:

            (a)  Mitchell  Entertainment  may (i) open any  Assignor's  mail and
collect any and all amounts due to any Assignor from other persons,  (ii) notify
any account  debtor  obligated  on any of the  Receivables  or any  purchaser of
Collateral  or any other  person of  Mitchell  Entertainment's  interest  in the
Collateral  and instruct any such persons to make payments  thereon  directly to
Mitchell  Entertainment  and  (iii)  notify  postal  authorities  that  all mail
addressed to any Assignor is to be delivered to Mitchell Entertainment.

            (b) Mitchell  Entertainment may grant extensions,  compromise claims
and settle  Collateral for less than face value, all without prior notice to any
Assignor.

            (c) Mitchell  Entertainment  shall have the right,  on behalf of any
Assignor,  (i) to enter into, or renegotiate,  any lease, license, sale or other
agreements  relating to any  Collateral in which any Assignor has an interest as
Mitchell  Entertainment  deems appropriate;  (ii) to require,  demand,  collect,
receive, settle, adjust and compromise and to give acquittances and receipts for
the payment of any and all monies payable pursuant to all agreements relating to
any item of Collateral  to which any Assignor may be a party;  (iii) to file any
claims  and/or  proofs of claim and to  commence,  maintain or  discontinue  any
actions, suits or other proceedings deemed by Mitchell  Entertainment  advisable
for the purpose of collecting or enforcing  payment of any such monies;  (iv) to
receive or endorse any checks,  drafts or other  orders or  instruments  for the
payment of monies  payable to any  Assignor  which shall be issued in respect of
such money;  (v) to execute any and all  instruments,  agreements  or  documents
which may be necessary or desirable under the  circumstances;  and (vi) to apply
all receipts so derived as herein  provided.  Mitchell  Entertainment,  however,
shall not be  obligated  to make any  demand or  present or file any claim or to
take any action authorized hereby.  Each Assignor shall gather up and deliver to
Mitchell Entertainment, and shall use its best efforts to cause third parties to
gather up and deliver to Mitchell Entertainment,  all materials, books, records,
documents  and  things  of  any  nature  (including,   without  limitation,  the
Collateral)  required by Mitchell  Entertainment  in the  exercise of its rights
hereunder upon Mitchell Entertainment's request. Each Assignor shall thereafter,
unless requested to do otherwise by Mitchell Entertainment,  continue to perform
its  respective  obligations in accordance  with all agreements  relating to any
Collateral to which it is a party.  If any agreement  relating to any Collateral
provides for fees to be paid to any Assignor for services  rendered  thereunder,
any  Assignor  shall  cause all such fees to be  remitted  directly  to Mitchell
Entertainment.

            (d)   Mitchell   Entertainment   may  exercise  in  respect  of  the
Collateral,  in addition to other  rights and  remedies  provided  for herein or
otherwise  available to it, all the rights and remedies of a secured party under
the Uniform  Commercial Code of the State of Florida (the "Code"),  and Mitchell
Entertainment  may also  without  notice  except  as  specified  below  sell the
Collateral or any part thereof in one or more parcels at public or private sale,

                                       10
<PAGE>

for cash,  on credit  or for  future  delivery,  and upon  such  other  terms as
Mitchell Entertainment in its sole and absolute discretion may deem commercially
reasonable.  Any  Assignor  agrees that,  to the extent  notice of sale shall be
required by law, at least ten (10) days'  notice to any Assignor of the time and
place of any public sale or the time after which any private  sale is to be made
shall constitute reasonable  notification.  Mitchell  Entertainment shall not be
obligated  to make any sale of  Collateral  regardless  of notice of sale having
been given.  Mitchell  Entertainment may adjourn any public or private sale from
time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed therefor, and such sale
may,  without further  notice,  be made at the time and place to which it was so
adjourned.  Any Assignor hereby waives any claims against Mitchell Entertainment
arising  by reason of the fact that the price at which any  Collateral  may have
been sold at such a private  sale was less than the price  which might have been
obtained  at a public  sale,  even if Mitchell  Entertainment  accepts the first
offer received and does not offer such Collateral to more than one offeree,  and
in all events such sale shall be deemed to be  commercially  reasonable.  At any
such public or private sale, Mitchell  Entertainment may be the purchaser of the
Collateral.

            (e) Any cash held by Mitchell  Entertainment  as Collateral  and all
cash  proceeds  received  by Mitchell  Entertainment  in respect of any sale of,
collection  from, or other  realization  upon all or any part of the  Collateral
may,  in  the  discretion  of  Mitchell  Entertainment,   be  held  by  Mitchell
Entertainment  as Collateral for, and/or then or at any time thereafter  applied
in whole or in part by  Mitchell  Entertainment  against  all or any part of the
Obligations  in such order as Mitchell  Entertainment  shall  elect.  After such
application  and after  payment by Mitchell  Entertainment  of any other  amount
required  by law,  any  surplus of such cash or cash  proceeds  held by Mitchell
Entertainment  and remaining after payment in full of all the Obligations  shall
be paid over to any  Assignor  or to  whomsoever  may be  lawfully  entitled  to
receive such  surplus.  In a like manner,  each  Assignor  shall pay to Mitchell
Entertainment, without demand, whatever amount of the Obligations remains unpaid
after  the  Collateral  has been sold and the  proceeds  applied  as  aforesaid,
together  with  interest  thereon  from the date of demand at the  highest  rate
permitted  under  applicable law, which interest shall also constitute a part of
the Obligations.  Without limiting the foregoing,  any Assignor hereby expressly
waives any obligations  Mitchell  Entertainment may have regarding the foregoing
under Section 9207(c) of the Code.

            (f) Mitchell  Entertainment  shall not be obligated to resort to its
rights or remedies with respect to any other security for or guaranty or payment
of the  Obligations  before  resorting  to its rights and  remedies  against any
Assignor  or the  Collateral  hereunder.  All rights and  remedies  of  Mitchell
Entertainment shall be cumulative and not in the alternative.

      9. If the Assignor  defaults in the  performance  or fulfillment of any of
the terms,  conditions,  promises,  covenants,  provisions  or warranties on any
Assignor's  part to be performed or fulfilled under or pursuant to this Security
Agreement,  Mitchell  Entertainment may, at its option without waiving its right
to enforce this Security Agreement according to its terms, immediately or at any
time thereafter and without notice to the Assignor,  perform or fulfill the same
or cause the  performance or fulfillment of the same for the Assignor's  account
and at the  Assignor's  cost  and  expense,  and the cost  and  expense  thereof
(including   reasonable   attorneys'   fees  incurred   through  all  levels  of
proceedings)  shall be added to the  Obligations  and shall be payable on demand
with interest thereon at the highest rate permitted by law.

                                       11
<PAGE>

      10. Each Assignor hereby appoints Mitchell Entertainment,  any of Mitchell
Entertainment's officers,  employees or any other person or entity whom Mitchell
Entertainment  may  designate  as our  attorney,  with  power  to  execute  such
documents in our behalf and to supply any omitted information and correct patent
errors in any  documents  executed by such  Assignor  or on our behalf;  to file
financing  statements  against the Assignor  covering the  Collateral  (and,  in
connection  with the  filing  of any such  financing  statements,  describe  the
Collateral  as "all assets and all personal  property,  whether now owned and/or
hereafter acquired" (or any substantially  similar variation thereof));  to sign
such  Assignor's  name on public  records;  and to do all other things  Mitchell
Entertainment  deems  necessary  to carry  out  this  Security  Agreement.  Each
Assignor  hereby  ratifies  and  approve  all acts of the  attorney  and neither
Mitchell  Entertainment  nor  the  attorney  will  be  liable  for  any  acts of
commission or omission,  nor for any error of judgment or mistake of fact or law
other than their gross  negligence  or willful  misconduct  (as  determined by a
court of competent  jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable  decision).  This
power being coupled with an interest,  is irrevocable so long as any Obligations
remains unpaid.

      11. No delay or failure on Mitchell Entertainment's part in exercising any
right, privilege or option hereunder shall operate as a waiver of such or of any
other right, privilege,  remedy or option, and no waiver whatever shall be valid
unless in writing,  signed by Mitchell Entertainment and then only to the extent
therein set forth, and no waiver by Mitchell  Entertainment of any default shall
operate  as a waiver of any other  default  or of the same  default  on a future
occasion.  Mitchell  Entertainment's  books and records  containing entries with
respect to the  Obligations  shall be  admissible  in  evidence in any action or
proceeding,  shall be binding upon the Assignor for the purpose of  establishing
the items  therein set forth and shall  constitute  prima  facie proof  thereof.
Mitchell  Entertainment  shall have the right to enforce  any one or more of the
remedies  available  to Mitchell  Entertainment,  successively,  alternately  or
concurrently.  Each  Assignor  agrees to join  with  Mitchell  Entertainment  in
executing  financing  statements or other  instruments to the extent required by
the Code in form  satisfactory to Mitchell  Entertainment  and in executing such
other  documents  or  instruments  as may be  required  or deemed  necessary  by
Mitchell   Entertainment  for  purposes  of  affecting  or  continuing  Mitchell
Entertainment's security interest in the Collateral.

      12.  This  Security  Agreement  shall  be  governed  by and  construed  in
accordance  with the laws of the  State of  Florida  and  cannot  be  terminated
orally. All of the rights, remedies,  options, privileges and elections given to
Mitchell  Entertainment  hereunder  shall  inure  to  the  benefit  of  Mitchell
Entertainment's  successors and assigns.  The term "Mitchell  Entertainment"  as
herein  used  shall  include  Mitchell  Entertainment,  any  parent of  Mitchell
Entertainment,   any  of   Mitchell   Entertainment's   subsidiaries   and   any
co-subsidiaries  of Mitchell  Entertainment's  parent,  whether now  existing or
hereafter  created  or  acquired,  and all of the terms,  conditions,  promises,
covenants,  provisions and warranties of this Security  Agreement shall inure to
the  benefit  of each of the  foregoing  and  shall  bind  the  representatives,
successors  and  assigns  of any  Assignor  and each of the  foregoing.  Each of
Mitchell  Entertainment  and the Assignor hereby (a) submit to the  nonexclusive
jurisdiction  of any Florida  court  sitting in the County of  Broward,  and (b)
waive any objection such Assignor or Mitchell  Entertainment  may have as to the
bringing or maintaining of such action with any such court.

                                       12

      13. All notices  from  Mitchell  Entertainment  to any  Assignor  shall be
sufficiently  given if mailed or  delivered  to the  Assignor at its address set
forth in the Securities Purchase Agreement.

      14.  Assignor  hereby waives and releases,  for itself and anyone claiming
through,  by, or under it, to the maximum  extent  permitted  by the laws of the
State of Florida: (a) all benefit that might accrue to Assignor by virtue of any
present or future law  exempting  the  Collateral,  or any part of the  proceeds
arising from any sale thereof,  from attachment,  levy or sale on execution,  or
providing for any  appraisement,  valuation,  stay of execution,  exemption from
civil process,  redemption or extension of time for payment;  (b) all notices of
default,  or Mitchell  Entertainment's  actual  exercise of any option or remedy
under any  Documents,  or  otherwise;  and (c) any right to have the  Collateral
marshalled.

                                       13

      15. EACH ASSIGNOR AND MITCHELL  ENTERTAINMENT HEREBY MUTUALLY,  KNOWINGLY,
WILLINGLY,  INTENTIONALLY AND VOLUNTARILY WAIVE THEIR RIGHT TO TRIAL BY JURY AND
NO PARTY NOR ANY  ASSIGNEE,  SUCCESSOR,  HEIR,  OR LEGAL  REPRESENTATIVE  OF THE
PARTIES (ALL OF WHOM ARE HEREINAFTER  COLLECTIVELY REFERRED TO AS THE "PARTIES")
SHALL SEEK A JURY TRIAL IN ANY LAWSUIT,  PROCEEDING,  COUNTERCLAIM  OR ANY OTHER
LITIGATION  PROCEEDING  BASED UPON OR ARISING OUT OF THIS SECURITY  AGREEMENT OR
ANY  DOCUMENTS  OR  ANY  INSTRUMENT  EVIDENCING,  SECURING  OR  RELATING  TO THE
INDEBTEDNESS  OR OTHER  OBLIGATIONS  SECURED HEREBY OR ANY RELATED  AGREEMENT OR
INSTRUMENT,  ANY OTHER  COLLATERAL  FOR THE  INDEBTEDNESS  OR OTHER  OBLIGATIONS
SECURED HEREBY OR ANY COURSE OF ACTION,  COURSE OF DEALING,  STATEMENTS (WHETHER
VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS  RELATING TO THE NOTE OR THIS SECURITY  AGREEMENT.
THE PARTIES ALSO WAIVE ANY RIGHT TO CONSOLIDATE ANY ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL
HAS BEEN WAIVED WITH ANY OTHER ACTION IN WHICH A JURY TRIAL HAS NOT BEEN WAIVED.
THE  PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION HAVE BEEN FULLY  NEGOTIATED BY THE PARTIES.  THE
WAIVER  CONTAINED  HEREIN IS  IRREVOCABLE,  CONSTITUTES  A KNOWING AND VOLUNTARY
WAIVER, AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO EXCEPTIONS.



                           Very truly yours,
