         WHEREAS,  Buyer and Seller  desire to amend the Contract in  accordance
with the terms and conditions set forth herein.

         NOW, THEREFORE,  in consideration of the sum of Ten and 00/100 ($10.00)
Dollars and other good and valuable  consideration,  the parties do hereby agree

conditions of this Amendment.

         4. Buyer and Seller agree that the third sentence of Section 3.3.1.D of

Note or any  portion  thereof  shall be  convertible,  at any time,  at the sole
option of Seller into the common stock, no par value, of Buyer (the  "Conversion
Shares")  at a  conversion  price of $3.50 per  share."  is hereby  deleted  and

Promissory  Note or any  portion  thereof,  which is equal  to or  greater  than
$40,000.00, shall be convertible, at any time, at the sole option of Seller into
the  common  stock,  no par  value,  of Buyer  (the  "Conversion  Shares")  at a
conversion price of $2.50 per share."

         5.  Buyer and Seller  hereby  agree that in  addition  to the  Purchase
Price,  the  amount of  $37,500.00  shall be paid to Buyer in the form of 37,500

(the "Third Extension Shares"), which will be issued,  transferred and delivered

substantially  similar  to the Stock  Purchase  Agreement.  The Third  Extension
Shares shall constitute an additional non-refundable Deposit under the Contract.

         8. In the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions of the
Contract  and  the  terms  and  provisions  of this  Amendment,  the  terms  and
provisions of this Amendment shall control and prevail, and otherwise, except as
modified herein, the Contract shall continue in full force and effect.

         9. That all, each and every of the terms,  covenants and  conditions in
the Contract which are not inconsistent herewith are hereby expressly confirmed,
ratified and declared to be in full force and effect.

         10. This Agreement may be modified only by written modification hereto,

         11. This Amendment may be executed in two or more counterparts, each of
