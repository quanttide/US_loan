derived from and known about our business and operations.

ITEM 1.01    ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 22, 2004, we entered into a Securities  Purchase Agreement,
effective as of December 20, 2004 (the "Securities  Purchase  Agreement"),  with
Mitchell  Entertainment  Company,  a Delaware  limited  liability  company  (the
"Lender"),  pursuant to which we issued to the Lender a secured convertible term
note in the aggregate  principal amount of $3,000,000 (the "Note") and a warrant
to purchase up to  2,000,000  shares of our common stock (the  "Warrant")  at an
initial  exercise  price of $2.00 per share.  In connection  with the closing of
this loan  transaction,  we incurred  issuance costs of approximately  $200,000,
which  includes  the  reimbursement  to the  Lender  for its costs and  expenses
(including  legal  fees)  related to the loan  transaction  and a finders fee of
$60,000 paid to Palmetto Services, Inc., an affiliate of the Lender.

         The Note bears interest at 10% per annum, payable monthly commencing on
January 1, 2005. The maturity date of the Note is December 19, 2006,  subject to
the Lender's right to (a) extend the maturity date if we do not satisfy  certain
financial  covenants or (b) to call the Note upon our failure to satisfy certain
financial  conditions  or the  cessation  of  the  active  participation  in our
business of certain key persons.  In  addition,  the Lender has the right at any
time to convert the  principal  amount of the Note,  together  with interest due
thereon, into shares of our common stock at an initial conversion price of $1.50
per share.  At any time after  December 16, 2005, we have the right to cause the
Lender to convert  the entire  principal  amount of the Note into  shares of our
common stock provided:

      o     all shares to be acquired by the Lender are freely tradable  without
            restriction whatsoever,

      o     the  principal  market for our  common  stock is either the NASD OTC
            Bulletin  Board,  the NASDAQ  SmallCap  Market,  the National Market
            System, the American Stock Exchange or the New York Stock Exchange,

      o     our common stock must have closed on the principal market at a price
            of not less than $5.00 per share for ninety (90) consecutive trading
            days within the one hundred  (100) trading days  terminating  on the
            last  trading  day prior to the date of  delivery  of the  mandatory
            conversion notice to the Lender,
<PAGE>

      o     we deliver  to the  Lender a  certificate  of our  President,  Chief
            Financial Officer and Secretary confirming that none of such persons
            knows of any fact or circumstance affecting us that would reasonably
            and foreseeably  cause the closing price of our common stock to fall
            below $5.00 per share  during the next thirty (30)  trading  days on
            the principal market, and

      o     no  event  of  default  (as  defined  in  the  Note)  exists  and is
            continuing.

The Note may be pre-paid in part or in full at any time, subject to the Lender's
right to purchase our common stock at the  conversion  price of the Note. In the
event of the  occurrence  and  continuance of an event of default (as defined in
the Note) we are required to pay the Lender a default interest rate equal to 18%
per annum.  Upon an event of default and after any applicable grace period,  the
Lender may  declare all  outstanding  principal,  interest  and other fees to be
immediately  due and payable.  The Warrant is  exercisable  through the close of
business on the later of (a) December  31, 2009 or (b) the maturity  date of the
Note. Both the Note and the Warrant provide for anti-dilution  protection in the
event we issue  shares of our  common  stock at a per share  price less than the
conversion price of the Note and/or exercise price of the Warrant,  in the event
we issue additional shares of our common stock as a dividend or distribution; in
the event we subdivide or combine our common  stock;  or in the event our EBITDA
for the quarter ended September 30, 2006 is not at least $5,000,000. The Warrant
also  provides  that  if the SEC  does  not  declare  effective  a  registration
statement  covering the shares of common  stock  issuable  upon  exercise of the
Warrant  within the time periods set forth below,  the number of shares that the
holder  of the  Warrant  will be  entitled  to  receive  upon  exercise  will be
increased by 20,000 shares for each 30 day period of delay (prorated for partial
periods) at the exercise price in effect immediately prior to such increase.

         We issued the Note and the Warrant in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities  Act"),  and/or Regulation D
of the Securities Act. We intend to issue any shares upon conversion of the Note
or exercise of the Warrant in reliance  upon Section  3(a)(9) of the  Securities
Act,  Section 4(2) of the Securities Act, and/or  Regulation D of the Securities
Act.  These  securities  may not be offered or sold in the United  States in the
absence  of  an  effective   registration   statement  or  exemption   from  the
registration  requirements  under the Securities Act. An appropriate  legend has
been  placed on the Note and  Warrant  issued,  and will be placed on the shares
issued upon the conversion of the Note and exercise of the Warrant.

         In  connection  with the issuance and sale of the Note and Warrant,  on
December 22, 2004 we entered into a Registration Rights Agreement,  effective as
of December  20, 2004 (the  "Registration  Rights  Agreement"),  with the Lender
pursuant to which we agreed to (i) file a shelf registration  statement covering
the resale of the shares of our common stock issuable upon the conversion of the
Note and  exercise  of the Warrant no later than April 30, 2005 and (ii) use our
reasonable  commercial  efforts  to  cause  such  registration  statement  to be
declared  effective no later than 180 days after December 20, 2004. With respect
to the shares of our common stock  issuable  upon the  anti-dilution  provisions
contained  in the Note and the Warrant,  we agreed to file a shelf  registration
statement no later than 30 days after the occurrence of such an issuance and use
<PAGE>

our reasonable  commercial  efforts to cause such  registration  statement to be
declared  effective  no later than 45 days  after the filing  date of such shelf
registration statement.  In addition,  pursuant to the terms of the Registration
Rights  Agreement,  we must use our  reasonable  commercial  efforts to keep the
shelf registration  statements  continuously  effective under the Securities Act
until the earlier of when (i) all the securities registered thereunder have been
sold or (ii)  all the  securities  thereunder  may be sold  immediately  without
registration under the Securities Act and without volume  restrictions  pursuant
to Rule 144(k)  under the  Securities  Act. We also  granted  certain  piggyback
registration rights pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement. If we fail to
meet certain of our obligations  under the Registration  Rights  Agreement,  the
Registration  Rights  Agreement  provides  that we must  pay to the  holders  of
registrable  securities  (as  defined  in  the  Registration  Rights  Agreement)
liquidated  damages in the form of a cash  payment  equal to .5% of the original
principal  amount  of the Note  for each 30 day  period  (prorated  for  partial
periods) for which we are in default of the Registration  Rights Agreement until
the applicable default is cured.

         As  reported  on our  Current  Report on Form 8-K filed with the SEC on
November 30, 2004, the above described loan transaction was conditioned upon our
acquisition  of the real property  located at 3200 West Oakland Park  Boulevard,
Lauderdale Lakes, Florida (the "Lauderdale Property").  On December 22, 2004, we
entered into a Mortgage Deed and Security Agreement,  Master Security Agreement,
and  Assignment of Rents,  Leases and Deposits each of which was effective as of
December  20,  2004 with the Lender  pursuant  to which our  obligations  to the
Lender under the Note and related agreements are secured by a second mortgage on
the  Lauderdale  Property  (including  all of our rights  title and  interest as
lessor in and to all leases or rental  arrangements of the Lauderdale  Property)
and   substantially  all  of  our  assets  and  the  assets  and  stock  of  our
subsidiaries. On December 22, 2004, the Lender and the Seller (as defined below)
also entered into a Subordination Agreement,  effective as of December 20, 2004,
which was agreed to,  accepted  and  acknowledged  by us,  pursuant to which the
parties agreed that the Lender's  mortgage on the Lauderdale  Property and other
obligations  due from us to the  Lender  shall be  subordinate  to the  Seller's
mortgage on the  Lauderdale  Property and other  obligations  due from us to the
Seller.

         As an additional inducement to the Lender, on December 22, 2004 we also
entered into an Environmental Indemnity Agreement,  effective as of December 20,
2004,  with the Lender  pursuant  to which we agreed  to,  among  other  things,
indemnify the Lender against any claims,  losses, fines,  penalties,  judgments,
damages,  costs or expenses (including  attorney's fees, consultant fees, expert
fees) and all other  liabilities  arising out of or resulting from activities on
the Lauderdale Property involving toxic materials or the improper  installation,
maintenance or removal of any underground storage tank.

        All of the documents described above are filed herewith as exhibits and
are incorporated  herein by reference.  The summary of the transaction set forth
above is qualified in its entirety by reference to such exhibits.

ITEM 2.01    COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

         On December 22, 2004,  pursuant to the Agreement for Purchase and Sale,
effective as of September 10, 2004, as amended by the Amendment for Purchase and
Sale, effective as of October 25, 2004, and Amendment No. 2 to the Agreement for
Purchase and Sale,  effective as November 30, 2004 (together,  the "Agreement"),
with Charley Zeches,  in her capacity as trustee of Lakes Holding Trust U/A (the
"Seller"),  we purchased  the  Lauderdale  Property.  The purchase  price of the
Lauderdale Property consisted of Eight Hundred Sixty Thousand Dollars ($860,000)
in cash  paid at or prior  to  closing,  a  convertible  promissory  note in the
principal amount of Seven Million Dollars ($7,000,000) and 312,500 shares of our
common stock.

         The  purchase  price was paid as follows:  (i) we made a deposit in the
amount of One Hundred  Thousand  Dollars  ($100,000) on September 14, 2004 which
was released  from escrow on or about October 25, 2004,  (ii) we issued  250,000
shares of our common stock to Elizabeth Buntrock, an affiliate of the Seller, on
or about  October 25, 2004 in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the  Securities  Act
and/or  Regulation  D  of  the  Securities  Act,  which  shares  have  piggyback
registration rights, (iii) we paid Six Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($650,000)
to the Seller at the closing,  (iv) we issued a convertible  promissory  note to
the Seller in the principal amount of Seven Million Dollars  ($7,000,000) at the
closing, (v) we issued 25,000 shares of our common stock on or about October 25,
2004 to Elizabeth Buntrock,  in reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
and/or  Regulation  D under the  Securities  Act,  which  shares have  piggyback
registration rights, (vi) we paid Fifty Thousand Dollars ($50,000) to the Seller
on October 29, 2004,  (vii) we paid  Twenty-Two  Thousand  Five Hundred  Dollars
($22,500) to the Seller on November 10, 2004,  (viii) we issued 37,500 shares of
our  common  stock on or about  December  14,  2004 to  Elizabeth  Buntrock,  in
reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities  Act and/or  Regulation D under the
Securities  Act, which shares have piggyback  registration  rights,  and (ix) we
paid  Thirty-Seven  Thousand  Five  Hundred  Dollars  ($37,500) to the Seller on
November 29, 2004. The purchase price described above includes  $100,000 in cash
and  62,500  shares of our  common  stock  issued in  connection  with  Seller's
agreeing  to extend the closing  date of this  transaction  beyond the  original
close date that had been contemplated in the Agreement.

         The  Seller  may,  at any  time,  convert  all or  any  portion  of the
promissory  note described above into shares of our common stock at a conversion
price of $2.50 per share  (subject  to certain  adjustments).  Any shares of our
common  stock  issued  upon  conversion  will be issued in  reliance  on Section
3(a)(9)  of the  Securities  Act,  Section  4(2) of the  Securities  Act  and/or
Regulation  D of the  Securities  Act and will  include  piggyback  registration
rights.  Subject to the Seller's right of conversion,  we may prepay all amounts
owing under the promissory  note without  penalty.  The promissory  note accrues
interest at an annual rate of 6.5%,  payable  monthly  commencing  on January 1,
2005 and shall mature on November 1, 2005. At the closing,  we deposited into an
escrow  account a prepayment of interest and estimated  real estate taxes in the
amount of One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars ($150,000). We will deposit into an
escrow account,  additional quarterly prepayments of interest and estimated real
estate  taxes,  each in the amount of One Hundred  Forty-Five  Thousand  Dollars
($145,000)  on  January  25,  2005,  April 25,  2005 and August  25,  2005.  The
<PAGE>

promissory  note also  requires  that a  principal  payment in the amount of Two
Hundred Fifty Thousand  Dollars  ($250,000) be paid on April 25, 2005. If we are
delinquent in any payments  required under the  promissory  note, we must pay to
the  Seller,  in  addition  to any  interest  or other  sums  payable  under the
promissory  note,  a service  charge  equal to 5% of the  amount of any  payment
received  by the  Seller 10 days or more  after the due date  thereof.  Upon the
occurrence of any other default  under the  promissory  note or under any of the
Loan Documents (as defined in the promissory  note) we shall pay the Seller,  on
demand,  interest on all sums  outstanding at 18% per annum. In the event of the
continuation of any default in the payment of any interest, principal or escrows
under the promissory note for a period of 10 days after due, or in the event the
Seller  deems  itself  insecure  or upon the  occurrence  of any other  event of
default  under  the  promissory  note,  any of the  Loan  Documents,  any  other
documents  delivered to the Seller in connection with the promissory note or any
other  obligation  of us to the  Seller,  then the Seller may declare the entire
outstanding  principal,  interest and other  charges to be  immediately  due and
payable.

         In addition to the aggregate  purchase price, in  consideration  of the
initial  extension of the closing  date,  we issued  25,000 shares of our common
stock on or about  October  25,  2004 to AUW,  Inc.,  which  assisted us and the
Seller in connection with the sale and purchase of the Lauderdale  Property,  in
reliance upon Section 4(2) of the Securities  Act and/or  Regulation D under the
Securities Act, which shares have piggyback  registration  rights.  In addition,
pursuant to the sale  agreements,  we agreed that AUW,  Inc. will be provided an
office  (free of charge as to rent only) in the  Building  through  November 30,
2005.

         On December 22, 2004, we also entered into a Mortgage Deed and Security
Agreement  and  Assignment  of  Rents,  Leases  and  Deposits  each of which was
effective  as of  December  20,  2004  with the  Seller  pursuant  to which  our
obligations to the Seller under the promissory  note and related  agreements are
secured by a mortgage on the  Lauderdale  Property  (including all of our rights
title and interest as lessor in and to all leases or rental  arrangements of the
Lauderdale Property).

         The  material  terms of this  transaction  previously  disclosed in our
current  reports on Forms 8-K filed with the SEC on September 20, 2004,  October
29, 2004 and December 14, 2004 are incorporated herein by reference.  All of the

December 9, 2004 and December 15, 2004,  we entered into  separate  Subscription
<PAGE>

Agreements with several accredited  investors.  Pursuant to such agreements,  we
issued  (i)  convertible  promissory  notes in  aggregate  principal  amount  of
$675,000,  which  notes  accrue  interest  at an annual  rate of 10%,  mature in
October,  November  or December of 2006,  and are  convertible  at any time into
shares of common  stock at a  conversion  price of $3.00 per  share,  subject to
certain  adjustments,  and (ii)  warrants to purchase  an  aggregate  of 132,335
shares of our common stock at an exercise  price of $3.00 per share,  subject to
certain  adjustments.  We have the right to cause  each  holder  of  convertible
promissory  notes  described above to convert his, her or its notes in the event
the market closing price of our common stock is greater than $5.00 per share for
more than 20 consecutive  trading days at anytime during the term of his, her or
its note. If any required  payment under a  convertible  promissory  note is not
paid within 15 days from and  including  its due date,  then in such event,  all
past due amounts  under such  convertible  promissory  note will be subject to a
late  penalty of five cents on every dollar  owed.  If we fail to pay  principal
and/or  interest  on the date on which it  falls  due or to  perform  any of the
agreements,  conditions,  covenants,  provisions, or stipulations contained in a
convertible  promissory  note,  then the holder of such note, at his, her or its
option may declare  immediately  due and payable  the entire  unpaid  balance of
principal with interest from the date of default at the rate of 10% per year. In
such case, the holder of the note may also recover all costs in connection  with
suit, a reasonable  attorney's fee for collection,  and interest on any judgment
obtained  by such  holder  at the rate of 10% per  year.  The  warrants  are all
immediately  exercisable  and  mature two years  from the date of  issuance.  We
issued the  aforementioned  securities  in  reliance  upon  Section  4(2) of the
Securities Act and/or Regulation D of the Securities Act. We intend to issue any
shares upon  conversion  or exercise of the  securities in reliance upon Section
3(a)(9) of the  Securities  Act,  Section  4(2) of the  Securities  Act,  and/or
Regulation D of the Securities Act. These  securities may not be offered or sold
in the United  States in the absence of an effective  registration  statement or
exemption  from the  registration  requirements  under the  Securities  Act.  An
appropriate  legend has been placed on the securities issued, and will be placed
on the shares  issued upon the  conversion or exercise (as  applicable)  of such
securities.   The  security  issuances   described  in  this  paragraph  include
convertible promissory notes in aggregate principal amount of $228,000 disclosed
