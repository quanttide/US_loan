loss as a result of any realization upon any collateral granted by it to secure
its obligations under this <U>Article&nbsp;Three</U>, each other Guarantor (each a
&#147;<U>Non-Paying Guarantor</U>&#148;) shall contribute to such Paying Guarantor an
amount equal to such Non-Paying Guarantor&#146;s &#147;<U>Pro Rata Share</U>&#148; of such
payment or payments made, or losses suffered, by such Paying Guarantor. For
the purposes hereof, each Non-Paying Guarantor&#146;s &#147;<U>Pro Rata Share</U>&#148; with
respect to any such payment or loss by a Paying Guarantor shall be determined
as of the date on which such payment or loss was made by reference to the ratio
of (i)&nbsp;such Non-Paying Guarantor&#146;s Maximum Liability as of such date (without
giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution
hereunder) or, if such Non-Paying Guarantor&#146;s Maximum Liability has not been
determined, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such Non-Paying
Guarantor from the Company after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital
infusion or by other means) to (ii)&nbsp;the aggregate Maximum Liability of all
Guarantors hereunder (including such Paying Guarantor) as of such date (without
giving effect to any right to receive, or obligation to make, any contribution
hereunder), or to the extent that a Maximum Liability has not been determined
for any Guarantors, the aggregate amount of all monies received by such
Guarantors from the Company after the date hereof (whether by loan, capital
infusion or by other means). Nothing in this <U>Section&nbsp;3.08(3)</U> shall
affect any Guarantor&#146;s several liability for the entire amount of the
Guaranteed Obligations (up to such Guarantor&#146;s Maximum Liability). Each of the
Guarantors covenants and agrees that its right to receive any contribution
under this<U> Article&nbsp;Three</U> from a Non-Paying Guarantor shall be
subordinate and junior in right of payment to all the Guaranteed Obligations.
The provisions of this <U>Section&nbsp;3.08(3)</U> are for the benefit of both the
Holders and the Guarantors and may be enforced by any one, or more, or all of
them in accordance with the terms hereof.

Guarantee of any such

&#147;<U>Notes</U>&#148;) issued pursuant to the indenture dated as of June&nbsp;28, 1996 (the
&#147;<U>Indenture</U>&#148;) by and between The Ryland Group, Inc. (the

terms and limitations of the Notes, the Indenture, the Supplemental Indenture
and this Guarantee. This Guarantee will become effective in accordance with

ascribed to them in the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December&nbsp;22,

amended or supplemented (the &#147;<U>Supplemental Indenture</U>&#148;) or the Indenture,
as the case may be.

OF LAW. Each of the Guarantors submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the
State of New York sitting in the Borough of Manhattan, City of New York, and of
the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, in any
action or proceeding to enforce any of their obligations under this Guarantee,
and agree not to seek a transfer of any such action or proceeding on the basis
of inconvenience of the forum or otherwise (but the Guarantors shall not be
prevented from removing any such action or proceeding from a state court to the
United States District Court for the Southern District of New York). Each of
the Guarantors agree that process in any such action or proceeding may be
served upon it by registered mail or in any other manner permitted by the rules
of the court in which the action or proceeding is brought.
