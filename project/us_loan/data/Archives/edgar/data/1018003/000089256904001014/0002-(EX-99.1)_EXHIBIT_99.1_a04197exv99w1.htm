technology distributor, today announced the promotion of Keith Bradley to executive vice president
and president of its North American region, effective January&nbsp;3, 2005.

Murai, president, Ingram Micro Inc.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Keith is an outstanding leader,&#148; said Murai. &#147;Under his direction, the North American region
delivered excellent results through superior execution of our core operations and by introducing

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In his new role, Bradley will lead the company&#146;s largest region, which includes the United
States and Canada. He replaces Murai, who was promoted to president of the corporation along with
Greg Spierkel in March&nbsp;2004. Bradley joined the company in February&nbsp;2000 as vice president and
controller for the United States operation and was promoted to senior vice president and chief
financial officer of the North American region in January&nbsp;2003. He was a key leader of the

Prior to joining Ingram Micro, Bradley was vice president and global controller of The Disney
Stores, a subsidiary of Walt Disney Company, and an auditor and consultant with Price
WaterhouseCoopers in the United Kingdom, United Arab Emirates and the United States. Bradley is a
chartered accountant in the United Kingdom, with bachelor&#146;s and master&#146;s degrees in accounting from
the University of Belfast. He is located in the company&#146;s North American headquarters in Santa

Foster. &#147;Keith is a reflection of our goal of developing leaders with diverse backgrounds, who
value both extensive IT knowledge and entrepreneurial ideas. The breadth and depth of this team
gives Ingram Micro a distinct advantage in the marketplace.&#148;
