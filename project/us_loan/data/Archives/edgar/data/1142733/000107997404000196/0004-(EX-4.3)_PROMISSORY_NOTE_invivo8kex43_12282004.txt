               Note into shares of the Company's common stock, subject to the
               restrictions contained herein. The conversion price per share
               shall be fifty percent (50%) of the average of the three lowest

               Board (or such other principal market or exchange where the
               Common Stock is listed or traded at the time of conversion) for
               the ten days immediately preceding the Maturity Date. Such
               election to convert shall be evidenced by completion of the
               conversion notice attached hereto and delivery of such notice to
               the Company within five business days of (i) the Holder's receipt
               of a notice from the Company pursuant to Section 2 that a
               prepayment is due, or (ii) the Maturity Date. The Holder's right

               shall supercede the Company's right to repay such obligations in
               cash, subject to the restrictions contained herein.

     (c)  The Company covenants that in case the principal of, and accrued
          interest on, the Note becomes due and payable by declaration or
          otherwise, then the Company will pay in cash, or in Common Stock of
          the Company if required under this Agreement, to the Holder of this
          Note, the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on
          this Note for principal or interest, as the case may be, and in
          addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to cover
          the costs and expenses of collection, including reasonable fees and
          disbursements of the Holder's legal counsel if no conversion of the
          Note to Common Stock of the Company has been made. In case the Company
          shall fail forthwith to pay such amount, the Holder may commence an
          action or proceeding at law or in equity for the collection of the
          sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or
          proceeding to judgment or final decree against Company or other
          obligor upon this Note, wherever situated, the monies adjudicated or
          decreed to be payable.
