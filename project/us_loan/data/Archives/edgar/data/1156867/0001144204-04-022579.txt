Experienced Executive To Help Company Develop Brand

PHILADELPHIA & LONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2004--TNX Television Holdings,
Inc. (OTCBB:TNXT; "TNX") announced today that it has appointed Peter Cuneo as
its Vice Chairman. The appointment is effective immediately. Mr. Cuneo was the
President and CEO of Marvel Enterprises, Inc. (NYSE: MVL - News), where he led a
previously bankrupt company to a prominent position in the entertainment
industry. Currently, he is the Vice Chairman of Marvel. In his new role, Mr.
Cuneo is expected to draw upon a wealth of experience in building leading
consumer and entertainment brands.

"We are delighted that Peter has elected to join us at such an opportune time
for the Company," said Irwin Gross, TNX's Chairman and CEO. "He has been able to
capitalize on many of the leading entertainment brands such as Spider-Man,
X-Men, Blade and Daredevil, Hulk while at Marvel, as well as other consumer
brands at Remington Products and Black & Decker, among others. We expect him to
play a significant role as our Television Network expands into key markets such
as London"

While at Marvel, Mr. Cuneo helped the Company significantly improve its
operations, increasing EBITDA in just two years by $84 million. In his
approximately three-year term at Marvel, the company's market capitalization
increased by $2.2 billion. Prior to joining Marvel, Mr. Cuneo was a Managing
Director at Cortec Group, a private equity fund. Previously, he was President
and CEO of Remington Products Company, President of Black & Decker Corporation's
Security Hardware Group and President Bristol-Myers Squibb's Canadian
Pharmaceutical Division.

"I look forward to joining TNX Television to help it capitalize on the
extraordinary opportunity to change the way passengers commute," said Mr. Cuneo.
"I believe the Company is uniquely positioned to deliver compelling content to
commuters and ideal demographics for advertisers."

Currently, he is a member of the Board of Directors for Waterpik Technologies,
Majesco Holdings, Inc., and a Vice Chairman of Alfred University. He received
his BS from Alfred University and was awarded a Master' Degree from Harvard
