<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Chairman
Charles Finn stated, &#147;We are very excited about our senior staff expansion, the new
direction of our lending programs and additional services, which we believe will present
opportunities for growth and retention of customer relationships. Although the increased
staffing levels and the expansion of services will initially increase our administrative
costs, we are hopeful the anticipated loan growth and trust services will translate into
increased growth and profitability for our Company. </FONT></P>
