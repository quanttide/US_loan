          Plan, a copy of which is being furnished herewith to the Employee, is
          incorporated by reference herein and shall govern as to all matters not
          expressly provided for in this Agreement. Terms not defined herein have the

          <U>Award of Restricted Stock: Escrow</U>.&nbsp;&nbsp; The Company hereby awards the Employee
          9,500 shares of Restricted Stock, which shall have a Restricted Period as set
          forth in Section 3(a) herein. The shares of Restricted Stock awarded hereunder
          (the &#147;Shares&#148;) shall be placed in escrow with the Escrow Agent
          selected by the Committee (as such term is defined in the Plan) until all
          restrictions (the &#147;Restrictions&#148;) specifically set forth in this
          Agreement and in Section 5 of the Plan with respect to the Shares shall expire
          or be cancelled, at which time the Shares shall be released from escrow and the
          Company shall issue to the Employee a stock certificate with respect to such
          Shares, free of all Restrictions. Restricted Stock shall have all dividend and
          voting rights as set forth in Section 5.2 of the Plan. Cash dividends paid on
          the Restricted Stock while it is held in escrow shall be promptly delivered to
          the Employee. Dividends paid in stock or property and shares issued in
          connection with a stock split shall be added to the escrow account and held
          until the expiration of the Restricted Period for the Shares upon which such
          dividend or stock split was paid. If the Employee forfeits any shares awarded
          hereunder, such Shares (along with any related dividends paid in stock or
          property and shares issued in connection with a stock split) shall automatically
          revert to the Company (without any payment by the Company to the Employee) and
          shall no longer be held in escrow for the Employee. </FONT></P>

          rates on the fair market value of the Shares and dividends at the time they

          Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;), within 30 days of the
          Award Date, he or she will be subject to tax at ordinary income rates on the
          fair market value of the Shares on the Award Date (determined without regard to
          the Restrictions). The foregoing statement of tax consequences is intended only
          as a generalized statement of current federal tax law (as in existence on the
          date of this Agreement) and the Employee should consult with his or her tax
          consultant to determine the specific tax consequences of this award from time to
          time. The Employee hereby agrees to pay to the Company prior to the delivery of
          any Shares hereunder the amount of any federal, state or local income taxes
          which the Company is required by law to withhold in connection herewith. The
          Employee shall notify the Company within 10 days of making an election under
          Section&nbsp;83(b), or any successor section, of the Code and agrees to pay the
          Company such tax withholding amounts within 10 days thereafter. </FONT></P>
