not dispose of Shares acquired pursuant to this option (i) within 2 years of the date
this option is granted or (ii) within 1 year after such shares are transferred to the
Employee. The foregoing statement of tax consequences is intended only as a generalized
statement of current Federal tax law (as in existence on the date of this Agreement) and
the Employee should consult his or her tax consultant to determine the specific tax
consequences of his or her exercise of this Option. An employee who disposes of his
Shares prior to the expiration of such holding period shall notify the Company, within 10
days after the disposition occurs, of the date of the sale and the amount of gain on the
sale (to permit the Company to deduct the gain for tax purposes) and shall deliver to the

under the Act has been filed and remains effective with respect to the Shares, the
Company shall require that the offer and sale of such Shares be exempt from the
registration provisions of the Act. As a condition of such exemption, the Company shall
require a representation and undertaking, in form and substance satisfactory to counsel
for the Company, that the optionee is acquiring the Shares for his own account for
investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof and shall otherwise
require such representations and impose such conditions as shall establish to the Company&#146;s
satisfaction that the offer and sale of the Shares issuable upon the exercise of the
Option will not constitute a violation of the Act or any similar state act affecting the
offer and sale. If the shares are issued in an exempt transaction, the Shares shall bear
