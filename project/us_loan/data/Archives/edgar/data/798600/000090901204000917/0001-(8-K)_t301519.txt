ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On December 28, 2004, the Company as guarantor and its wholly owned subsidiary
Willey Brothers, Inc. ("Willey Brothers") as borrower entered into a tenth
amendment to the senior credit facility of Willey Brothers with Bank of America
Business Capital, successor-in-interest to Fleet Capital Corporation. The tenth
amendment to the facility provides for a twelve month extension of the facility
comprised of a $3,300,000 term loan and a revolving credit facility of
$1,750,000 for the first three months which will be reduced to $1,500,000 for
the balance of the term of the amendment. The non default rate of interest under
the tenth amendment will be the base rate plus 3.5%. As an additional fully
earned non-refundable amendment fee, Willey Brothers will pay 0.5% of the
Obligations as of and on January 3, 2005; plus 1% of the Obligations as of and
on June 30, 2005 and 1.5% of the Obligations as of and on September 30, 2005.
Under the terms of the tenth amendment to the facility, Willey Brothers will pay
prepayments toward the balance due under the term loan of $100,000 a month for
the first six months which will increase to $200,000 a month for the remainder
of the term. Additionally under the amendment, Willey Brothers will pay $25,000
a month for the first six months of the term of the amendment toward previously
outstanding amendment fees of $580,000. The payments toward previously
outstanding amendment fees will increase to $50,000 a month for the last six
months of the amendment. The amended credit facility continues to impose certain
other loan covenants on Willey Brothers and the Company. The facility expires on
December 31, 2005 with the right of prepayment without penalty during its term.
