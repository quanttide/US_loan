21, 2004 <B>&#151; ImmuCell Corporation (NASDAQ: ICCC)</B> today announced that it has entered into a product development and marketing agreement with Pfizer Animal Health, a division of Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), for Mast Out&reg;, a Nisin-based
treatment for mastitis in lactating dairy cows. The transaction entails ImmuCell receiving an up front payment from Pfizer as well as contingent milestone payments and royalties on sales. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Pfizer&#146;s interest in our technology is a significant endorsement of its potential,&#148; commented Michael F.
Brigham, president and CEO. &#147;We believe that the depth of resources that Pfizer can bring to bear on this opportunity will strengthen and expand this effort into a global development and marketing program maximizing the value for our
shareholders.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">ImmuCell granted Pfizer a worldwide,
exclusive, long-term license to sell the product. Pfizer will be responsible for clinical, regulatory and commercial manufacturing development. ImmuCell will supply product for efficacy trials that are expected to begin in the first half of 2005. In
January 2004, ImmuCell announced statistically significant cure rates in an experimental field trial of Mast Out&reg; involving 139 cows with subclinical mastitis. FDA-approved mastitis treatments currently on the market have the disadvantage of
requiring that milk from treated cows be discarded for a period during and after treatment. Mast Out&reg; has the potential to earn regulatory approval for the treatment of mastitis without this discard requirement. </FONT></P> <P

R&amp;D team has focused on moving Mast Out&reg; toward licensure in the USA, building on Nisin&#146;s 50 year history of safety as a food preservative,&#148; commented Dr. Joseph H. Crabb, vice president and chief scientific officer for ImmuCell.
&#147;Despite significant regulatory challenges, we have pushed the development to the point where it now makes sense to team up with Pfizer to continue the mission of making Mast Out&reg; an integral tool in modern mastitis management
worldwide.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">ImmuCell will continue to make and sell Wipe
Out&reg; Dairy Wipes, a topical Nisin-based product used to prepare the cow&#146;s teat area prior to milking. ImmuCell also plans to continue investigating other potential Nisin-containing products to the proof-of-concept stage for evaluation of
their global market potential by Pfizer or others. Pfizer has an option to negotiate rights to any such animal health product with an intramammary application. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>
