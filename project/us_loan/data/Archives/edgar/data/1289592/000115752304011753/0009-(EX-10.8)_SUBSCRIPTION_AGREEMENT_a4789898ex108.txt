                  parties hereto agree as follows:

applicable  securities  law,  are  being  offered  for  sale  by  the  Trust  in

requirement  of law that the  disposition of its property be at all times within
its  control  and  subject to its  ability  to resell  such  Capital  Securities

         2.5. The  Purchaser  represents  and warrants  that no filing with,  or
authorization, approval, consent, license, order, registration, qualification or
decree of, any governmental  body, agency or court having  jurisdiction over the

performing  any material  obligation set forth in this  Agreement;  and (ii) the

the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated  herein,  will not, with or
without  the  passage of time or giving of notice,  result in any such  material
