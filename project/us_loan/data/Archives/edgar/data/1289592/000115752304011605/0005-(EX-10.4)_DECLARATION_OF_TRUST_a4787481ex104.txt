to fail or cease to  qualify as a "grantor  trust"  for  United  States  federal
income tax  purposes or (B) to require  the trust to  register as an  Investment
Company  under the  Investment  Company  Act,  (iv) incur any  indebtedness  for
borrowed  money or issue any other  debt,  or (v) take or  consent to any action
that would result in the placement of a lien on any of the Trust  Property.  The
Institutional  Trustee shall, at the sole cost and expense of the Trust,  defend
all claims and  demands of all Persons at any time  claiming  any lien on any of
the Trust Property  adverse to the interest of the Trust or the Holders in their
capacity as Holders.

         (c) In connection with the issuance and sale of the Capital Securities,
the  Sponsor  shall have the right and  responsibility  to assist the Trust with
respect  to, or effect on behalf of the Trust,  the  following  (and any actions
taken by the Sponsor in furtherance  of the following  prior to the date of this
Declaration are hereby ratified and confirmed in all respects):

                  (i) the taking of any action  necessary to obtain an exemption
         from the Securities Act;

                  (ii) the  determination of the  jurisdictions in which to take
         appropriate  action to qualify or register  for sale all or part of the
         Capital  Securities  and the  determination  of any and all such  acts,
         other  than  actions  which must be taken by or on behalf of the Trust,
         and the  advice  to the  Administrators  of  actions  they must take on
         behalf of the Trust,  and the  preparation  for execution and filing of
         any documents to be executed and filed by the Trust or on behalf of the
         Trust,  as the Sponsor deems  necessary or advisable in order to comply
         with the applicable laws of any such States in connection with the sale
         of the Capital Securities;

                  (iii) the  negotiation  of the terms of, and the execution and
         delivery  of, the  Placement  Agreement  providing  for the sale of the
         Capital Securities; and

                  (iv) the taking of any other actions necessary or desirable to
         carry out any of the foregoing activities.

         (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Administrators
and the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities are
authorized  and  directed to conduct the affairs of the Trust and to operate the
Trust so that the  Trust  will not (i) be  deemed  to be an  Investment  Company
required to be registered under the Investment  Company Act, and (ii) fail to be
classified as a "grantor  trust" for United States  federal income tax purposes.
The  Administrators  and the Holders of a Majority in liquidation  amount of the
Common  Securities shall not take any action  inconsistent with the treatment of
the Debentures as indebtedness of the Debenture Issuer for United States federal
income tax purposes. In this connection, the Administrators and the Holders of a
Majority in liquidation  amount of the Common  Securities are authorized to take
any action,  not inconsistent  with applicable laws, the Certificate of Trust or
this Declaration,  as amended from time to time, that each of the Administrators
and the Holders of a Majority  in  liquidation  amount of the Common  Securities
determines in their discretion to be necessary or desirable for such purposes.

                                       13

         (e)  All  expenses  incurred  by the  Administrators  or  the  Trustees
pursuant  to this  Section  2.6  shall be  reimbursed  by the  Sponsor,  and the
Trustees and the  Administrators  shall have no obligations with respect to such
expenses.

         (f) The assets of the Trust shall consist of the Trust Property.

         (g) Legal title to all Trust  Property  shall be vested at all times in
the  Institutional  Trustee  (in its  capacity  as such)  and  shall be held and
administered by the Institutional Trustee and the Administrators for the benefit
of the Trust in accordance with this Declaration.

         (h) If the  Institutional  Trustee  or any Holder  has  instituted  any
proceeding  to  enforce  any right or remedy  under  this  Declaration  and such
proceeding  has been  discontinued  or  abandoned  for any  reason,  or has been
determined adversely to the Institutional Trustee or to such Holder, then and in
every such case the Sponsor,  the  Institutional  Trustee and the Holders shall,
subject to any  determination  in such  proceeding,  be restored  severally  and
respectively to their former positions hereunder,  and thereafter all rights and
remedies of the  Institutional  Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though
no such proceeding had been instituted.

         SECTION 2.7.  PROHIBITION OF ACTIONS BY THE TRUST AND THE INSTITUTIONAL
TRUSTEE.

         (a) The Trust shall not, and the Institutional  Trustee shall cause the
Trust not to,  engage in any activity  other than as required or  authorized  by
this  Declaration.  In  particular,  the Trust  shall not and the  Institutional
Trustee shall cause the Trust not to:

                  (i) invest any proceeds received by the Trust from holding the
         Debentures,  but shall  distribute  all such proceeds to Holders of the
         Securities  pursuant  to  the  terms  of  this  Declaration  and of the
         Securities;

                  (ii)  acquire  any  assets  other than as  expressly  provided
         herein;

                  (iii) possess Trust Property for other than a Trust purpose;

                  (iv) make any loans or incur any indebtedness other than loans
         represented by the Debentures;

                  (v)  possess  any power or  otherwise  act in such a way as to
         vary  the  Trust  assets  or the  terms  of the  Securities  in any way
         whatsoever other than as expressly provided herein;

                  (vi) issue any  securities  or other  evidences of  beneficial
         ownership  of, or  beneficial  interest  in,  the Trust  other than the
         Securities;

                  (vii) carry on any "trade or  business" as that phrase is used
         in the Code; or

                  (viii) other than as provided in this  Declaration  (including
         Annex I), (A) direct the time, method and place of exercising any trust
         or power  conferred  upon the  Debenture  Trustee  with  respect to the
         Debentures,  (B)  waive any past  default  that is  waivable  under the
         Indenture,  (C) exercise any right to rescind or annul any  declaration
         that the principal of all the Debentures  shall be due and payable,  or
         (D)  consent  to any  amendment,  modification  or  termination  of the
         Indenture or the Debentures where such consent shall be required unless
         the Trust  shall  have  received  a written  opinion  of counsel to the
         effect that such  modification  will not cause the Trust to cease to be
         classified as a "grantor  trust" for United States  federal  income tax
         purposes.

         SECTION 2.8. POWERS AND DUTIES OF THE INSTITUTIONAL TRUSTEE.

         (a) The  legal  title to the  Debentures  shall be owned by and held of
record in the name of the Institutional  Trustee in trust for the benefit of the
Trust and the Holders of the  Securities.  The right,  title and interest of the
Institutional  Trustee to the Debentures shall vest automatically in each Person
who may  hereafter be  appointed as  Institutional  Trustee in  accordance  with
Section 4.11. Such vesting and cessation of title shall be effective  whether or
not conveyancing  documents with regard to the Debentures have been executed and
delivered.

         (b) The Institutional  Trustee shall not transfer its right,  title and
interest in the Debentures to the Administrators or to the Delaware Trustee.

         (c) The Institutional Trustee shall:

                  (i) establish and maintain a segregated  non-interest  bearing
         trust  account  (the  "PROPERTY  ACCOUNT") in the name of and under the
         exclusive  control  of the  Institutional  Trustee,  maintained  in the
         Institutional  Trustee's trust department,  on behalf of the Holders of
         the  Securities  and,  upon the  receipt of  payments  of funds made in
         respect of the Debentures held by the  Institutional  Trustee,  deposit
         such funds into the Property  Account and make  payments,  or cause the
         Paying Agent to make payments, to the Holders of the Capital Securities
         and  Holders  of the Common  Securities  from the  Property  Account in
         accordance  with Section 5.1.  Funds in the Property  Account  shall be
         held uninvested until disbursed in accordance with this Declaration;

                  (ii)  engage  in  such  ministerial  activities  as  shall  be
         necessary  or  appropriate  to effect  the  redemption  of the  Capital
         Securities  and the Common  Securities to the extent the Debentures are
         redeemed or mature; and

                  (iii)  upon  written  notice  of  distribution  issued  by the
         Administrators  in accordance with the terms of the Securities,  engage
         in such ministerial  activities as shall be necessary or appropriate to
         effect the distribution of the Debentures to Holders of Securities upon
         the  occurrence of certain  circumstances  pursuant to the terms of the
         Securities.

         (d) The  Institutional  Trustee  may  bring or  defend,  pay,  collect,
compromise,  arbitrate,  resort to legal  action with  respect to, or  otherwise
adjust  claims or  demands  of or  against,  the Trust  that  arise out of or in
connection  with an  Event of  Default  of which a  Responsible  Officer  of the
Institutional  Trustee has actual  knowledge or arises out of the  Institutional
Trustee's duties and obligations under this Declaration; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
if an Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing  and  such  event is
attributable to the failure of the Debenture  Issuer to pay interest or premium,
if any, on or principal of the Debentures on the date such interest, premium, if
any, or  principal is otherwise  payable (or in the case of  redemption,  on the
redemption date), then a Holder of the Capital Securities may directly institute
a proceeding  for  enforcement  of payment to such Holder of the principal of or
premium,  if any, or interest on the Debentures  having a principal amount equal
to the aggregate  liquidation amount of the Capital Securities of such Holder (a
"DIRECT  ACTION")  on  or  after  the  respective  due  date  specified  in  the
Debentures.  In connection with such Direct Action, the rights of the Holders of
the Common  Securities  will be  subrogated  to the rights of such Holder of the
Capital  Securities to the extent of any payment made by the Debenture Issuer to
such Holder of the Capital Securities in such Direct Action; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that no Holder of the Common  Securities  may exercise such right of subrogation
so long as an Event of  Default  with  respect  to the  Capital  Securities  has
occurred and is continuing.

                                       15

         (e) The  Institutional  Trustee  shall  continue  to serve as a Trustee
until either:

                  (i) the Trust has been completely  liquidated and the proceeds
         of the  liquidation  distributed  to  the  Holders  of  the  Securities
         pursuant to the terms of the Securities and this Declaration; or

                  (ii) a Successor  Institutional Trustee has been appointed and
         has accepted that appointment in accordance with Section 4.11.

         (f) The  Institutional  Trustee  shall have the legal power to exercise
all of the rights, powers and privileges of a Holder of the Debentures under the
Indenture  and,  if  an  Event  of  Default   occurs  and  is  continuing,   the
Institutional Trustee may, for the benefit of Holders of the Securities, enforce
its rights as holder of the  Debentures  subject  to the  rights of the  Holders
pursuant  to  this  Declaration  (including  Annex  I)  and  the  terms  of  the
Securities.

         The  Institutional  Trustee must  exercise the powers set forth in this
Section 2.8 in a manner that is  consistent  with the purposes and  functions of
the Trust set out in Section 2.3, and the  Institutional  Trustee shall not take
any action that is inconsistent with the purposes and functions of the Trust set
out in Section 2.3.

         SECTION 2.9. CERTAIN DUTIES AND  RESPONSIBILITIES  OF THE INSTITUTIONAL
TRUSTEE AND ADMINISTRATORS.

         (a) The  Institutional  Trustee,  before the occurrence of any Event of
Default and after the curing or waiving of all such  Events of Default  that may
have occurred,  shall undertake to perform only such duties as are  specifically
set forth in this  Declaration and no implied  covenants shall be read into this
Declaration  against the Institutional  Trustee. In case an Event of Default has
occurred  (that has not been  cured or waived  pursuant  to  Section  6.7),  the
Institutional  Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this  Declaration,  and use the  same  degree  of care  and  skill  in  their
exercise,  as a prudent person would exercise or use under the  circumstances in
the conduct of his or her own affairs.

         (b) The duties and  responsibilities  of the Institutional  Trustee and
the Administrators shall be as provided by this Declaration. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  no provision of this  Declaration  shall  require the  Institutional
Trustee or  Administrators  to expend or risk their own funds or otherwise incur
any financial liability in the performance of any of their duties hereunder,  or
in the exercise of any of their rights or powers if the Institutional Trustee or
such  Administrator  shall have reasonable  grounds to believe that repayment of
such  funds  or  adequate  protection  against  such  risk of  liability  is not
reasonably assured to Institutional  Trustee or such  Administrator.  Whether or
not therein expressly so provided,  every provision of this Declaration relating
to the conduct or affecting  the  liability of or  affording  protection  to the
Institutional  Trustee or  Administrators  shall be subject to the provisions of
this  Article.  Nothing in this  Declaration  shall be  construed  to relieve an
Administrator the Institutional  Trustee from liability for the  Instititutional
Trustee's  or  such  Administrator's  own  negligent  act,  the  Instititutional
Trustee's  or  such  Administrator's  own  negligent  failure  to  act,  or  the
Instititutional Trustee's or such Administrator's own willful misconduct. To the
extent that, at law or in equity, the Institutional  Trustee or an Administrator
has  duties  and  liabilities  relating  to the  Trust  or to the  Holders,  the
Institutional  Trustee or such Administrator shall not be liable to the Trust or
to any Holder for the Institutional Trustee's or such Administrator's good faith
reliance  on  the  provisions  of  this  Declaration.  The  provisions  of  this
Declaration,  to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of the
Administrators  or the  Institutional  Trustee  otherwise  existing at law or in
equity,  are agreed by the Sponsor and the Holders to replace  such other duties
and liabilities of the Administrators or the Institutional Trustee.

                                       16
<PAGE>

         (c) All payments made by the Institutional Trustee or a Paying Agent in
respect of the Securities  shall be made only from the revenue and proceeds from
the Trust Property and only to the extent that there shall be sufficient revenue
or proceeds  from the Trust  Property to enable any  Institutional  Trustee or a
Paying Agent to make payments in accordance with the terms hereof.  Each Holder,
by its acceptance of a Security,  agrees that it will look solely to the revenue
and  proceeds  from the Trust  Property  to the  extent  legally  available  for
distribution   to  it  as  herein   provided  and  that  the  Trustees  and  the
Administrators  are not personally liable to it for any amount  distributable in
respect of any Security or for any other  liability in respect of any  Security.
This Section  2.9(c) does not limit the liability of the Trustees  expressly set
forth elsewhere in this Declaration.

         (d) The  Institutional  Trustee shall not be liable for its own acts or
omissions  hereunder  except as a result of its own  negligent  action,  its own
negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

                  (i) the  Institutional  Trustee  shall not be  liable  for any
         error of judgment  made in good faith by an  Authorized  Officer of the
         Institutional Trustee, unless it shall be proved that the Institutional
         Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

                  (ii)  the  Institutional  Trustee  shall  not be  liable  with
         respect to any action  taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith
         in  accordance  with the  direction  of the  Holders of not less than a
         Majority in liquidation  amount of the Capital Securities or the Common
         Securities,  as applicable,  relating to the time,  method and place of
         conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Institutional
         Trustee,   or  exercising  any  trust  or  power   conferred  upon  the
         Institutional Trustee under this Declaration;

                                       17
<PAGE>

                  (iii) the  Institutional  Trustee's  sole duty with respect to
         the custody,  safekeeping  and physical  preservation of the Debentures
         and the  Property  Account  shall be to deal  with such  property  in a
         similar manner as the Institutional Trustee deals with similar property
         for its fiduciary  accounts  generally,  subject to the protections and
         limitations on liability  afforded to the  Institutional  Trustee under
         this Declaration;

                  (iv) the  Institutional  Trustee  shall not be liable  for any
         interest on any money  received by it except as it may otherwise  agree
         in  writing  with the  Sponsor;  and  money  held by the  Institutional
         Trustee  need not be  segregated  from other funds held by it except in
         relation  to the  Property  Account  maintained  by  the  Institutional
         Trustee  pursuant  to  Section  2.8(c)(i)  and  except  to  the  extent
         otherwise required by law; and

                  (v) the  Institutional  Trustee shall not be  responsible  for
         monitoring  the  compliance by the  Administrators  or the Sponsor with
         their  respective  duties  under  this   Declaration,   nor  shall  the
         Institutional  Trustee be liable for any default or  misconduct  of the
         Administrators or the Sponsor.

         SECTION 2.10. CERTAIN RIGHTS OF INSTITUTIONAL  TRUSTEE.  Subject to the
provisions of Section 2.9:

         (a) the Institutional  Trustee may conclusively rely and shall fully be
protected  in  acting,  or  refraining  from  acting,  in good  faith  upon  any
resolution, opinion of counsel, certificate,  written representation of a Holder
or  transferee,  certificate  of auditors or any other  certificate,  statement,
instrument,   opinion,  report,  notice,  request,  direction,  consent,  order,
appraisal,  bond, debenture, note, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper
or  document  believed  by it to be  genuine  and to have been  signed,  sent or
presented by the proper party or parties;

         (b) if  (i) in  performing  its  duties  under  this  Declaration,  the
Institutional  Trustee is  required  to decide  between  alternative  courses of
action,  (ii) in  construing  any of the  provisions  of this  Declaration,  the
Institutional  Trustee finds the same ambiguous or  inconsistent  with any other
provisions contained herein, or (iii) the Institutional Trustee is unsure of the
application of any provision of this Declaration,  then, except as to any matter
as to which the  Holders of Capital  Securities  are  entitled to vote under the
terms of this Declaration, the Institutional Trustee may deliver a notice to the
Sponsor requesting the Sponsor's written instructions as to the course of action
to be taken and the  Institutional  Trustee  shall take such action,  or refrain
from taking such action,  as the  Institutional  Trustee  shall be instructed in
writing, in which event the Institutional Trustee shall have no liability except
for its own negligence or willful misconduct;

         (c)  any  direction  or  act  of  the  Sponsor  or  the  Administrators
contemplated by this Declaration shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers'
Certificate;

         (d)  whenever  in  the   administration   of  this   Declaration,   the
Institutional  Trustee  shall  deem it  desirable  that a matter  be  proved  or
established before undertaking,  suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the
Institutional Trustee (unless other evidence is herein specifically  prescribed)
may request and  conclusively  rely upon an Officers'  Certificate as to factual
matters which, upon receipt of such request,  shall be promptly delivered by the
Sponsor or the Administrators;

                                       18
<PAGE>

         (e)  the  Institutional  Trustee  shall  have  no  duty  to  see to any
recording,  filing or registration of any instrument (including any financing or
continuation  statement  or any  filing  under  tax or  securities  laws) or any
rerecording, refiling or reregistration thereof;

         (f) the Institutional Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection
(which counsel may be counsel to the Sponsor or any of its  Affiliates)  and the
advice of such counsel shall be full and complete  authorization  and protection
in respect of any action  taken,  suffered  or omitted by it  hereunder  in good
faith  and  in  reliance  thereon  and  in  accordance  with  such  advice;  the
Institutional  Trustee  shall  have the  right at any time to seek  instructions
concerning the  administration  of this  Declaration from any court of competent
jurisdiction;

         (g) the Institutional  Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise
any of the rights or powers vested in it by this  Declaration  at the request or
direction  of any of the  Holders  pursuant  to this  Declaration,  unless  such
Holders shall have offered to the  Institutional  Trustee  security or indemnity
reasonably  satisfactory to it against the costs, expenses and liabilities which
might be incurred by it in compliance with such request or direction;  PROVIDED,
that nothing  contained in this  Section  2.10(g)  shall be taken to relieve the
Institutional  Trustee,  subject to Section  2.9(b),  upon the  occurrence of an
Event of Default (that has not been cured or waived pursuant to Section 6.7), of
the  power to  exercise  such of the  rights  and  powers  vested  in it by this
Declaration,  and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,  as a
prudent person would exercise or use under the  circumstances  in the conduct of
his or her own affairs;

         (h)  the  Institutional   Trustee  shall  not  be  bound  to  make  any
investigation  into the facts or matters stated in any resolution,  certificate,
statement,   instrument,  opinion,  report,  notice,  request,  consent,  order,
approval, bond, debenture, note or other evidence of indebtedness or other paper
or document,  unless  requested in writing to do so by one or more Holders,  but
the  Institutional  Trustee may make such further inquiry or investigation  into
such facts or matters as it may see fit;

         (i) the  Institutional  Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
hereunder or perform any duties  hereunder  either directly or by or through its
agents or attorneys and the  Institutional  Trustee shall not be responsible for
any misconduct or negligence on the part of or for the  supervision of, any such
agent or attorney appointed with due care by it hereunder;

                                       19
<PAGE>

         (j)   whenever  in  the   administration   of  this   Declaration   the
Institutional  Trustee  shall deem it  desirable  to receive  instructions  with
respect to enforcing  any remedy or right or taking any other  action  hereunder
the Institutional  Trustee (i) may request  instructions from the Holders of the
Capital  Securities  which  instructions may only be given by the Holders of the
same  proportion  in  liquidation  amount of the Capital  Securities as would be
entitled  to direct the  Institutional  Trustee  under the terms of the  Capital
Securities  in respect of such  remedy,  right or action,  (ii) may refrain from
enforcing  such  remedy  or  right  or  taking  such  other  action  until  such
instructions  are  received,  and (iii)  shall be fully  protected  in acting in
accordance with such instructions;

         (k) except as otherwise  expressly  provided in this  Declaration,  the
Institutional  Trustee shall not be under any obligation to take any action that
is discretionary under the provisions of this Declaration;

         (l) when the Institutional  Trustee incurs expenses or renders services
in connection  with a Bankruptcy  Event,  such expenses  (including the fees and
expenses of its counsel) and the  compensation for such services are intended to
constitute  expenses of administration  under any bankruptcy law or law relating
to creditors rights generally;

         (m) the Institutional Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of an
Event of  Default  unless a  Responsible  Officer of the  Institutional  Trustee
obtains actual  knowledge of such event or the  Institutional  Trustee  receives
written  notice of such  event from any  Holder,  the  Sponsor or the  Debenture
Trustee;

         (n)  any  action  taken  by the  Institutional  Trustee  or its  agents
hereunder  shall  bind the  Trust and the  Holders  of the  Securities,  and the
signature of the  Institutional  Trustee or its agents alone shall be sufficient
and effective to perform any such action and no third party shall be required to
inquire as to the authority of the Institutional  Trustee to so act or as to its
compliance  with any of the terms and  provisions of this  Declaration,  both of
which shall be  conclusively  evidenced  by the  Institutional  Trustee's or its
agent's taking such action; and

         (o) no provision of this Declaration shall be deemed to impose any duty
or  obligation  on the  Institutional  Trustee  to  perform  any  act or acts or
exercise any right, power, duty or obligation conferred or imposed on it, in any
jurisdiction in which it shall be illegal, or in which the Institutional Trustee
shall be  unqualified  or  incompetent  in accordance  with  applicable  law, to
perform any such act or acts,  or to exercise  any such  right,  power,  duty or
obligation.  No  permissive  power or authority  available to the  Institutional
Trustee shall be construed to be a duty.

         SECTION 2.11. DELAWARE TRUSTEE.  Notwithstanding any other provision of
this  Declaration  other than Section 4.1,  the  Delaware  Trustee  shall not be
entitled to exercise any powers,  nor shall the Delaware Trustee have any of the

described in this  Declaration  (except as may be required  under the  Statutory
Trust Act).  Except as set forth in Section 4.1, the Delaware Trustee shall be a
Trustee for the sole and limited  purpose of fulfilling the  requirements of ss.
3807 of the Statutory Trust Act.

         SECTION 2.12.  EXECUTION OF DOCUMENTS.  Unless otherwise  determined in

behalf of the Trust any documents, agreements,  instruments or certificates that
the  Trustees  or the  Administrators,  as the case may be,  have the  power and
authority to execute pursuant to Section 2.6.

         SECTION 2.13. NOT  RESPONSIBLE  FOR RECITALS OR ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES.
The recitals  contained in this Declaration and the Securities shall be taken as
the statements of the Sponsor, and the Trustees do not assume any responsibility

         SECTION 2.14.  DURATION OF TRUST. The Trust,  unless earlier  dissolved
pursuant to the  provisions of Article VII hereof,  shall be in existence for 35
years from the Closing Date.

         SECTION 2.15. MERGERS.

         (a) The Trust may not consolidate,  amalgamate,  merge with or into, or
be  replaced  by,  or  convey,  transfer  or lease  its  properties  and  assets
substantially  as an  entirety  to any  corporation  or other  body,  except  as
described  in  Sections  2.15(b)  and (c) and  except  in  connection  with  the
liquidation  of the Trust and the  distribution  of the Debentures to Holders of
Securities  pursuant to Section  7.1(a)(iv) of the  Declaration  or Section 4 of
Annex I.

         (b) The Trust may,  with the consent of the  Institutional  Trustee and
without  the  consent of the  Holders of the  Capital  Securities,  consolidate,
amalgamate,  merge with or into,  or be  replaced by a trust  organized  as such
under the laws of any state; provided that:

         (c) if the Trust is not the surviving  entity,  such  successor  entity
(the "SUCCESSOR ENTITY") either:

                           (A) expressly  assumes all of the  obligations of the
                  Trust under the Securities; or

                           (B) substitutes for the Securities  other  securities
                  having  substantially  the same terms as the  Securities  (the
                  "SUCCESSOR  SECURITIES") so that the Successor Securities rank
                  the same as the Securities rank with respect to  Distributions
                  and payments upon Liquidation, redemption and otherwise;

                  (ii) the Sponsor expressly appoints a trustee of the Successor
         Entity that possesses  substantially  the same powers and duties as the
         Institutional Trustee as the Holder of the Debentures;

                  (iii) such merger, consolidation,  amalgamation or replacement
         does not adversely affect the rights, preferences and privileges of the
         Holders of the Securities  (including any Successor  Securities) in any
         material respect;

                  (iv) the Institutional  Trustee receives written  confirmation
         from a nationally recognized statistical rating organization that rates
         securities  issued by the initial  purchaser of the Capital  Securities
         that it will not reduce or withdraw  the rating of any such  securities
         because of such  merger,  conversion,  consolidation,  amalgamation  or
         replacement;

                  (v)  such  Successor   Entity  has  a  purpose   substantially
         identical to that of the Trust;

                                       21
<PAGE>

                  (vi)  prior to such  merger,  consolidation,  amalgamation  or
         replacement,  the  Trust  has  received  an  opinion  of  a  nationally
         recognized independent counsel to the Trust experienced in such matters
         to the effect that:

                           (A)  such  merger,  consolidation,   amalgamation  or
                  replacement does not adversely affect the rights,  preferences
                  and privileges of the Holders of the Securities (including any
                  Successor Securities) in any material respect;

                           (B)    following    such    merger,    consolidation,
                  amalgamation  or  replacement,   neither  the  Trust  nor  the
                  Successor Entity will be required to register as an Investment
                  Company; and

                           (C)    following    such    merger,    consolidation,
                  amalgamation  or  replacement,  the  Trust  (or the  Successor
                  Entity) will continue to be  classified  as a "grantor  trust"
                  for United States federal income tax purposes;

                  (vii) the Sponsor guarantees the obligations of such Successor
         Entity under the Successor  Securities at least to the extent  provided
         by the Guarantee;

                  (viii) the Sponsor owns 100% of the common  securities  of any
         Successor Entity; and

                  (ix)  prior to such  merger,  consolidation,  amalgamation  or
         replacement, the Institutional Trustee shall have received an Officers'
         Certificate of the  Administrators  and an opinion of counsel,  each to
         the effect that all conditions  precedent under this Section 2.15(b) to
         such transaction have been satisfied.

         (d) Notwithstanding  Section 2.15(b),  the Trust shall not, except with
the  consent  of  Holders  of  100%  in  aggregate  liquidation  amount  of  the
Securities,  consolidate,  amalgamate, merge with or into, or be replaced by any
other entity or permit any other entity to consolidate,  amalgamate,  merge with
or  into,  or  replace  it  if  such  consolidation,   amalgamation,  merger  or
replacement  would cause the Trust or Successor Entity to be classified as other
than a grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.

                                  ARTICLE III.

in an amount at least equal to 3% of the capital of the Trust,  at the same time
as the Capital Securities are sold.

         SECTION 3.2.  RESPONSIBILITIES  OF THE SPONSOR.  In connection with the
issue and sale of the Capital  Securities,  the Sponsor shall have the exclusive
right and  responsibility  to engage in, or direct the  Administrators to engage

         (a) to determine the jurisdictions in which to take appropriate  action
to qualify or register for sale all or part of the Capital  Securities and to do
any and all such acts,  other than actions which must be taken by the Trust, and
advise the Trust of actions it must take,  and prepare for  execution and filing
any  documents  to be  executed  and filed by the Trust,  as the  Sponsor  deems
necessary,  advisable  or  incidental  thereto  in  order  to  comply  with  the
applicable laws of any such jurisdictions; and

                                       22
<PAGE>

         (b) to negotiate  the terms of and/or  execute and deliver on behalf of
the Trust, the Placement  Agreement and other related  agreements  providing for
the sale of the Capital Securities.

         SECTION  3.3.  EXPENSES.  In  connection  with the  offering,  sale and
issuance of the  Debentures to the Trust and in connection  with the sale of the
Securities  by the Trust,  the Sponsor,  in its  capacity as  Debenture  Issuer,
shall:

         (a) pay all  reasonable  costs and expenses  relating to the  offering,
sale and issuance of the  Debentures,  including  compensation  of the Debenture
Trustee under the Indenture in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture;

         (b) be responsible for and shall pay all debts and  obligations  (other
than with  respect to the  Securities)  and all costs and  expenses of the Trust
(including, but not limited to, costs and expenses relating to the organization,
maintenance  and dissolution of the Trust),  the offering,  sale and issuance of
the Securities (including fees to the placement agents in connection therewith),
the fees and expenses  (including  reasonable  counsel fees and expenses) of the

telecommunications  expenses and costs and expenses  incurred in connection with
the acquisition,  financing, and disposition of Trust assets and the enforcement
by the Institutional Trustee of the rights of the Holders; and

         (c) pay any and all taxes (other than United States  withholding  taxes
attributable to the Trust or its assets) and all liabilities, costs and expenses
with respect to such taxes of the Trust.

         The  Sponsor's  obligations  under  this  Section  3.3 shall be for the
benefit  of,  and shall be  enforceable  by,  any  Person  to whom  such  debts,
obligations,  costs,  expenses and taxes are owed (a "CREDITOR")  whether or not
such  Creditor has received  notice  hereof.  Any such  Creditor may enforce the
Sponsor's  obligations  under this Section 3.3 directly  against the Sponsor and
the  Sponsor  irrevocably  waives any right or remedy to  require  that any such
Creditor take any action against the Trust or any other Person before proceeding
against the Sponsor. The Sponsor agrees to execute such additional agreements as
may be necessary or desirable in order to give full effect to the  provisions of
this Section 3.3.

         SECTION 3.4. RIGHT TO PROCEED.  The Sponsor  acknowledges the rights of
Holders to institute a Direct Action as set forth in Section 2.8(d) hereto.

                    INSTITUTIONAL TRUSTEE AND ADMINISTRATORS

         SECTION 4.1. NUMBER OF TRUSTEES. The number of Trustees shall initially
be two, and;

         (a) at any time before the issuance of any Securities, the Sponsor may,
by written instrument, increase or decrease the number of Trustees; and

increased or decreased by vote of the Holder of a Majority in liquidation amount
of the  Common  Securities  voting as a class at a meeting  of the Holder of the
Common Securities;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that there shall be a Delaware Trustee if
required by Section  4.2; and there shall always be one Trustee who shall be the
Institutional Trustee, and such Trustee may also serve as Delaware Trustee if it
meets the  applicable  requirements,  in which case  Section  2.11 shall have no
application to such entity in its capacity as Institutional Trustee.

         SECTION 4.2. DELAWARE TRUSTEE.  If required by the Statutory Trust Act,
one Trustee (the "DELAWARE TRUSTEE") shall be:

         (a) a natural person who is a resident of the State of Delaware; or

         (b) if not a natural  person,  an entity which is  organized  under the
laws of the United States or any state thereof or the District of Columbia,  has
its principal  place of business in the State of Delaware,  and otherwise  meets
the  requirements of applicable  law,  including ss. 3807 of the Statutory Trust
Act.

         SECTION 4.3. INSTITUTIONAL TRUSTEE; ELIGIBILITY.

         capital   and  surplus  of  at  least  fifty   million   U.S.   dollars
         ($50,000,000.00), and subject to supervision or examination by Federal,
         state,  or District  of  Columbia  authority.  If such  corporation  or
         national association  publishes reports of condition at least annually,
         pursuant to law or to the  requirements of the supervising or examining
         authority  referred to above,  then for the  purposes  of this  Section
         4.3(a)(iii),  the combined  capital and surplus of such  corporation or
         national  association  shall be deemed to be its  combined  capital and
         surplus  as set  forth  in its  most  recent  report  of  condition  so
         published.

                                       24
<PAGE>

         (b) If at any time the Institutional Trustee shall cease to be eligible
to so act under Section  4.1(a),  the  Institutional  Trustee shall  immediately
resign in the manner and with the effect set forth in Section 4.3(a).

(c)      If the  Institutional  Trustee has or shall  acquire  any  "conflicting
         interest"  within the meaning of Section 310(b) of the Trust  Indenture
         Act of  1939,  as  amended,  the  Institutional  Trustee  shall  either
         eliminate  such  interest  or  resign,  to the extent and in the manner
         provided by, and subject to this Declaration.

         (d)  The  initial  Institutional  Trustee  shall  be  Wilmington  Trust
Company.

         SECTION 4.4. CERTAIN  QUALIFICATIONS OF THE DELAWARE TRUSTEE GENERALLY.

Declaration  and  except  with  respect to any action the taking of which is the
subject of a meeting of the Administrators,  any action required or permitted to
be  taken  by  the  Administrators  may  be  taken  by,  and  any  power  of the
Administrators  may be  exercised  by,  or with  the  consent  of,  any one such
Administrator.

         SECTION 4.6.  INITIAL  DELAWARE  TRUSTEE.  The initial Delaware Trustee
shall be Wilmington Trust Company.

         SECTION 4.7.  APPOINTMENT,  REMOVAL AND  RESIGNATION  OF  INSTITUTIONAL
TRUSTEE AND ADMINISTRATORS.

         (a)  Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary in this Declaration,  no
resignation  or  removal  of  any  Trustee  (the  "Relevant   Trustee")  and  no
appointment  of a  successor  Trustee  pursuant  to this  Article  shall  become
effective  until the  acceptance  of  appointment  by the  successor  Trustee in
accordance with the applicable requirements of this Section 4.8.

         (b)  Subject to the  immediately  preceding  paragraph,  a Trustee  may
resign  at any time by giving  written  notice  thereof  to the  Holders  of the
Securities and by appointing a successor Relevant Trustee.  Upon the resignation
of  the  Institutional  Trustee,  the  Institutional  Trustee  shall  appoint  a
successor by  requesting  from at least three  Persons  meeting the  eligibility
requirements their expenses and charges to serve as the successor  Institutional
Trustee on a form provided by the  Administrators,  and selecting the Person who
agrees  to  the  lowest  expense  and  charges  (the  "SUCCESSOR   INSTITUTIONAL
TRUSTEE").  If the  instrument of acceptance by the successor  Relevant  Trustee
required  by this  Section  4.8 shall not have been  delivered  to the  Relevant
Trustee  within 60 days  after  the  giving of such  notice  of  resignation  or
delivery of the instrument of removal, the Relevant Trustee may petition, at the
expense of the Trust,  any  Federal,  state or  District  of  Columbia  court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Relevant Trustee. Such
court may  thereupon,  after  prescribing  such  notice,  if any, as it may deem
proper,  appoint a Relevant  Trustee.  The  Institutional  Trustee shall have no
liability for the selection of such successor pursuant to this Section 4.8.


                                       25
<PAGE>

         (c) Unless an Event of Default shall have  occurred and be  continuing,
any Trustee may be removed at any time by an act of the Holders of a Majority in
liquidation amount of the Common Securities. If any Trustee shall be so removed,
the  Holders of the Common  Securities,  by act of the  Holders of a Majority in
liquidation  amount of the Common Securities  delivered to the Relevant Trustee,
shall  promptly  appoint  a  successor  Relevant  Trustee,  and  such  Successor
Institutional  Trustee  shall comply with the  applicable  requirements  of this
Section 4.7. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and be  continuing,  the
Institutional  Trustee or the Delaware Trustee,  or both of them, may be removed
by the act of the  Holders of a Majority  in  liquidation  amount of the Capital
Securities, delivered to the Relevant Trustee (in its individual capacity and on
behalf of the Trust). If any Trustee shall be so removed, the Holders of Capital
Securities,  by act of the  Holders of a Majority in  liquidation  amount of the
Capital  Securities then outstanding  delivered to the Relevant  Trustee,  shall
promptly appoint a successor Relevant Trustees, and such successor Trustee shall
comply with the  applicable  requirements  of this  Section 4.8. If no successor
Relevant  Trustee  shall have been so  appointed by the Holders of a Majority in
liquidation  amount of the Capital  Securities  and accepted  appointment in the
manner  required  by this  Section  4.7,  within 30 days  after  delivery  of an
instrument of removal,  the Relevant Trustee or any Holder who has been a Holder
of the Securities for at least 6 months may, on behalf of himself and all others
similarly situated, petition any Federal, state or District of Columbia court of
competent  jurisdiction for the appointment of the successor  Relevant  Trustee.
Such court may thereupon,  after prescribing such notice, if any, as it may deem
proper, appoint a successor Relevant Trustee or Trustees.

         (d) The Institutional Trustee shall give notice of each resignation and
each  removal of a Trustee and each  appointment  of a successor  Trustee to all
Holders in the manner  provided in Section  13.1(d) and shall give notice to the
Sponsor.  Each notice shall include the name of the successor  Relevant  Trustee
and  the  address  of its  Corporate  Trust  Office  if it is the  Institutional
Trustee.

         (e)  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing  or any  other  provision  of this
Declaration,  in the event a Delaware Trustee who is a natural person dies or is
adjudged by a court to have become  incompetent  or  incapacitated,  the vacancy
created  by  such  death,  incompetence  or  incapacity  may  be  filled  by the
Institutional  Trustee  following  the  procedures in this Section 4.7 (with the
successor  being a  Person  who  satisfies  the  eligibility  requirement  for a
Delaware  Trustee  set  forth  in this  Declaration)  (the  "SUCCESSOR  DELAWARE
TRUSTEE").

         (f) In  case  of the  appointment  hereunder  of a  successor  Relevant
Trustee,  the retiring Relevant Trustee and each successor Relevant Trustee with
respect to the Securities  shall execute and deliver an amendment hereto wherein
each  successor  Relevant  Trustee shall accept such  appointment  and which (i)
shall contain such provisions as shall be necessary or desirable to transfer and
confirm  to, and to vest in,  each  successor  Relevant  Trustee all the rights,
powers,  trusts and duties of the retiring  Relevant Trustee with respect to the
Securities  and the Trust and (ii) shall add to or change any of the  provisions
of this  Declaration  as shall be  necessary  to provide for or  facilitate  the
administration  of the  Trust  by more  than  one  Relevant  Trustee,  it  being
understood  that  nothing  herein or in such  amendment  shall  constitute  such
Institutional  Trustees  co-trustees and upon the execution and delivery of such
amendment  the  resignation  or removal of the retiring  Relevant  Trustee shall
become effective to the extent provided therein and each such successor Relevant
Trustee,  without any further act, deed or conveyance,  shall become vested with
all the rights, powers, trusts and duties of the retiring Relevant Trustee; but,
on request of the Trust or any successor Relevant Trustee such retiring Relevant
Trustee  shall duly  assign,  transfer  and deliver to such  successor  Relevant
Trustee all Trust Property, all proceeds thereof and money held by such retiring
Relevant Trustee  hereunder with respect to the Securities and the Trust subject
to the payment of all unpaid fees,  expenses and  indemnities  of such  retiring
Relevant Trustee.

                                       26
<PAGE>

         (g) No  Institutional  Trustee or Delaware  Trustee shall be liable for
the acts or omissions to act of any Successor Institutional Trustee or Successor
Delaware Trustee, as the case may be.

         (h) The Holders of the Capital Securities will have no right to vote to
appoint,  remove or replace the  Administrators,  which voting rights are vested
exclusively in the Holder of the Common Securities.

         (i) Any  successor  Delaware  Trustee  shall file an  amendment  to the
Certificate  of Trust  with the  Secretary  of  State of the  State of  Delaware
identifying the name and principal place of business of such Delaware Trustee in
the State of Delaware.

         SECTION 4.8.  VACANCIES  AMONG  TRUSTEES.  If a Trustee  ceases to hold
office for any reason and the number of  Trustees  is not  reduced  pursuant  to
Section 4.1, a vacancy  shall occur.  A resolution  certifying  the existence of
such  vacancy by the  Trustees or, if there are more than two, a majority of the
Trustees,  shall be conclusive  evidence of the  existence of such vacancy.  The
vacancy shall be filled with a Trustee appointed in accordance with Section 4.8.

         SECTION 4.9. EFFECT OF VACANCIES. The death,  resignation,  retirement,
removal,  bankruptcy,  dissolution,  liquidation,  incompetence or incapacity to
perform the duties of a Trustee  shall not  operate to  dissolve,  terminate  or
annul the Trust or terminate this Declaration.  Whenever a vacancy in the number
of Trustees  shall occur,  until such vacancy is filled by the  appointment of a
Trustee in accordance with Section 4.7, the Institutional Trustee shall have all
the powers  granted to the Trustees and shall  discharge all the duties  imposed
upon the Trustees by this Declaration.

         SECTION 4.10. MEETINGS OF THE TRUSTEES AND THE ADMINISTRATORS. Meetings
of the  Administrators  shall  be held  from  time to time  upon  the call of an
Administrator.  Regular meetings of the  Administrators may be held in person in
the United States or by telephone,  at a place (if applicable) and time fixed by
resolution  of the  Administrators.  Notice  of any  in-person  meetings  of the
Trustees with the Administrators or meetings of the Administrators shall be hand
delivered or otherwise delivered in writing (including by facsimile, with a hard
copy by overnight courier) not less than 48 hours before such meeting. Notice of
any telephonic  meetings of the Trustees with the  Administrators or meetings of
the Administrators or any committee thereof shall be hand delivered or otherwise
delivered  in writing  (including  by  facsimile,  with a hard copy by overnight
courier) not less than 24 hours before a meeting.  Notices shall contain a brief
statement  of the time,  place and  anticipated  purposes  of the  meeting.  The
presence  (whether in person or by telephone) of a Trustee or an  Administrator,
as the case may be, at a  meeting  shall  constitute  a waiver of notice of such
meeting  except  where  the  Trustee  or an  Administrator,  as the case may be,
attends a meeting for the express purpose of objecting to the transaction of any
activity  on the  grounds  that the  meeting  has not been  lawfully  called  or
convened.  Unless  provided  otherwise  in this  Declaration,  any action of the
Trustees or the Administrators, as the case may be, may be taken at a meeting by
vote of a majority of the  Trustees or the  Administrators  present  (whether in
person or by  telephone)  and  eligible  to vote with  respect  to such  matter,
provided that a Quorum is present, or without a meeting by the unanimous written
consent of the Trustees or the Administrators.  Meetings of the Trustees and the
Administrators  together  shall be held  from  time to time upon the call of any
Trustee or an Administrator.

         (a) Any  Administrator  may,  by  power  of  attorney  consistent  with
applicable law,  delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 that is
a U.S.  Person  his or her power for the  purpose  of  executing  any  documents
contemplated in Section 2.6; and

         (b) the  Administrators  shall have power to delegate from time to time
to such of their  number  the doing of such  things  and the  execution  of such
instruments  either in the name of the Trust or the names of the  Administrators
or  otherwise  as the  Administrators  may deem  expedient,  to the extent  such
delegation is not  prohibited by applicable law or contrary to the provisions of
the Trust, as set forth herein.

         SECTION 4.12. CONVERSION,  CONSOLIDATION OR SUCCESSION TO BUSINESS. Any
Person  into which the  Institutional  Trustee or the  Delaware  Trustee  may be
merged  or  converted  or  with  which  it may be  consolidated,  or any  Person
resulting   from  any  merger,   conversion  or   consolidation   to  which  the
Institutional  Trustee or the Delaware  Trustee shall be a party,  or any Person
succeeding  to all or  substantially  all the  corporate  trust  business of the
Institutional  Trustee or the  Delaware  Trustee  shall be the  successor of the
Institutional  Trustee or the Delaware Trustee  hereunder,  provided such Person
shall be  otherwise  qualified  and eligible  under this Article and,  provided,
further,  that such Person shall file an amendment to the  Certificate  of Trust
with the Secretary of State of the State of Delaware as  contemplated in Section
4.7(i).

                                   ARTICLE V.

                                  DISTRIBUTIONS

         SECTION 5.1.  DISTRIBUTIONS.  Holders  shall receive  Distributions  in
accordance  with the  applicable  terms  of the  relevant  Holder's  Securities.
Distributions  shall be made on the Capital Securities and the Common Securities
in accordance with the preferences set forth in their  respective  terms. If and
to the extent  that the  Debenture  Issuer  makes a payment of  Interest  or any
principal on the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee, the Institutional
Trustee  shall and is directed  to, to the extent funds are  available  for that
purpose, make a distribution (a "DISTRIBUTION") of such amounts to Holders.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                             ISSUANCE OF SECURITIES

         SECTION 6.1. GENERAL PROVISIONS REGARDING SECURITIES.

         (a) The Administrators  shall, on behalf of the Trust, issue one series
of capital securities,  evidenced by a certificate  substantially in the form of
Exhibit A1,  representing  undivided  beneficial  interests in the assets of the
Trust and having such terms as are set forth in Annex I and one series of common
securities, evidenced by a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2,
representing  undivided  beneficial  interests in the assets of the Trust having
such terms as are set forth in Annex I. The Trust shall issue no  securities  or
other interests in the assets of the Trust other than the Capital Securities and
the Common  Securities.  The Capital  Securities rank PARI PASSU to, and payment
thereon shall be made Pro Rata with, the Common Securities except that, where an
Event of Default has  occurred and is  continuing,  the rights of Holders of the
Common  Securities  to payment in respect of  Distributions  and  payments  upon
liquidation,  redemption and otherwise are subordinated to the rights to payment
of the Holders of the Capital Securities as set forth in Annex I.

         (b) The  Certificates  shall be signed on behalf of the Trust by one or
more  Administrators.  Such signature shall be the facsimile or manual signature
of any  Administrator.  In case any  Administrator  of the Trust who shall  have
signed any of the  Securities  shall cease to be such  Administrator  before the
Certificates  so signed  shall be  delivered  by the  Trust,  such  Certificates
nevertheless may be delivered as though the person who signed such  Certificates
had not ceased to be such  Administrator,  and any  Certificate may be signed on
behalf of the Trust by such persons who, at the actual date of execution of such
Security,  shall be an Administrator  of the Trust,  although at the date of the
execution  and  delivery  of the  Declaration  any such  person  was not such an
Administrator.  A Capital Security shall not be valid until authenticated by the
facsimile or manual  signature  of an  Authorized  Officer of the  Institutional
Trustee.  Such signature shall be conclusive  evidence that the Capital Security
has been authenticated  under this Declaration.  Upon written order of the Trust
signed by one  Administrator,  the Institutional  Trustee shall authenticate the
Capital Securities for original issue. The Institutional  Trustee may appoint an
authenticating  agent  that  is  a  U.S.  Person  acceptable  to  the  Trust  to
authenticate  the  Capital  Securities.   A  Common  Security  need  not  be  so
authenticated and shall be valid upon execution by one or more administrators.

         (c) The  consideration  received  by the Trust for the  issuance of the
Securities shall constitute a contribution to the capital of the Trust and shall
not constitute a loan to the Trust.

         (d) Upon issuance of the  Securities  as provided in this  Declaration,
the Securities so issued shall be deemed to be validly  issued,  fully paid and,
except as provided  in Section  9.1(b)  with  respect to the Common  Securities,
non-assessable.

         (e) Every  Person,  by virtue of having  become a Holder in  accordance
with the terms of this Declaration,  shall be deemed to have expressly  assented
and  agreed to the terms of,  and shall be bound by,  this  Declaration  and the
Guarantee.

                                       29

         SECTION 6.2.  PAYING AGENT,  TRANSFER  AGENT AND  REGISTRAR.  The Trust
shall maintain in Wilmington, Delaware, an office or agency where the Securities
may be presented  for payment  ("PAYING  AGENT"),  and an office or agency where
Securities  may be  presented  for  registration  of transfer  or exchange  (the
"TRANSFER  AGENT").  The Trust  shall keep or cause to be kept at such office or
agency a register  for the  purpose of  registering  Securities,  transfers  and
exchanges  of  Securities,  such  register  to  be  held  by  a  registrar  (the
"REGISTRAR"). The Administrators may appoint the Paying Agent, the Registrar and
the Transfer Agent and may appoint one or more  additional  Paying Agents or one
or more co-Registrars, or one or more co-Transfer Agents in such other locations
as they shall determine.  The term "PAYING AGENT" includes any additional paying
agent,  the term "REGISTRAR"  includes any additional  registrar or co-Registrar
and the term  "TRANSFER  AGENT"  includes any  additional  transfer  agent.  The
Administrators  may change any Paying Agent,  Transfer Agent or Registrar at any
time without  prior notice to any Holder.  The  Administrators  shall notify the
Institutional  Trustee of the name and  address of any  Paying  Agent,  Transfer
Agent and Registrar not a party to this Declaration.  The Administrators  hereby
initially  appoint the  Institutional  Trustee to act as Paying Agent,  Transfer
Agent and Registrar for the Capital  Securities and the Common  Securities.  The
Institutional  Trustee or any of its  Affiliates in the United States may act as
Paying Agent, Transfer Agent or Registrar.

         SECTION  6.3.  FORM  AND  DATING.   The  Capital   Securities  and  the
Institutional   Trustee's   certificate  of  authentication   thereon  shall  be
substantially  in the form of Exhibit  A-1, and the Common  Securities  shall be
substantially  in the form of Exhibit A-2, each of which is hereby  incorporated
in and expressly  made a part of this  Declaration.  Certificates  may be typed,
printed,  lithographed  or engraved or may be produced in any other manner as is
reasonably acceptable to the Administrators,  as conclusively evidenced by their
execution thereof. The Securities may have letters, numbers,  notations or other
marks of identification or designation and such legends or endorsements required
by law, stock exchange rule, agreements to which the Trust is subject if any, or
usage  (provided  that any such  notation,  legend or  endorsement  is in a form
acceptable  to the  Sponsor).  The Trust at the  direction of the Sponsor  shall
furnish  any such  legend  not  contained  in Exhibit  A-1 to the  Institutional
Trustee in writing.  Each Capital  Security shall be dated on or before the date
of its  authentication.  The terms and provisions of the Securities set forth in
Annex I and the forms of  Securities  set forth in Exhibits A-1 and A-2 are part
of the terms of this Declaration and to the extent applicable, the Institutional
Trustee,  the Delaware Trustee,  the  Administrators  and the Sponsor,  by their
execution and delivery of this  Declaration,  expressly  agree to such terms and
provisions and to be bound thereby.  Capital  Securities  will be issued only in
blocks having an aggregate  liquidation  amount of not less than $100,000.00 and
any multiple of $1,000.00 in excess thereof.

         The Capital Securities are being offered and sold by the Trust pursuant
to the Placement  Agreement in definitive,  registered  form without coupons and
with the Restricted Securities Legend.

         SECTION 6.4. MUTILATED, DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN CERTIFICATES.


         If:

                                       30
<PAGE>

         (a) any mutilated  Certificates should be surrendered to the Registrar,
or  if  the  Registrar  shall  receive  evidence  to  its  satisfaction  of  the
destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate; and

         (b) there shall be delivered to the Registrar,  the  Administrators and
the Institutional  Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them
to keep each of them harmless;

then, in the absence of notice that such Certificate shall have been acquired by
a protected  purchaser,  an  Administrator  on behalf of the Trust shall execute
(and in the case of a Capital Security  Certificate,  the Institutional  Trustee
shall  authenticate)  and  deliver,  in  exchange  for or in  lieu  of any  such
mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or stolen  Certificate,  a new  Certificate of like
denomination.  In connection with the issuance of any new Certificate under this
Section 6.4, the  Registrar or the  Administrators  may require the payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection  therewith.  Any  duplicate  Certificate  issued  pursuant to this
Section shall  constitute  conclusive  evidence of an ownership  interest in the
relevant Securities, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or
destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

         SECTION 6.5.  TEMPORARY  SECURITIES.  Until  definitive  Securities are
ready for  delivery,  the  Administrators  may  prepare  and, in the case of the
Capital  Securities,  the Institutional  Trustee shall  authenticate,  temporary
Securities.   Temporary  Securities  shall  be  substantially  in  the  form  of
definitive  Securities but may have variations that the Administrators  consider
appropriate  for  temporary   Securities.   Without   unreasonable   delay,  the
Administrators  shall  prepare and, in the case of the Capital  Securities,  the
Institutional Trustee shall authenticate,  definitive Securities in exchange for
temporary Securities.

         SECTION 6.6.  CANCELLATION.  The Administrators at any time may deliver
Securities to the Institutional  Trustee for  cancellation.  The Registrar shall
forward  to the  Institutional  Trustee  any  Securities  surrendered  to it for
registration of transfer, redemption or payment. The Institutional Trustee shall
promptly  cancel  all  Securities  surrendered  for  registration  of  transfer,
payment,  replacement  or  cancellation  and  shall  dispose  of  such  canceled
Securities as the  Administrators  direct.  The Administrators may not issue new
Securities to replace Securities that have been paid or that have been delivered
to the Institutional Trustee for cancellation.

         SECTION 6.7. RIGHTS OF HOLDERS; WAIVERS OF PAST DEFAULTS.


         (a) The legal title to the Trust Property is vested  exclusively in the
Institutional  Trustee (in its capacity as such) in accordance with Section 2.5,
and the  Holders  shall  not have any  right or  title  therein  other  than the
undivided  beneficial  interest  in the assets of the Trust  conferred  by their
Securities and they shall have no right to call for any partition or division of
property,  profits  or rights  of the  Trust  except  as  described  below.  The
Securities  shall be personal  property giving only the rights  specifically set
forth therein and in this  Declaration.  The Securities shall have no preemptive
or similar rights.

         (b) For so long as any Capital Securities remain  outstanding,  if upon
an Indenture Event of Default, the Debenture Trustee fails or the holders of not
less than 25% in principal amount of the outstanding  Debentures fail to declare
the principal of all of the  Debentures to be immediately  due and payable,  the
Holders of a Majority  in  liquidation  amount of the  Capital  Securities  then
outstanding shall have the right to make such declaration by a notice in writing
to the Institutional Trustee, the Sponsor and the Debenture Trustee.

                                       31
<PAGE>

         At any time after a  declaration  of  acceleration  with respect to the
Debentures  has been made and  before a judgment  or decree  for  payment of the
money  due has  been  obtained  by the  Debenture  Trustee  as  provided  in the
Indenture, if the Institutional Trustee, subject to the provisions hereof, fails
to annul any such declaration and waive such default,  the Holders of a Majority
in  liquidation  amount of the  Capital  Securities,  by  written  notice to the
Institutional  Trustee,  the Sponsor and the Debenture Trustee,  may rescind and
annul such declaration and its consequences if:

                  (i) the  Debenture  Issuer  has  paid or  deposited  with  the
         Debenture Trustee a sum sufficient to pay

                           (A) all  overdue  installments  of interest on all of
                  the Debentures,

                           (B) any  accrued  Additional  Interest  on all of the
                  Debentures,

                           (C) the  principal of (and  premium,  if any, on) any
                  Debentures  that  have  become  due  otherwise  than  by  such
                  declaration  of  acceleration   and  interest  and  Additional
                  Interest thereon at the rate borne by the Debentures, and

                           (D)  all  sums  paid  or  advanced  by the  Debenture
                  Trustee under the Indenture and the  reasonable  compensation,
                  expenses,  disbursements and advances of the Debenture Trustee
                  and the Institutional Trustee, their agents and counsel; and

                  (ii) all Events of  Default  with  respect to the  Debentures,
         other than the  non-payment of the principal of the Debentures that has
         become  due solely by such  acceleration,  have been cured or waived as
         provided in Section 5.7 of the Indenture.

         The Holders of at least a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital
Securities  may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital  Securities,  waive
any past default under the Indenture or any Indenture Event of Default, except a
default or  Indenture  Event of Default in the payment of  principal or interest
(unless  such  default or  Indenture  Event of Default  has been cured and a sum
sufficient  to pay all  matured  installments  of  interest  and  principal  due
otherwise than by acceleration has been deposited with the Debenture Trustee) or
a default under the  Indenture or an Indenture  Event of Default in respect of a
covenant or  provision  that under the  Indenture  cannot be modified or amended
without the consent of the holder of each outstanding Debenture.  No such waiver
shall affect any subsequent default or impair any right consequent thereon.

         Upon receipt by the  Institutional  Trustee of written notice declaring
such an  acceleration,  or rescission and annulment  thereof,  by Holders of any
part  of the  Capital  Securities,  a  record  date  shall  be  established  for
determining  Holders of outstanding  Capital Securities entitled to join in such
notice,  which  record  date  shall be at the close of  business  on the day the
Institutional  Trustee receives such notice. The Holders on such record date, or
their duly designated proxies, and only such Persons,  shall be entitled to join
in such notice,  whether or not such Holders  remain  Holders  after such record
date; PROVIDED, that unless such declaration of acceleration,  or rescission and
annulment,  as the case may be,  shall have  become  effective  by virtue of the
requisite  percentage  having  joined in such notice prior to the day that is 90
days after such record date,  such notice of  declaration  of  acceleration,  or
rescission and annulment,  as the case may be, shall  automatically  and without
further  action by any Holder be canceled and of no further  effect.  Nothing in
this  paragraph  shall  prevent a Holder,  or a proxy of a Holder,  from giving,
after  expiration of such 90-day period,  a new written notice of declaration of
acceleration,  or rescission and annulment thereof,  as the case may be, that is
identical to a written notice that has been canceled  pursuant to the proviso to
the preceding  sentence,  in which event a new record date shall be  established
pursuant to the provisions of this Section 6.7.

                                       32
<PAGE>

         (c) Except as  otherwise  provided  in  paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this
Section  6.7,  the Holders of at least a Majority in  liquidation  amount of the
Capital Securities may, on behalf of the Holders of all the Capital  Securities,
waive any past  default  or Event of  Default  and its  consequences.  Upon such
waiver,  any such  default or Event of  Default  shall  cease to exist,  and any
default  or Event of  Default  arising  therefrom  shall be  deemed to have been
cured, for every purpose of this Declaration, but no such waiver shall extend to
any  subsequent  or other  default  or Event of  Default  or  impair  any  right
consequent thereon.

                      DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION OF TRUST

         SECTION 7.1. DISSOLUTION AND TERMINATION OF TRUST.

         (a) The Trust shall dissolve on the first to occur of:

                  (i) unless  earlier  dissolved,  on  December  15,  2039,  the
         expiration of the term of the Trust;

                  (ii) upon a Bankruptcy Event with respect to the Sponsor,  the
         Trust or the Debenture Issuer;

                  (iii) (other than in connection  with a merger,  consolidation
         or  similar   transaction   not  prohibited  by  the  Indenture,   this
         Declaration or the  Guarantee,  as the case may be) upon (A) the filing
         of a certificate of  dissolution or its equivalent  with respect to the
         Sponsor,  and (B)(I)  upon the  consent  of  Holders  of a Majority  in
         liquidation  amount of the Securities voting together as a single class
         to file a certificate of cancellation with respect to the Trust or (II)
         upon the revocation of the charter of the Sponsor and the expiration of
         90 days after the date of revocation without a reinstatement thereof;

                  (iv) upon the distribution of the Debentures to the Holders of
         the Securities following the exercise of the right of the Holder of all
         of the outstanding  Common Securities to dissolve the Trust as provided
         in Section 3 of Annex I hereto;

                  (v) upon the entry of a decree of judicial  dissolution of the
         Holder  of  the  Common  Securities,  the  Sponsor,  the  Trust  or the
         Debenture Issuer;

                                       33
<PAGE>

                  (vi) when all of the  Securities  shall  have been  called for
         redemption and the amounts necessary for redemption  thereof shall have
         been  paid  to  the  Holders  in  accordance  with  the  terms  of  the
         Securities; or

                  (vii) before the issuance of any Securities,  with the consent
         of all of the Trustees and the Sponsor.

         (b) As soon as is practicable after the occurrence of an event referred
to in Section 7.1(a),  and after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the
Trust as required by applicable  law,  including of the Statutory Trust Act, and
subject  to the  terms  set forth in Annex I, the  Institutional  Trustee  shall
terminate the Trust by filing a certificate of  cancellation  with the Secretary
of State of the State of Delaware.

         (c) The  provisions  of Section  2.9 and  Article IX shall  survive the
termination of the Trust.

                                 ARTICLE VIII.

                              TRANSFER OF INTERESTS

         SECTION 8.1. GENERAL.

         (a) Subject to Section 8.1(c),  where Capital  Securities are presented
to the Registrar or a  co-registrar  with a request to register a transfer or to
exchange them for an equal aggregate  liquidation  amount of Capital  Securities
represented by different certificates, the Registrar shall register the transfer
or make the  exchange  if its  requirements  for such  transactions  are met. To
permit  registrations  of transfer and exchanges,  the Trust shall issue and the
Institutional  Trustee shall authenticate  Capital Securities at the Registrar's
request.

         (b) Upon issuance of the Common  Securities,  the Sponsor shall acquire
and retain  beneficial and record ownership of the Common  Securities and for so
long as the  Securities  remain  outstanding,  the Sponsor  shall  maintain 100%
ownership  of the  Common  Securities;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that any  permitted
successor  of the  Sponsor,  in its  capacity  as  Debenture  Issuer,  under the
Indenture  that is a U.S.  Person may succeed to the Sponsor's  ownership of the
Common Securities.

         (c) Capital Securities may only be transferred, in whole or in part, in
accordance  with the terms and conditions set forth in this  Declaration  and in
the  terms  of the  Capital  Securities.  To the  fullest  extent  permitted  by
applicable  law, any transfer or purported  transfer of any Security not made in
accordance with this Declaration shall be null and void and will be deemed to be
of no legal effect  whatsoever and any such transferee shall be deemed not to be
the Holder of such Capital Securities for any purpose, including but not limited
to the receipt of Distributions on such Capital Securities,  and such transferee
shall be deemed to have no interest whatsoever in such Capital Securities.

         (d) The Registrar shall provide for the  registration of Securities and
of transfers of Securities,  which will be effected without charge but only upon
payment (with such indemnity as the Registrar may require) in respect of any tax
or other  governmental  charges  that may be imposed  in  relation  to it.  Upon
surrender for  registration of transfer of any  Securities,  the Registrar shall
cause one or more new  Securities  of the same tenor to be issued in the name of
the  designated  transferee  or  transferees.   Any  Security  issued  upon  any
registration of transfer or exchange  pursuant to the terms of this  Declaration
shall  evidence  the same  Security  and shall be entitled to the same  benefits
under this  Declaration as the Security  surrendered  upon such  registration of
transfer or exchange.  Every Security  surrendered for  registration of transfer
shall be accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to
the  Registrar  duly  executed  by the  Holder or such  Holder's  attorney  duly
authorized in writing.  Each Security  surrendered for  registration of transfer
shall be  canceled  by the  Institutional  Trustee  pursuant  to Section  6.6. A
transferee  of a Security  shall be  entitled  to the rights and  subject to the
obligations  of a Holder  hereunder  upon the  receipt by such  transferee  of a
Security.  By acceptance of a Security,  each transferee shall be deemed to have
agreed to be bound by this Declaration.

                                       34
<PAGE>


         (e) The Trust shall not be required (i) to issue, register the transfer
of, or  exchange  any  Securities  during a period  beginning  at the opening of
business 15 days before the day of any  selection of Securities  for  redemption
and ending at the close of business on the  earliest  date on which the relevant
notice  of  redemption  is  deemed  to have  been  given to all  Holders  of the
Securities  to be redeemed,  or (ii) to register the transfer or exchange of any
Security so selected for  redemption in whole or in part,  except the unredeemed
portion of any Security being redeemed in part.

         SECTION 8.2. TRANSFER PROCEDURES AND RESTRICTIONS.

         (a) The Capital Securities shall bear the Restricted Securities Legend,
which  shall  not be  removed  unless  there  is  delivered  to the  Trust  such
satisfactory  evidence,  which may include an opinion of counsel satisfactory to
the  Institutional  Trustee,  as may be reasonably  required by the Trust,  that
neither  the legend nor the  restrictions  on  transfer  set forth  therein  are
required to ensure that  transfers  thereof  comply with the  provisions  of the
Securities Act. Upon provision of such satisfactory  evidence, the Institutional
Trustee,  at the written direction of the Trust,  shall authenticate and deliver
Capital Securities that do not bear the legend.

         (b) Except as permitted by Section 8.2(a),  each Capital Security shall
bear  a  legend  (the  "RESTRICTED  SECURITIES  LEGEND")  in  substantially  the
following  form and a  Capital  Security  shall  not be  transferred  except  in
compliance with such legend,  unless otherwise  determined by the Sponsor,  upon
the advice of counsel expert in securities  law, in accordance  with  applicable
law:

                  THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT
         OF 1933, AS AMENDED (THE  "SECURITIES  ACT"), ANY STATE SECURITIES LAWS
         OR ANY OTHER  APPLICABLE  SECURITIES LAW. NEITHER THIS SECURITY NOR ANY
         INTEREST OR  PARTICIPATION  HEREIN MAY BE  REOFFERED,  SOLD,  ASSIGNED,
         TRANSFERRED,  PLEDGED,  ENCUMBERED  OR  OTHERWISE  DISPOSED  OF IN  THE
         ABSENCE OF SUCH REGISTRATION OR UNLESS SUCH TRANSACTION IS EXEMPT FROM,
         OR NOT SUBJECT TO, THE REGISTRATION  REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT
         AND ANY APPLICABLE  STATE  SECURITIES LAWS. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY

                           LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF
             HOLDERS OF SECURITIES, INSTITUTIONAL TRUSTEE OR OTHERS

         SECTION 9.1. LIABILITY.

         (a) Except as expressly  set forth in this  Declaration,  the Guarantee
and the terms of the Securities, the Sponsor shall not be:

                  (i)  personally  liable for the  return of any  portion of the
         capital  contributions  (or any return  thereon)  of the Holders of the
         Securities which shall be made solely from assets of the Trust; or

                  (ii)  required  to pay to the  Trust or to any  Holder  of the
         Securities any deficit upon dissolution of the Trust or otherwise.

         (b) The Holder of the Common  Securities shall be liable for all of the
debts and  obligations of the Trust (other than with respect to the  Securities)
to the extent not satisfied out of the Trust's assets.

         (c)  Pursuant to the  Statutory  Trust Act,  the Holders of the Capital

         SECTION 9.2. EXCULPATION.

         (a) No Indemnified  Person shall be liable,  responsible or accountable
in damages or otherwise to the Trust or any Covered Person for any loss,  damage

Indemnified  Person reasonably  believed to be within the scope of the authority
conferred on such Indemnified  Person by this Declaration or by law, except that

incurred by reason of such Indemnified Person's negligence or willful misconduct
with respect to such acts or omissions.

         (b) An Indemnified  Person shall be fully  protected in relying in good
faith upon the records of the Trust and upon such information, opinions, reports
or statements presented to the Trust by any Person as to matters the Indemnified
Person reasonably believes are within such other Person's professional or expert
competence  and, if selected by such  Indemnified  Person,  has been selected by
such  Indemnified  Person  with  reasonable  care by or on behalf of the  Trust,
including  information,  opinions,  reports  or  statements  as to the value and
amount of the assets, liabilities, profits, losses, or any other facts pertinent

         SECTION 9.3. FIDUCIARY DUTY.

         (a) To the extent that, at law or in equity, an Indemnified  Person has
duties  (including  fiduciary  duties) and liabilities  relating  thereto to the
Trust or to any other Covered  Person,  an Indemnified  Person acting under this
Declaration  shall not be liable to the Trust or to any other Covered Person for
its good faith reliance on the provisions of this Declaration. The provisions of
this Declaration, to the extent that they restrict the duties and liabilities of
an Indemnified  Person otherwise existing at law or in equity, are agreed by the
parties hereto to replace such other duties and  liabilities of the  Indemnified
Person.

         (b) Whenever in this Declaration an Indemnified  Person is permitted or
required to make a decision:

                  (i) in its "discretion" or under a grant of similar authority,
         the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to consider such interests and
         factors as it desires,  including its own interests,  and shall have no
         duty or  obligation  to give any  consideration  to any  interest of or
         factors affecting the Trust or any other Person; or

                  (ii) in its "good faith" or under  another  express  standard,
         the Indemnified  Person shall act under such express standard and shall
         not be  subject  to any other or  different  standard  imposed  by this
         Declaration or by applicable law.

         SECTION 9.4. INDEMNIFICATION.

         (a) The Sponsor shall  indemnify,  to the full extent permitted by law,
any Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any  threatened,  pending or completed  action,  suit or proceeding,  whether
civil, criminal,  administrative or investigative (other than an action by or in
the right of the Trust)  arising out of or in connection  with the acceptance or
administration  of this  Declaration  by reason of the fact that he is or was an
Indemnified Person against expenses  (including  reasonable  attorneys' fees and
expenses),  judgments,  fines  and  amounts  paid  in  settlement  actually  and
reasonably incurred by him in connection with such action, suit or proceeding if
he acted in good faith and in a manner he  reasonably  believed  to be in or not
opposed to the best  interests of the Trust,  and,  with respect to any criminal
action or  proceeding,  had no  reasonable  cause to  believe  his  conduct  was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,  order,
settlement,  conviction,  or upon a plea of NOLO  CONTENDERE or its  equivalent,
shall not, of itself,  create a presumption that the Indemnified  Person did not
act in good faith and in a manner which he  reasonably  believed to be in or not
opposed to the best  interests of the Trust,  and,  with respect to any criminal
action or  proceeding,  had  reasonable  cause to believe  that his  conduct was
unlawful.

         (b) The Sponsor shall  indemnify,  to the full extent permitted by law,
any Indemnified Person who was or is a party or is threatened to be made a party
to any threatened, pending or completed action or suit by or in the right of the
Trust to procure a judgment in its favor  arising out of or in  connection  with
the acceptance or  administration of this Declaration by reason of the fact that
he is or  was an  Indemnified  Person  against  expenses  (including  reasonable
attorneys'  fees  and  expenses)  actually  and  reasonably  incurred  by him in
connection  with the defense or settlement of such action or suit if he acted in
good faith and in a manner he reasonably believed to be in or not opposed to the
best interests of the Trust;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no such  indemnification
shall be made in  respect  of any  claim,  issue  or  matter  as to  which  such
Indemnified Person shall have been adjudged to be liable to the Trust unless and
only to the extent that the court in which such action or suit was brought shall
determine upon  application  that,  despite the adjudication of liability but in
view of all the  circumstances of the case, such person is fairly and reasonably
entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court shall deem proper.

         (c) To the extent that an Indemnified Person shall be successful on the
merits or otherwise  (including  dismissal of an action without prejudice or the
settlement  of an action  without  admission  of  liability)  in  defense of any
action, suit or proceeding referred to in paragraphs (a) and (b) of this Section
9.4,  or in  defense  of any  claim,  issue  or  matter  therein,  he  shall  be
indemnified,  to the full extent permitted by law,  against expenses  (including
attorneys'  fees  and  expenses)  actually  and  reasonably  incurred  by him in
connection therewith.

                                       39
<PAGE>

         (d) Any  indemnification  of an Administrator  under paragraphs (a) and
(b) of this Section 9.4 (unless ordered by a court) shall be made by the Sponsor
only  as   authorized   in  the  specific   case  upon  a   determination   that
indemnification of the Indemnified Person is proper in the circumstances because
he has met the  applicable  standard of conduct set forth in paragraphs  (a) and
(b). Such  determination  shall be made (i) by the  Administrators by a majority
vote of a Quorum consisting of such  Administrators who were not parties to such
action, suit or proceeding, (ii) if such a Quorum is not obtainable, or, even if
obtainable,  if  a  Quorum  of  disinterested   Administrators  so  directs,  by
independent legal counsel in a written opinion,  or (iii) by the Common Security
Holder of the Trust.

         (e) To  the  fullest  extent  permitted  by  law,  expenses  (including
reasonable  attorneys' fees and expenses)  incurred by an Indemnified  Person in
defending a civil,  criminal,  administrative or investigative  action,  suit or
proceeding  referred to in  paragraphs  (a) and (b) of this Section 9.4 shall be
paid by the Sponsor in advance of the final disposition of such action,  suit or
proceeding  upon receipt of an undertaking  by or on behalf of such  Indemnified
Person to repay such amount if it shall  ultimately be determined that he is not
entitled to be  indemnified  by the Sponsor as  authorized  in this Section 9.4.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  no advance  shall be made by the  Sponsor if a
determination  is reasonably  and promptly made (i) by the  Administrators  by a
majority vote of a Quorum of disinterested Administrators, (ii) if such a Quorum
is not  obtainable,  or,  even  if  obtainable,  if a  quorum  of  disinterested
Administrators so directs, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or
(iii) by the Common  Security  Holder of the Trust,  that,  based upon the facts
known to the  Administrators,  counsel or the Common Security Holder at the time
such  determination is made, such Indemnified  Person acted in bad faith or in a
manner that such Indemnified  Person did not believe to be in the best interests
of the Trust, or, with respect to any criminal proceeding, that such Indemnified
Person believed or had reasonable cause to believe his conduct was unlawful.  In
no event  shall any  advance  be made in  instances  where  the  Administrators,
independent  legal counsel or the Common  Security Holder  reasonably  determine
that such Indemnified Person deliberately  breached his duty to the Trust or its
Common or Capital Security Holders.


                                       40
<PAGE>

         (f) The Trustees, at the sole cost and expense of the Sponsor,  retains
the right to representation  by counsel of its own choosing in any action,  suit
or any other proceeding for which it is indemnified under paragraphs (a) and (b)
of this Section 9.4, without affecting its right to indemnification hereunder or
waiving any rights afforded to it under this Declaration or applicable law.

         (g) The  indemnification  and  advancement of expenses  provided by, or
granted  pursuant  to, the other  paragraphs  of this  Section  9.4 shall not be
deemed exclusive of any other rights to which those seeking  indemnification and
advancement  of  expenses  may  be  entitled   under  any  agreement,   vote  of
stockholders  or  disinterested  directors  of the  Sponsor or Capital  Security
Holders of the Trust or  otherwise,  both as to action in his official  capacity
and as to action in another  capacity  while holding such office.  All rights to
indemnification  under  this  Section  9.4 shall be deemed to be  provided  by a
contract  between  the Sponsor  and each  Indemnified  Person who serves in such
capacity  at any time  while  this  Section  9.4 is in  effect.  Any  repeal  or
modification of this Section 9.4 shall not affect any rights or obligations then
existing.

         (h) The Sponsor or the Trust may  purchase  and  maintain  insurance on
behalf of any Person who is or was an  Indemnified  Person against any liability
asserted against him and incurred by him in any such capacity, or arising out of
his status as such, whether or not the Sponsor would have the power to indemnify
him against such liability under the provisions of this Section 9.4.

         (i) For purposes of this Section 9.4,  references  to "the Trust" shall
include,  in addition to the  resulting or  surviving  entity,  any  constituent
entity (including any constituent of a constituent)  absorbed in a consolidation
or  merger,  so that any Person who is or was a  director,  trustee,  officer or
employee of such constituent entity, or is or was serving at the request of such
constituent entity as a director, trustee, officer, employee or agent of another
entity,  shall stand in the same position  under the  provisions of this Section
9.4 with  respect to the  resulting  or  surviving  entity as he would have with
respect to such constituent entity if its separate existence had continued.

         (j) The  indemnification  and  advancement of expenses  provided by, or
granted  pursuant to, this Section 9.4 shall,  unless  otherwise  provided  when
authorized  or  ratified,  (i)  continue  as to a Person who has ceased to be an
Indemnified  Person and shall inure to the benefit of the heirs,  executors  and
administrators of such a Person,  and (ii) survive the termination or expiration
of this  Declaration  or the earlier  removal or  resignation  of an Indemnified
Person.

         SECTION 9.5. OUTSIDE BUSINESSES.  Any Covered Person, the Sponsor,  the
Delaware  Trustee  and the  Institutional  Trustee  may  engage in or possess an
interest in other business ventures of any nature or description,  independently
or with others,  similar or  dissimilar  to the  business of the Trust,  and the
Trust  and the  Holders  of  Securities  shall  have no rights by virtue of this
Declaration in and to such independent ventures or the income or profits derived
therefrom,  and the pursuit of any such venture,  even if  competitive  with the
business of the Trust,  shall not be deemed  wrongful or  improper.  None of any
Covered Person,  the Sponsor,  the Delware Trustee or the Institutional  Trustee
shall be obligated to present any particular  investment or other opportunity to
the Trust even if such  opportunity is of a character  that, if presented to the
Trust,  could be taken by the Trust,  and any Covered Person,  the Sponsor,  the
Delaware Trustee and the Institutional  Trustee shall have the right to take for
its own account  (individually  or as a partner or fiduciary) or to recommend to
others any such particular investment or other opportunity.  Any Covered Person,
the Delaware Trustee and the  Institutional  Trustee may engage or be interested
in any financial or other  transaction  with the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the
Sponsor,  or may act as  depositary  for,  trustee or agent  for,  or act on any
committee or body of holders of,  securities or other obligations of the Sponsor
or its Affiliates.

         SECTION 9.6. COMPENSATION; FEE. The Sponsor agrees:

         (a) to pay to the Trustees from time to time such  compensation for all
services rendered by them hereunder as the parties shall agree from time to time
(which  compensation  shall not be limited by any  provision of law in regard to
the compensation of a trustee of an express trust); and

         (b) except as otherwise  expressly  provided  herein,  to reimburse the
Trustees  Trustee upon request for all reasonable  expenses,  disbursements  and
advances  incurred or made by the Trustees in  accordance  with any provision of
this  Declaration  (including the reasonable  compensation  and the expenses and
disbursements of their respective agents and counsel),  except any such expense,
disbursement or advance as may be  attributable to its negligence,  bad faith or
willful misconduct.

         The provisions of this Section 9.6 shall survive the dissolution of the
Trust and the termination of this  Declaration and the removal or resignation of
any Trustee.

         No Trustee may claim any lien or charge on any property of the Trust as
a result of any amount due pursuant to this Section 9.6.

Trust.

         (c) The  Administrators,  at the Sponsor's  expense,  shall cause to be

with respect to the Holder to applicable  jurisdictions.  To the extent that the
Institutional  Trustee or any Paying  Agent is required to withhold and pay over
any amounts to any authority with respect to distributions or allocations to any
Holder,  the amount  withheld shall be deemed to be a Distribution in the amount
of the withholding to the Holder.  In the event of any claimed  overwithholding,
Holders shall be limited to an action  against the applicable  jurisdiction.  If
the amount  required to be withheld was not withheld  from actual  Distributions
made,  the  Institutional  Trustee  or any Paying  Agent may  reduce  subsequent
Distributions by the amount of such withholding.

         SECTION  10.5.  INTENTION  OF THE PARTIES.  It is the  intention of the
parties hereto that the Trust be classified for United States federal income tax
purposes  as a  grantor  trust.  The  provisions  of this  Declaration  shall be
interpreted to further this intention of the parties.

         SECTION 11.1. AMENDMENTS.


         (a)  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  this  Declaration  or by  any
applicable  terms of the Securities,  this  Declaration may only be amended by a
written instrument  approved and executed by the Institutional  Trustee, or (ii)
if the amendment affects the rights, powers,  duties,  obligations or immunities
of the Delaware Trustee, by the Delaware Trustee.

         (b)  Notwithstanding  any  other  provision  of  this  Article  XI,  an
amendment  may be made,  and any such  purported  amendment  shall be valid  and
effective only if:

                  (i) the Institutional Trustee shall have first received;

                           (A) an Officers'  Certificate  from each of the Trust
                  and the  Sponsor  that such  amendment  is  permitted  by, and
                  conforms  to,  the terms of this  Declaration  (including  the
                  terms of the Securities); and

                           (B) an opinion of counsel  (who may be counsel to the

                  terms of the Securities);  and all conditions precedent to the
                  execution and delivery of such amendment have been  satisfied;
                  and

                  (ii) the result of such amendment would not be to

                           (A)  cause the  Trust to cease to be  classified  for
                  purposes of United States federal income taxation as a grantor
                  trust; or

                           (B) cause the Trust to be deemed to be an  Investment
                  Company required to be registered under the Investment Company
                  Act.

         (c) Except as provided  in Section  11.1(d),  (e) or (h), no  amendment
shall be made, and any such purported  amendment  shall be void and  ineffective
unless the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities
shall have consented to such amendment.

         (d) In  addition to and  notwithstanding  any other  provision  in this
Declaration,  without the consent of each affected Holder,  this Declaration may
not be amended to (i)  change  the amount or timing of any  Distribution  on the
Securities  or  any  redemption  or  liquidation  provisions  applicable  to the
Securities or otherwise adversely affect the amount of any Distribution required
to be made in respect of the Securities as of a specified date, or (ii) restrict
the right of a Holder to institute suit for the  enforcement of any such payment
on or after such date.

amended without the consent of all of the Holders of the Securities.

         (f) Article III shall not be amended without the consent of the Holders
of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities.

         (g) The  rights of the  Holders  of the  Capital  Securities  or Common
Securities, as applicable, under Article IV to appoint and remove Trustees shall

amount of the Capital Securities or Common Securities, as applicable.

         (h) This  Declaration may be amended by the  Institutional  Trustee and
the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount of the Common Securities without

                  (i) cure any ambiguity;

                  (ii) correct or supplement  any provision in this  Declaration
         that may be defective or inconsistent  with any other provision of this
         Declaration;

                  (iii) add to the covenants, restrictions or obligations of the
         Sponsor; or

                  (iv)  modify,  eliminate  or  add  to any  provision  of  this
         Declaration to such extent as may be necessary to ensure that the Trust
         will be classified for United States federal income tax purposes at all
         times as a grantor  trust and will not be  required  to  register as an
         "investment  company"  under  the  Investment  Company  Act  (including
         without  limitation to conform to any change in Rule 3a-5, Rule 3a-7 or
         any other  applicable rule under the Investment  Company Act or written
         change in  interpretation  or  application  thereof by any  legislative
         body, court, government agency or regulatory authority) which amendment
         does not have a material  adverse effect on the rights,  preferences or
         privileges of the Holders of Securities;

                  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that no such modification,  elimination or
         addition  referred  to in  clauses  (i),  (ii),  (iii)  or  (iv)  shall
         adversely  affect in any material  respect the powers,  preferences  or
         special rights of Holders of Capital Securities.

         SECTION 11.2. MEETINGS OF THE HOLDERS OF SECURITIES;  ACTION BY WRITTEN
CONSENT.

         (a)  Meetings of the Holders of the  Capital  Securities  or the Common
Securities  may be called at any time by the  Administrators  (or as provided in
the terms of the  Securities) to consider and act on any matter on which Holders
of such  Securities  are entitled to act under the terms of this  Declaration or
the terms of the  Securities.  The  Administrators  shall  call a meeting of the
Holders of such  class if  directed  to do so by the  Holders of at least 10% in
liquidation  amount  of such  Securities.  Such  direction  shall  be  given  by
delivering to the  Administrators  one or more notices in a writing stating that
the signing Holders of such Securities wish to call a meeting and indicating the
general or specific  purpose for which the meeting is to be called.  Any Holders
of the  Securities  calling a meeting shall specify in writing the  Certificates
held by the Holders of the Securities exercising the right to call a meeting and
only those  Securities  represented  by such  Certificates  shall be counted for
purposes of determining  whether the required percentage set forth in the second
sentence of this paragraph has been met.

         (b)  Except  to the  extent  otherwise  provided  in the  terms  of the
Securities,  the following  provisions shall apply to meetings of Holders of the
Securities:

                  (i)  notice  of any  such  meeting  shall  be given to all the
         Holders  of the  Securities  having a right to vote  thereat at least 7
         days  and not  more  than  60 days  before  the  date of such  meeting.
         Whenever a vote,  consent or approval of the Holders of the  Securities
         is permitted or required under this Declaration,  such vote, consent or
         approval  may be given at a meeting of the  Holders of the  Securities.
         Any  action  that may be  taken  at a  meeting  of the  Holders  of the
         Securities  may be taken  without a meeting  if a  consent  in  writing
         setting  forth the  action so taken is  signed  by the  Holders  of the
         Securities  owning  not less  than the  minimum  liquidation  amount of
         Securities  that would be necessary to authorize or take such action at
         a meeting at which all Holders of the Securities having a right to vote
         thereon were present and voting.  Prompt notice of the taking of action
         without  a  meeting  shall be given to the  Holders  of the  Securities
         entitled to vote who have not consented in writing.  The Administrators
         may specify  that any written  ballot  submitted  to the Holders of the
         Securities for the purpose of taking any action without a meeting shall
         be  returned   to  the  Trust   within  the  time   specified   by  the
         Administrators;

                  (ii) each Holder of a Security may authorize any Person to act
         for it by proxy on all  matters  in which a  Holder  of  Securities  is
         entitled to participate,  including  waiving notice of any meeting,  or
         voting or participating at a meeting. No proxy shall be valid after the
         expiration of 11 months from the date thereof unless otherwise provided
         in the proxy.  Every proxy shall be  revocable  at the  pleasure of the
         Holder of the  Securities  executing it.  Except as otherwise  provided
         herein,  all  matters  relating  to the  giving,  voting or validity of
         proxies shall be governed by the General  Corporation  Law of the State
         of  Delaware   relating  to  proxies,   and  judicial   interpretations
         thereunder, as if the Trust were a Delaware corporation and the Holders
         of the Securities  were  stockholders of a Delaware  corporation;  each
         meeting of the  Holders of the  Securities  shall be  conducted  by the
         Administrators  or by such other  Person  that the  Administrators  may
         designate; and

                  (iii) unless the Statutory Trust Act, this Declaration, or the
         terms of the Securities  otherwise  provides,  the  Administrators,  in
         their sole discretion, shall establish all other provisions relating to
         meetings of Holders of Securities,  including notice of the time, place
         or purpose of any  meeting at which any matter is to be voted on by any
         Holders of the Securities, waiver of any such notice, action by consent
         without  a  meeting,   the  establishment  of  a  record  date,  quorum
         requirements,  voting in person  or by proxy or any other  matter  with
         respect to the exercise of any such right to vote;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
         that each meeting shall be conducted in the United States (as that term
         is defined in Treasury Regulations section 301.7701-7).

                                     ANNEX I

                               TERMS OF SECURITIES

                  Pursuant  to  Section   6.1  of  the   Amended  and   Restated
Declaration  of Trust,  dated as of December  15, 2004 (as amended  from time to
time, the "DECLARATION"),  the designation,  rights,  privileges,  restrictions,
preferences  and other terms and  provisions of the Capital  Securities  and the
Common  Securities are set out below (each capitalized term used but not defined
herein has the meaning set forth in the Declaration):

         1. DESIGNATION AND NUMBER.

                  (a) 13,000  Fixed/Floating  Rate Capital  Securities  of Tower
Group Statutory Trust III (the "Trust"),  with an aggregate  stated  liquidation
amount  with  respect to the  assets of the Trust of  thirteen  million  dollars
($13,000,000) and a stated  liquidation amount with respect to the assets of the
Trust of $1,000.00 per Capital Security,  are hereby designated for the purposes
of  identification  only  as the  "CAPITAL  SECURITIES".  The  Capital  Security
Certificates  evidencing the Capital  Securities  shall be  substantially in the
form of Exhibit A-1 to the Declaration,  with such changes and additions thereto
or deletions therefrom as may be required by ordinary usage, custom or practice.

                  (b) 403  Fixed/Floating  Rate Common  Securities  of the Trust
(the "COMMON  SECURITIES")  will be evidenced  by Common  Security  Certificates
substantially in the form of Exhibit A-2 to the  Declaration,  with such changes
and  additions  thereto or  deletions  therefrom  as may be required by ordinary
usage, custom or practice.

         2. DISTRIBUTIONS.

                  (a)  Distributions  will be payable on each  Security  for the
period beginning on (and including) the date of original  issuance and ending on
(but  excluding)  the  Distribution  Payment Date in December 2009 at a rate per
annum of 7.40% and shall bear interest for each successive  Distribution  Period
beginning on (and including) the Distribution Payment Date in December 2009, and
each  succeeding  Distribution  Payment Date, and ending on (but  excluding) the
next succeeding  Distribution Payment Date (each, a "DISTRIBUTION  PERIOD") at a
rate per annum equal to the 3-Month LIBOR,  determined as described below,  plus
3.40% (the "COUPON  RATE"),  applied to the stated  liquidation  amount thereof,
such rate being the rate of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the
Institutional  Trustee.  Distributions  in arrears  for more than one  quarterly
period  will  bear  interest  thereon  compounded  quarterly  at the  applicable
Distribution  Rate (to the  extent  permitted  by law).  Distributions,  as used
herein,  include cash distributions,  any such compounded  distributions and any
Additional Sums payable on the Debentures unless otherwise noted. A Distribution
is  payable  only  to the  extent  that  payments  are  made in  respect  of the
Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the extent the Institutional
Trustee has funds available therefor. The amount of the Distribution payable (i)
for any Distribution Period commencing on or after the date of original issuance
but before the  Distribution  Payment Date in December  2009 will be computed on
the  basis  of a  360-day  year  of  twelve  30-day  months,  and  (ii)  for the
Distribution  Period  commencing  on or after the  Distribution  Payment Date in
December  2009 and each  succeeding  Distribution  Period will be  calculated by
applying the Distribution Rate to the stated  liquidation  amount outstanding at
the commencement of the Distribution  Period and multiplying each such amount by
the actual number of days in the Distribution  Period concerned  divided by 360.
All percentages  resulting from any calculations on the Capital  Securities will
be rounded, if necessary,  to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point,  with five  one-millionths  of a percentage  point rounded  upward (e.g.,
9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655), and all dollar
amounts  used in or  resulting  from such  calculation  will be  rounded  to the
nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

                  "3-MONTH LIBOR" means the London  interbank  offered  interest
rate for three-month,  U.S. dollar deposits  determined by the Debenture Trustee
in the following order of priority:

                  (1) the rate  (expressed  as a percentage  per annum) for U.S.
         dollar deposits having a three-month  maturity that appears on Telerate
         Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m.  (London time) on the related  Determination
         Date (as  defined  below).  "Telerate  Page  3750"  means  the  display
         designated  as "Page  3750" on the Dow Jones  Telerate  Service or such
         other  page as may  replace  Page 3750 on that  service  or such  other
         service  or  services  as may be  nominated  by  the  British  Bankers'
         Association  as the  information  vendor for the purpose of  displaying
         London interbank offered rates for U.S. dollar deposits;

                  (2)  if  such  rate  cannot  be   identified  on  the  related
         Determination  Date,  the Debenture  Trustee will request the principal
         London offices of four leading banks in the London  interbank market to
         provide such banks' offered  quotations  (expressed as percentages  per
         annum) to prime banks in the London  interbank  market for U.S.  dollar
         deposits having a three-month  maturity as of 11:00 a.m.  (London time)
         on such  Determination  Date. If at least two  quotations are provided,
         3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations;

                  (3)  if  fewer  than  two  such  quotations  are  provided  as
         requested in clause (2) above, the Debenture  Trustee will request four
         major New York City banks to provide  such  banks'  offered  quotations
         (expressed  as  percentages  per annum) to leading  European  banks for
         loans  in  U.S.  dollars  as  of  11:00  a.m.  (London  time)  on  such
         Determination  Date.  If at least  two such  quotations  are  provided,
         3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations; and

                  (4)  if  fewer  than  two  such  quotations  are  provided  as
         requested in clause (3) above,  3-Month  LIBOR will be a 3-Month  LIBOR
         determined  with  respect  to  the  Distribution   Period   immediately
         preceding such current Distribution Period.

                  If the rate  for U.S.  dollar  deposits  having a  three-month
maturity that initially  appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m.  (London
time) on the related  Determination Date is superseded on the Telerate Page 3750
by a corrected rate by 12:00 noon (London time) on such Determination Date, then
the  corrected  rate  as so  substituted  on the  applicable  page  will  be the
applicable 3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date.

                  The Interest Rate for any Distribution  Period will at no time
be higher than the maximum  rate then  permitted by New York law as the same may
be modified by United States law.


                                       I-2
<PAGE>

                  "DETERMINATION DATE" means the date that is two London Banking
Days (i.e.,  a business  day in which  dealings in deposits in U.S.  dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market) preceding the particular Distribution
Period for which a Coupon Rate is being determined.

                  "INTEREST  RATE"  means  for  the  period  beginning  on  (and
including)  the date of  original  issuance  and ending on (but  excluding)  the
Distribution  Payment Date in December  2009 the rate per annum of 7.40% and for
each Distribution Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

                  "MATURITY DATE" means December 15, 2034.

                           (b)   Distributions   on  the   Securities   will  be
cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance, and will be payable,
subject to  extension  of  distribution  payment  periods as  described  herein,
quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15,  September 15 and December 15 of each
year or if such day is not a Business Day, then the next succeeding Business Day
(each a "DISTRIBUTION  PAYMENT DATE"),  commencing on the  Distribution  Payment
Date in March 2005 when, as and if available for payment.  The Debenture  Issuer
has the  right  under  the  Indenture  to  defer  payments  of  interest  on the
Debentures,  so long as no  Indenture  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  by deferring the payment of interest on the Debentures for up to 20
consecutive  quarterly periods (each an "EXTENSION PERIOD") at any time and from
time to time, subject to the conditions  described below, during which Extension
Period no  interest  shall be due and  payable.  During  any  Extension  Period,
interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such accrued
interest will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Distribution  Rate in effect
for each  such  Extension  Period,  compounded  quarterly  (from  the date  such
interest  would have been payable were it not for the Extension  Period,  to the
extent  permitted  by law (such  interest  referred  to  herein  as  "ADDITIONAL
INTEREST")  during any Extension  Period.  No Extension Period may end on a date
other than a Distribution  Payment Date. At the end of any such Extension Period
the  Debenture  Issuer  shall pay all  interest  then  accrued and unpaid on the
Debentures (together with Additional Interest thereon);  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that
no Extension  Period may extend beyond the Maturity  Date and PROVIDED  FURTHER,
HOWEVER,  that during any such Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer shall not,
and shall not permit any  Affiliate of the  Debenture  Issuer  controlled by the
Debenture  Issuer to, (i) declare or pay any dividends or  distributions  on, or
redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of
the Debenture Issuer's or its Affiliates'  capital stock (other than payments of
dividends  or  distributions  to the  Debenture  Issuer or a  Subsidiary  of the
Debenture Issuer) or make any guarantee  payments with respect to the foregoing,
or (ii) make any payment of principal  of or interest or premium,  if any, on or
repay,  repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Debenture  Issuer or any
Affiliate of the Debenture  Issuer  controlled by the Debenture Issuer that rank
PARI PASSU in all respects with or junior in interest to the  Debentures  (other
than, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, (a)  repurchases,  redemptions
or other  acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Debenture Issuer or any
Subsidiary of the Debenture  Issuer in connection with any employment  contract,
benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the benefit of one or more
employees,  officers,  directors or  consultants,  in connection with a dividend
reinvestment  or  stockholder  stock  purchase  plan or in  connection  with the
issuance of capital  stock of the  Debenture  Issuer or of such  Subsidiary  (or
securities   convertible   into  or  exercisable  for  such  capital  stock)  as
consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable
Extension Period,  (b) as a result of any exchange or conversion of any class or
series  of the  Debenture  Issuer's  capital  stock (or any  capital  stock of a
Subsidiary  of the  Debenture  Issuer) for any class or series of the  Debenture



                                       I-3
<PAGE>


Issuer's capital stock (or in the case of a Subsidiary of the Debenture  Issuer,
any  class or  series  of such  Subsidiary's  capital  stock) or of any class or
series of the  Debenture  Issuer's  indebtedness  for any class or series of the
Debenture Issuer's capital stock (or in the case of indebtedness of a Subsidiary
of  the  Debenture   Issuer,  of  any  class  or  series  of  such  Subsidiary's
indebtedness for any class or series of such  Subsidiary's  capital stock),  (c)
the purchase of fractional interests in shares of the Debenture Issuer's capital
stock (or the capital  stock of a  Subsidiary  of the  Company)  pursuant to the
conversion or exchange  provisions  of such capital stock or the security  being
converted or exchanged, (d) any declaration of a dividend in connection with any
stockholders'  rights plan, or the issuance of rights,  stock or other  property
under any  stockholders'  rights plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights
pursuant thereto,  (e) any dividend in the form of stock,  warrants,  options or
other rights where the dividend  stock or the stock  issuable  upon  exercise of
such  warrants,  options or other  rights is the same stock as that on which the
dividend  is being paid or ranks PARI PASSU with or junior to such stock and any
cash payments in lieu of fractional  shares issued in connection  therewith,  or
(f) payments under the Capital Securities  Guarantee).  Prior to the termination
of any Extension  Period,  the Debenture  Issuer may further extend such period,
provided  that  such  period   together  with  all  such  previous  and  further
consecutive  extensions  thereof  shall  not  exceed  20  consecutive  quarterly
periods,  or extend  beyond  the  Maturity  Date.  Upon the  termination  of any
Extension  Period and upon the payment of all accrued  and unpaid  interest  and
Additional  Interest,  the Debenture Issuer may commence a new Extension Period,
subject to the foregoing requirements.  No interest or Additional Interest shall
be due and payable during an Extension  Period,  except at the end thereof,  but
each  installment  of interest  that would  otherwise  have been due and payable
during  such  Extension  Period  shall  bear  Additional  Interest.  During  any
Extension Period, Distributions on the Securities shall be deferred for a period
equal to the Extension Period. If Distributions are deferred,  the Distributions
due shall be paid on the date that the related Extension Period  terminates,  to
Holders of the  Securities  as they appear on the books and records of the Trust
on the  record  date  immediately  preceding  such  date.  Distributions  on the
Securities  must  be paid on the  dates  payable  (after  giving  effect  to any
Extension  Period)  to the  extent  that the Trust has funds  available  for the
payment of such  distributions in the Property Account of the Trust. The Trust's
funds  available  for  Distribution  to the  Holders of the  Securities  will be
limited  to  payments  received  from  the  Debenture  Issuer.  The  payment  of
Distributions  out of moneys held by the Trust is  guaranteed  by the  Guarantor
pursuant to the Guarantee.

                           (c)  Distributions  on the Securities will be payable
to the  Holders  thereof as they appear on the books and records of the Trust on
the relevant record dates. The relevant record dates shall be 15 days before the
relevant Distribution Payment Date. Distributions payable on any Securities that
are not  punctually  paid on any  Distribution  Payment Date, as a result of the
Debenture  Issuer having failed to make a payment under the  Debentures,  as the
case may be, when due (taking into account any Extension Period),  will cease to
be payable to the Person in whose name such  Securities  are  registered  on the
relevant record date, and such defaulted Distribution will instead be payable to
the Person in whose name such  Securities  are  registered on the special record
date or other specified date determined in accordance with the Indenture.

                           (d) In the  event  that  there is any  money or other
property  held by or for the Trust that is not  accounted  for  hereunder,  such
property shall be distributed  Pro Rata (as defined herein) among the Holders of
the Securities.

         3.  LIQUIDATION  DISTRIBUTION  UPON  DISSOLUTION.  In the  event of the
voluntary or involuntary liquidation,  dissolution, winding-up or termination of
the Trust (each a  "LIQUIDATION")  other than in connection with a redemption of
the Debentures, the Holders of the Securities will be entitled to receive out of
the assets of the Trust available for distribution to Holders of the Securities,
after  satisfaction  of liabilities to creditors of the Trust (to the extent not
satisfied by the Debenture Issuer), distributions equal to the lesser of (i) the
aggregate  of the stated  liquidation  amount of  $1,000.00  per  Security  plus
accrued and unpaid  Distributions  thereon to the date of payment, to the extent
the Trust shall have funds available therefor,  and (ii) the amount of assets of
the Trust remaining available for contributions to Holders in liquidation of the
Trust (such amount being, the "LIQUIDATION DISTRIBUTION"),  unless in connection
with such  Liquidation,  the Debentures in an aggregate  stated principal amount
equal to the aggregate stated  liquidation  amount of such  Securities,  with an
interest rate equal to the Distribution  Rate of, and bearing accrued and unpaid
interest  in an amount  equal to the accrued  and unpaid  Distributions  on, and
having  the same  record  date as,  such  Securities,  after  paying  or  making
reasonable  provision  to  pay  all  claims  and  obligations  of the  Trust  in
accordance  with the Statutory  Trust Act,  shall be  distributed  on a Pro Rata
basis to the Holders of the Securities in exchange for such Securities.

         The  Sponsor,  as the Holder of all of the Common  Securities,  has the
right at any time to dissolve the Trust (including, without limitation, upon the
occurrence  of a Special  Event)  and,  after  satisfaction  of  liabilities  to
creditors of the Trust, cause the Debentures to be distributed to the Holders of
the  Securities  on a Pro Rata basis in  accordance  with the  aggregate  stated
liquidation amount thereof.

                  If a  Liquidation  of the Trust  occurs as described in clause
(i), (ii), (iii) or (v) in Section 7.1(a) of the Declaration, the Trust shall be
liquidated by the Institutional  Trustee as expeditiously as it determines to be
possible by distributing,  after satisfaction of liabilities to creditors of the
Trust, to the Holders of the  Securities,  the Debentures on a Pro Rata basis to
the extent not satisfied by the Debenture  Issuer,  unless such  distribution is
determined by the Institutional Trustee not to be practical, in which event such
Holders will be entitled to receive out of the assets of the Trust available for
distribution to the Holders,  after  satisfaction of liabilities of creditors of
the Trust to the extent not satisfied by the Debenture  Issuer,  an amount equal
to the Liquidation  Distribution.  An early Liquidation of the Trust pursuant to
clause  (iv)  of  Section  7.1(a)  of  the   Declaration   shall  occur  if  the
Institutional   Trustee   determines  that  such   Liquidation  is  possible  by
distributing,  after  satisfaction  of liabilities to creditors of the Trust, to
the Holders of the  Securities  on a Pro Rata basis,  the  Debentures,  and such
distribution occurs.

                  If, upon any such Liquidation the Liquidation Distribution can
be paid only in part because the Trust has insufficient  assets available to pay
in full  the  aggregate  Liquidation  Distribution,  then  the  amounts  payable
directly by the Trust on such Capital Securities shall be paid to the Holders of
the  Securities  on a Pro Rata  basis,  except  that if an Event of Default  has
occurred and is continuing,  the Capital Securities shall have a preference over
the Common Securities with regard to such distributions.



                                       I-5
<PAGE>

                  After the date for any  distribution  of the  Debentures  upon
dissolution of the Trust (i) the Securities of the Trust will be deemed to be no
longer outstanding,  (ii) upon surrender of a Holder's  Securities  certificate,
such  Holder of the  Securities  will  receive a  certificate  representing  the
Debentures  to be  delivered  upon such  distribution,  (iii)  any  certificates
representing  the  Securities  still  outstanding  will be deemed  to  represent
undivided  beneficial  interests in such of the  Debentures as have an aggregate
principal  amount  equal to the  aggregate  stated  liquidation  amount  with an
interest rate  identical to the  Distribution  Rate of, and bearing  accrued and
unpaid  interest  equal to accrued and unpaid  distributions  on, the Securities
until such  certificates  are presented to the Debenture Issuer or its agent for
transfer or  reissuance  (and until such  certificates  are so  surrendered,  no
payments of  interest or  principal  shall be made to Holders of  Securities  in
respect of any payments due and payable under the Debentures;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER
that such failure to pay shall not be deemed to be an Event of Default and shall
not entitle the Holder to the benefits of the Guarantee), and (iv) all rights of
Holders of Securities  under the  Declaration  shall cease,  except the right of
such Holders to receive  Debentures upon surrender of certificates  representing
such Securities.

         4. REDEMPTION AND DISTRIBUTION.

         (a) The Debentures will mature on December 15, 2034. The Debentures may
be redeemed by the  Debenture  Issuer,  in whole or in part on any  Distribution
Payment Date on or after the Distribution  Payment Date in December 2009, at the
Optional  Redemption  Price. In addition,  the Debentures may be redeemed by the
Debenture Issuer at the Special  Redemption  Price, in whole but not in part, at
any Distribution Payment Date, upon the occurrence and continuation of a Special
Event within 120 days  following  the  occurrence  of such Special  Event at the
Special Redemption Price, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice to
holders of such  Debentures  so long as such Special  Event is  continuing.  The
Sponsor shall appoint a Quotation  Agent,  which  initially  shall be U. S. Bank
National Association, for the purpose of performing the services contemplated in
or by reference in, the definition of Special Redemption Price. Any error in the
calculation  of the  Special  Redemption  Price  by the  Quotation  Agent or the
Debenture  Trustee  may be  corrected  at any time by  notice  delivered  to the
Sponsor  and the holders of the Capital  Securities.  Subject to the  corrective
rights   set  forth   above,   all   certificates,   communications,   opinions,
determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions given, expressed, made or
obtained  for  the  purposes  of the  provisions  relating  to the  payment  and
calculation  of the Special  Redemption  Price on the  Debentures or the Capital
Securities by the Debenture  Trustee,  the Quotation Agent or the  Institutional
Trustee, as the case may be, shall (in the absence of willful default, bad faith
or  manifest  error) be final,  conclusive  and  binding  on the  holders of the
Debentures  and the  Capital  Securities,  the  Trust  and the  Sponsor,  and no
liability shall attach (except as provided above) to the Debenture Trustee,  the
Quotation Agent or the Institutional  Trustee in connection with the exercise or
non-exercise by any of them of their respective powers, duties and discretion.

         "COMPARABLE   TREASURY   ISSUE"  means  with  respect  to  any  Special
Redemption  Date the United States Treasury  security  selected by the Quotation
Agent as having a maturity  comparable to the Fixed Rate Period  Remaining  Life
that  would  be  utilized,  at the  time of  selection  and in  accordance  with
customary financial practice, in pricing new issues of corporate debt securities
of  comparable  maturity to the Fixed Rate Period  Remaining  Life. If no United
States  Treasury  security  has a maturity  which is within a period  from three
months  before to three months after the  Distribution  Payment Date in December
2009,  the two most closely  corresponding  fixed,  non-callable  United  States
Treasury  securities,  as selected by the Quotation Agent,  shall be used as the
Comparable  Treasury  Issue,  and the Treasury  Rate shall be  interpolated  and
extrapolated on a straight-line basis,  rounding to the nearest month using such
securities.


                                       I-6
<PAGE>

         "COMPARABLE  TREASURY  PRICE"  means (a) the average of five  Reference
Treasury Dealer Quotations for such Special Redemption Date, after excluding the
highest and lowest such  Reference  Treasury  Dealer  Quotations,  or (b) if the
Quotation  Agent  obtains  fewer  than  five  such  Reference   Treasury  Dealer
Quotations, the average of all such Quotations.

establishes yields on actively traded United States Treasury securities adjusted
to constant maturity under the caption "Treasury  Constant  Maturities," for the
maturity  corresponding  to the Fixed Rate Period Remaining Life (if no maturity
is within three  months  before or after the Fixed Rate Period  Remaining  Life,
yields for the two published maturities most closely  corresponding to the Fixed
Rate Period  Remaining  Life shall be determined  and the Treasury Rate shall be
interpolated or extrapolated from such yields on a straight-line basis, rounding
to the nearest month) or (ii) if such release (or any successor  release) is not
published  during the week  preceding the  calculation  date or does not contain
such yields,  the rate per annum equal to the  semi-annual  equivalent  yield to
maturity of the  Comparable  Treasury  Issue,  calculated  using a price for the

equal to the  Comparable  Treasury Price for such Special  Redemption  Date. The
Treasury Rate shall be calculated by the Quotation  Agent on the third  Business
Day preceding the Special Redemption Date.

                  (b) Upon the  repayment in full at maturity or  redemption  in
whole or in part of the Debentures (other than following the distribution of the
Debentures to the Holders of the  Securities),  the proceeds from such repayment
or payment shall  concurrently  be applied to redeem Pro Rata at the  applicable
Optional Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price, as applicable, Securities
having an aggregate  liquidation amount equal to the aggregate  principal amount
of the Debentures so repaid or redeemed; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that holders of such
Securities shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice of such
redemption (other than at the scheduled maturity of the Debentures).

                  (c) If fewer than all the outstanding  Securities are to be so
redeemed,  the Common Securities and the Capital Securities will be redeemed Pro
Rata and the Capital  Securities  to be redeemed  will be redeemed Pro Rata from

                           (i)  Notice  of  any  redemption  of,  or  notice  of
                  distribution of the Debentures in exchange for, the Securities
                  (a  "REDEMPTION/DISTRIBUTION  NOTICE")  will be  given  by the
                  Trust by mail to each Holder of  Securities  to be redeemed or
                  exchanged  not fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days  before the
                  date fixed for redemption or exchange  thereof  which,  in the
                  case of a redemption, will be the date fixed for redemption of
                  the Debentures. For purposes of the calculation of the date of
                  redemption  or  exchange  and the dates on which  notices  are
                  given    pursuant    to    this    paragraph     4(e)(i),    a
                  Redemption/Distribution  Notice shall be deemed to be given on
                  the day such  notice  is first  mailed  by  first-class  mail,
                  postage  prepaid,   to  Holders  of  such   Securities.   Each
                  Redemption/Distribution  Notice  shall  be  addressed  to  the
                  Holders of such  Securities at the address of each such Holder
                  appearing on the books and records of the Trust.  No defect in
                  the  Redemption/Distribution  Notice or in the mailing thereof
                  with  respect to any Holder  shall  affect the validity of the
                  redemption or exchange  proceedings  with respect to any other
                  Holder.

                           (ii) If the  Securities  are to be  redeemed  and the
                  Trust gives a Redemption/  Distribution  Notice,  which notice
                  may only be issued if the  Debentures  are redeemed as set out
                  in this paragraph 4 (which notice will be irrevocable),  then,
                  PROVIDED  that  the  Institutional  Trustee  has a  sufficient
                  amount of cash in  connection  with the related  redemption or
                  maturity of the Debentures, the Institutional Trustee will pay
                  the relevant Optional  Redemption Price or Special  Redemption
                  Price,  as  applicable,  to the Holders of such  Securities by
                  check  mailed to the address of each such Holder  appearing on
                  the books and records of the Trust on the Optional  Redemption
                  Date or Special Redemption Date. If a  Redemption/Distribution
                  Notice  shall have been given and funds  deposited as required
                  then immediately prior to the close of business on the date of
                  such  deposit  Distributions  will  cease  to  accrue  on  the
                  Securities so called for  redemption and all rights of Holders
                  of such Securities so called for redemption will cease, except
                  the right of the  Holders of such  Securities  to receive  the
                  applicable  Optional  Redemption  Price or Special  Redemption
                  Price  specified in paragraph  4(a),  but without  interest on
                  such Optional Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price. If
                  any date fixed for  redemption of Securities is not a Business
                  Day,  then payment of any such  Optional  Redemption  Price or
                  Special  Redemption Price payable on such date will be made on
                  the next  succeeding day that is a Business Day. If payment of
                  the Optional  Redemption Price or Special  Redemption Price in
                  respect of any  Securities is  improperly  withheld or refused
                  and not paid either by the Trust or by the Debenture Issuer as
                  guarantor  pursuant to the  Guarantee,  Distributions  on such
                  Securities  will continue to accrue at the  Distribution  Rate
                  from  the  original   Optional   Redemption  Date  or  Special
                  Redemption  Date to the actual date of payment,  in which case
                  the actual  payment date will be considered the date fixed for
                  redemption for purposes of calculating the Optional Redemption
                  Price  or  Special  Redemption  Price.  In  the  event  of any
                  redemption  of the Capital  Securities  issued by the Trust in
                  part,  the Trust shall not be required to (i) issue,  register
                  the  transfer  of or  exchange  any  Security  during a period
                  beginning  at the  opening  of  business  15 days  before  any
                  selection for redemption of the Capital  Securities and ending
                  at the close of  business  on the  earliest  date on which the
                  relevant  notice of redemption is deemed to have been given to
                  all  Holders of the  Capital  Securities  to be so redeemed or
                  (ii)   register  the  transfer  of  or  exchange  any  Capital
                  Securities  so selected for  redemption,  in whole or in part,
                  except for the  unredeemed  portion of any Capital  Securities
                  being redeemed in part.

                           (iii)  Redemption/Distribution  Notices shall be sent
                  by the Administrators on behalf of the Trust to (A) in respect
                  of the  Capital  Securities,  the  Holders  thereof and (B) in
                  respect of the Common Securities, the Holder thereof.

                           (iv)  Subject to the  foregoing  and  applicable  law
                  (including,   without   limitation,   United  States   federal
                  securities  laws),  and provided  that the acquiror is not the
                  Holder  of the  Common  Securities  or the  obligor  under the
                  Indenture,  the Sponsor or any of its  subsidiaries may at any
                  time  and  from  time to  time  purchase  outstanding  Capital
                  Securities  by  tender,  in  the  open  market  or by  private
                  agreement.

         5. VOTING RIGHTS - CAPITAL SECURITIES.

         (a) Except as provided  under  paragraphs  5(b) and 7 and as  otherwise
required by law and the Declaration,  the Holders of the Capital Securities will
have no voting rights.  The Administrators are required to call a meeting of the
Holders of the  Capital  Securities  if directed to do so by Holders of at least
10% in liquidation amount of the Capital Securities.

         (b)  Subject to the  requirements  of  obtaining  a tax  opinion by the
Institutional Trustee in certain circumstances set forth in the last sentence of
this paragraph,  the Holders of a Majority in liquidation  amount of the Capital
Securities,  voting  separately  as a class,  have the right to direct the time,
method,  and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy  available to the
Institutional  Trustee,  or  exercising  any trust or power  conferred  upon the
Institutional  Trustee under the Declaration,  including the right to direct the
Institutional Trustee, as holder of the Debentures, to (i) exercise the remedies
available  under the Indenture as the holder of the  Debentures,  (ii) waive any
past default that is waivable under the  Indenture,  (iii) exercise any right to
rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall be
due and  payable  or (iv)  consent on behalf of all the  Holders of the  Capital
Securities to any amendment, modification or termination of the Indenture or the
Debentures where such consent shall be required;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, where
a consent or action under the Indenture  would require the consent or act of the
holders of greater  than a simple  majority  in  aggregate  principal  amount of
Debentures (a "SUPER MAJORITY") affected thereby, the Institutional  Trustee may
only give such  consent  or take such  action at the  written  direction  of the
Holders  of at  least  the  proportion  in  liquidation  amount  of the  Capital
Securities  outstanding  which the relevant  Super  Majority  represents  of the
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures  outstanding.  If the Institutional
Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the Debentures  after the Holders of a
Majority in liquidation  amount of such Capital  Securities have so directed the
Institutional  Trustee,  to the fullest extent permitted by law, a Holder of the
Capital  Securities  may  institute  a legal  proceeding  directly  against  the
Debenture  Issuer  to  enforce  the  Institutional  Trustee's  rights  under the
Debentures   without  first   instituting  any  legal  proceeding   against  the
Institutional  Trustee  or any  other  person  or  entity.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and such event
is  attributable  to the  failure of the  Debenture  Issuer to pay  interest  or
principal on the Debentures on the date the interest or principal is payable (or
in the  case  of  redemption,  the  Optional  Redemption  Date  or  the  Special
Redemption  Date,  as  applicable),  then a  Holder  of  record  of the  Capital
Securities may directly  institute a proceeding for enforcement of payment on or
after the  respective  due dates  specified  in the  Debentures,  to such Holder
directly of the principal of or interest on the  Debentures  having an aggregate
principal  amount  equal to the  aggregate  liquidation  amount  of the  Capital
Securities of such Holder. The Institutional Trustee shall notify all Holders of
the  Capital  Securities  of any  default  actually  known to the  Institutional
Trustee  with respect to the  Debentures  unless (x) such default has been cured
prior to the giving of such notice or (y) the Institutional  Trustee  determines
in good faith that the  withholding  of such  notice is in the  interest  of the
Holders of such  Capital  Securities,  except  where the default  relates to the
payment of principal of or interest on any of the Debentures.  Such notice shall
state that such Indenture Event of Default also  constitutes an Event of Default
hereunder.  Except  with  respect  to  directing  the time,  method and place of
conducting a proceeding for a remedy,  the Institutional  Trustee shall not take
any of the actions  described  in clauses  (i),  (ii) or (iii) above  unless the
Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of tax counsel to the effect that,
as a result of such  action,  the Trust will not be  classified  as other than a
grantor trust for United States federal income tax purposes.


                                      I-11
<PAGE>

         In the event the consent of the Institutional Trustee, as the holder of
the  Debentures,  is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment,
modification or termination of the Indenture,  the  Institutional  Trustee shall
request the  direction  of the Holders of the  Securities  with  respect to such
amendment,  modification  or  termination  and shall  vote with  respect to such
amendment,  modification or termination as directed by a Majority in liquidation
amount of the Securities voting together as a single class;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that  where a  consent  under the  Indenture  would  require  the  consent  of a
Super-Majority,  the  Institutional  Trustee  may only give such  consent at the
direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the
Securities  outstanding  which the  relevant  Super-Majority  represents  of the
aggregate  principal  amount of the Debentures  outstanding.  The  Institutional
Trustee shall not take any such action in accordance  with the directions of the
Holders of the  Securities  unless the  Institutional  Trustee  has  obtained an
opinion of tax counsel to the effect that, as a result of such action, the Trust
will not be classified  as other than a grantor trust for United States  federal
income tax purposes.

         A waiver of an Indenture  Event of Default will  constitute a waiver of
the corresponding Event of Default hereunder. Any required approval or direction
of  Holders of the  Capital  Securities  may be given at a  separate  meeting of
Holders of the Capital Securities convened for such purpose, at a meeting of all
of the Holders of the  Securities  in the Trust or pursuant to written  consent.
The Institutional Trustee will cause a notice of any meeting at which Holders of
the Capital  Securities are entitled to vote, or of any matter upon which action
by written  consent of such Holders is to be taken,  to be mailed to each Holder
of record of the Capital  Securities.  Each such notice will include a statement
setting forth the following information (i) the date of such meeting or the date
by which  such  action  is to be taken,  (ii) a  description  of any  resolution
proposed for adoption at such meeting on which such Holders are entitled to vote
or of such matter upon which written consent is sought,  and (iii)  instructions
for the  delivery of proxies or  consents.  No vote or consent of the Holders of
the  Capital  Securities  will be  required  for the Trust to redeem  and cancel
Capital  Securities or to  distribute  the  Debentures  in  accordance  with the
Declaration and the terms of the Securities.

         Notwithstanding  that Holders of the Capital Securities are entitled to
vote or  consent  under any of the  circumstances  described  above,  any of the
Capital Securities that are owned by the Sponsor or any Affiliate of the Sponsor
shall not entitle the Holder thereof to vote or consent and shall,  for purposes
of such vote or  consent,  be treated  as if such  Capital  Securities  were not
outstanding.

         In no event will  Holders of the Capital  Securities  have the right to
vote to appoint,  remove or replace the Administrators,  which voting rights are
vested  exclusively in the Sponsor as the Holder of all of the Common Securities
of the  Trust.  Under  certain  circumstances  as more  fully  described  in the
Declaration,  Holders of Capital  Securities  have the right to vote to appoint,
remove or replace the Institutional Trustee and the Delaware Trustee.

         6. VOTING RIGHTS - COMMON SECURITIES.

         (a)  Except  as  provided  under  paragraphs  6(b),  6(c)  and 7 and as
otherwise  required by law and the Declaration,  the Common Securities will have
no voting rights.

         (b) The Holders of the Common  Securities  are entitled,  in accordance
with Article IV of the  Declaration,  to vote to appoint,  remove or replace any
Administrators.

         (c) Subject to Section 6.7 of the Declaration and only after each Event
of Default  (if any) with  respect to the  Capital  Securities  has been  cured,
waived, or otherwise eliminated and subject to the requirements of the second to
last sentence of this paragraph, the Holders of a Majority in liquidation amount
of the Common  Securities,  voting  separately as a class,  may direct the time,
method,  and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy  available to the
Institutional  Trustee,  or  exercising  any trust or power  conferred  upon the
Institutional  Trustee under the Declaration,  including (i) directing the time,
method,  place of  conducting  any  proceeding  for any remedy  available to the
Debenture  Trustee,  or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Debenture
Trustee  with respect to the  Debentures,  (ii) waiving any past default and its
consequences that is waivable under the Indenture, or (iii) exercising any right
to rescind or annul a declaration that the principal of all the Debentures shall
be due and payable; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that, where a consent or action under the
Indenture would require a Super  Majority,  the  Institutional  Trustee may only
give such consent or take such action at the written direction of the Holders of
at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the Common Securities which the
relevant  Super  Majority  represents of the aggregate  principal  amount of the
Debentures  outstanding.  Notwithstanding this paragraph 6(c), the Institutional
Trustee shall not revoke any action previously  authorized or approved by a vote
or consent of the Holders of the Capital Securities.  Other than with respect to
directing the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the  Institutional  Trustee or the  Debenture  Trustee as set forth
above,  the  Institutional  Trustee shall not take any action  described in (i),
(ii) or (iii) above, unless the Institutional Trustee has obtained an opinion of
tax counsel to the effect that for the purposes of United States  federal income
tax the Trust will not be classified as other than a grantor trust on account of
such action. If the Institutional  Trustee fails to enforce its rights under the
Declaration  to the fullest  extent  permitted  by law, any Holder of the Common
Securities  may  institute  a legal  proceeding  directly  against any Person to
enforce the Institutional Trustee's rights under the Declaration,  without first
instituting a legal proceeding  against the  Institutional  Trustee or any other
Person.

         Any approval or direction  of Holders of the Common  Securities  may be
given at a separate  meeting of Holders of the Common  Securities  convened  for
such purpose,  at a meeting of all of the Holders of the Securities in the Trust
or pursuant to written consent.  The  Administrators  will cause a notice of any
meeting at which  Holders of the Common  Securities  are entitled to vote, or of
any matter upon which action by written  consent of such Holders is to be taken,
to be mailed to each  Holder of the Common  Securities.  Each such  notice  will
include a statement  setting  forth (i) the date of such  meeting or the date by
which such action is to be taken, (ii) a description of any resolution  proposed
for  adoption at such  meeting on which such  Holders are entitled to vote or of
such matter upon which written consent is sought, and (iii) instructions for the
delivery of proxies or consents.

         No vote or consent of the  Holders  of the  Common  Securities  will be
required for the Trust to redeem and cancel  Common  Securities or to distribute
the  Debentures  in  accordance  with  the  Declaration  and  the  terms  of the
Securities.

         7. AMENDMENTS TO DECLARATION AND INDENTURE.

         (a)  In  addition  to  any  requirements  under  Section  11.1  of  the
Declaration,  if any proposed amendment to the Declaration  provides for, or the
Trustees,  Sponsor or Administrators otherwise propose to effect, (i) any action
that would  adversely  affect the powers,  preferences  or special rights of the
Securities, whether by way of amendment to the Declaration or otherwise, or (ii)
the  Liquidation  of the Trust,  other than as  described  in Section 7.1 of the
Declaration,  then the Holders of outstanding  Securities,  voting together as a
single  class,  will be entitled to vote on such  amendment or proposal and such
amendment  or proposal  shall not be  effective  except with the approval of the
Holders of at least a Majority in liquidation amount of the Securities, affected
thereby;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, if any amendment or proposal referred to in clause
(i) above would adversely affect only the Capital  Securities or only the Common
Securities,  then only the affected  Securities will be entitled to vote on such
amendment  or proposal  and such  amendment  or proposal  shall not be effective
except with the  approval of a Majority in  liquidation  amount of such class of
Securities.

         (b) In the event the consent of the Institutional Trustee as the holder
of the Debentures is required under the Indenture with respect to any amendment,
modification   or   termination  of  the  Indenture  or  the   Debentures,   the
Institutional  Trustee shall request the written direction of the Holders of the
Securities with respect to such amendment, modification or termination and shall
vote with respect to such amendment, modification, or termination as directed by
a Majority in liquidation  amount of the Securities  voting together as a single
class; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that where a consent under the Indenture would require
a Super Majority,  the  Institutional  Trustee may only give such consent at the
direction of the Holders of at least the proportion in liquidation amount of the
Securities  which  the  relevant  Super  Majority  represents  of the  aggregate
principal amount of the Debentures outstanding.

         (c) Notwithstanding the foregoing,  no amendment or modification may be
made to the  Declaration if such amendment or  modification  would (i) cause the
Trust to be classified for purposes of United States federal income  taxation as
other than a grantor trust, (ii) reduce or otherwise adversely affect the powers
of the  Institutional  Trustee,  or  (iii)  cause  the  Trust  to be  deemed  an
Investment  Company  which is required  to be  registered  under the  Investment
Company Act.

         (d) Notwithstanding any provision of the Declaration,  the right of any
Holder of the Capital  Securities to receive payment of Distributions  and other
payments upon redemption, liquidation or otherwise, on or after their respective
due dates,  or to institute a suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or
after such  respective  dates,  shall not be impaired  or  affected  without the
consent of such Holder.  For the  protection  and  enforcement  of the foregoing
provision,  each and every Holder of the Capital Securities shall be entitled to
such relief as can be given either at law or equity.

         8. PRO  RATA.  A  reference  in these  terms of the  Securities  to any
payment,  distribution  or  treatment as being "PRO RATA" shall mean pro rata to
each Holder of the Securities  according to the aggregate  liquidation amount of
the  Securities  held  by the  relevant  Holder  in  relation  to the  aggregate
liquidation  amount of all Securities then outstanding  unless, in relation to a
payment,  an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,  in which case any
funds  available to make such payment  shall be paid first to each Holder of the
Capital Securities Pro Rata according to the aggregate liquidation amount of the
Capital  Securities  held  by the  relevant  Holder  relative  to the  aggregate
liquidation  amount  of all  Capital  Securities  outstanding,  and  only  after
satisfaction  of all amounts owed to the Holders of the Capital  Securities,  to
each  Holder  of the  Common  Securities  Pro Rata  according  to the  aggregate
liquidation amount of the Common Securities held by the relevant Holder relative
to the aggregate liquidation amount of all Common Securities outstanding.

<PAGE>

         9.  RANKING.  The Capital  Securities  rank PARI PASSU with and payment
thereon shall be made Pro Rata with the Common  Securities except that, where an
Event of Default has  occurred and is  continuing,  the rights of Holders of the
Common  Securities  to  receive  payment  of  Distributions  and  payments  upon
liquidation,  redemption  and  otherwise are  subordinated  to the rights of the
Holders  of the  Capital  Securities  with the  result  that no  payment  of any
Distribution on, or Optional  Redemption Price (or Special Redemption Price) of,
any Common Security, and no other payment on account of redemption,  liquidation
or other acquisition of Common Securities,  shall be made unless payment in full
in cash of all accumulated and unpaid  Distributions on all outstanding  Capital
Securities for all distribution  periods  terminating on or prior thereto, or in
the case of payment of the  Optional  Redemption  Price (or  Special  Redemption
Price) the full amount of such Optional  Redemption Price (or Special Redemption
Price) on all outstanding  Capital Securities then called for redemption,  shall
have been made or  provided  for,  and all funds  immediately  available  to the
Institutional  Trustee  shall first be applied to the payment in full in cash of
all  Distributions on, or the Optional  Redemption Price (or Special  Redemption
Price) of, the Capital Securities then due and payable.

         10.  ACCEPTANCE OF GUARANTEE AND INDENTURE.  Each Holder of the Capital
Securities  and the Common  Securities,  by the  acceptance of such  Securities,
agrees to the  provisions  of the  Guarantee  and the  Indenture,  including the
subordination provisions therein.

and the  issuance of the  Securities  is not subject to,  preemptive  or similar
rights to subscribe for any additional securities.

The Sponsor  will  provide a copy of the  Declaration,  the  Guarantee,  and the
Indenture to a Holder  without  charge on written  request to the Sponsor at its
principal place of business.

                      [FORM OF REVERSE OF CAPITAL SECURITY]

         Distributions  payable on each Capital  Security  will be payable at an
annual rate equal to 7.40%  beginning  on (and  including)  the date of original
issuance and ending on (but  excluding) the  Distribution  Payment Date (defined
herein)  in  December  2009 and at an  annual  rate for each  successive  period
beginning on (and  including)  December 2009, and each  succeeding  Distribution
Payment Date,  commencing on the  Distribution  Payment Date in March 2005,  and
ending on (but  excluding) the next succeeding  Distribution  Payment Date (each
such period,  a "Distribution  Period"),  equal to 3-Month LIBOR,  determined as
described  below,  plus  3.40%  (the  "Coupon  Rate"),  applied  to  the  stated
liquidation  amount of $1,000.00 per Capital Security,  such rate being the rate
of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the  Institutional  Trustee.
Distributions in arrears will bear interest thereon compounded  quarterly at the
Distribution  Rate  (to the  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law).  The  term
"Distributions"  as used herein includes payments of cash  distributions and any
such compounded  distributions and any Additional Sums payable on the Debentures
unless  otherwise  noted.  A  Distribution  is payable  only to the extent  that
payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee
and to the extent the  Institutional  Trustee has funds available  therefor.  As
used herein, "Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking Days
(i.e.,  a  business  day in which  dealings  in  deposits  in U.S.  dollars  are
transacted in the London  interbank  market)  preceding the  commencement of the
relevant Distribution Period. The amount of the Distribution payable (i) for any
Distribution  Period  commencing  on or after the date of original  issuance but
before the  Distribution  Payment Date in December  2009 will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months,  and (ii) for the  Distribution
Period commencing on or after the Distribution Payment Date in December 2009 and
each succeeding Distribution Period will be computed on the Distribution Rate to
the  stated   liquidation   amount   outstanding  at  the  commencement  of  the
Distribution  Period and  multiplying  each such amount by the actual  number of
days in the Distribution Period concerned divided by 360.

         "3-Month  LIBOR" as used  herein,  means the London  interbank  offered
interest rate for three-month  U.S. dollar deposits  determined by the Debenture
Trustee  in the  following  order  of  priority:  (i) the rate  (expressed  as a
percentage per annum) for U.S.  dollar  deposits  having a three-month  maturity
that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
Determination  Date ("Telerate Page 3750" means the display  designated as "Page
3750" on the Dow Jones  Telerate  Service or such other page as may replace Page
3750 on that  service or such other  service or services as may be  nominated by
the British  Bankers'  Association as the information  vendor for the purpose of
displaying  London interbank  offered rates for U.S. dollar  deposits);  (ii) if
such rate cannot be identified on the related  Determination Date, the Debenture
Trustee will request the principal  London  offices of four leading banks in the
London interbank market to provide such banks' offered quotations  (expressed as
percentages  per annum) to prime banks in the London  interbank  market for U.S.
dollar deposits having a three-month  maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on
such Determination  Date. If at least two such quotations are provided,  3-Month
LIBOR will be the arithmetic  mean of such  quotations;  (iii) if fewer than two
such  quotations  are provided as requested in clause (ii) above,  the Debenture
Trustee  will  request  four major New York City banks to  provide  such  banks'
offered  quotations  (expressed as  percentages  per annum) to leading  European
banks  for  loans  in U.S.  dollars  as of  11:00  a.m.  (London  time)  on such
Determination Date. If at least two such quotations are provided,  3-Month LIBOR
will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations;  and (iv) if fewer than two such
quotations  are provided as requested in clause (iii) above,  3-Month LIBOR will
be  a  3-Month  LIBOR  determined  with  respect  to  the  Distribution   Period
immediately  preceding such current  Distribution  Period.  If the rate for U.S.
dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that initially appears on Telerate
Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m.  (London time) on the related  Determination  Date is
superseded on the Telerate  Page 3750 by a corrected  rate by 12:00 noon (London
time) on such  Determination  Date, then the corrected rate as so substituted on
the applicable page will be the applicable  3-Month LIBOR for such Determination
Date.


                                      A-1-5
<PAGE>

         "Interest  Rate" means for the period  beginning on (and including) the
date of original issuance and ending on (but excluding) the Distribution Payment
Date in  December  2009 the rate per  annum of 7.40%  and for each  Distribution
Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

         The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All  percentages   resulting  from  any  calculations  on  the  Capital
Securities will be rounded, if necessary,  to the nearest one hundred-thousandth
of a percentage  point,  with five  one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upward (e.g.,  9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655),
and all  dollar  amounts  used in or  resulting  from such  calculation  will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         Except as  otherwise  described  below,  Distributions  on the  Capital
Securities  will be cumulative,  will accrue from the date of original  issuance
and will be payable  quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and
December  15 of each year or if such day is not a  Business  Day,  then the next
succeeding  Business  Day (each  such  date,  a  "Distribution  Payment  Date"),
commencing on the Distribution  Payment Date in March 2005. The Debenture Issuer
has the  right  under  the  Indenture  to  defer  payments  of  interest  on the
Debentures,  so long as no  Indenture  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  by extending the interest  payment  period for up to 20 consecutive
quarterly periods (each an "Extension Period") at any time and from time to time
on the  Debentures,  subject to the  conditions  described  below,  during which
Extension  Period no interest  shall be due and  payable.  During any  Extension
Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such
accrued interest will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Distribution Rate in
effect for each such Extension Period,  compounded  quarterly from the date such
interest  would have been payable were it not for the Extension  Period,  to the
extent  permitted  by law (such  interest  referred  to  herein  as  "Additional
Interest").  No  Extension  Period may end on a date  other than a  Distribution
Payment Date. At the end of any such Extension Period the Debenture Issuer shall
pay all  interest  then  accrued  and unpaid on the  Debentures  (together  with
Additional Interest thereon);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no Extension Period may
extend  beyond the Maturity  Date.  Prior to the  termination  of any  Extension
Period, the Debenture Issuer may further extend such period,  provided that such
period  together  with all such  previous  and  further  consecutive  extensions
thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive  quarterly periods, or extend beyond the
Maturity Date. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment
of all accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, the Debenture Issuer
may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the foregoing  requirements.  No
interest or  Additional  Interest  shall be due and payable  during an Extension
Period,  except at the end thereof,  but each installment of interest that would
otherwise  have been due and payable  during such  Extension  Period  shall bear
Additional Interest.  During any Extension Period,  Distributions on the Capital
Securities  shall be deferred for a period  equal to the  Extension  Period.  If
Distributions are deferred, the Distributions due shall be paid on the date that
the related  Extension Period  terminates,  to Holders of the Securities as they
appear on the books and  records  of the Trust on the  record  date  immediately
preceding such date.  Distributions  on the Securities must be paid on the dates
payable  (after giving  effect to any  Extension  Period) to the extent that the
Trust has funds available for the payment of such  distributions in the Property
Account of the Trust.  The  Trust's  funds  available  for  Distribution  to the
Holders  of the  Securities  will be  limited  to  payments  received  from  the
Debenture  Issuer.  The payment of Distributions out of moneys held by the Trust
is guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

                      [FORM OF REVERSE OF COMMON SECURITY]

         Distributions  payable on each  Common  Security  will be payable at an
annual rate equal to 7.40%  beginning  on (and  including)  the date of original
issuance and ending on (but  excluding) the  Distribution  Payment Date (defined
herein)  in  December  2009 and at an  annual  rate for each  successive  period
beginning on (and including) the Distribution Payment Date in December 2009, and
each  succeeding  Distribution  Payment  Date,  commencing  on the  Distribution
Payment Date in March 2005, and ending on (but  excluding)  the next  succeeding
Distribution Payment Date (each such period, a "Distribution Period"),  equal to
3-Month LIBOR,  determined as described  below,  plus 3.40% (the "Coupon Rate"),
applied to the stated liquidation amount of $1,000.00 per Common Security,  such
rate  being the rate of  interest  payable on the  Debentures  to be held by the
Institutional  Trustee.  Distributions  in arrears  will bear  interest  thereon
compounded  quarterly  at the  Distribution  Rate (to the  extent  permitted  by
applicable  law).  The  term   "Distributions"  as  used  herein  includes  cash
distributions  and any such  compounded  distributions  and any Additional  Sums
payable on the Debentures unless otherwise noted. A Distribution is payable only
to the extent that  payments are made in respect of the  Debentures  held by the
Institutional  Trustee  and to the extent the  Institutional  Trustee  has funds
available therefor. As used herein,  "Determination Date" means the date that is
two London  Banking Days (i.e.,  a business day in which dealings in deposits in
U.S.  dollars are  transacted  in the London  interbank  market)  preceding  the
commencement of the relevant Distribution Period. The amount of the Distribution
payable  (i) for any  Distribution  Period  commencing  on or after  the date of
original issuance but before the Distribution Payment Date in December 2009 will
be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months, and (ii) for
the Distribution Period commencing on or after the Distribution  Payment Date in
December  2009 and each  succeeding  Distribution  Period will be  calculated by
applying the Distribution Rate to the stated  liquidation  amount outstanding at
the commencement of the Distribution  Period and multiplying each such amount by
the actual number of days in the Distribution Period concerned divided by 360.

         "3-Month  LIBOR" as used  herein,  means the London  interbank  offered
interest rate for three-month  U.S. dollar deposits  determined by the Debenture
Trustee  in the  following  order  of  priority:  (i) the rate  (expressed  as a
percentage per annum) for U.S.  dollar  deposits  having a three-month  maturity
that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
Determination  Date ("Telerate Page 3750" means the display  designated as "Page
3750" on the Dow Jones  Telerate  Service or such other page as may replace Page
3750 on that  service or such other  service or services as may be  nominated by
the British  Bankers'  Association as the information  vendor for the purpose of
displaying  London interbank  offered rates for U.S. dollar  deposits);  (ii) if
such rate cannot be identified on the related  Determination Date, the Debenture
Trustee will request the principal  London  offices of four leading banks in the
London interbank market to provide such banks' offered quotations  (expressed as
percentages  per annum) to prime banks in the London  interbank  market for U.S.
dollar deposits having a three-month  maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on
such Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided,  3-Month LIBOR
will be the  arithmetic  mean of such  quotations;  (iii) if fewer than two such
quotations are provided as requested in clause (ii) above, the Debenture Trustee
will  request  four  major New York City banks to provide  such  banks'  offered
quotations  (expressed as percentages  per annum) to leading  European banks for
loans in U.S. dollars as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Determination Date.
If at  least  two  such  quotations  are  provided,  3-Month  LIBOR  will be the
arithmetic mean of such  quotations;  and (iv) if fewer than two such quotations
are provided as requested in clause (iii) above, 3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month
LIBOR determined with respect to the Distribution  Period immediately  preceding
such current  Distribution Period. If the rate for U.S. dollar deposits having a
three-month  maturity that  initially  appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00
a.m.  (London  time) on the  related  Determination  Date is  superseded  on the
Telerate  Page 3750 by a  corrected  rate by 12:00  noon  (London  time) on such
Determination  Date, then the corrected rate as so substituted on the applicable
page will be the applicable 3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date.




                                      A-2-3
<PAGE>

         "Interest  Rate" means for the period  beginning on (and including) the
date of original issuance and ending on (but excluding) the Distribution Payment
Date in  December  2009 the rate per  annum of 7.40%  and for each  Distribution
Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

         The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All  percentages   resulting  from  any   calculations  on  the  Common
Securities will be rounded, if necessary,  to the nearest one hundred-thousandth
of a percentage  point,  with five  one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upward (e.g.,  9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655),
and all  dollar  amounts  used in or  resulting  from such  calculation  will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         Except  as  otherwise  described  below,  Distributions  on the  Common
Securities  will be cumulative,  will accrue from the date of original  issuance
and will be payable  quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and
December  15 of each year or if such day is not a  Business  Day,  then the next
succeeding  Business  Day (each  such  date,  a  "Distribution  Payment  Date"),
commencing on the Distribution  Payment Date in March 2005. The Debenture Issuer
has the  right  under  the  Indenture  to  defer  payments  of  interest  on the
Debentures,  so long as no  Indenture  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  by extending the interest  payment  period for up to 20 consecutive
quarterly periods (each an "Extension Period") at any time and from time to time
on the  Debentures,  subject to the  conditions  described  below,  during which
Extension  Period no interest  shall be due and  payable.  During any  Extension
Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such
accrued interest will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Distribution Rate in
effect for each such Extension Period,  compounded  quarterly from the date such
interest  would have been payable were it not for the Extension  Period,  to the
extent  permitted  by law (such  interest  referred  to  herein  as  "Additional
Interest").  No  Extension  Period may end on a date  other than a  Distribution
Payment  Date. At the end of any such  Extension  Period,  the Debenture  Issuer
shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid on the Debentures  (together with
Additional Interest thereon);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no Extension Period may
extend  beyond the Maturity  Date.  Prior to the  termination  of any  Extension
Period, the Debenture Issuer may further extend such period,  provided that such
period  together  with all such  previous  and  further  consecutive  extensions
thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive  quarterly periods, or extend beyond the
Maturity Date. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment
of all accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, the Debenture Issuer
may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the foregoing  requirements.  No
interest or  Additional  Interest  shall be due and payable  during an Extension
Period,  except at the end thereof,  but each installment of interest that would
otherwise  have been due and payable  during such  Extension  Period  shall bear
Additional  Interest.  During any Extension Period,  Distributions on the Common
Securities  shall be deferred for a period  equal to the  Extension  Period.  If
Distributions are deferred, the Distributions due shall be paid on the date that
the related Extension Period terminates,  to Holders of the Common Securities as
they appear on the books and records of the Trust on the record date immediately
preceding such date.  Distributions on the Common Securities must be paid on the
dates payable  (after giving effect to any Extension  Period) to the extent that
the Trust has funds  available  for the  payment  of such  distributions  in the
Property  Account of the Trust.  The Trust's funds available for Distribution to
the Holders of the Common  Securities will be limited to payments  received from
the Debenture Issuer.
