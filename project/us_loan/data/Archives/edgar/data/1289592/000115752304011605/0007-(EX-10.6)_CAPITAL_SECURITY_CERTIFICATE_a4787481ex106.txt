                          [REVERSE OF CAPITAL SECURITY]

         Distributions  payable on each Capital  Security  will be payable at an
annual rate equal to 7.40%  beginning  on (and  including)  the date of original
issuance and ending on (but  excluding) the  Distribution  Payment Date (defined
herein)  in  December  2009 and at an  annual  rate for each  successive  period
beginning on (and  including)  December 2009, and each  succeeding  Distribution
Payment Date,  commencing on the  Distribution  Payment Date in March 2005,  and
ending on (but  excluding) the next succeeding  Distribution  Payment Date (each
such period,  a "Distribution  Period"),  equal to 3-Month LIBOR,  determined as
described  below,  plus  3.40%  (the  "Coupon  Rate"),  applied  to  the  stated
liquidation  amount of $1,000.00 per Capital Security,  such rate being the rate
of interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the  Institutional  Trustee.
Distributions in arrears will bear interest thereon compounded  quarterly at the
Distribution  Rate  (to the  extent  permitted  by  applicable  law).  The  term
"Distributions"  as used herein includes payments of cash  distributions and any
such compounded  distributions and any Additional Sums payable on the Debentures
unless  otherwise  noted.  A  Distribution  is payable  only to the extent  that
payments are made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee
and to the extent the  Institutional  Trustee has funds available  therefor.  As
used herein, "Determination Date" means the date that is two London Banking Days
(i.e.,  a  business  day in which  dealings  in  deposits  in U.S.  dollars  are
transacted in the London  interbank  market)  preceding the  commencement of the
relevant Distribution Period. The amount of the Distribution payable (i) for any
Distribution  Period  commencing  on or after the date of original  issuance but
before the  Distribution  Payment Date in December  2009 will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months,  and (ii) for the  Distribution
Period commencing on or after the Distribution Payment Date in December 2009 and
each succeeding Distribution Period will be computed on the Distribution Rate to
the  stated   liquidation   amount   outstanding  at  the  commencement  of  the
Distribution  Period and  multiplying  each such amount by the actual  number of
days in the Distribution Period concerned divided by 360.

         "3-Month  LIBOR" as used  herein,  means the London  interbank  offered
interest rate for three-month  U.S. dollar deposits  determined by the Debenture
Trustee  in the  following  order  of  priority:  (i) the rate  (expressed  as a
percentage per annum) for U.S.  dollar  deposits  having a three-month  maturity
that appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on the related
Determination  Date ("Telerate Page 3750" means the display  designated as "Page
3750" on the Dow Jones  Telerate  Service or such other page as may replace Page
3750 on that  service or such other  service or services as may be  nominated by
the British  Bankers'  Association as the information  vendor for the purpose of
displaying  London interbank  offered rates for U.S. dollar  deposits);  (ii) if
such rate cannot be identified on the related  Determination Date, the Debenture
Trustee will request the principal  London  offices of four leading banks in the
London interbank market to provide such banks' offered quotations  (expressed as
percentages  per annum) to prime banks in the London  interbank  market for U.S.
dollar deposits having a three-month  maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on
such Determination  Date. If at least two such quotations are provided,  3-Month
LIBOR will be the arithmetic  mean of such  quotations;  (iii) if fewer than two
such  quotations  are provided as requested in clause (ii) above,  the Debenture
Trustee  will  request  four major New York City banks to  provide  such  banks'
offered  quotations  (expressed as  percentages  per annum) to leading  European
banks  for  loans  in U.S.  dollars  as of  11:00  a.m.  (London  time)  on such
Determination Date. If at least two such quotations are provided,  3-Month LIBOR
will be the arithmetic mean of such quotations;  and (iv) if fewer than two such
quotations  are provided as requested in clause (iii) above,  3-Month LIBOR will
be  a  3-Month  LIBOR  determined  with  respect  to  the  Distribution   Period
immediately  preceding such current  Distribution  Period.  If the rate for U.S.
dollar deposits having a three-month maturity that initially appears on Telerate
Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m.  (London time) on the related  Determination  Date is
superseded on the Telerate  Page 3750 by a corrected  rate by 12:00 noon (London
time) on such  Determination  Date, then the corrected rate as so substituted on
the applicable page will be the applicable  3-Month LIBOR for such Determination
Date.
<PAGE>

         "Interest  Rate" means for the period  beginning on (and including) the
date of original issuance and ending on (but excluding) the Distribution Payment
Date in  December  2009 the rate per  annum of 7.40%  and for each  Distribution
Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

         The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All  percentages   resulting  from  any  calculations  on  the  Capital
Securities will be rounded, if necessary,  to the nearest one hundred-thousandth
of a percentage  point,  with five  one-millionths of a percentage point rounded
upward (e.g.,  9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655),
and all  dollar  amounts  used in or  resulting  from such  calculation  will be
rounded to the nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         Except as  otherwise  described  below,  Distributions  on the  Capital
Securities  will be cumulative,  will accrue from the date of original  issuance
and will be payable  quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and
December  15 of each year or if such day is not a  Business  Day,  then the next
succeeding  Business  Day (each  such  date,  a  "Distribution  Payment  Date"),
commencing on the Distribution  Payment Date in March 2005. The Debenture Issuer
has the  right  under  the  Indenture  to  defer  payments  of  interest  on the
Debentures,  so long as no  Indenture  Event  of  Default  has  occurred  and is
continuing,  by extending the interest  payment  period for up to 20 consecutive
quarterly periods (each an "Extension Period") at any time and from time to time
on the  Debentures,  subject to the  conditions  described  below,  during which
Extension  Period no interest  shall be due and  payable.  During any  Extension
Period, interest will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such
accrued interest will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Distribution Rate in
effect for each such Extension Period,  compounded  quarterly from the date such
interest  would have been payable were it not for the Extension  Period,  to the
extent  permitted  by law (such  interest  referred  to  herein  as  "Additional
Interest").  No  Extension  Period may end on a date  other than a  Distribution
Payment Date. At the end of any such Extension Period the Debenture Issuer shall
pay all  interest  then  accrued  and unpaid on the  Debentures  (together  with
Additional Interest thereon);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no Extension Period may
extend  beyond the Maturity  Date.  Prior to the  termination  of any  Extension
Period, the Debenture Issuer may further extend such period,  provided that such
period  together  with all such  previous  and  further  consecutive  extensions
thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive  quarterly periods, or extend beyond the
Maturity Date. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment
of all accrued and unpaid interest and Additional Interest, the Debenture Issuer
may commence a new Extension Period, subject to the foregoing  requirements.  No
interest or  Additional  Interest  shall be due and payable  during an Extension
Period,  except at the end thereof,  but each installment of interest that would
otherwise  have been due and payable  during such  Extension  Period  shall bear
Additional Interest.  During any Extension Period,  Distributions on the Capital
Securities  shall be deferred for a period  equal to the  Extension  Period.  If

<PAGE>

Distributions are deferred, the Distributions due shall be paid on the date that
the related  Extension Period  terminates,  to Holders of the Securities as they
appear on the books and  records  of the Trust on the  record  date  immediately
preceding such date.  Distributions  on the Securities must be paid on the dates
payable  (after giving  effect to any  Extension  Period) to the extent that the
Trust has funds available for the payment of such  distributions in the Property
Account of the Trust.  The  Trust's  funds  available  for  Distribution  to the
Holders  of the  Securities  will be  limited  to  payments  received  from  the
Debenture  Issuer.  The payment of Distributions out of moneys held by the Trust
is guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

         The  Capital   Securities  shall  be  redeemable  as  provided  in  the
Declaration.
