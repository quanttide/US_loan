      THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY  AGREES THAT IT WILL COMPLY WITH THE FOREGOING
RESTRICTIONS.

      THIS  SECURITY  IS IN  REGISTERED  FORM  WITHIN THE  MEANING  OF  TREASURY
REGULATIONS  SECTION  1.871-14(c)(1)(i)  FOR U.S. FEDERAL INCOME AND WITHHOLDING
TAX PURPOSES.

      IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER,  THE HOLDER WILL DELIVER TO THE REGISTRAR
AND TRANSFER AGENT SUCH CERTIFICATES AND OTHER INFORMATION AS MAY BE REQUIRED BY
THE  INDENTURE  TO  CONFIRM  THAT  THE  TRANSFER  COMPLIES  WITH  THE  FOREGOING
RESTRICTIONS.

      SECTION 2.6. MUTILATED,  DESTROYED, LOST OR STOLEN DEBENTURES. In case any
Debenture shall become  mutilated or be destroyed,  lost or stolen,  the Company
shall execute,  and upon its written request the Trustee shall  authenticate and
deliver, a new Debenture bearing a number not contemporaneously  outstanding, in
exchange and  substitution  for the  mutilated  Debenture,  or in lieu of and in
substitution for the Debenture so destroyed,  lost or stolen.  In every case the
applicant  for a  substituted  Debenture  shall  furnish to the  Company and the
Trustee  such  security or  indemnity as may be required by them to save each of
them harmless,  and, in every case of destruction,  loss or theft, the applicant
shall also furnish to the Company and the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction
of the  destruction,  loss or  theft  of  such  Debenture  and of the  ownership
thereof.

                                       12
<PAGE>

      The Trustee may authenticate  any such  substituted  Debenture and deliver
the same  upon the  written  request  or  authorization  of any  officer  of the
Company. Upon the issuance of any substituted Debenture, the Company may require
the payment of a sum  sufficient to cover any tax or other  governmental  charge
that may be  imposed  in  relation  thereto  and any  other  expenses  connected
therewith.  In case any Debenture which has matured or is about to mature or has
been called for redemption in full shall become mutilated or be destroyed,  lost
or stolen,  the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute  Debenture,  pay or
authorize the payment of the same (without  surrender thereof except in the case
of a mutilated Debenture) if the applicant for such payment shall furnish to the
Company and the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by them to
save each of them harmless and, in case of destruction,  loss or theft, evidence
satisfactory to the Company and to the Trustee of the destruction, loss or theft
of such Debenture and of the ownership thereof.

      Every  substituted  Debenture  issued  pursuant to the  provisions of this
Section 2.6 by virtue of the fact that any such Debenture is destroyed,  lost or
stolen shall  constitute  an additional  contractual  obligation of the Company,
whether or not the  destroyed,  lost or stolen  Debenture  shall be found at any
time,  and shall be entitled to all the benefits of this  Indenture  equally and
proportionately  with any and all other  Debentures duly issued  hereunder.  All
Debentures  shall be held and owned  upon the  express  condition  that,  to the
extent permitted by applicable law, the foregoing  provisions are exclusive with
respect to the  replacement or payment of mutilated,  destroyed,  lost or stolen
Debentures   and  shall   preclude   any  and  all  other   rights  or  remedies
notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary
with respect to the  replacement  or payment of negotiable  instruments or other
securities without their surrender.

      SECTION 2.7. TEMPORARY  DEBENTURES.  Pending the preparation of definitive
Debentures,  the Company may execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make
available  for  delivery  temporary   Debentures  that  are  typed,  printed  or
lithographed.   Temporary   Debentures  shall  be  issuable  in  any  authorized
denomination, and substantially in the form of the definitive Debentures in lieu
of which they are issued but with such  omissions,  insertions and variations as
may be  appropriate  for temporary  Debentures,  all as may be determined by the
Company.  Every such temporary Debenture shall be executed by the Company and be
authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in  substantially  the
same manner,  and with the same effect,  as the definitive  Debentures.  Without
unreasonable  delay the Company  will  execute and deliver to the Trustee or the
Authenticating  Agent  definitive  Debentures and thereupon any or all temporary
Debentures may be surrendered in exchange therefor,  at the principal  corporate
trust office of the Trustee or at any office or agency maintained by the Company
for  such   purpose  as  provided  in  Section  3.2,  and  the  Trustee  or  the
Authenticating  Agent shall  authenticate  and make  available  for  delivery in
exchange for such temporary Debentures a like aggregate principal amount of such
definitive  Debentures.  Such  exchange  shall be made by the Company at its own
expense and without any charge therefor except that in case of any such exchange
involving a  registration  of transfer the Company may require  payment of a sum
sufficient  to cover  any  tax,  fee or other  governmental  charge  that may be
imposed in relation thereto. Until so exchanged,  the temporary Debentures shall
in all  respects  be  entitled  to the same  benefits  under this  Indenture  as
definitive Debentures authenticated and delivered hereunder.

      SECTION 2.8. PAYMENT OF INTEREST AND ADDITIONAL INTEREST.  Interest at the
Interest Rate and any Additional Interest on any Debenture that is payable,  and
is  punctually  paid or duly  provided  for, on any  Interest  Payment  Date for
Debentures  shall be paid to the Person in whose name said  Debenture (or one or
more  Predecessor  Securities)  is  registered  at the close of  business on the
regular record date for such interest  installment  except that interest and any
Additional  Interest payable on the Maturity Date shall be paid to the Person to
whom principal is paid.

      Each  Debenture  shall  bear  interest  for the period  beginning  on (and
including)  the date of  original  issuance  and ending on (but  excluding)  the
Interest  Payment Date in December 2009 at a rate per annum of 7.40%,  and shall
bear interest for each  successive  Distribution  Period  beginning or after the
Interest  Payment Date in December 2009 at a rate per annum equal to the 3-Month
LIBOR,  determined as described in Section 2.10, plus 3.40% (the "COUPON RATE"),
applied to the principal amount thereof, until the principal thereof becomes due
and payable, and on any overdue principal and to the extent that payment of such
interest is  enforceable  under  applicable  law  (without  duplication)  on any
overdue installment of interest (including  Additional Interest) at the Interest
Rate in effect for each applicable period compounded  quarterly.  Interest shall
be payable (subject to any relevant  Extension  Period)  quarterly in arrears on
each Interest Payment Date with the first  installment of interest to be paid on
the Interest Payment Date in March 2005.

      Any interest on any  Debenture,  including  Additional  Interest,  that is
payable,  but is not  punctually  paid or duly  provided  for,  on any  Interest
Payment Date (herein called  "DEFAULTED  INTEREST")  shall forthwith cease to be
payable to the registered  holder on the relevant  regular record date by virtue
of having been such holder;  and such  Defaulted  Interest  shall be paid by the
Company to the  Persons  in whose  names such  Debentures  (or their  respective
Predecessor  Securities)  are  registered  at the close of business on a special
record date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest,  which shall be fixed in
the following  manner:  the Company shall notify the Trustee in writing at least
25 days prior to the date of the  proposed  payment  of the amount of  Defaulted
Interest proposed to be paid on each such Debenture and the date of the proposed
payment,  and at the same time the  Company  shall  deposit  with the Trustee an
amount of money equal to the aggregate  amount proposed to be paid in respect of
such Defaulted  Interest or shall make arrangements  satisfactory to the Trustee
for such  deposit  prior to the date of the  proposed  payment,  such money when
deposited  to be held in trust for the benefit of the  Persons  entitled to such
Defaulted Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a
special record date for the payment of such  Defaulted  Interest which shall not
be more than 15 nor less than 10 days prior to the date of the proposed  payment
and not less than 10 days after the  receipt by the Trustee of the notice of the
proposed payment.  The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company of such special
record  date and,  in the name and at the  expense of the  Company,  shall cause
notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and the special record
date therefor to be mailed,  first class postage prepaid, to each Securityholder
at its address as it appears in the  Debenture  Register,  not less than 10 days
prior to such  special  record  date.  Notice of the  proposed  payment  of such
Defaulted  Interest and the special  record date therefor  having been mailed as
aforesaid,  such Defaulted  Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names
such Debentures (or their respective  Predecessor  Securities) are registered on
such special record date and shall be no longer payable.

                                       14
<PAGE>

      The Company may make payment of any Defaulted  Interest on any  Debentures
in any other  lawful  manner after notice given by the Company to the Trustee of
the  proposed  payment  method;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  the  Trustee  in its  sole
discretion deems such payment method to be practical.

      Any interest (including  Additional  Interest) scheduled to become payable
on an Interest  Payment Date occurring  during an Extension  Period shall not be
Defaulted  Interest  and shall be payable on such other date as may be specified
in the terms of such Debentures.

      The term  "regular  record  date" as used in this  Section  shall mean the
close  of  business  on the 15th  calendar  day next  preceding  the  applicable
Interest Payment Date.

      Subject  to the  foregoing  provisions  of this  Section,  each  Debenture
delivered  under this Indenture upon  registration of transfer of or in exchange
for or in lieu of any other Debenture shall carry the rights to interest accrued
and unpaid, and to accrue, that were carried by such other Debenture.

      SECTION  2.9.   CANCELLATION  OF  DEBENTURES  PAID,  ETC.  All  Debentures
surrendered for the purpose of payment, redemption,  exchange or registration of
transfer,  shall,  if  surrendered  to the  Company  or  any  paying  agent,  be
surrendered  to the Trustee and promptly  canceled by it, or, if  surrendered to
the Trustee or any  Authenticating  Agent, shall be promptly canceled by it, and
no Debentures  shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly  permitted by
any  of the  provisions  of  this  Indenture.  All  Debentures  canceled  by any
Authenticating  Agent shall be  delivered  to the  Trustee.  The  Trustee  shall
destroy all canceled Debentures unless the Company otherwise directs the Trustee
in writing.  If the Company shall acquire any of the Debentures,  however,  such
acquisition   shall  not  operate  as  a  redemption  or   satisfaction  of  the
indebtedness  represented  by such  Debentures  unless  and  until  the same are
surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation.

      SECTION 2.10.  COMPUTATION OF INTEREST. The amount of interest payable (i)
for any Distribution Period commencing on or after the date of original issuance
but before the Interest  Payment  Date in December  2009 will be computed on the
basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day months,  and (ii) for the  Distribution
Period  commencing  on the  Interest  Payment  Date in  December  2009  and each
succeeding  Distribution Period will be calculated by applying the Interest Rate
to the principal  amount  outstanding at the  commencement  of the  Distribution
Period and  multiplying  each such  amount by the  actual  number of days in the
Distribution Period concerned divided by 360. All percentages resulting from any
calculations on the Debentures will be rounded, if necessary, to the nearest one
hundred-thousandth  of  a  percentage  point,  with  five  one-millionths  of  a
percentage point rounded upward (e.g., 9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to
9.87655% (or  .0987655),  and all dollar  amounts used in or resulting from such
calculation  will be  rounded to the  nearest  cent  (with  one-half  cent being
rounded upward)).

            (a) "3-MONTH LIBOR" means the London interbank offered interest rate
for three-month, U.S. dollar deposits determined by the Trustee in the following
order of priority:

            (1) the rate  (expressed as a percentage per annum) for U.S.  dollar
      deposits having a three-month  maturity that appears on Telerate Page 3750
      as of 11:00  a.m.  (London  time) on the  related  Determination  Date (as
      defined below). "Telerate Page 3750" means the display designated as "Page
      3750" on the Dow Jones Telerate  Service or such other page as may replace
      Page 3750 on that  service or such other  service  or  services  as may be
      nominated by the British  Bankers'  Association as the information  vendor
      for the purpose of  displaying  London  interbank  offered  rates for U.S.
      dollar deposits;


                                       15
<PAGE>

            (2) if such rate cannot be identified  on the related  Determination
      Date,  the Trustee  will  request  the  principal  London  offices of four
      leading  banks in the  London  interbank  market to  provide  such  banks'
      offered quotations  (expressed as percentages per annum) to prime banks in
      the London  interbank market for U.S. dollar deposits having a three-month
      maturity as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such Determination  Date. If at
      least two  quotations  are provided,  3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic
      mean of such quotations;

            (3) if fewer than two such  quotations  are provided as requested in
      clause (2) above,  the Trustee will request four major New York City banks
      to provide such banks' offered  quotations  (expressed as percentages  per
      annum) to  leading  European  banks for loans in U.S.  dollars as of 11:00
      a.m.  (London  time) on such  Determination  Date.  If at  least  two such
      quotations are provided, 3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of such
      quotations; and

            (4) if fewer than two such  quotations  are provided as requested in
      clause (3) above,  3-Month LIBOR will be a 3-Month LIBOR  determined  with
      respect to the  Distribution  Period  immediately  preceding  such current
      Distribution Period.

      If the rate for U.S. dollar  deposits  having a three-month  maturity that
initially  appears on Telerate  Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m.  (London time) on the
related  Determination  Date  is  superseded  on the  Telerate  Page  3750  by a
corrected rate by 12:00 noon (London time) on such Determination  Date, then the
corrected rate as so  substituted on the applicable  page will be the applicable
3-Month LIBOR for such Determination Date.

            (b) The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be
higher than the maximum  rate then  permitted by New York law as the same may be
modified by United States law.

            (c)  "DETERMINATION  DATE" means the date that is two London Banking
Days (i.e.,  a business  day in which  dealings in deposits in U.S.  dollars are
transacted in the London interbank market) preceding the particular Distribution
Period for which a Coupon Rate is being determined.

            (d) The Trustee shall notify the Company, the Institutional  Trustee
and any securities exchange or interdealer quotation system on which the Capital
Securities are listed,  of the Coupon Rate and the  Determination  Date for each
Distribution Period, in each case as soon as practicable after the determination
thereof  but in no event  later than the  thirtieth  (30th) day of the  relevant
Distribution Period. Failure to notify the Company, the Institutional Trustee or
any securities  exchange or interdealer  quotation system, or any defect in said
notice,  shall not affect the  obligation  of the Company to make payment on the
Debentures at the applicable  Coupon Rate.  Any error in the  calculation of the
Coupon Rate by the Trustee may be corrected  at any time by notice  delivered as
above provided.  Upon the request of a holder of a Debenture,  the Trustee shall
provide the Coupon Rate then in effect and, if  determined,  the Coupon Rate for
the next Distribution Period.

                                       16
<PAGE>

            (e)  Subject  to  the  corrective   rights  set  forth  above,   all
certificates, communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, quotations
and  decisions  given,  expressed,  made or  obtained  for the  purposes  of the
provisions relating to the payment and calculation of interest on the Debentures
and distributions on the Capital  Securities by the Trustee or the Institutional
Trustee will (in the absence of willful  default,  bad faith and manifest error)
be final,  conclusive  and  binding on the  Trust,  the  Company  and all of the
holders of the Debentures and the Capital Securities, and no liability shall (in
the  absence of willful  default,  bad faith or  manifest  error)  attach to the
Trustee  or the  Institutional  Trustee  in  connection  with  the  exercise  or
non-exercise  by  either  of  them  of  their  respective  powers,   duties  and
discretion.

      SECTION 2.11. EXTENSION OF INTEREST PAYMENT PERIOD. So long as no Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing,  the Company shall have the right,  from
time to time,  and  without  causing an Event of Default,  to defer  payments of
interest on the  Debentures  by  extending  the interest  payment  period on the
Debentures at any time and from time to time during the term of the  Debentures,
for up to 20 consecutive  quarterly periods (each such extended interest payment
period,  an  "EXTENSION  PERIOD"),  during  which  Extension  Period no interest
(including  Additional Interest) shall be due and payable (except any Additional
Sums that may be due and payable).  No Extension  Period may end on a date other
than an  Interest  Payment  Date.  During an  Extension  Period,  interest  will
continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such accrued interest will
accrue at an annual rate equal to the Interest Rate in effect for such Extension
Period, compounded quarterly from the date such interest would have been payable
were it not for the  Extension  Period,  to the  extent  permitted  by law (such
interest  referred to herein as "ADDITIONAL  INTEREST").  At the end of any such
Extension  Period the Company  shall pay all interest then accrued and unpaid on
the Debentures (together with Additional Interest thereon);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that no Extension Period may extend beyond the Maturity Date;  PROVIDED FURTHER,
HOWEVER,  that during any such Extension Period, the Company shall not and shall
not permit any Affiliate of the Company controlled by the Company to (i) declare
or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase,  acquire, or make
a liquidation  payment with respect to, any of the Company's or such Affiliate's
capital stock (other than payments of dividends or  distributions to the Company
or a Subsidiary of the Company) or make any  guarantee  payments with respect to
the foregoing;  or (ii) make any payment of principal of or interest or premium,
if any, on or repay,  repurchase or redeem any debt securities of the Company or
any  Affiliate of the Company  controlled by the Company that rank PARI PASSU in
all respects  with or junior in interest to the  Debentures  (other  than,  with
respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above,  (a)  repurchases,  redemptions  or other
acquisitions  of shares of capital stock of the Company or any Subsidiary of the
Company  in  connection  with any  employment  contract,  benefit  plan or other
similar arrangement with or for the benefit of one or more employees,  officers,
directors  or  consultants,  in  connection  with  a  dividend  reinvestment  or
stockholder  stock  purchase plan or in connection  with the issuance of capital
stock of the Company or of such  Subsidiary (or securities  convertible  into or
exercisable  for  such  capital  stock)  as   consideration  in  an  acquisition
transaction  entered into prior to the  applicable  Extension  Period,  (b) as a

                                       17

<PAGE>


result of any  exchange or  conversion  of any class or series of the  Company's
capital  stock (or any capital  stock of a  Subsidiary  of the  Company) for any
class or series of the  Company's  capital stock (or in the case of a Subsidiary
of the Company,  any class or series of such  Subsidiary's  capital stock) or of
any class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the
Company's  capital stock (or in the case of  indebtedness of a Subsidiary of the
Company, of any class or series of such Subsidiary's  indebtedness for any class
or series of such  Subsidiary's  capital stock),  (c) the purchase of fractional
interests in shares of the  Company's  capital  stock (or the capital stock of a
Subsidiary of the Company) pursuant to the conversion or exchange  provisions of
such  capital  stock or the  security  being  converted  or  exchanged,  (d) any
declaration of a dividend in connection with any  stockholders'  rights plan, or
the issuance of rights,  stock or other property under any stockholders'  rights
plan,  or the  redemption  or repurchase  of rights  pursuant  thereto,  (e) any
dividend  in the form of stock,  warrants,  options  or other  rights  where the
dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants,  options or
other  rights is the same stock as that on which the  dividend  is being paid or
ranks PARI PASSU with or junior to such stock and any cash  payments  in lieu of
fractional  shares issued in  connection  therewith,  or (f) payments  under the
Capital Securities Guarantee). Prior to the termination of any Extension Period,
the Company may further extend such period,  provided that such period  together
with all such  previous and further  consecutive  extensions  thereof  shall not
exceed 20  consecutive  quarterly  periods,  or extend beyond the Maturity Date.
Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all accrued
and unpaid  interest  and  Additional  Interest,  the Company may commence a new
Extension  Period,  subject  to  the  foregoing  requirements.  No  interest  or
Additional Interest shall be due and payable during an Extension Period,  except
at the end thereof,  but each  installment of interest that would otherwise have
been due and payable during an Extension  Period shall bear Additional  Interest
to the extent  permitted  by  applicable  law. The Company must give the Trustee
notice  of its  election  to begin or  extend  an  Extension  Period  at least 5
Business Days prior to the regular  record date (as such term is used in Section
2.8)  immediately  preceding  the  Interest  Payment  Date with respect to which
interest on the  Debentures  would have been payable  except for the election to
begin or extend an  Extension  Period.  The  Trustee  shall  give  notice of the
Company's election to begin a new Extension Period to the Securityholders.

      SECTION 2.12. CUSIP NUMBERS. The Company in issuing the Debentures may use
"CUSIP"  numbers (if then  generally in use),  and, if so, the Trustee shall use
CUSIP  numbers in notices of redemption  as a  convenience  to  Securityholders;
PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that any such notice may state that no representation is made
as to the  correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Debentures or as
contained in any notice of a redemption  and that reliance may be placed only on
the  other  identification  numbers  printed  on the  Debentures,  and any  such
redemption  shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such  numbers.
The  Company  will  promptly  notify the Trustee in writing of any change in the
CUSIP numbers.

      SECTION  2.13.  RANKING.  The  Company's  obligations  in  respect  of the
Debentures  shall rank PARI PASSU with the Company's  obligations  under (i) the
Indenture  dated as of May 15, 2003, in respect of the  Company's  Floating Rate
Junior  Subordinated  Deferrable  Interest  Debentures  due May 15,  2033 issued
thereunder and under the Guarantee Agreement by and between the Company and U.S.
Bank National Association, dated as of May 15, 2003 and (ii) the Indenture dated
as of  September  30, 2003,  in respect of the  Company's  Floating  Rate Junior
Subordinated  Note due  September  30,  2033  issued  thereunder  and  under the
Guarantee  Agreement by and between the Company and JP Morgan Chase Bank,  dated
as of September 30, 2003.

                                  ARTICLE III.
                       PARTICULAR COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY

      SECTION 3.1. PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL,  PREMIUM AND INTEREST; AGREED TREATMENT
                   OF THE DEBENTURES.


      (a) The Company  covenants and agrees that it will duly and punctually pay
or cause to be paid the  principal of and premium,  if any, and interest and any
Additional  Interest and other payments on the  Debentures at the place,  at the
respective  times  and  in  the  manner  provided  in  this  Indenture  and  the
Debentures.  Each  installment  of interest on the Debentures may be paid (i) by
mailing  checks  for  such  interest  payable  to the  order of the  holders  of
Debentures  entitled thereto as they appear on the registry books of the Company
if a request for a wire transfer has not been received by the Company or (ii) by
wire  transfer to any account with a banking  institution  located in the United
States  designated  in writing by such Person to the paying  agent no later than
the related record date. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the holder of
this Debenture is the Institutional Trustee, the payment of the principal of and
interest on this Debenture will be made in immediately  available  funds at such
place and to such account as may be designated by the Institutional Trustee.

      (b) The Company will treat the Debentures as  indebtedness  of the Company
that is in registered  form within the meaning of Treasury  Regulations  Section
1.871-14(c)(1)(i). The Company will further treat the amounts payable in respect
of the  principal  amount of such  Debentures  as interest for all United States
federal income and withholding tax purposes. All interest payments in respect of
such Debentures will be made free and clear of United States  withholding tax to
any beneficial  owner thereof that has provided an Internal Revenue Service Form
W-8BEN (or any substitute or successor form)  establishing its non-United States
status for United States federal income and withholding tax purposes.

      (c) As of the date of this Indenture, the Company has no present intention
to exercise its right under  Section  2.11 to defer  payments of interest on the
Debentures by commencing an Extension Period.

      (d) As of the  date of this  Indenture,  the  Company  believes  that  the
likelihood that it would exercise its right under Section 2.11 to defer payments
of interest on the  Debentures  by  commencing  an Extension  Period at any time
during  which  the  Debentures   are   outstanding  is  remote  because  of  the
restrictions  that would be imposed on the  Company's  ability to declare or pay
dividends  or  distributions  on, or to redeem,  purchase or make a  liquidation
payment  with  respect to, any of its  outstanding  equity and on the  Company's
ability to make any payments of principal  of or interest on, or  repurchase  or
redeem, any of its debt securities that rank PARI PASSU in all respects with (or
junior in interest to) the Debentures.

      SECTION 3.2. OFFICES FOR NOTICES AND PAYMENTS,  ETC. So long as any of the
Debentures  remain  outstanding,   the  Company  will  maintain  in  Wilmington,
Delaware, an office or agency where the Debentures may be presented for payment,
an office or agency where the  Debentures may be presented for  registration  of
transfer and for exchange as in this Indenture  provided and an office or agency
where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Debentures or
of this  Indenture may be served.  The Company will give to the Trustee  written
notice  of the  location  of any such  office  or  agency  and of any  change of
location thereof. Until otherwise designated from time to time by the Company in
a notice to the  Trustee,  or  specified as  contemplated  by Section 2.5,  such
office or agency for all of the above  purposes shall be the office or agency of
the  Trustee.  In case the  Company  shall fail to  maintain  any such office or
agency  in  Wilmington,  Delaware,  or shall  fail to give  such  notice  of the
location or of any change in the location thereof, presentations and demands may
be made and notices may be served at the Principal Office of the Trustee.

                                       19

         In addition to any such office or agency,  the Company may from time to
time  designate one or more offices or agencies  outside  Wilmington,  Delaware,
where the  Debentures  may be  presented  for  registration  of transfer and for
exchange in the manner provided in this Indenture, and the Company may from time
to  time  rescind  such  designation,  as the  Company  may  deem  desirable  or
expedient;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no such designation or rescission shall in
any manner  relieve the Company of its obligation to maintain any such office or
agency in Wilmington,  Delaware,  for the purposes above mentioned.  The Company
will  give to the  Trustee  prompt  written  notice of any such  designation  or
rescission thereof.

      SECTION 3.3.  APPOINTMENTS  TO FILL  VACANCIES IN  TRUSTEE'S  OFFICE.  The
Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of Trustee,
will appoint,  in the manner  provided in Section 6.9, a Trustee,  so that there
shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder.

      SECTION 3.4. PROVISION AS TO PAYING AGENT.

            (a) If the  Company  shall  appoint a paying  agent  other  than the
Trustee,  it will cause such paying  agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee
an instrument  in which such agent shall agree with the Trustee,  subject to the
provision of this Section 3.4,

            (1)  that it will  hold all sums  held by it as such  agent  for the
            payment of the  principal  of and premium,  if any, or interest,  if
            any, on the  Debentures  (whether  such sums have been paid to it by
            the Company or by any other obligor on the  Debentures) in trust for
            the benefit of the holders of the Debentures;

            (2) that it will  give the  Trustee  prompt  written  notice  of any
            failure by the Company (or by any other  obligor on the  Debentures)
            to make any  payment of the  principal  of and  premium,  if any, or
            interest,  if any, on the Debentures  when the same shall be due and
            payable; and

            (3) that it will, at any time during the continuance of any Event of
            Default,  upon the written request of the Trustee,  forthwith pay to
            the Trustee all sums so held in trust by such paying agent.

            (b) If the Company shall act as its own paying agent, it will, on or
before each due date of the  principal  of and  premium,  if any, or interest or
other  payments,  if any, on the  Debentures,  set aside,  segregate and hold in
trust for the benefit of the holders of the  Debentures a sum  sufficient to pay
such  principal,  premium,  interest or other  payments so becoming due and will
notify the  Trustee in  writing  of any  failure to take such  action and of any
failure by the Company (or by any other  obligor under the  Debentures)  to make
any  payment of the  principal  of and  premium,  if any,  or  interest or other
payments, if any, on the Debentures when the same shall become due and payable.



                                       20
<PAGE>

            Whenever  the Company  shall have one or more paying  agents for the
Debentures,  it will,  on or prior  to each  due  date of the  principal  of and
premium, if any, or interest,  if any, on the Debentures,  deposit with a paying
agent a sum sufficient to pay the principal, premium, interest or other payments
so  becoming  due,  such sum to be held in trust for the  benefit of the Persons
entitled thereto and (unless such paying agent is the Trustee) the Company shall
promptly notify the Trustee in writing of its action or failure to act.

            (c) Anything in this  Section 3.4 to the  contrary  notwithstanding,
the Company may, at any time,  for the purpose of obtaining a  satisfaction  and
discharge  with  respect to the  Debentures,  or for any other  reason,  pay, or
direct  any  paying  agent to pay to the  Trustee  all sums held in trust by the
Company or any such paying  agent,  such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the
trusts herein contained.

            (d) Anything in this  Section 3.4 to the  contrary  notwithstanding,
the  agreement  to hold sums in trust as provided in this Section 3.4 is subject
to Sections 12.3 and 12.4.

      SECTION  3.5.  CERTIFICATE  TO TRUSTEE.  The Company  will  deliver to the
Trustee  on or before  120 days after the end of each  fiscal  year,  so long as
Debentures are outstanding  hereunder,  a Certificate stating that in the course
of the  performance  by the  signers of their  duties as officers of the Company
they would normally have knowledge of any Default during such fiscal year by the
Company in the performance of any covenants contained herein, stating whether or
not they have  knowledge of any such Default  and, if so,  specifying  each such
Default of which the signers have knowledge and the nature and status thereof.

      SECTION 3.6. ADDITIONAL SUMS. If and for so long as the Trust or a trustee
of the Trust is the holder of all  Debentures  and the Trust is  required to pay
any additional taxes (excluding withholding taxes), duties, assessments or other
governmental  charges as a result of a Tax Event, then the Company will pay such
additional amounts ("ADDITIONAL SUMS") on the Debentures as shall be required so
that the net amounts  received and retained by the Trust after paying such taxes
(excluding withholding taxes), duties, assessments or other governmental charges
will be equal to the  amounts  the Trust  would have  received  if no such taxes
(excluding withholding taxes), duties, assessments or other governmental charges
had been  imposed.  Whenever  in this  Indenture  or the  Debentures  there is a
reference  in any  context to the  payment of  principal  of or  interest on the
Debentures,  such mention shall be deemed to include  mention of payments of the
Additional  Sums  provided for in this  paragraph  to the extent  that,  in such
context,  Additional  Sums are,  were or would be  payable  in  respect  thereof
pursuant to the provisions of this paragraph and express  mention of the payment
of  Additional  Sums (if  applicable)  in any  provisions  hereof  shall  not be
construed as excluding  Additional  Sums in those  provisions  hereof where such
express mention is not made; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the deferral of the payment
of interest during an Extension  Period pursuant to Section 2.11 shall not defer
the payment of any Additional Sums that may be due and payable.

      SECTION 3.7.  COMPLIANCE WITH CONSOLIDATION  PROVISIONS.  The Company will
not, while any of the Debentures remain outstanding,  consolidate with, or merge
into, or merge into itself,  or sell or convey all or  substantially  all of its
property  to any other  Person  unless the  provisions  of Article XI hereof are
complied with.

      SECTION 3.8.  LIMITATION ON DIVIDENDS.  If Debentures are initially issued
to the Trust or a trustee of such Trust in connection with the issuance of Trust
Securities by the Trust (regardless of whether Debentures continue to be held by
such  Trust) and (i) there shall have  occurred  and be  continuing  an Event of
Default, (ii) the Company shall be in default with respect to its payment of any
obligations under the Capital Securities  Guarantee,  or (iii) the Company shall
have  given  notice  of its  election  to  defer  payments  of  interest  on the
Debentures by extending the interest  payment period as provided herein and such
period, or any extension  thereof,  shall be continuing,  then the Company shall
not, and shall not permit any Affiliate of the Company controlled by the Company
to, (x) declare or pay any dividends or distributions  on, or redeem,  purchase,
acquire,  or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's or
such   Affiliates'   capital   stock  (other  than   payments  of  dividends  or
distributions  to the  Company  or a  Subsidiary  of the  Company)  or make  any
guarantee  payments  with  respect to the  foregoing  or (y) make any payment of
principal of or interest or premium,  if any, on or repay,  repurchase or redeem
any debt securities of the Company or any Affiliate of the Company controlled by

repurchases, redemptions or other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the
Company or any  Subsidiary  of the  Company in  connection  with any  employment
contract,  benefit plan or other similar  arrangement with or for the benefit of
one or more employees,  officers, directors or consultants, in connection with a
dividend  reinvestment or stockholder  stock purchase plan or in connection with
the  issuance  of  capital  stock  of the  Company  or of  such  Subsidiary  (or
securities   convertible   into  or  exercisable  for  such  capital  stock)  as
consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable
Extension Period,  (2) as a result of any exchange or conversion of any class or
series of the  Company's  capital stock (or any capital stock of a Subsidiary of
the Company) for any class or series of the  Company's  capital stock (or in the
case of a Subsidiary  of the Company,  any class or series of such  Subsidiary's
capital stock) or of any class or series of the Company's  indebtedness  for any
class or series of the Company's capital stock(or in the case of indebtedness of
a  Subsidiary  of the  Company,  of any  class or  series  of such  Subsidiary's
indebtedness for any class or series of such  Subsidiary's  capital stock),  (3)
the purchase of fractional  interests in shares of the  Company's  capital stock
(or the capital stock of a Subsidiary of the Company) pursuant to the conversion
or exchange  provisions of such capital stock or the security being converted or
exchanged,   (4)  any   declaration  of  a  dividend  in  connection   with  any

pursuant thereto,  (5) any dividend in the form of stock,  warrants,  options or
other rights where the dividend  stock or the stock  issuable  upon  exercise of
such  warrants,  options or other  rights is the same stock as that on which the
dividend  is being paid or ranks PARI PASSU with or junior to such stock and any
cash payments in lieu of fractional  shares issued in connection  therewith,  or
(6) payments under the Capital Securities Guarantee).

      SECTION  3.9.  COVENANTS  AS TO THE  TRUST.  For  so  long  as  the  Trust
Securities remain outstanding,  the Company shall maintain 100% ownership of the
Common  Securities;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that any  permitted  successor  of the
Company  under this  Indenture  may succeed to the  Company's  ownership of such
Common Securities. The Company, as owner of the Common Securities, shall, except
in  connection  with a  distribution  of  Debentures  to the  holders  of  Trust
Securities  in  liquidation  of the Trust,  the  redemption  of all of the Trust
Securities  or  certain  mergers,  consolidations  or  amalgamations,   each  as
permitted by the  Declaration,  cause the Trust (a) to remain a statutory trust,
(b) to otherwise  continue to be classified as a grantor trust for United States

      SECTION 3.10.  ADDITIONAL JUNIOR INDEBTEDNESS.  The Company shall not, and
it shall not cause or permit any  Subsidiary of the Company to, incur,  issue or
be  obligated  on  any  Additional  Junior  Indebtedness,   either  directly  or

Junior  Indebtedness that, by its terms, is expressly stated to be either junior
and subordinate or PARI PASSU in all respects to the Debentures.

                                  ARTICLE IV.
                        SECURITYHOLDERS LISTS AND REPORTS
                         BY THE COMPANY AND THE TRUSTEE

      SECTION 4.1.  SECURITYHOLDERS LISTS. The Company covenants and agrees that
it will furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee:

            (a) on each regular record date for the Debentures,  a list, in such
form as the Trustee may  reasonably  require,  of the names and addresses of the
Securityholders of the Debentures as of such record date; and

            (b) at such other  times as the  Trustee  may  request  in  writing,
within 30 days after the receipt by the Company of any such  request,  a list of
similar  form and  content  as of a date not more than 15 days prior to the time
such list is furnished;

except that no such lists need be  furnished  under this  Section 4.1 so long as
the  Trustee  is in  possession  thereof  by reason of its  acting as  Debenture
registrar.

      SECTION 4.2. PRESERVATION AND DISCLOSURE OF LISTS.

            (a)  The  Trustee  shall  preserve,  in  as  current  a  form  as is
reasonably  practicable,  all  information  as to the names and addresses of the
holders of Debentures  (1) contained in the most recent list  furnished to it as
provided in Section  4.1 or (2)  received  by it in the  capacity of  Debentures
registrar (if so acting)  hereunder.  The Trustee may destroy any list furnished
to it as provided in Section 4.1 upon receipt of a new list so furnished.

            (b) In  case  three  or  more  holders  of  Debentures  (hereinafter
referred to as "applicants")  apply in writing to the Trustee and furnish to the
Trustee  reasonable  proof that each such  applicant has owned a Debenture for a
period of at least 6 months  preceding  the date of such  application,  and such
application  states that the applicants desire to communicate with other holders
of  Debentures  with respect to their rights under this  Indenture or under such
Debentures  and is  accompanied  by a  copy  of  the  form  of  proxy  or  other
communication which such applicants propose to transmit,  then the Trustee shall
within 5 Business Days after the receipt of such  application,  at its election,
either:

                                       23
<PAGE>

                  (1) afford such applicants access to the information preserved
                  at the time by the Trustee in accordance  with the  provisions
                  of subsection (a) of this Section 4.2, or

                  (2) inform such  applicants  as to the  approximate  number of
                  holders of Debentures  whose names and addresses appear in the
                  information preserved at the time by the Trustee in accordance
                  with the provisions of subsection (a) of this Section 4.2, and
                  as to the approximate cost of mailing to such  Securityholders
                  the form of proxy or other communication, if any, specified in
                  such application.

      If the Trustee  shall elect not to afford such  applicants  access to such
information,  the Trustee shall,  upon the written  request of such  applicants,
mail to each  Securityholder  whose name and address  appear in the  information
preserved  at the time by the  Trustee  in  accordance  with the  provisions  of
subsection  (a) of  this  Section  4.2 a copy  of the  form of  proxy  or  other
communication  which is specified in such  request  with  reasonable  promptness
after a tender to the Trustee of the  material  to be mailed and of payment,  or
provision for the payment, of the reasonable expenses of mailing,  unless within
five days after such tender,  the Trustee shall mail to such applicants and file
with the  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission,  if  permitted  or  required by
applicable  law,  together  with a copy of the material to be mailed,  a written
statement to the effect that, in the opinion of the Trustee,  such mailing would
be contrary to the best interests of the holders of all Debentures,  as the case
may be, or would be in violation of applicable law. Such written statement shall
specify the basis of such opinion. If said Commission,  as permitted or required
by applicable law, after opportunity for a hearing upon the objections specified
in the written statement so filed,  shall enter an order refusing to sustain any
of such objections or if, after the entry of an order  sustaining one or more of
such  objections,  said Commission  shall find, after notice and opportunity for
hearing,  that all the  objections so sustained have been met and shall enter an
order so  declaring,  the Trustee shall mail copies of such material to all such
Securityholders with reasonable promptness after the entry of such order and the
renewal  of  such  tender;  otherwise  the  Trustee  shall  be  relieved  of any
obligation or duty to such applicants respecting their application.

            (c) Each and every holder of  Debentures,  by receiving  and holding
the same,  agrees with  Company and the Trustee that neither the Company nor the
Trustee  nor any  paying  agent  shall  be held  accountable  by  reason  of the
disclosure of any such  information as to the names and addresses of the holders
of  Debentures  in accordance  with the  provisions  of  subsection  (b) of this
Section 4.2,  regardless of the source from which such  information was derived,
and that the  Trustee  shall not be held  accountable  by reason of mailing  any
material pursuant to a request made under said subsection (b).

                   REMEDIES OF THE TRUSTEE AND SECURITYHOLDERS
                            UPON AN EVENT OF DEFAULT

      SECTION 5.1. EVENTS OF DEFAULT.  "Event of Default," wherever used herein,
means any one of the  following  events  (whatever  the reason for such Event of
Default  and  whether it shall be  voluntary  or  involuntary  or be effected by
operation  of law or pursuant to any  judgment,  decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

            (a) the Company  defaults in the  payment of any  interest  upon any
Debenture when it becomes due and payable,  and fails to cure such default for a
period of 30 days;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that a valid  extension  of an interest
payment  period by the Company in  accordance  with the terms of this  Indenture
shall not constitute a default in the payment of interest for this purpose; or

            (b) the  Company  defaults  in the payment of all or any part of the
principal of (or premium,  if any, on) any Debentures as and when the same shall
become due and payable either at maturity,  upon  redemption,  by declaration of
acceleration or otherwise; or

            (c) the Company defaults in the performance of, or breaches,  any of
its covenants or agreements in this  Indenture or in the terms of the Debentures
established  as  contemplated  in  this  Indenture  (other  than a  covenant  or
agreement a default in whose  performance  or whose  breach is elsewhere in this
Section  specifically dealt with), and continuance of such default or breach for
a period of 60 days after there has been given, by registered or certified mail,
to the  Company by the  Trustee or to the Company and the Trustee by the holders
of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the outstanding  Debentures,  a
written notice specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied
and stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder; or

            (d) a court of competent  jurisdiction shall enter a decree or order
for relief in respect of the Company in an involuntary case under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, or shall appoint a receiver,  liquidator,  assignee, custodian, trustee,
sequestrator (or similar official) of the Company or for any substantial part of
its property,  or shall order the  winding-up or  liquidation of its affairs and
such  decree or order  shall  remain  unstayed  and in effect for a period of 90
consecutive days; or

            (e) the Company shall commence a voluntary case under any applicable
bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization or other similar law now or hereafter in
effect, shall consent to the entry of an order for relief in an involuntary case
under any such law, or shall consent to the appointment of or taking  possession
by a receiver, liquidator, assignee, trustee, custodian,  sequestrator (or other
similar official) of the Company or of any substantial part of its property,  or
shall make any general  assignment  for the benefit of creditors,  or shall fail
generally to pay its debts as they become due; or

            (f) the Trust shall have  voluntarily or  involuntarily  liquidated,
dissolved, wound-up its business or otherwise terminated its existence except in
connection  with (i) the  distribution of the Debentures to holders of the Trust
Securities in liquidation of their  interests in the Trust,  (ii) the redemption
of  all  of  the  outstanding   Trust   Securities  or  (iii)  certain  mergers,
consolidations or amalgamations, each as permitted by the Declaration.

                                       25
<PAGE>

      If an Event of  Default  occurs  and is  continuing  with  respect  to the
Debentures,  then, and in each and every such case,  unless the principal of the
Debentures shall have already become due and payable,  either the Trustee or the
holders of not less than 25% in  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures
then  outstanding  hereunder,  by notice in writing to the  Company  (and to the
Trustee if given by  Securityholders),  may declare the entire  principal of the
Debentures  and the  interest  accrued  thereon,  if any,  to be due and payable
immediately, and upon any such declaration the same shall become immediately due
and payable.

      The foregoing  provisions,  however, are subject to the condition that if,
at any time after the  principal of the  Debentures  shall have been so declared
due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for the payment of the moneys
due shall have been obtained or entered as hereinafter provided, (i) the Company
shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee a sum  sufficient to pay all matured
installments  of  interest  upon all the  Debentures  and the  principal  of and
premium, if any, on the Debentures which shall have become due otherwise than by
acceleration  (with  interest  upon such  principal  and  premium,  if any,  and
Additional  Interest) and such amount as shall be sufficient to cover reasonable
compensation  of the  Trustee and each  predecessor  Trustee,  their  respective
agents, attorneys and counsel, and all other amounts due to the Trustee pursuant
to Section  6.6, if any,  and (ii) all Events of Default  under this  Indenture,
other than the  non-payment  of the  principal  of or  premium,  if any,  on the
Debentures which shall have become due by  acceleration,  shall have been cured,
waived or otherwise  remedied as provided  herein -- then and in every such case
the holders of a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of the Debentures then
outstanding,  by written notice to the Company and to the Trustee, may waive all
defaults and rescind and annul such  declaration  and its  consequences,  but no
such waiver or  rescission  and  annulment  shall  extend to or shall affect any
subsequent default or shall impair any right consequent thereon.

      In case the Trustee  shall have  proceeded to enforce any right under this
Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because
of such  rescission  or  annulment  or for any other  reason or shall  have been
determined  adversely to the  Trustee,  then and in every such case the Company,
the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures shall be restored  respectively to
their  several  positions  and rights  hereunder,  and all rights,  remedies and
powers of the  Company,  the  Trustee and the  holders of the  Debentures  shall
continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.

      SECTION 5.2. PAYMENT OF DEBENTURES ON DEFAULT; SUIT THEREFOR.  The Company
covenants that upon the occurrence  and during the  continuation  of an Event of
Default  pursuant to Section 5.1(a) or Section  5.1(b) then,  upon demand of the
Trustee,  the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of
the  Debentures  the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on
all Debentures for principal and premium,  if any, or interest,  or both, as the
case may be, with Additional  Interest  accrued on the Debentures (to the extent
that payment of such interest is  enforceable  under  applicable law and, if the
Debentures are held by the Trust or a trustee of such Trust, without duplication
of any other  amounts  paid by the Trust or a  trustee  of the Trust in  respect
thereof);  and, in addition thereto,  such further amount as shall be sufficient
to  cover  the  costs  and  expenses  of  collection,   including  a  reasonable
compensation to the Trustee,  its agents,  attorneys and counsel,  and any other
amounts due to the Trustee  under  Section  6.6. In case the Company  shall fail
forthwith to pay such amounts upon such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and
as trustee of an express trust, shall be entitled and empowered to institute any
actions or proceedings at law or in equity for the collection of the sums so due
and unpaid, and may prosecute any such action or proceeding to judgment or final
decree, and may enforce any such judgment or final decree against the Company or
any other obligor on such  Debentures and collect in the manner  provided by law
out of the  property  of the  Company or any other  obligor  on such  Debentures
wherever situated the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable.

                                       26
<PAGE>

      In case there shall be pending  proceedings  for the bankruptcy or for the
reorganization  of the  Company  or any other  obligor on the  Debentures  under
Bankruptcy  Law, or in case a receiver or trustee shall have been  appointed for
the property of the Company or such other  obligor,  or in the case of any other
similar judicial  proceedings  relative to the Company or other obligor upon the
Debentures,  or to the  creditors  or  property  of the  Company  or such  other
obligor,  the Trustee,  irrespective  of whether the principal of the Debentures
shall  then be due  and  payable  as  therein  expressed  or by  declaration  of
acceleration  or otherwise  and  irrespective  of whether the Trustee shall have
made any  demand  pursuant  to the  provisions  of this  Section  5.2,  shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or otherwise,

            (a)   to file and  prove a claim or claims  for the whole  amount of
                  principal  and  interest  owing and  unpaid in  respect of the
                  Debentures,

            (b)   in case of any judicial  proceedings,  (i) to file such proofs
                  of claim and other  papers or documents as may be necessary or
                  advisable   in  order  to  have  the  claims  of  the  Trustee
                  (including  any  claim  for  reasonable  compensation  to  the
                  Trustee and each  predecessor  Trustee,  and their  respective
                  agents,  attorneys and counsel,  and for  reimbursement of all
                  other amounts due to the Trustee  under  Section 6.6),  and of
                  the  Securityholders  allowed  in  such  judicial  proceedings
                  relative  to  the   Company  or  any  other   obligor  on  the
                  Debentures,  or to the creditors or property of the Company or
                  such other  obligor,  unless  prohibited by applicable law and
                  regulations  and (ii) to vote on behalf of the  holders of the
                  Debentures  in any election of a trustee or a standby  trustee
                  in   arrangement,   reorganization,   liquidation   or   other
                  bankruptcy  or  insolvency  proceedings  or Person  performing
                  similar functions in comparable proceedings,

            (c)   to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable or
                  deliverable on any such claims, and

            (d)   to distribute  the same after the deduction of its charges and
                  expenses.

By its acceptance of any Debentures, each Securityholder shall be deemed to have
authorized any receiver,  assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization to
make such  payments to the  Trustee,  and,  in the event that the Trustee  shall
consent to the making of such payments directly to the  Securityholders,  to pay
to the  Trustee  such  amounts  as  shall  be  sufficient  to  cover  reasonable
compensation  to the  Trustee,  each  predecessor  Trustee and their  respective
agents,  attorneys  and counsel,  and all other amounts due to the Trustee under
Section 6.6.

                                       27
<PAGE>

      Nothing  herein  contained  shall be construed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any  Securityholder  any
plan of  reorganization,  arrangement,  adjustment or composition  affecting the
Debentures  or the rights of any holder  thereof or to authorize  the Trustee to
vote in respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.

      All rights of action and of  asserting  claims  under this  Indenture,  or
under  any of the  Debentures,  may be  enforced  by  the  Trustee  without  the
possession of any of the Debentures,  or the production  thereof at any trial or
other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by
the  Trustee  shall be brought  in its own name as trustee of an express  trust,
and,  subject to Section 5.3, any recovery of judgment  shall be for the ratable
benefit of the holders of the Debentures.

      In any  proceedings  brought  by the  Trustee  (and  also any  proceedings
involving the  interpretation  of any  provision of this  Indenture to which the
Trustee  shall be a  party),  the  Trustee  shall be held to  represent  all the
holders of the Debentures,  and it shall not be necessary to make any holders of
the Debentures parties to any such proceedings.

      SECTION  5.3.  APPLICATION  OF MONEYS  COLLECTED  BY  TRUSTEE.  Any moneys
collected  by the  Trustee  pursuant  to this  Article V shall be applied in the
following  order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution
of such moneys,  upon presentation of the several Debentures in respect of which
moneys have been collected,  and stamping thereon the payment, if only partially
paid, and upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

      First:  To the payment of costs and expenses  incurred by, and  reasonable
fees of, the  Trustee,  its  agents,  attorneys  and  counsel,  and of all other
amounts due to the Trustee under Section 6.6;

      Second: To the payment of all Senior Indebtedness of the Company if and to
the extent required by Article XV;

      Third:  To the  payment  of the  amounts  then  due and  unpaid  upon  the
Debentures for principal (and premium,  if any), and interest on the Debentures,
in  respect  of which or for the  benefit  of which  money  has been  collected,
ratably,  without  preference or priority of any kind,  according to the amounts
due on  such  Debentures  for  principal  (and  premium,  if any)  and  interest
(including Additional Interest), respectively; and

      Fourth: The balance, if any, to the Company.

      SECTION 5.4.  PROCEEDINGS BY  SECURITYHOLDERS.  No holder of any Debenture
shall have any right to institute any suit,  action or proceeding for any remedy
hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the Trustee written
notice of an Event of  Default  with  respect to the  Debentures  and unless the
holders of not less than 25% in  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures
then  outstanding  shall have given the Trustee a written  request to  institute
such  action,  suit or  proceeding  and shall have  offered to the Trustee  such
reasonable  indemnity  as  it  may  require  against  the  costs,  expenses  and
liabilities  to be  incurred  thereby,  and the  Trustee  for 60 days  after its
receipt of such  notice,  request  and offer of  indemnity  shall have failed to
institute any such action, suit or proceeding.

                                       28

      Notwithstanding any other provisions in this Indenture, however, the right
of any holder of any Debenture to receive  payment of the principal of, premium,
if any, and interest,  on such  Debenture when due, or to institute suit for the
enforcement of any such payment,  shall not be impaired or affected  without the
consent of such holder and by  accepting a Debenture  hereunder  it is expressly
understood,  intended and covenanted by the taker and holder of every  Debenture
with every  other such  taker and  holder and the  Trustee,  that no one or more
holders of Debentures shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue or
by availing  itself of any  provision of this  Indenture  to affect,  disturb or
prejudice  the rights of the  holders of any other  Debentures,  or to obtain or
seek to obtain  priority  over or  preference  to any other such  holder,  or to
enforce any right under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and
for the equal, ratable and common benefit of all holders of Debentures.  For the
protection and  enforcement  of the  provisions of this Section,  each and every
Securityholder  and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given
either at law or in equity.

      SECTION  5.5.  PROCEEDINGS  BY  TRUSTEE.  In case of an Event  of  Default
hereunder the Trustee may in its  discretion  proceed to protect and enforce the
rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate  judicial  proceedings
as the  Trustee  shall deem most  effectual  to protect  and enforce any of such
rights,  either  by suit in  equity  or by  action  at law or by  proceeding  in
bankruptcy or otherwise, whether for the specific enforcement of any covenant or
agreement  contained  in this  Indenture  or in aid of the exercise of any power
granted in this  Indenture,  or to enforce  any other legal or  equitable  right
vested in the Trustee by this Indenture or by law.

      SECTION 5.6. REMEDIES  CUMULATIVE AND CONTINUING;  DELAY OR OMISSION NOT A
WAIVER.  Except  as  otherwise  provided  in  Section  2.6 with  respect  to the
replacement of mutilated,  destroyed, lost or stolen Debentures,  all powers and
remedies given by this Article V to the Trustee or to the Securityholders shall,
to the extent  permitted by law, be deemed  cumulative  and not exclusive of any
other  powers  and  remedies  available  to the  Trustee  or the  holders of the
Debentures,  by judicial proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or
observance  of the  covenants  and  agreements  contained  in this  Indenture or
otherwise  established with respect to the Debentures,  and no delay or omission
of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the  Debentures to exercise any right,
remedy or power  accruing upon any Event of Default  occurring and continuing as
aforesaid shall impair any such right, remedy or power, or shall be construed to
be a waiver of any such default or an acquiescence  therein; and, subject to the
provisions of Section 5.4,  every power and remedy given by this Article V or by
law to the Trustee or to the Securityholders may be exercised from time to time,
and as often as shall be deemed  expedient,  by the Trustee (in accordance  with
its duties under Section 6.1) or by the Securityholders.

      No delay or omission of the Trustee or any  Securityholder to exercise any
right or remedy  accruing  upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right
or remedy or constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or an acquiescence
therein.  Every right and remedy  given by this Article or by law to the Trustee
or to any Securityholder may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may
be deemed expedient, by the Trustee (in accordance with its duties under Section
6.1 hereof) or by such holder, as the case may be.

      SECTION 5.7.  DIRECTION OF PROCEEDINGS  AND WAIVER OF DEFAULTS BY MAJORITY
OF  SECURITYHOLDERS.  The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of
the Debentures affected (voting as one class) at the time outstanding shall have
the right to direct the time, method, and place of conducting any proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trustee,  or exercising any trust or power conferred
on the Trustee with respect to such Debentures; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (subject
to the provisions of Section 6.1) the Trustee shall have the right to decline to
follow any such  direction  if the Trustee  shall  determine  that the action so
directed  would be unjustly  prejudicial  to the holders not taking part in such
direction or if the Trustee being advised by counsel  determines that the action
or proceeding so directed may not lawfully be taken or if a Responsible  Officer
of the Trustee shall  determine that the action or proceedings so directed would
involve the Trustee in personal liability.

      The holders of a majority in aggregate  principal amount of the Debentures
at the time  outstanding  may on behalf of the holders of all of the  Debentures
waive (or modify any previously  granted waiver of) any past default or Event of
Default,  and its  consequences,  except an Event of Default  (a)  specified  in
Sections 5.1(a) and (b), (b) in respect of covenants or provisions  hereof which
cannot  be  modified  or  amended  without  the  consent  of the  holder of each
Debenture affected, or (c) in respect of the covenants contained in Section 3.9;
PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if the Debentures are held by the Trust or a trustee of
such trust,  such waiver or  modification  to such waiver shall not be effective
until the holders of a majority in  Liquidation  Amount of the Trust  Securities
shall have consented to such waiver or  modification  to such waiver,  PROVIDED,
FURTHER,  that if the  consent of the holder of each  outstanding  Debenture  is
required,  such  waiver  shall not be  effective  until each holder of the Trust
Securities  shall have  consented  to such  waiver.  Upon any such  waiver,  the
default  covered  thereby  shall be deemed to be cured for all  purposes of this
Indenture and the Company,  the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures  shall
be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no
such waiver shall extend to any  subsequent or other default or Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default or Event of Default
hereunder  shall have been waived as permitted by this Section,  said default or
Event of Default shall for all purposes of the  Debentures and this Indenture be
deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing.

      SECTION 5.8. NOTICE OF DEFAULTS.  The Trustee shall,  within 90 days after
the actual  knowledge by a Responsible  Officer of the Trustee of the occurrence
of a default with respect to the Debentures, mail to all Securityholders, as the
names and addresses of such holders appear upon the Debenture  Register,  notice
of all defaults with respect to the Debentures known to the Trustee, unless such
defaults  shall have been  cured  before  the  giving of such  notice  (the term
"defaults"  for the purpose of this Section 5.8 being  hereby  defined to be the
events  specified in clauses (a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 5.1, not
including  periods of grace, if any, provided for therein);  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,
that, except in the case of default in the payment of the principal of, premium,
if any, or interest on any of the Debentures,  the Trustee shall be protected in
withholding  such notice if and so long as a Responsible  Officer of the Trustee
in good faith determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests
of the Securityholders.

      SECTION  5.9.  UNDERTAKING  TO PAY COSTS.  All  parties to this  Indenture
agree,  and each holder of any  Debenture  by his  acceptance  thereof  shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit
for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture,  or in any suit
against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as Trustee, the filing
by any party  litigant in such suit of an  undertaking  to pay the costs of such
suit,  and that  such  court  may in its  discretion  assess  reasonable  costs,
including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in
such  suit,  having  due  regard to the  merits  and good faith of the claims or
defenses made by such party litigant;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the provisions of
this Section 5.9 shall not apply to any suit  instituted by the Trustee,  to any
suit instituted by any Securityholder,  or group of Securityholders,  holding in
the aggregate more than 10% in principal  amount of the Debentures  outstanding,
or to any suit  instituted  by any  Securityholder  for the  enforcement  of the
payment of the  principal of (or premium,  if any) or interest on any  Debenture
against the Company on or after the same shall have become due and payable.

                                  ARTICLE VI.
                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

      SECTION 6.1. DUTIES AND  RESPONSIBILITIES OF TRUSTEE.  With respect to the
holders of Debentures issued hereunder,  the Trustee, prior to the occurrence of
an Event of  Default  with  respect  to the  Debentures  and after the curing or
waiving of all Events of Default  which may have  occurred,  with respect to the
Debentures,  undertakes  to  perform  such  duties  and only such  duties as are
specifically set forth in this Indenture, and no implied covenants shall be read
into this  Indenture  against  the  Trustee.  In case an Event of  Default  with
respect to the Debentures has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the
Trustee  shall  exercise  such of the  rights  and  powers  vested in it by this
Indenture,  and use the same  degree of care and skill in their  exercise,  as a
prudent man would exercise or use under the  circumstances in the conduct of his
own affairs.

      No provision of this  Indenture  shall be construed to relieve the Trustee
from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or
its own willful misconduct, except that:

            (a) prior to the  occurrence  of an Event of Default with respect to
Debentures  and after the curing or  waiving of all Events of Default  which may
have occurred

                  (1) the duties and  obligations of the Trustee with respect to
                  Debentures   shall  be   determined   solely  by  the  express
                  provisions  of this  Indenture,  and the Trustee  shall not be
                  liable  except  for  the   performance   of  such  duties  and
                  obligations with respect to the Debentures as are specifically
                  set  forth in this  Indenture,  and no  implied  covenants  or
                  obligations  shall be read into  this  Indenture  against  the
                  Trustee, and

                  (2) in the  absence  of bad faith on the part of the  Trustee,
                  the  Trustee  may  conclusively  rely,  as to the truth of the
                  statements  and  the  correctness  of the  opinions  expressed
                  therein,  upon any  certificates or opinions  furnished to the
                  Trustee and conforming to the  requirements of this Indenture;
                  but, in the case of any such certificates or opinions which by
                  any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished
                  to the Trustee,  the Trustee  shall be under a duty to examine
                  the  same to  determine  whether  or not they  conform  to the
                  requirements of this Indenture;

                                       31
<PAGE>

            (b) the Trustee  shall not be liable for any error of judgment  made
in good faith by a  Responsible  Officer or Officers of the  Trustee,  unless it
shall be proved that the Trustee was  negligent in  ascertaining  the  pertinent
facts; and

            (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken
or omitted to be taken by it in good faith,  in accordance with the direction of
the  Securityholders  pursuant to Section 5.7,  relating to the time, method and
place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy  available to the Trustee,  or
exercising any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture.

      None of the  provisions  contained  in this  Indenture  shall  require the
Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise  incur  personal  financial
liability in the  performance  of any of its duties or in the exercise of any of
its rights or powers,  if there is ground for  believing  that the  repayment of
such funds or liability  is not assured to it under the terms of this  Indenture
or indemnity  satisfactory  to the Trustee  against such risk is not  reasonably
assured to it.

      SECTION 6.2.  RELIANCE ON DOCUMENTS,  OPINIONS,  ETC.  Except as otherwise
provided in Section 6.1:

            (a) the Trustee may  conclusively  rely and shall be fully protected
in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement,
instrument,  opinion,  report,  notice,  request,  consent,  order,  bond, note,
debenture  or other paper or  document  believed by it to be genuine and to have
been signed or presented by the proper party or parties;

            (b) any request, direction, order or demand of the Company mentioned
herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers' Certificate (unless other
evidence in respect thereof be herein  specifically  prescribed);  and any Board
Resolution  may be evidenced  to the Trustee by a copy thereof  certified by the
Secretary or an Assistant Secretary of the Company;

            (c) the Trustee may consult  with counsel of its  selection  and any
advice or  Opinion  of  Counsel  shall be full and  complete  authorization  and
protection in respect of any action  taken,  suffered or omitted by it hereunder
in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

            (d) the Trustee  shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
rights  or  powers  vested  in it by this  Indenture  at the  request,  order or
direction  of any of the  Securityholders,  pursuant to the  provisions  of this
Indenture,  unless  such  Securityholders  shall  have  offered  to the  Trustee
reasonable  security or indemnity  against the costs,  expenses and  liabilities
which may be incurred therein or thereby;

            (e) the Trustee  shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
by it in good faith and believed by it to be authorized or within the discretion
or rights or  powers  conferred  upon it by this  Indenture;  nothing  contained
herein  shall,  however,  relieve  the  Trustee  of  the  obligation,  upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default with respect to the  Debentures  (that has not
been cured or waived) to exercise with respect to Debentures  such of the rights
and powers  vested in it by this  Indenture,  and to use the same degree of care
and skill in their  exercise,  as a prudent man would  exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his own affairs;

                                       32
<PAGE>

            (f) the Trustee  shall not be bound to make any  investigation  into
the  facts  or  matters  stated  in  any  resolution,   certificate,  statement,
instrument,  opinion,  report, notice, request,  consent, order, approval, bond,
debenture,  coupon or other paper or document, unless requested in writing to do
so by the holders of not less than a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of
the outstanding  Debentures  affected thereby;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that if the
payment  within a  reasonable  time to the  Trustee  of the costs,  expenses  or
liabilities  likely to be incurred by it in the making of such investigation is,
in the  opinion of the  Trustee,  not  reasonably  assured to the Trustee by the
security afforded to it by the terms of this Indenture,  the Trustee may require
reasonable  indemnity  against  such  expense or  liability as a condition to so
proceeding;

            (g) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers hereunder or
perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents  (including
any Authenticating Agent) or attorneys, and the Trustee shall not be responsible
for any  misconduct  or  negligence  on the part of any such  agent or  attorney
appointed by it with due care; and

            (h) with the exceptions of defaults under Sections 5.1(a) or 5.1(b),
the  Trustee  shall not be charged  with  knowledge  of any  Default or Event of
Default with respect to the  Debentures  unless a written notice of such Default
or Event of Default  shall have been given to the  Trustee by the Company or any
other obligor on the Debentures or by any holder of the Debentures.

      SECTION 6.3. NO RESPONSIBILITY  FOR RECITALS,  ETC. The recitals contained
herein and in the Debentures (except in the certificate of authentication of the
Trustee or the  Authenticating  Agent) shall be taken as the  statements  of the
Company,  and the Trustee and the Authenticating  Agent assume no responsibility
for the correctness of the same. The Trustee and the  Authenticating  Agent make
no representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the
Debentures.  The Trustee and the  Authenticating  Agent shall not be accountable
for the use or  application  by the Company of any Debentures or the proceeds of
any Debentures  authenticated and delivered by the Trustee or the Authenticating
Agent in conformity with the provisions of this Indenture.

      SECTION 6.4. TRUSTEE, AUTHENTICATING AGENT, PAYING AGENTS, TRANSFER AGENTS
OR REGISTRAR MAY OWN DEBENTURES.  The Trustee or any Authenticating Agent or any
paying agent or any transfer agent or any Debenture registrar, in its individual
or any other  capacity,  may become the owner or pledgee of Debentures  with the
same rights it would have if it were not Trustee,  Authenticating  Agent, paying
agent, transfer agent or Debenture registrar.

      SECTION  6.5.  MONEYS TO BE HELD IN TRUST.  Subject to the  provisions  of
Section  12.4,  all moneys  received by the Trustee or any paying  agent  shall,
until used or applied as herein  provided,  be held in trust for the purpose for
which they were received,  but need not be segregated from other funds except to
the extent  required by law.  The Trustee and any paying agent shall be under no
liability for interest on any money received by it hereunder except as otherwise
agreed in writing  with the Company.  So long as no Event of Default  shall have
occurred and be  continuing,  all  interest  allowed on any such moneys shall be
paid from time to time to the  Company  upon the written  order of the  Company,
signed by the Chief Executive  Officer,  the President,  a Vice  President,  the
Treasurer or an Assistant Treasurer of the Company.

      SECTION 6.6.  COMPENSATION AND EXPENSES OF TRUSTEE.  The Company covenants
and agrees to pay to the Trustee  from time to time,  and the  Trustee  shall be
entitled  to,  such  compensation  as shall be agreed to in writing  between the
Company and the Trustee  (which shall not be limited by any  provision of law in
regard to the  compensation of a trustee of an express  trust),  and the Company
will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable  expenses,
disbursements  and advances  incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance  with
any of the provisions of this Indenture  (including the reasonable  compensation
and the  expenses  and  disbursements  of its  counsel  and of all  Persons  not
regularly in its employ) except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may
arise from its negligence or willful  misconduct.  The Company also covenants to
indemnify the Trustee and any  predecessor  Trustee (and its  officers,  agents,
directors and employees) for, and to hold it harmless against, any and all loss,
damage, action, suit, claim,  liability,  cost or expense including taxes (other
than taxes based on the income of the Trustee)  incurred  without  negligence or
willful  misconduct  on  the  part  of  the  Trustee  and  arising  out of or in
connection with the acceptance or  administration  of this trust,  including the
costs and  expenses of  defending  itself  against any claim of  liability.  The
obligations  of the Company under this Section 6.6 to  compensate  and indemnify
the Trustee and to pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses,  disbursements and
advances shall constitute  additional  indebtedness  hereunder.  Such additional
indebtedness shall be secured by a lien prior to that of the Debentures upon all
property and funds held or  collected by the Trustee as such,  except funds held
in trust for the benefit of the holders of particular Debentures.

      Without  prejudice  to any other  rights  available  to the Trustee  under
applicable  law,  when the  Trustee  incurs  expenses  or  renders  services  in
connection with an Event of Default specified in Section 5.1(d),  Section 5.1(e)
or Section 5.1(f),  the expenses  (including the reasonable charges and expenses
of its counsel) and the compensation for the services are intended to constitute
expenses of  administration  under any applicable  federal or state  bankruptcy,
insolvency or other similar law.

      The provisions of this Section shall survive the resignation or removal of
the Trustee and the defeasance or other termination of this Indenture.

      Notwithstanding  anything  in  this  Indenture  or  any  Debenture  to the
contrary,  the Trustee shall have no  obligation  whatsoever to advance funds to
pay any  principal  of or  interest  on or other  amounts  with  respect  to the
Debentures or otherwise advance funds to or on behalf of the Company.

      SECTION  6.7.  OFFICERS'  CERTIFICATE  AS  EVIDENCE.  Except as  otherwise
provided  in  Sections  6.1  and  6.2,  whenever  in the  administration  of the
provisions  of this  Indenture  the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable
that a matter be proved or  established  prior to taking or omitting  any action
hereunder,  such matter  (unless  other  evidence  in respect  thereof be herein
specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of negligence or willful misconduct
on the part of the Trustee,  be deemed to be conclusively proved and established
by an Officers' Certificate  delivered to the Trustee, and such certificate,  in
the absence of  negligence  or willful  misconduct  on the part of the  Trustee,
shall be full warrant to the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it under
the provisions of this Indenture upon the faith thereof.

      SECTION 6.8.  ELIGIBILITY OF TRUSTEE.  The Trustee  hereunder shall at all
times be a banking  corporation  or  national  association  organized  and doing
business  under  the  laws of the  United  States  of  America  or any  state or
territory  thereof or of the District of Columbia  authorized under such laws to
exercise  corporate  trust  powers,  having  (or whose  obligations  under  this
Indenture are guaranteed by an affiliate  having) a combined capital and surplus
of  at  least  fifty  million  U.S.  dollars  ($50,000,000.00)  and  subject  to
supervision  or  examination  by  federal,  state,  territorial,  or District of
Columbia  authority.  If such  corporation  or  national  association  publishes
reports of condition at least annually,  pursuant to law or to the  requirements
of the aforesaid  supervising or examining  authority,  then for the purposes of
this  Section  6.8 the  combined  capital  and  surplus of such  corporation  or
national  association  shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent records of condition so published.

      The  Company  may  not,  nor  may  any  Person   directly  or   indirectly
controlling,  controlled by, or under common control with the Company,  serve as
Trustee.

      In case at any time the Trustee  shall cease to be eligible in  accordance
with the provisions of this Section 6.8, the Trustee shall resign immediately in
the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.9.

      If the Trustee has or shall acquire any "conflicting  interest" within the
meaning of  ss.310(b)  of the Trust  Indenture  Act of 1939,  the Trustee  shall
either  eliminate  such  interest  or  resign,  to the  extent and in the manner
described by this Indenture.

      SECTION 6.9. RESIGNATION OR REMOVAL OF TRUSTEE.

            (a) The Trustee, or any trustee or trustees hereafter appointed, may
at any time resign by giving written  notice of such  resignation to the Company
and by mailing notice thereof,  at the Company's expense,  to the holders of the
Debentures at their  addresses as they shall appear on the  Debenture  Register.
Upon receiving such notice of resignation,  the Company shall promptly appoint a
successor trustee or trustees by written instrument,  in duplicate,  executed by
order of its Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered
to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee.  If no successor
Trustee  shall have been so appointed and have  accepted  appointment  within 30
days  after  the  mailing  of  such  notice  of   resignation  to  the  affected
Securityholders,  the  resigning  Trustee may  petition  any court of  competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor  Trustee,  or any Securityholder
who has been a bona fide holder of a Debenture  or  Debentures  for at least six
months may,  subject to the  provisions of Section 5.9, on behalf of himself and
all others similarly situated,  petition any such court for the appointment of a
successor  Trustee.  Such court may thereupon,  after such notice, if any, as it
may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor Trustee.

                                       35
<PAGE>

            (b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur --

                  (1) the Trustee  shall fail to comply with the  provisions  of
                  Section 6.8 after written  request  therefor by the Company or
                  by any  Securityholder  who has been a bona  fide  holder of a
                  Debenture or Debentures for at least 6 months, or

                  (2) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance  with
                  the  provisions  of Section 6.8 and shall fail to resign after
                  written  request  therefor  by  the  Company  or by  any  such
                  Securityholder, or

                  (3) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting,  or shall be
                  adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee
                  or of its property  shall be appointed,  or any public officer
                  shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property
                  or affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation,  conservation or
                  liquidation,

                  then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee and
                  appoint  a  successor  Trustee  by  written   instrument,   in
                  duplicate,  executed by order of the Board of  Directors,  one
                  copy of which  instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so
                  removed and one copy to the successor Trustee,  or, subject to
                  the provisions of Section 5.9, any Securityholder who has been
                  a bona fide holder of a Debenture or Debentures for at least 6
                  months  may,  on behalf of himself  and all  others  similarly
                  situated, petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
                  removal of the  Trustee  and the  appointment  of a  successor
                  Trustee. Such court may thereupon,  after such notice, if any,
                  as it may deem  proper and  prescribe,  remove the Trustee and
                  appoint a successor Trustee.

            (c) Upon prior  written  notice to the Company and the Trustee,  the
holders of a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures  at the
time  outstanding  may at any time remove the  Trustee and  nominate a successor
Trustee,  which shall be deemed appointed as successor  Trustee unless within 10
Business Days after such nomination the Company objects thereto,  in which case,
or in the case of a failure by such holders to nominate a successor Trustee, the
Trustee so  removed or any  Securityholder,  upon the terms and  conditions  and
otherwise as in subsection  (a) of this Section 6.9  provided,  may petition any
court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor Trustee.

            (d) Any  resignation or removal of the Trustee and  appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall become
effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as provided in
Section 6.10.

      SECTION 6.10.  ACCEPTANCE  BY SUCCESSOR  TRUSTEE.  Any  successor  Trustee
appointed as provided in Section 6.9 shall execute,  acknowledge  and deliver to
the  Company  and  to its  predecessor  Trustee  an  instrument  accepting  such
appointment hereunder,  and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring
Trustee shall become effective and such successor  Trustee,  without any further
act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties
and  obligations  with respect to the Debentures of its  predecessor  hereunder,
with like effect as if originally named as Trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on
the written  request of the  Company or of the  successor  Trustee,  the Trustee
ceasing to act shall,  upon  payment of any amounts  then due it pursuant to the
provisions  of Section 6.6,  execute and deliver an instrument  transferring  to
such  successor  Trustee  all the rights and powers of the Trustee so ceasing to
act and shall duly assign,  transfer and deliver to such  successor  Trustee all
property and money held by such retiring Trustee thereunder. Upon request of any
such  successor  Trustee,  the Company shall execute any and all  instruments in
writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
Trustee  all  such  rights  and  powers.  Any  Trustee  ceasing  to  act  shall,
nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property or funds held or collected by such
Trustee to secure any amounts then due it pursuant to the  provisions of Section
6.6.

                                       36
<PAGE>

      If a successor Trustee is appointed, the Company, the retiring Trustee and
the successor Trustee shall execute and deliver an indenture supplemental hereto
which shall contain such provisions as shall be deemed necessary or desirable to
confirm that all the rights,  powers,  trusts and duties of the retiring Trustee
with  respect  to the  Debentures  as to which the  predecessor  Trustee  is not
retiring shall continue to be vested in the predecessor  Trustee,  and shall add
to or change any of the  provisions  of this  Indenture as shall be necessary to
provide for or facilitate the administration of the Trust hereunder by more than
one Trustee,  it being  understood  that nothing herein or in such  supplemental
indenture shall constitute such Trustees  co-trustees of the same trust and that
each such Trustee shall be Trustee of a trust or trusts  hereunder  separate and
apart from any trust or trusts hereunder administered by any other such Trustee.

      No successor Trustee shall accept  appointment as provided in this Section
unless at the time of such acceptance  such successor  Trustee shall be eligible
under the provisions of Section 6.8.

      In no event shall a retiring  Trustee be liable for the acts or  omissions
of any successor Trustee hereunder.

      Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor  Trustee as provided in this
Section 6.10,  the Company  shall mail notice of the  succession of such Trustee
hereunder to the holders of Debentures  at their  addresses as they shall appear
on the  Debenture  Register.  If the Company fails to mail such notice within 10
Business Days after the acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee,  the
successor  Trustee  shall  cause such  notice to be mailed at the expense of the
Company.

      SECTION 6.11.  SUCCESSION BY MERGER,  ETC. Any corporation  into which the
Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated,  or any
corporation resulting from any merger,  conversion or consolidation to which the
Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation  succeeding to all or substantially
all of the corporate  trust  business of the Trustee,  shall be the successor of
the  Trustee  hereunder  without  the  execution  or  filing of any paper or any
further  act on the  part  of any of the  parties  hereto;  PROVIDED  that  such
corporation shall be otherwise eligible and qualified under this Article.

      In case at the time such  successor  to the Trustee  shall  succeed to the
trusts  created  by  this  Indenture  any  of the  Debentures  shall  have  been
authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may adopt the
certificate  of  authentication  of any  predecessor  Trustee,  and deliver such
Debentures  so  authenticated;  and in case at that  time any of the  Debentures
shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee may authenticate
such Debentures  either in the name of any predecessor  hereunder or in the name
of the successor Trustee; and in all such cases such certificates shall have the
full force which it is anywhere in the Debentures or in this Indenture  provided
that the  certificate  of the Trustee shall have;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the
right to adopt the certificate of authentication  of any predecessor  Trustee or
authenticate  Debentures in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only
to its successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

      SECTION   6.12.   AUTHENTICATING   AGENTS.   There  may  be  one  or  more
Authenticating  Agents  appointed by the Trustee upon the request of the Company
with  power  to  act  on  its  behalf  and  subject  to  its  direction  in  the
authentication   and  delivery  of  the  Debentures   issued  upon  exchange  or
registration of transfer  thereof as fully to all intents and purposes as though
any such Authenticating  Agent had been expressly authorized to authenticate and
deliver Debentures;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Trustee shall have no liability
to the  Company  for any acts or  omissions  of the  Authenticating  Agent  with
respect  to  the  authentication  and  delivery  of  any  Debentures.  Any  such
Authenticating  Agent shall at all times be a  corporation  organized  and doing
business  under  the laws of the  United  States  or of any  state or  territory
thereof or of the  District  of  Columbia  authorized  under such laws to act as
Authenticating  Agent,  having  a  combined  capital  and  surplus  of at  least
$50,000,000.00  and being  subject to  supervision  or  examination  by federal,
state,  territorial  or  District  of Columbia  authority.  If such  corporation
publishes  reports  of  condition  at  least  annually  pursuant  to  law or the
requirements of such  authority,  then for the purposes of this Section 6.12 the
combined  capital  and  surplus  of such  corporation  shall be deemed to be its
combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of condition
so published.  If at any time an Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible
in accordance with the provisions of this Section,  it shall resign  immediately
in the manner and with the effect herein specified in this Section.

      Any  corporation  into  which  any  Authenticating  Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be  consolidated,  or any  corporation  resulting
from any merger,  consolidation or conversion to which any Authenticating  Agent
shall be a party, or any corporation  succeeding to all or substantially  all of
the corporate trust business of any Authenticating Agent, shall be the successor
of such  Authenticating  Agent  hereunder,  if  such  successor  corporation  is
otherwise  eligible  under this Section 6.12 without the  execution or filing of
any  paper  or any  further  act on the  part  of the  parties  hereto  or  such
Authenticating Agent.

      Any  Authenticating  Agent may at any time resign by giving written notice
of  resignation  to the Trustee and to the Company.  The Trustee may at any time
terminate the agency of any Authenticating  Agent with respect to the Debentures
by giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating  Agent and to the
Company. Upon receiving such a notice of resignation or upon such a termination,
or in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible under
this Section 6.12,  the Trustee may, and upon the request of the Company  shall,
promptly  appoint a successor  Authenticating  Agent eligible under this Section
6.12,  shall give written  notice of such  appointment  to the Company and shall
mail notice of such  appointment  to all holders of  Debentures as the names and
addresses  of such  holders  appear on the  Debenture  Register.  Any  successor
Authenticating  Agent upon acceptance of its appointment  hereunder shall become
vested with all rights,  powers, duties and responsibilities with respect to the
Debentures of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally named
as Authenticating Agent herein.

                                       38
<PAGE>

         The Company agrees to pay to any Authenticating Agent from time to time
reasonable compensation for its services. Any Authenticating Agent shall have no
responsibility  or liability  for any action  taken by it as such in  accordance
with the directions of the Trustee.

                                  ARTICLE VII.
                         CONCERNING THE SECURITYHOLDERS

      SECTION 7.1. ACTION BY  SECURITYHOLDERS.  Whenever in this Indenture it is
provided  that the  holders of a specified  percentage  in  aggregate  principal
amount of the Debentures may take any action (including the making of any demand
or  request,  the giving of any  notice,  consent or waiver or the taking of any
other action) the fact that at the time of taking any such action the holders of
such  specified  percentage  have  joined  therein may be  evidenced  (a) by any
instrument  or any number of  instruments  of  similar  tenor  executed  by such
Securityholders  in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing,  or (b) by
the record of such holders of Debentures  voting in favor thereof at any meeting
of such  Securityholders  duly called and held in accordance with the provisions
of Article VIII, or (c) by a combination of such  instrument or instruments  and
any such  record of such a meeting of such  Securityholders  or (d) by any other
method the Trustee deems satisfactory.

      If the Company shall solicit from the Securityholders any request, demand,
authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or revocation
of the same,  the Company  may,  at its option,  as  evidenced  by an  Officers'
Certificate,  fix  in  advance  a  record  date  for  such  Debentures  for  the
determination  of  Securityholders   entitled  to  give  such  request,  demand,
authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or revocation
of the same, but the Company shall have no obligation to do so. If such a record
date is fixed, such request, demand, authorization,  direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other  action or  revocation  of the same may be given before or after
the record date, but only the Securityholders of record at the close of business
on the record  date shall be deemed to be  Securityholders  for the  purposes of
determining whether  Securityholders of the requisite  proportion of outstanding
Debentures  have  authorized  or agreed or  consented to such  request,  demand,
authorization,  direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action or revocation
of the same, and for that purpose the outstanding  Debentures  shall be computed
as of the record date; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such authorization,  agreement
or consent by such  Securityholders on the record date shall be deemed effective
unless it shall become  effective  pursuant to the  provisions of this Indenture
not later than 6 months after the record date.

      SECTION  7.2.  PROOF  OF  EXECUTION  BY  SECURITYHOLDERS.  Subject  to the
provisions of Section 6.1, 6.2 and 8.5, proof of the execution of any instrument
by a  Securityholder  or his  agent or  proxy  shall  be  sufficient  if made in
accordance  with such  reasonable  rules and regulations as may be prescribed by
the  Trustee or in such  manner as shall be  satisfactory  to the  Trustee.  The
ownership  of  Debentures  shall be proved  by the  Debenture  Register  or by a
certificate of the Debenture registrar.  The Trustee may require such additional
proof of any matter referred to in this Section as it shall deem necessary.

      The record of any  Securityholders  meeting  shall be proved in the manner
provided in Section 8.6.

                                       39
<PAGE>

      SECTION 7.3. WHO ARE DEEMED ABSOLUTE OWNERS.  Prior to due presentment for
registration  of  transfer of any  Debenture,  the  Company,  the  Trustee,  any
Authenticating  Agent,  any paying agent,  any transfer  agent and any Debenture
registrar may deem the Person in whose name such  Debenture  shall be registered
upon the Debenture  Register to be, and may treat him as, the absolute  owner of
such Debenture  (whether or not such Debenture shall be overdue) for the purpose
of receiving payment of or on account of the principal of, premium,  if any, and
interest on such Debenture and for all other  purposes;  and neither the Company
nor the  Trustee  nor any  Authenticating  Agent  nor any  paying  agent nor any
transfer  agent nor any Debenture  registrar  shall be affected by any notice to
the contrary. All such payments so made to any holder for the time being or upon
his  order  shall  be  valid,  and,  to the  extent  of the sum or sums so paid,
effectual to satisfy and discharge  the  liability  for moneys  payable upon any
such Debenture.

      SECTION  7.4.  DEBENTURES  OWNED BY  COMPANY  DEEMED NOT  OUTSTANDING.  In
determining  whether the holders of the requisite  aggregate principal amount of
Debentures  have  concurred  in any  direction,  consent  or waiver  under  this
Indenture, Debentures which are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the
Debentures or by any Person directly or indirectly  controlling or controlled by
or under direct or indirect common control with the Company or any other obligor
on the Debentures  shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the
purpose of any such determination;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that for the purposes of
determining  whether  the  Trustee  shall be  protected  in  relying on any such
direction, consent or waiver, only Debentures which a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee actually knows are so owned shall be so disregarded. Debentures so owned
which have been  pledged in good faith may be  regarded as  outstanding  for the
purposes of this Section 7.4 if the pledgee shall establish to the  satisfaction
of the Trustee the pledgee's  right to vote such Debentures and that the pledgee
is not the Company or any such other  obligor or Person  directly or  indirectly
controlling or controlled by or under direct or indirect common control with the
Company or any such other  obligor.  In the case of a dispute as to such  right,
any  decision  by the  Trustee  taken upon the  advice of counsel  shall be full
protection to the Trustee.

      SECTION 7.5.  REVOCATION OF CONSENTS;  FUTURE HOLDERS  BOUND.  At any time
prior to (but not after) the  evidencing to the Trustee,  as provided in Section
7.1, of the taking of any action by the holders of the  percentage  in aggregate
principal  amount of the  Debentures  specified in this  Indenture in connection
with  such  action,  any  holder  (in cases  where no  record  date has been set
pursuant to Section 7.1) or any holder as of an applicable record date (in cases
where a record date has been set pursuant to Section 7.1) of a Debenture (or any
Debenture  issued in whole or in part in exchange or substitution  therefor) the
serial number of which is shown by the evidence to be included in the Debentures
the holders of which have consented to such action may, by filing written notice
with the  Trustee  at the  Principal  Office of the  Trustee  and upon  proof of
holding as provided in Section 7.2,  revoke such action so far as concerns  such
Debenture  (or  so far as  concerns  the  principal  amount  represented  by any
exchanged or substituted  Debenture).  Except as aforesaid any such action taken
by the holder of any Debenture  shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder
and upon all future holders and owners of such  Debenture,  and of any Debenture
issued in  exchange or  substitution  therefor  or on  registration  of transfer
thereof,  irrespective  of whether or not any notation in regard thereto is made
upon  such  Debenture  or any  Debenture  issued  in  exchange  or  substitution
therefor.

meeting, shall be mailed to holders of Debentures affected at their addresses as

more than 180 days prior to the date fixed for the meeting.

      SECTION 8.3.  CALL OF MEETINGS BY COMPANY OR  SECURITYHOLDERS.  In case at

Securityholders,  by written  request  setting  forth in  reasonable  detail the
action  proposed  to be taken at the  meeting,  and the  Trustee  shall not have
mailed the notice of such meeting  within 20 days after receipt of such request,
then the Company or such  Securityholders  may  determine the time and the place
for such  meeting  and may call such  meeting to take any action  authorized  in
Section 8.1, by mailing notice thereof as provided in Section 8.2.

      SECTION  8.4.  QUALIFICATIONS  FOR  VOTING.  To be entitled to vote at any

      SECTION 8.5.  REGULATIONS.  Notwithstanding  any other  provisions of this
Indenture,  the  Trustee  may make such  reasonable  regulations  as it may deem
advisable for any meeting of Securityholders,  in regard to proof of the holding
of  Debentures  and  of  the  appointment  of  proxies,  and  in  regard  to the
appointment and duties of inspectors of votes, the submission and examination of
proxies,  certificates  and other  evidence of the right to vote, and such other
matters concerning the conduct of the meeting as it shall think fit.

      The  Trustee  shall,  by an  instrument  in  writing,  appoint a temporary
chairman  of the  meeting,  unless the  meeting  shall  have been  called by the
Company or by  Securityholders  as  provided  in Section  8.3, in which case the
Company or the Securityholders calling the meeting, as the case may be, shall in
like manner appoint a temporary  chairman.  A permanent chairman and a permanent
secretary of the meeting shall be elected by majority vote of the meeting.

      Subject to the  provisions  of Section  7.4, at any meeting each holder of
Debentures  with respect to which such  meeting is being held or proxy  therefor
shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000.00  principal amount of Debentures
held or represented  by him;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that no vote shall be cast or
counted at any meeting in respect of any Debenture challenged as not outstanding
and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be not outstanding.  The chairman of
the meeting shall have no right to vote other than by virtue of Debentures  held
by him or instruments in writing as aforesaid duly designating him as the Person
to vote on behalf of other Securityholders.  Any meeting of Securityholders duly
called  pursuant to the  provisions of Section 8.2 or 8.3 may be adjourned  from
time to time by a  majority  of those  present,  whether or not  constituting  a
quorum, and the meeting may be held as so adjourned without further notice.

      SECTION 8.6. VOTING. The vote upon any resolution submitted to any meeting
of holders of Debentures  with respect to which such meeting is being held shall
be by written  ballots  on which  shall be  subscribed  the  signatures  of such
holders or of their representatives by proxy and the serial number or numbers of
the  Debentures  held or  represented  by them.  The  permanent  chairman of the
meeting shall appoint two  inspectors of votes who shall count all votes cast at
the meeting for or against any  resolution  and who shall make and file with the
secretary of the meeting  their  verified  written  reports in triplicate of all
votes cast at the  meeting.  A record in duplicate  of the  proceedings  of each
meeting of Securityholders shall be prepared by the secretary of the meeting and
there shall be attached to said record the original reports of the inspectors of
votes on any vote by ballot taken thereat and  affidavits by one or more Persons
having  knowledge of the facts setting forth a copy of the notice of the meeting
and showing  that said notice was mailed as provided in Section  8.2. The record
shall show the serial  numbers of the  Debentures  voting in favor of or against
any resolution. The record shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the
permanent  chairman and secretary of the meeting and one of the duplicates shall
be  delivered to the Company and the other to the Trustee to be preserved by the
Trustee, the latter to have attached thereto the ballots voted at the meeting.

      Any record so signed and  verified  shall be  conclusive  evidence  of the
matters therein stated.

      SECTION 8.7. QUORUM;  ACTIONS.  The Persons entitled to vote a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding shall constitute a
quorum for a meeting of Securityholders;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that if any action
is to be taken at such  meeting  with  respect  to a consent,  waiver,  request,
demand, notice,  authorization,  direction or other action which may be given by
the  holders of not less than a  specified  percentage  in  aggregate  principal
amount of the Debentures then  outstanding,  the Persons holding or representing
such specified percentage in principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding
will  constitute a quorum.  In the absence of a quorum  within 30 minutes of the
time  appointed  for any such  meeting,  the meeting  shall,  if convened at the
request of Securityholders,  be dissolved.  In any other case the meeting may be
adjourned  for a period of not less than 10 days as  determined by the permanent
chairman of the meeting prior to the adjournment of such meeting. In the absence
of a quorum at any such adjourned meeting, such adjourned meeting may be further
adjourned  for a period of not less than 10 days as  determined by the permanent
chairman of the meeting  prior to the  adjournment  of such  adjourned  meeting.
Notice of the reconvening of any adjourned meeting shall be given as provided in
Section  8.2,  except  that such  notice need be given only once not less than 5
days  prior to the date on which the  meeting  is  scheduled  to be  reconvened.
Notice of the  reconvening  of an adjourned  meeting  shall state  expressly the
percentage,  as provided above,  of the principal  amount of the Debentures then
outstanding which shall constitute a quorum.

      Except as limited by the  provisos in the first  paragraph of Section 9.2,
any resolution  presented to a meeting or adjourned  meeting duly  reconvened at
which a quorum is present as aforesaid may be adopted by the affirmative vote of
the holders of a majority in aggregate  principal  amount of the Debentures then
outstanding;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that, except as limited by the provisos in the
first  paragraph  of Section 9.2,  any  resolution  with respect to any consent,
waiver, request, demand, notice, authorization,  direction or other action which
this Indenture expressly provides may be given by the holders of not less than a
specified  percentage  in  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures  then
outstanding may be adopted at a meeting or an adjourned  meeting duly reconvened
and at which a quorum is present as aforesaid  only by the  affirmative  vote of
the holders of a not less than such specified  percentage in principal amount of
the Debentures then outstanding.

      Any  resolution  passed or  decision  taken at any  meeting  of holders of
Debentures duly held in accordance with this Section shall be binding on all the
Securityholders, whether or not present or represented at the meeting.

                             SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES

      SECTION 9.1.  SUPPLEMENTAL  INDENTURES WITHOUT CONSENT OF SECURITYHOLDERS.
The Company,  when  authorized by a Board  Resolution,  and the Trustee may from
time to time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures  supplemental
hereto,  without  the  consent  of the  Securityholders,  for one or more of the
following purposes:

            (a) to evidence the succession of another Person to the Company,  or
successive  successions,  and the  assumption  by the  successor  Person  of the
covenants,  agreements and  obligations  of the Company,  pursuant to Article XI
hereof;

            (b) to add to the  covenants of the Company such further  covenants,
restrictions  or conditions  for the  protection of the holders of Debentures as
the Board of Directors shall consider to be for the protection of the holders of
such Debentures,  and to make the occurrence, or the occurrence and continuance,
of a default in any of such additional  covenants,  restrictions or conditions a
default or an Event of Default  permitting the  enforcement of all or any of the
several  remedies  provided  in this  Indenture  as herein set forth;  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that in  respect  of any  such  additional  covenant,  restriction  or
condition  such  supplemental  indenture may provide for a particular  period of
grace after default  (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in
the case of other  defaults)  or may provide for an immediate  enforcement  upon
such  default  or may limit the  remedies  available  to the  Trustee  upon such
default;

                                       43
<PAGE>

            (c) to cure any ambiguity or to correct or supplement  any provision
contained  herein or in any  supplemental  indenture  which may be  defective or
inconsistent  with any other provision  contained  herein or in any supplemental
indenture,  or to make such other  provisions  in regard to matters or questions
arising under this Indenture; PROVIDED that any such action shall not materially
adversely affect the interests of the holders of the Debentures;

            (d) to add to,  delete  from,  or revise  the  terms of  Debentures,
including,  without  limitation,  any terms relating to the issuance,  exchange,
registration  or  transfer of  Debentures,  including  to provide  for  transfer
procedures and  restrictions  substantially  similar to those  applicable to the
Capital  Securities as required by Section 2.5 (for purposes of assuring that no
registration  of Debentures is required  under the  Securities  Act);  PROVIDED,
HOWEVER,  that any such action shall not  adversely  affect the interests of the
holders of the Debentures then outstanding (it being understood, for purposes of
this proviso, that transfer restrictions on Debentures  substantially similar to
those  that  were  applicable  to  Capital  Securities  shall  not be  deemed to
materially adversely affect the holders of the Debentures);

            (e) to  evidence  and  provide  for the  acceptance  of  appointment
hereunder by a successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures and to add to or
change any of the  provisions of this Indenture as shall be necessary to provide
for or facilitate the  administration  of the trusts  hereunder by more than one
Trustee;

            (f) to make any change  (other  than as  elsewhere  provided in this
paragraph) that does not adversely  affect the rights of any  Securityholder  in
any material respect; or

            (g) to provide for the issuance of and  establish the form and terms
and conditions of the  Debentures,  to establish the form of any  certifications
required  to be  furnished  pursuant  to the  terms  of  this  Indenture  or the
Debentures, or to add to the rights of the holders of Debentures.

      The Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company in the execution
of any such supplemental  indenture,  to make any further appropriate agreements
and  stipulations  which may be therein  contained and to accept the conveyance,
transfer and assignment of any property thereunder, but the Trustee shall not be
obligated  to,  but may in its  discretion,  enter  into any  such  supplemental
indenture  which affects the Trustee's  own rights,  duties or immunities  under
this Indenture or otherwise.

      Any  supplemental  indenture  authorized by the provisions of this Section
9.1 may be executed  by the  Company and the Trustee  without the consent of the
holders of any of the Debentures at the time outstanding, notwithstanding any of
the provisions of Section 9.2.

                                       44
<PAGE>

      SECTION 9.2. SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES WITH CONSENT OF SECURITYHOLDERS. With
the consent  (evidenced  as provided in Section  7.1) of the holders of not less
than a majority in  aggregate  principal  amount of the  Debentures  at the time
outstanding  affected by such supplemental  indenture  (voting as a class),  the
Company, when authorized by a Board Resolution, and the Trustee may from time to
time and at any time enter into an indenture or indentures  supplemental  hereto
for the  purpose  of adding  any  provisions  to or  changing  in any  manner or
eliminating  any of the  provisions  of this  Indenture  or of any  supplemental
indenture  or of  modifying  in any  manner  the  rights of the  holders  of the
Debentures; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such supplemental indenture shall without
the consent of the  holders of each  Debenture  then  outstanding  and  affected
thereby (i) change the fixed maturity of any Debenture,  or reduce the principal
amount thereof or any premium thereon,  or reduce the rate or extend the time of
payment of interest thereon,  or reduce any amount payable on redemption thereof
or make the principal  thereof or any interest or premium thereon payable in any
coin or currency other than that provided in the Debentures, or impair or affect
the right of any  Securityholder to institute suit for payment thereof or impair
the right of repayment,  if any, at the option of the holder, or (ii) reduce the
aforesaid  percentage of Debentures the holders of which are required to consent
to any such  supplemental  indenture;  PROVIDED  FURTHER,  HOWEVER,  that if the
Debentures  are held by a trust or a trustee of such  trust,  such  supplemental
indenture  shall not be effective until the holders of a majority in Liquidation
Amount of Trust Securities shall have consented to such supplemental  indenture;
PROVIDED  FURTHER,  HOWEVER,  that if the consent of the  Securityholder of each
outstanding  Debenture is required,  such  supplemental  indenture  shall not be
effective until each holder of the Trust Securities shall have consented to such
supplemental indenture.

      Upon  the  request  of  the  Company  accompanied  by a  Board  Resolution
authorizing  the  execution  of any such  supplemental  indenture,  and upon the
filing  with the  Trustee  of  evidence  of the  consent of  Securityholders  as
aforesaid,  the  Trustee  shall join with the Company in the  execution  of such
supplemental  indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's
own rights,  duties or immunities  under this  Indenture or otherwise,  in which
case the Trustee may in its  discretion,  but shall not be  obligated  to, enter
into such supplemental indenture.

      Promptly  after  the  execution  by the  Company  and the  Trustee  of any
supplemental  indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Section,  the Trustee
shall transmit by mail, first class postage prepaid,  a notice,  prepared by the
Company,  setting  forth in general  terms the  substance  of such  supplemental
indenture,  to the  Securityholders as their names and addresses appear upon the
Debenture  Register.  Any  failure of the  Trustee to mail such  notice,  or any
defect therein,  shall not, however, in any way impair or affect the validity of
any such supplemental indenture.

      It shall not be  necessary  for the consent of the  Securityholders  under
this Section 9.2 to approve the  particular  form of any  proposed  supplemental
indenture,  but it  shall  be  sufficient  if such  consent  shall  approve  the
substance thereof.

      SECTION 9.3. EFFECT OF SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURES.  Upon the execution of any
supplemental  indenture  pursuant  to the  provisions  of this  Article IX, this
Indenture  shall be and be deemed  to be  modified  and  amended  in  accordance
therewith and the respective rights, limitations of rights, obligations,  duties
and immunities under this Indenture of the Trustee,  the Company and the holders
of Debentures shall thereafter be determined,  exercised and enforced  hereunder
subject in all respects to such  modifications  and amendments and all the terms
and conditions of any such  supplemental  indenture shall be and be deemed to be
part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.

      SECTION  9.4.  NOTATION  ON  DEBENTURES.   Debentures   authenticated  and
delivered  after the  execution of any  supplemental  indenture  pursuant to the
provisions of this Article IX may bear a notation as to any matter  provided for
in  such  supplemental  indenture.  If the  Company  or  the  Trustee  shall  so
determine, new Debentures so modified as to conform, in the opinion of the Board
of Directors of the Company,  to any modification of this Indenture contained in
any such  supplemental  indenture  may be prepared  and executed by the Company,
authenticated  by the  Trustee  or the  Authenticating  Agent and  delivered  in
exchange for the Debentures then outstanding.

      SECTION  9.5.  EVIDENCE OF  COMPLIANCE  OF  SUPPLEMENTAL  INDENTURE  TO BE
FURNISHED TO TRUSTEE. The Trustee, subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and
6.2,  shall, in addition to the documents  required by Section 14.6,  receive an
Officers'  Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive evidence that any
supplemental  indenture  executed pursuant hereto complies with the requirements
of this  Article  IX.  The  Trustee  shall  receive  an  Opinion  of  Counsel as
conclusive  evidence that any supplemental  indenture  executed pursuant to this
Article IX is  authorized  or  permitted  by, and conforms to, the terms of this
Article IX and that it is proper for the Trustee  under the  provisions  of this
Article IX to join in the execution thereof.

                                   ARTICLE X.
                            REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES

      SECTION  10.1.  OPTIONAL  REDEMPTION.  The Company shall have the right to
redeem  the  Debentures,  in whole or in part,  but in all cases in a  principal
amount with integral multiples of $1,000.00,  on any Interest Payment Date on or
after the  Interest  Payment  Date in  December  2009 (an  "OPTIONAL  REDEMPTION
DATE"), at the Optional Redemption Price.

      SECTION 10.2. SPECIAL EVENT REDEMPTION. If a Special Event shall occur and
be  continuing,  the Company  shall have the right to redeem the  Debentures  in
whole, but not in part, at any Interest Payment Date,  within 120 days following
the  occurrence  of such Special Event (the  "SPECIAL  REDEMPTION  DATE") at the
Special  Redemption  Price. If the Special Event redemption  occurs prior to the
Interest  Payment Date in December  2009,  the Company shall appoint a Quotation
Agent,  which initially shall be Wilmington  Trust Company or its designee,  for
the purpose of performing the services  contemplated in, or by reference in, the
definition of Special  Redemption  Price.  Any error in the  calculation  of the
Special  Redemption Price by the Quotation Agent or the Trustee may be corrected
at any  time  by  notice  delivered  to  the  Company  and  the  holders  of the
Debentures.  Subject to the corrective rights set forth above, all certificates,
communications, opinions, determinations, calculations, quotations and decisions
given,  expressed,  made or obtained for the purposes of the provisions relating
to the payment and calculation of the Special Redemption Price on the Debentures
by the Trustee or the Quotation Agent, as the case may be, shall (in the absence
of  willful  default,  bad faith or  manifest  error) be final,  conclusive  and
binding on the holders of the Debentures and the Company, and no liability shall
attach  (except as  provided  above) to the  Trustee or the  Quotation  Agent in
connection with the exercise or non-exercise by any of them of their  respective
powers, duties and discretion.

                                       46
<PAGE>

      SECTION 10.3. NOTICE OF REDEMPTION;  SELECTION OF DEBENTURES.  In case the
Company  shall  desire to exercise  the right to redeem all, or, as the case may
be,  any part of the  Debentures,  it shall  cause to be mailed a notice of such
redemption  at  least  30 and  not  more  than  60 days  prior  to the  Optional
Redemption  Date or the Special  Redemption Date to the holders of Debentures so
to be redeemed as a whole or in part at their last  addresses as the same appear
on the Debenture Register. Such mailing shall be by first class mail. The notice
if mailed in the manner herein provided shall be  conclusively  presumed to have
been duly given,  whether or not the holder  receives such notice.  In any case,
failure to give such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the holder of
any Debenture  designated  for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect
the validity of the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debenture.

      Each such notice of redemption shall specify the CUSIP number,  if any, of
the  Debentures  to be  redeemed,  the Optional  Redemption  Date or the Special
Redemption  Date, as applicable,  the Optional  Redemption  Price or the Special
Redemption  Price, as applicable,  at which  Debentures are to be redeemed,  the
place or places of payment,  that  payment  will be made upon  presentation  and
surrender  of such  Debentures,  that  interest  accrued  to the date  fixed for
redemption will be paid as specified in said notice,  and that on and after said
date  interest  thereon or on the portions  thereof to be redeemed will cease to
accrue.  If less  than all the  Debentures  are to be  redeemed  the  notice  of
redemption  shall specify the numbers of the Debentures to be redeemed.  In case
the Debentures  are to be redeemed in part only, the notice of redemption  shall
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state
that on and  after  the  date  fixed  for  redemption,  upon  surrender  of such
Debenture,  a new  Debenture  or  Debentures  in  principal  amount equal to the
unredeemed portion thereof will be issued.

      Prior to 10:00 a.m. (New York City time) on the Optional  Redemption  Date
or Special  Redemption  Date, as  applicable,  the Company will deposit with the
Trustee  or with one or more  paying  agents an amount  of money  sufficient  to
redeem on the  Optional  Redemption  Date or the  Special  Redemption  Date,  as
applicable,  all the  Debentures  so called for  redemption  at the  appropriate
Optional  Redemption Price or Special  Redemption  Price,  together with accrued
interest  to the  Optional  Redemption  Date  or  Special  Redemption  Date,  as
applicable.

      If all, or less than all, the Debentures  are to be redeemed,  the Company
will  give  the  Trustee  notice  not  less  than  45 nor  more  than  60  days,
respectively,  prior to the Optional Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date,
as applicable, as to the aggregate principal amount of Debentures to be redeemed
and the Trustee shall select,  in such manner as in its sole discretion it shall
deem  appropriate  and fair,  the  Debentures  or portions  thereof (in integral
multiples of $1,000.00) to be redeemed.

      SECTION 10.4.  PAYMENT OF DEBENTURES  CALLED FOR REDEMPTION.  If notice of
redemption  has been  given as  provided  in Section  10.3,  the  Debentures  or
portions of  Debentures  with  respect to which such notice has been given shall
become due and payable on the  Optional  Redemption  Date or Special  Redemption
Date,  as  applicable,  and at the place or places  stated in such notice at the
applicable Optional Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price,  together with
interest accrued to the Optional  Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date, as
applicable,  and on and after said date (unless the Company shall default in the
payment  of  such  Debentures  at  the  Optional  Redemption  Price  or  Special
Redemption  Price, as applicable,  together with interest  accrued to said date)
interest on the  Debentures or portions of  Debentures so called for  redemption
shall cease to accrue.  On  presentation  and surrender of such  Debentures at a
place of payment  specified in said notice,  such  Debentures  or the  specified
portions  thereof  shall be paid and  redeemed by the Company at the  applicable
Optional  Redemption Price or Special  Redemption Price,  together with interest
accrued thereon to the Optional  Redemption Date or Special  Redemption Date, as
applicable.

                                       47
<PAGE>

      Upon  presentation  of any  Debenture  redeemed in part only,  the Company
shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available for delivery
to the  holder  thereof,  at the  expense of the  Company,  a new  Debenture  or
Debentures  of  authorized  denominations,  in  principal  amount  equal  to the
unredeemed portion of the Debenture so presented.

                CONSOLIDATION, MERGER, SALE, CONVEYANCE AND LEASE

      SECTION 11.1.  COMPANY MAY  CONSOLIDATE,  ETC., ON CERTAIN TERMS.  Nothing
contained in this Indenture or in the Debentures shall prevent any consolidation
or  merger  of the  Company  with or  into  any  other  Person  (whether  or not
affiliated  with the Company) or successive  consolidations  or mergers in which
the Company or its successor or successors shall be a party or parties, or shall
prevent any sale,  conveyance,  transfer or other  disposition  of the property,
assets or capital  stock of the Company or its  successor  or  successors  as an
entirety,  or substantially as an entirety,  to any other Person (whether or not
affiliated  with the Company,  or its  successor or  successors)  authorized  to
acquire  and  operate  the same;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that the  Company  hereby
covenants  and  agrees  that,  upon any such  consolidation,  merger  (where the
Company is not the surviving corporation),  sale, conveyance,  transfer or other
disposition,  the due and punctual payment of the principal of (and premium,  if
any) and  interest on all of the  Debentures  in  accordance  with their  terms,
according to their tenor, and the due and punctual performance and observance of
all the  covenants and  conditions of this  Indenture to be kept or performed by
the Company,  shall be expressly assumed by supplemental  indenture satisfactory
in form to the  Trustee  executed  and  delivered  to the  Trustee by the entity
formed by such consolidation,  or into which the Company shall have been merged,
or by the entity which shall have acquired such property or capital stock.

      SECTION  11.2.  SUCCESSOR  ENTITY TO BE  SUBSTITUTED.  In case of any such
consolidation,  merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or other disposition and upon
the assumption by the successor entity, by supplemental indenture,  executed and
delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the due and
punctual payment of the principal of and premium, if any, and interest on all of
the Debentures and the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the
covenants and  conditions  of this  Indenture to be performed or observed by the
Company,  such  successor  entity shall  succeed to and be  substituted  for the
Company, with the same effect as if it had been named herein as the Company, and
thereupon the predecessor  entity shall be relieved of any further  liability or
obligation hereunder or upon the Debentures. Such successor entity thereupon may
cause to be signed,  and may issue in its own name, any or all of the Debentures
issuable  hereunder which  theretofore shall not have been signed by the Company
and delivered to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent; and, upon the order of
such  successor  entity  instead of the  Company  and  subject to all the terms,
conditions  and  limitations in this  Indenture  prescribed,  the Trustee or the
Authenticating  Agent  shall  authenticate  and  deliver  any  Debentures  which
previously  shall have been signed and delivered by the officers of the Company,
to  the  Trustee  or  the  Authenticating  Agent  for  authentication,  and  any
Debentures which such successor  entity  thereafter shall cause to be signed and
delivered to the Trustee or the Authenticating  Agent for that purpose.  All the
Debentures  so issued shall in all respects have the same legal rank and benefit
under this  Indenture as the  Debentures  theretofore  or  thereafter  issued in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture as though all of such Debentures had
been issued at the date of the execution hereof.

      SECTION  11.3.  OPINION OF COUNSEL TO BE GIVEN TO  TRUSTEE.  The  Trustee,
subject to the provisions of Sections 6.1 and 6.2, shall receive, in addition to
the  Opinion  of  Counsel  required  by  Section  9.5,  an Opinion of Counsel as
conclusive evidence that any consolidation,  merger, sale, conveyance,  transfer
or other disposition, and any assumption,  permitted or required by the terms of
this Article XI complies with the provisions of this Article XI.

      SECTION 14.7. TABLE OF CONTENTS,  HEADINGS, ETC. The table of contents and
the titles and headings of the articles and sections of this Indenture have been

hereof.

      SECTION 14.8. EXECUTION IN COUNTERPARTS. This Indenture may be executed in
any  number  of  counterparts,  each of  which  shall be an  original,  but such
counterparts shall together constitute but one and the same instrument.

      SECTION  14.9.  SEVERABILITY.  In case  any one or more of the  provisions
contained in this Indenture or in the Debentures shall for any reason be held to
be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity, illegality

of such Debentures, but this Indenture and such Debentures shall be construed as
if such invalid or illegal or  unenforceable  provision had never been contained
herein or therein.

      SECTION 14.10. ASSIGNMENT. The Company will have the right at all times to
assign any of its rights or  obligations  under  this  Indenture  to a direct or

Subject to the  foregoing,  this  Indenture  is  binding  upon and inures to the

      SECTION 14.11.  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  OF RIGHTS.  The Company agrees that,  with
respect to any Debentures held by the Trust or the Institutional  Trustee of the
Trust,  if the  Institutional  Trustee of the Trust  fails to enforce its rights
under  this  Indenture  as the holder of  Debentures  held as the assets of such
Trust  after the  holders of a majority  in  Liquidation  Amount of the  Capital
Securities of such Trust have so directed such  Institutional  Trustee, a holder
of record of such Capital  Securities  may, to the fullest  extent  permitted by
law,  institute legal  proceedings  directly against the Company to enforce such
Institutional  Trustee's rights under this Indenture  without first  instituting
any legal proceedings against such trustee or any other Person.  Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing  and such
event is attributable to the failure of the Company to pay interest (or premium,
if any) or principal on the Debentures on the date such interest (or premium, if
any) or  principal is otherwise  payable (or in the case of  redemption,  on the
redemption  date),  the  Company  agrees  that a holder  of  record  of  Capital
Securities of the Trust may directly  institute a proceeding against the Company
for  enforcement  of payment to such  holder  directly of the  principal  of (or
premium,  if any) or interest on the  Debentures  having an aggregate  principal
amount equal to the aggregate  Liquidation  Amount of the Capital  Securities of
such holder on or after the respective due date specified in the Debentures.

                           SUBORDINATION OF DEBENTURES

      SECTION 15.1. AGREEMENT TO SUBORDINATE.  The Company covenants and agrees,
and each  holder  of  Debentures  by such  Securityholder's  acceptance  thereof
likewise  covenants and agrees,  that all Debentures  shall be issued subject to
the provisions of this Article XV; and each holder of a Debenture,  whether upon
original issue or upon transfer or assignment thereof,  accepts and agrees to be
bound by such provisions.

      The payment by the Company of the principal  of, and premium,  if any, and
interest on all Debentures  shall,  to the extent and in the manner  hereinafter
set forth, be  subordinated  and junior in right of payment to the prior payment
in full of all Senior  Indebtedness of the Company,  whether  outstanding at the
date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred.

      No  provision  of this  Article XV shall  prevent  the  occurrence  of any
default or Event of Default hereunder.

      SECTION 15.2. DEFAULT ON SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS.  In the event and during the
continuation of any default by the Company in the payment of principal, premium,
interest  or any other  payment  due on any Senior  Indebtedness  of the Company
following  any grace  period,  or in the event that the  maturity  of any Senior
Indebtedness of the Company has been  accelerated  because of a default and such
acceleration has not been rescinded or canceled and such Senior Indebtedness has
not been paid in full,  then,  in either case,  no payment  shall be made by the
Company with respect to the principal (including  redemption) of, or premium, if
any, or interest on the Debentures.

      In the event that,  notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any payment shall be
received  by the  Trustee  when such  payment  is  prohibited  by the  preceding
paragraph of this Section 15.2, such payment shall,  subject to Section 15.7, be
held in trust for the  benefit of, and shall be paid over or  delivered  to, the
holders of Senior  Indebtedness or their respective  representatives,  or to the
trustee or  trustees  under any  indenture  pursuant to which any of such Senior
Indebtedness may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, but
only to the  extent  that the  holders  of the  Senior  Indebtedness  (or  their
representative  or  representatives  or a trustee) notify the Trustee in writing
within 90 days of such  payment of the amounts  then due and owing on the Senior
Indebtedness and only the amounts  specified in such notice to the Trustee shall
be paid to the holders of Senior Indebtedness.

      SECTION 15.3. LIQUIDATION,  DISSOLUTION,  BANKRUPTCY.  Upon any payment by
the Company or  distribution  of assets of the Company of any kind or character,
whether in cash,  property or securities,  to creditors upon any  dissolution or
winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary or
involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other proceedings, all
amounts due upon all Senior  Indebtedness  of the Company shall first be paid in
full, or payment  thereof  provided for in money in  accordance  with its terms,
before any  payment is made by the  Company,  on account of the  principal  (and
premium,  if any) or interest on the  Debentures.  Upon any such  dissolution or
winding-up or  liquidation  or  reorganization,  any payment by the Company,  or
distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or  securities,  to which the  Securityholders  or the Trustee would be
entitled to receive from the Company,  except for the provisions of this Article
XV, shall be paid by the Company,  or by any  receiver,  trustee in  bankruptcy,
liquidating trustee,  agent or other Person making such payment or distribution,
or by the  Securityholders or by the Trustee under this Indenture if received by
them or it,  directly  to the holders of Senior  Indebtedness  (PRO RATA to such
holders on the basis of the respective  amounts of Senior  Indebtedness  held by
such  holders,  as  calculated  by  the  Company)  or  their  representative  or
representatives,  or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture  pursuant to
which any instruments  evidencing such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued,
as their  respective  interests may appear,  to the extent necessary to pay such
Senior  Indebtedness in full, in money or money's worth,  after giving effect to
any  concurrent  payment or  distribution  to or for the  holders of such Senior
Indebtedness,  before any payment or distribution is made to the Securityholders
or to the Trustee.

                                       53
<PAGE>

      In  the  event  that,   notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  payment  or
distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities,  prohibited by the  foregoing,  shall be received by the
Trustee before all Senior Indebtedness is paid in full, or provision is made for
such payment in money in accordance with its terms, such payment or distribution
shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be paid over or delivered to
the   holders  of  such  Senior   Indebtedness   or  their   representative   or
representatives,  or to the trustee or trustees under any indenture  pursuant to
which any instruments  evidencing such Senior Indebtedness may have been issued,
as their  respective  interests may appear,  as  calculated by the Company,  for
application to the payment of all Senior  Indebtedness,  remaining unpaid to the
extent necessary to pay such Senior  Indebtedness in full in money in accordance
with its terms, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or distribution to
or for the benefit of the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

      For purposes of this Article XV, the words "cash,  property or securities"
shall not be deemed to include  shares of stock of the Company as reorganized or
readjusted,  or securities of the Company or any other corporation  provided for
by  a  plan  of  reorganization  or  readjustment,   the  payment  of  which  is
subordinated  at least to the extent provided in this Article XV with respect to
the Debentures to the payment of all Senior  Indebtedness,  that may at the time
be outstanding, provided that (i) such Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new
corporation, if any, resulting from any such reorganization or readjustment, and
(ii) the rights of the holders of such Senior  Indebtedness are not, without the
consent of such holders,  altered by such  reorganization  or readjustment.  The
consolidation  of the Company with,  or the merger of the Company into,  another
corporation  or the  liquidation  or  dissolution  of the Company  following the
conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety,  or  substantially  as an
entirety,  to another  corporation upon the terms and conditions provided for in
Article  XI of this  Indenture  shall not be deemed a  dissolution,  winding-up,
liquidation  or  reorganization  for the  purposes of this Section if such other
corporation  shall,  as a part  of such  consolidation,  merger,  conveyance  or
transfer,  comply with the  conditions  stated in Article XI of this  Indenture.
Nothing in Section 15.2 or in this Section shall apply to claims of, or payments
to, the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.6 of this Indenture.

      SECTION  15.4.  SUBROGATION.  Subject to the payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness,  the  Securityholders  shall be  subrogated  to the  rights of the
holders of such Senior  Indebtedness  to receive  payments or  distributions  of
cash,  property  or  securities  of  the  Company,  applicable  to  such  Senior
Indebtedness  until the principal of (and  premium,  if any) and interest on the
Debentures  shall be paid in full.  For the  purposes  of such  subrogation,  no
payments or  distributions  to the holders of such  Senior  Indebtedness  of any
cash,  property or securities to which the  Securityholders or the Trustee would
be entitled  except for the  provisions  of this Article XV, and no payment over
pursuant  to the  provisions  of this  Article  XV to or for the  benefit of the
holders of such Senior Indebtedness by Securityholders or the Trustee, shall, as
between the Company,  its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness of
the  Company,  and the  holders of the  Debentures  be deemed to be a payment or
distribution by the Company to or on account of such Senior Indebtedness.  It is
understood  that the  provisions of this Article XV are and are intended  solely
for  the  purposes  of  defining  the  relative  rights  of the  holders  of the
Securities, on the one hand, and the holders of such Senior Indebtedness, on the
other hand.

      Nothing  contained in this Article XV or elsewhere in this Indenture or in
the  Debentures  is intended to or shall  impair,  as between the  Company,  its
creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness,  and the holders of the
Debentures,  the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional,
to pay to the holders of the Debentures  the principal of (and premium,  if any)
and interest on the Debentures as and when the same shall become due and payable
in accordance  with their terms,  or is intended to or shall affect the relative
rights of the holders of the Debentures and creditors of the Company, other than
the holders of Senior Indebtedness, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent
the  Trustee  or the  holder  of any  Debenture  from  exercising  all  remedies
otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject
to the  rights,  if any,  under this  Article XV of the  holders of such  Senior
Indebtedness in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company, received
upon the exercise of any such remedy.

      Upon any payment or distribution  of assets of the Company  referred to in
this Article XV, the Trustee,  subject to the  provisions  of Article VI of this
Indenture,  and the Securityholders  shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon
any order or decree made by any court of  competent  jurisdiction  in which such
dissolution,  winding-up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending,
or a certificate of the receiver,  trustee in bankruptcy,  liquidation  trustee,
agent or other  Person  making such  payment or  distribution,  delivered to the
Trustee or to the Securityholders,  for the purposes of ascertaining the Persons
entitled to participate in such distribution, the holders of Senior Indebtedness
and other  indebtedness of the Company,  the amount thereof or payable  thereon,
the amount or amounts paid or distributed  thereon and all other facts pertinent
thereto or to this Article XV.

      SECTION 15.5. TRUSTEE TO EFFECTUATE SUBORDINATION.  Each Securityholder by
such  Securityholder's  acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee on
such  Securityholder's  behalf  to  take  such  action  as may be  necessary  or
appropriate  to  effectuate  the  subordination  provided in this Article XV and
appoints the Trustee such Securityholder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes.

      SECTION 15.6. NOTICE BY THE COMPANY. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to a Responsible  Officer of the Trustee at the  Principal  Office of the
Trustee of any fact known to the Company  that would  prohibit the making of any
payment of monies to or by the Trustee in respect of the Debentures  pursuant to
the  provisions  of this  Article XV.  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of this
Article XV or any other  provision of this  Indenture,  the Trustee shall not be
charged  with  knowledge of the  existence of any facts that would  prohibit the
making  of  any  payment  of  monies  to or by the  Trustee  in  respect  of the
Debentures  pursuant to the  provisions  of this Article XV,  unless and until a
Responsible  Officer of the Trustee at the Principal Office of the Trustee shall
have received  written notice thereof from the Company or a holder or holders of
Senior Indebtedness or from any trustee therefor;  and before the receipt of any
such written  notice,  the Trustee,  subject to the  provisions of Article VI of
this  Indenture,  shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such facts
exist; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice
provided  for in this  Section at least 2  Business  Days prior to the date upon
which  by the  terms  hereof  any  money  may  become  payable  for any  purpose
(including,  without limitation, the payment of the principal of (or premium, if
any) or interest on any  Debenture),  then,  anything  herein  contained  to the
contrary  notwithstanding,  the Trustee  shall have full power and  authority to
receive  such  money and to apply the same to the  purposes  for which they were
received,  and shall not be affected by any notice to the  contrary  that may be
received by it within 2 Business Days prior to such date.

      The Trustee,  subject to the  provisions of Article VI of this  Indenture,
shall be entitled to conclusively rely on the delivery to it of a written notice
by a Person  representing  himself to be a holder of Senior  Indebtedness  (or a
trustee or  representative  on behalf of such  holder),  to establish  that such
notice has been given by a holder of such  Senior  Indebtedness  or a trustee or
representative  on behalf of any such holder or  holders.  In the event that the
Trustee  determines in good faith that further evidence is required with respect
to  the  right  of any  Person  as a  holder  of  such  Senior  Indebtedness  to
participate  in any payment or  distribution  pursuant  to this  Article XV, the
Trustee  may  request  such  Person  to  furnish   evidence  to  the  reasonable
satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of such Senior Indebtedness held by
such Person,  the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such
payment or  distribution  and any other  facts  pertinent  to the rights of such
Person  under this  Article  XV, and, if such  evidence  is not  furnished,  the
Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending  judicial  determination as
to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

      SECTION 15.7. RIGHTS OF THE TRUSTEE;  HOLDERS OF SENIOR INDEBTEDNESS.  The
Trustee in its individual capacity shall be entitled to all the rights set forth
in this Article XV in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it,
to the same extent as any other  holder of Senior  Indebtedness,  and nothing in
this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its rights as such holder.

      With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes
to perform or to  observe  only such of its  covenants  and  obligations  as are
specifically  set  forth  in  this  Article  XV,  and no  implied  covenants  or
obligations  with  respect to the holders of such Senior  Indebtedness  shall be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to
owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of such Senior  Indebtedness  and, subject
to the  provisions  of Article VI of this  Indenture,  the Trustee  shall not be
liable to any holder of such Senior Indebtedness if it shall pay over or deliver
to Securityholders, the Company or any other Person money or assets to which any
holder of such Senior  Indebtedness  shall be entitled by virtue of this Article
XV or otherwise.
                                       56

      Nothing in this  Article XV shall apply to claims of, or payments  to, the
Trustee under or pursuant to Section 6.6.

      SECTION 15.8.  SUBORDINATION MAY NOT BE IMPAIRED.  No right of any present
or future holder of any Senior  Indebtedness to enforce  subordination as herein
provided  shall at any time in any way be  prejudiced  or impaired by any act or
failure to act on the part of the  Company,  or by any act or failure to act, in
good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company, with the
terms,  provisions and covenants of this Indenture,  regardless of any knowledge
thereof that any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with.

      Without in any way limiting the generality of the foregoing paragraph, the
holders of Senior  Indebtedness may, at any time and from time to time,  without
the  consent  of or  notice  to  the  Trustee  or the  Securityholders,  without
incurring  responsibility  to  the  Securityholders  and  without  impairing  or
releasing  the  subordination  provided  in this  Article XV or the  obligations
hereunder  of the  holders  of the  Debentures  to the  holders  of such  Senior
Indebtedness,  do any one or more of the following: (i) change the manner, place
or terms of payment or extend  the time of payment  of, or renew or alter,  such
Senior Indebtedness,  or otherwise amend or supplement in any manner such Senior
Indebtedness or any instrument  evidencing the same or any agreement under which
such  Senior  Indebtedness  is  outstanding;  (ii)  sell,  exchange,  release or
otherwise deal with any property pledged,  mortgaged or otherwise  securing such
Senior  Indebtedness;  (iii)  release  any  Person  liable in any manner for the
collection  of such  Senior  Indebtedness;  and (iv)  exercise  or refrain  from
exercising any rights against the Company, and any other Person.

      Fixed/Floating Rate Junior Subordinated Deferrable Interest Debenture

                                       of

                                Tower Group, Inc.

                                December 15, 2004

         Tower Group,  Inc., a corporation duly organized and existing under the
laws of Delaware (the "Company,"  which term includes any successor Person under
the Indenture  hereinafter  referred to), for value received  promises to pay to
Wilmington  Trust  Company,  not  in  its  individual  capacity  but  solely  as
Institutional  Trustee for Tower Group  Statutory  Trust III (the  "Holder")  or
registered assigns, the principal sum of thirteen million four hundred and three


                                      A-1-2
<PAGE>


thousand dollars ($13,403,000) on December 15, 2034, and to pay interest on said
principal sum from December 15, 2004, or from the most recent  Interest  Payment
Date (as defined  herein) to which  interest has been paid or duly provided for,
quarterly (subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on March 15, June
15,  September  15 and December 15 of each year or if such day is not a Business
Day, then the next succeeding Business Day (each such date, an "Interest Payment
Date"), commencing on the Interest Payment Date in March 2005, at an annual rate
equal to 7.40%  beginning on (and  including) the date of original  issuance and
ending on (but  excluding) the Interest  Payment Date in December 2009 and at an
annual rate for each successive Distribution Period beginning on (and including)
the Interest Payment Date in December 2009, and each succeeding Interest Payment
Date, and ending on (but  excluding) the next succeeding  Interest  Payment Date
(each a "Distribution Period"),  equal to 3-Month LIBOR, determined as described
below,  plus 3.40% (the "Coupon Rate"),  applied to the principal amount hereof,
until the principal  hereof is paid or duly  provided for or made  available for
payment, and on any overdue principal and (without duplication and to the extent
that  payment of such  interest  is  enforceable  under  applicable  law) on any
overdue installment of interest (including  Additional Interest) at the Interest
Rate in effect for each applicable period,  compounded quarterly, from the dates
such  amounts are due until they are paid or made  available  for  payment.  The
amount of interest  payable (i) for any  Distribution  Period  commencing  on or
after the date of original  issuance  but before the  Interest  Payment  Date in
December  2009 will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve  30-day
months, and (ii) for the Distribution Period commencing on or after the Interest
Payment Date in December 2009 and each  succeeding  Distribution  Period will be
computed on the basis of the actual  number of days in the  Distribution  Period
concerned  divided by 360. The interest  installment so payable,  and punctually
paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the
Indenture,  be paid to the Person in whose name this  Debenture  (or one or more
Predecessor  Securities)  is  registered at the close of business on the regular
record date for such interest installment,  which shall be fifteen days prior to
the day on which the relevant  Interest  Payment Date occurs.  Any such interest
installment not so punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to
be  payable  to the Holder on such  regular  record  date and may be paid to the
Person in whose name this Debenture (or one or more  Predecessor  Securities) is
registered at the close of business on a special record date.

         Capitalized terms used and not defined in this Debenture shall have the
meanings  assigned in the Indenture dated as of the date of original issuance of
this Debenture between the Trustee and the Company.

         "3-Month  LIBOR" as used  herein,  means the London  interbank  offered
interest rate for three-month U.S. dollar deposits  determined by the Trustee in
the following  order of priority:  (i) the rate  (expressed as a percentage  per
annum) for U.S. dollar  deposits  having a three-month  maturity that appears on
Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00 a.m.  (London time) on the related  Determination
Date  ("Telerate  Page 3750" means the display  designated as "Page 3750" on the
Dow Jones  Telerate  Service or such other page as may replace Page 3750 on that
service or such other  service or  services as may be  nominated  by the British
Bankers'  Association  as the  information  vendor for the purpose of displaying
London  interbank  offered rates for U.S.  dollar  deposits);  (ii) if such rate
cannot be identified on the related Determination Date, the Trustee will request
the  principal  London  offices of four  leading  banks in the London  interbank
market to provide such banks' offered  quotations  (expressed as percentages per
annum) to prime banks in the London  interbank  market for U.S.  dollar deposits
having  a  three-month   maturity  as  of  11:00  a.m.  (London  time)  on  such


                                      A-1-3
<PAGE>


Determination Date. If at least two quotations are provided,  3-Month LIBOR will
be the  arithmetic  mean of such  quotations;  (iii)  if  fewer  than  two  such
quotations  are  provided as  requested  in clause (ii) above,  the Trustee will
request four major New York City banks to provide such banks' offered quotations
(expressed as percentages per annum) to leading European banks for loans in U.S.
dollars as of 11:00 a.m. (London time) on such  Determination  Date. If at least
two such  quotations are provided,  3-Month LIBOR will be the arithmetic mean of
such  quotations;  and (iv) if fewer than two such  quotations  are  provided as
requested  in  clause  (iii)  above,  3-Month  LIBOR  will  be a  3-Month  LIBOR
determined with respect to the Distribution  Period  immediately  preceding such
current  Distribution  Period.  If the rate for U.S.  dollar  deposits  having a
three-month  maturity that  initially  appears on Telerate Page 3750 as of 11:00
a.m.  (London  time) on the  related  Determination  Date is  superseded  on the
Telerate  Page 3750 by a  corrected  rate by 12:00  noon  (London  time) on such
Determination  Date, then the corrected rate as so substituted on the applicable
page will be the applicable 3-Month LIBOR for such  Determination  Date. As used
herein,  "Determination  Date"  means the date that is two London  Banking  Days
(i.e.,  a  business  day in which  dealings  in  deposits  in U.S.  dollars  are
transacted in the London  interbank  market)  preceding the  commencement of the
relevant Distribution Period.

         "Interest  Rate" means for the period  beginning on (and including) the
date of original  issuance and ending on (but  excluding)  the Interest  Payment
Date in  December  2009 the rate per  annum of 7.40%  and for each  Distribution
Period thereafter, the Coupon Rate.

         The Interest Rate for any Distribution Period will at no time be higher
than the maximum rate then permitted by New York law as the same may be modified
by United States law.

         All percentages  resulting from any calculations on the Debentures will
be rounded, if necessary,  to the nearest one hundred-thousandth of a percentage
point,  with five  one-millionths  of a percentage  point rounded  upward (e.g.,
9.876545% (or .09876545) being rounded to 9.87655% (or .0987655), and all dollar
amounts  used in or  resulting  from such  calculation  will be  rounded  to the
nearest cent (with one-half cent being rounded upward)).

         The principal of and interest on this Debenture shall be payable at the
office or agency of the Trustee (or other paying agent appointed by the Company)
maintained  for that  purpose in any coin or  currency  of the United  States of
America  that at the time of payment is legal  tender for  payment of public and
private debts; PROVIDED,  HOWEVER, that payment of interest may be made by check
mailed to the registered holder at such address as shall appear in the Debenture
Register if a request for a wire  transfer by such holder has not been  received
by the Company or by wire transfer to an account appropriately designated by the
holder  hereof.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  so long as the holder of this
Debenture  is the  Institutional  Trustee,  the payment of the  principal of and
interest on this Debenture will be made in immediately  available  funds at such
place and to such account as may be designated by the Trustee.

         So long as no Event of Default  has  occurred  and is  continuing,  the
Company shall have the right, from time to time, and without causing an Event of
Default,  to defer  payments of  interest on the  Debentures  by  extending  the
interest  payment  period  on the  Debentures  at any time and from time to time
during the term of the Debentures,  for up to 20 consecutive  quarterly  periods
(each such extended  interest  payment period,  an "Extension  Period"),  during



                                      A-1-4
<PAGE>

which Extension Period no interest (including  Additional Interest) shall be due
and  payable  (except  any  Additional  Sums  that may be due and  payable).  No
Extension Period may end on a date other than an Interest  Payment Date.  During
an Extension  Period,  interest will continue to accrue on the  Debentures,  and
interest  on such  accrued  interest  will accrue at an annual rate equal to the
Interest Rate in effect for such Extension Period, compounded quarterly from the
date such interest would have been payable were it not for the Extension Period,
to the extent permitted by law (such interest  referred to herein as "Additional
Interest").  At the end of any such  Extension  Period the Company shall pay all
interest then accrued and unpaid on the  Debentures  (together  with  Additional
Interest thereon); PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no Extension Period may extend beyond
the Maturity Date;  PROVIDED  FURTHER,  HOWEVER,  that during any such Extension
Period,  the Company shall not and shall not permit any Affiliate of the Company
controlled  by the Company to engage in any of the  activities  or  transactions
described  on  the  reverse  side  hereof  and in the  Indenture.  Prior  to the
termination of any Extension Period, the Company may further extend such period,
provided  that  such  period   together  with  all  such  previous  and  further
consecutive  extensions  thereof  shall  not  exceed  20  consecutive  quarterly
periods,  or extend  beyond  the  Maturity  Date.  Upon the  termination  of any
Extension  Period and upon the payment of all accrued  and unpaid  interest  and
Additional Interest, the Company may commence a new Extension Period, subject to
the foregoing requirements.  No interest or Additional Interest shall be due and
payable  during  an  Extension  Period,  except  at the end  thereof,  but  each
installment of interest that would otherwise have been due and payable during an
Extension Period shall bear Additional  Interest to the extent permitted by law.
The Company  must give the Trustee  notice of its election to begin or extend an
Extension  Period at least 5 Business Days prior to the regular  record date (as
such term is used in Section 2.8 of the  Indenture)  immediately  preceding  the
Interest  Payment Date with respect to which  interest on the  Debentures  would
have been  payable  except  for the  election  to begin or  extend an  Extension
Period.  The Trustee shall give notice of the Company's  election to begin a new
Extension Period to the holder of the Debentures.

         The indebtedness evidenced by this Debenture is, to the extent provided
in the  Indenture,  subordinate  and  junior  in right of  payment  to the prior
payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Debenture is issued subject
to the  provisions of the Indenture  with respect  thereto.  Each holder of this
Debenture,  by  accepting  the  same,  (a)  agrees to and shall be bound by such
provisions,  (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on his or her behalf to take
such action as may be necessary or  appropriate to acknowledge or effectuate the
subordination   so   provided   and  (c)   appoints   the  Trustee  his  or  her
attorney-in-fact  for any and all such purposes.  Each holder hereof,  by his or
her  acceptance  hereof,  hereby  waives  all  notice of the  acceptance  of the
subordination provisions contained herein and in the Indenture by each holder of
Senior Indebtedness,  whether now outstanding or hereafter incurred,  and waives
reliance by each such holder upon said provisions.

         This Debenture shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Indenture
hereinafter referred to, be valid or become obligatory for any purpose until the
certificate of  authentication  hereon shall have been signed by or on behalf of
the Trustee.

         The  provisions  of this  Debenture  are  continued on the reverse side
hereof and such provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect as though
fully set forth at this place.

                         [FORM OF REVERSE OF DEBENTURE]

         This Debenture is one of the  fixed/floating  rate junior  subordinated
deferrable interest debentures of the Company,  all issued or to be issued under
and pursuant to the Indenture  dated as of December 15, 2004 (the  "Indenture"),
duly  executed  and  delivered  between the Company  and the  Trustee,  to which
Indenture reference is hereby made for a description of the rights,  limitations
of rights,  obligations,  duties and immunities  thereunder of the Trustee,  the
Company  and the  holders  of the  Debentures.  The  Debentures  are  limited in
aggregate principal amount as specified in the Indenture.

         Upon the  occurrence and  continuation  of a Special Event prior to the
Interest  Payment  Date in December  2009,  the Company  shall have the right to
redeem the Debentures in whole,  but not in part, at any Interest  Payment Date,
within 120 days following the  occurrence of such Special Event,  at the Special
Redemption Price.

         In addition, the Company shall have the right to redeem the Debentures,
in whole or in  part,  but in all  cases in a  principal  amount  with  integral
multiples of  $1,000.00,  on any Interest  Payment Date on or after the Interest
Payment Date in December 2009, at the Optional Redemption Price.

         Prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Optional  Redemption Date
or Special  Redemption  Date, as  applicable,  the Company will deposit with the
Trustee  or with one or more  paying  agents an amount  of money  sufficient  to
redeem on the  Optional  Redemption  Date or the  Special  Redemption  Date,  as
applicable,  all the  Debentures  so called for  redemption  at the  appropriate
Optional Redemption Price or Special Redemption Price.

         If all,  or less than  all,  the  Debentures  are to be  redeemed,  the
Company  will  give the  Trustee  notice  not less than 45 nor more than 60 days
prior to the Optional Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date, as applicable,
as to the  aggregate  principal  amount of  Debentures  to be  redeemed  and the
Trustee  shall  select,  in such manner as in its sole  discretion it shall deem
appropriate and fair, the Debentures or portions thereof (in integral  multiples
of $1,000.00) to be redeemed.

         Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  any  redemption  of Debentures by the
Company  shall be subject  to the  receipt  of any and all  required  regulatory
approvals.

         In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, upon
demand of the Trustee,  the principal of all of the Debentures  shall become due
and  payable  in the  manner,  with the effect  and  subject  to the  conditions
provided in the Indenture.

         The  Indenture  contains  provisions  permitting  the  Company  and the
Trustee,  with the  consent  of the  holders  of not  less  than a  majority  in
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding, to execute
supplemental  indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing
in any manner or  eliminating  any of the provisions of this Indenture or of any
supplemental  indenture  or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders
of the Debentures;  PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that no such supplemental indenture shall
without  the  consent of the  holders of each  Debenture  then  outstanding  and
affected  thereby (i) change the fixed maturity of any Debenture,  or reduce the
principal  amount thereof or any premium  thereon,  or reduce the rate or extend
the time of  payment  of  interest  thereon,  or reduce  any  amount  payable on
redemption  thereof or make the  principal  thereof or any  interest  or premium
thereon  payable  in any  coin or  currency  other  than  that  provided  in the
Debentures,  or impair or affect the right of any  Securityholder  to  institute
suit for payment thereof or impair the right of repayment, if any, at the option
of the holder, or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Debentures the holders
of which are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture.

         The Indenture  also  contains  provisions  permitting  the holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding
on behalf of the  holders  of all of the  Debentures  to waive  (or  modify  any
previously  granted  waiver of) any past  default or Event of  Default,  and its
consequences,  except an Event of Default (a)  specified in Sections  5.1(a) and
(b), (b) in respect of covenants or provisions  hereof or of the Indenture which
cannot  be  modified  or  amended  without  the  consent  of the  holder of each
Debenture affected,  or (c) in respect of the covenants contained in Section 3.9
of the  Indenture;  PROVIDED,  HOWEVER,  that if the  Debentures are held by the
Trust or a trustee of the Trust,  such  waiver or  modification  to such  waiver
shall not be effective until the holders of a majority in Liquidation  Amount of
the Trust Securities shall have consented to such waiver or modification to such
waiver, PROVIDED, FURTHER, that if the consent of the holder of each outstanding
Debenture is required,  such waiver shall not be effective  until each holder of
the Trust Securities shall have consented to such waiver.  Upon any such waiver,
the default  covered thereby shall be deemed to be cured for all purposes of the
Indenture and the Company,  the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures  shall
be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, respectively; but no
such waiver shall extend to any  subsequent or other default or Event of Default
or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any default or Event of Default
hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by the Indenture,  said default or
Event of Default shall for all purposes of the  Debentures  and the Indenture be
deemed to have been cured and to be not continuing.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debenture
or of the Indenture  shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company,  which
is absolute and unconditional,  to pay the principal of and premium, if any, and
interest, including Additional Interest, on this Debenture at the time and place
and at the rate and in the money herein prescribed.

         The Company has agreed that if Debentures  are initially  issued to the
Trust or a  trustee  of such  Trust in  connection  with the  issuance  of Trust
Securities by the Trust (regardless of whether Debentures continue to be held by
such  Trust) and (i) there shall have  occurred  and be  continuing  an Event of
Default, (ii) the Company shall be in default with respect to its payment of any
obligations under the Capital Securities  Guarantee,  or (iii) the Company shall
have  given  notice  of its  election  to  defer  payments  of  interest  on the
Debentures by extending the interest  payment period as provided herein and such
Extension  Period,  or any  extension  thereof,  shall be  continuing,  then the
Company shall not, and shall not permit any Affiliate of the Company  controlled
by the Company  to, (x) declare or pay any  dividends  or  distributions  on, or
redeem, purchase, acquire, or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of
the  Company's  or such  Affiliates'  capital  stock  (other  than  payments  of
dividends or  distributions  to the Company or a  Subsidiary  of the Company) or
make any  guarantee  payments  with  respect  to the  foregoing  or (y) make any
payment of principal of or interest or premium, if any, on or repay,  repurchase
or redeem any debt  securities  of the Company or any  Affiliate  of the Company

controlled by the Company that rank PARI PASSU in all respects with or junior in
interest to the  Debentures  (other  than,  with  respect to clauses (x) and (y)
above, (1) repurchases,  redemptions or other  acquisitions of shares of capital
stock of the Company or any  Subsidiary  of the Company in  connection  with any
employment  contract,  benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or for the
benefit  of one or  more  employees,  officers,  directors  or  consultants,  in
connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase plan or in
connection  with  the  issuance  of  capital  stock  of the  Company  or of such
Subsidiary  (or  securities  convertible  into or  exercisable  for such capital
stock) as consideration in an acquisition  transaction entered into prior to the
applicable  Extension  Period,  (2) as a result of any exchange or conversion of
any class or series of the  Company's  capital  stock (or any capital stock of a
Subsidiary  of the  Company)  for any class or series of the  Company's  capital
stock (or in the case of a  Subsidiary  of the  Company,  any class or series of
such  Subsidiary's  capital  stock) or of any  class or series of the  Company's
indebtedness  for any class or series of the Company's  capital stock (or in the
case of indebtedness  of a Subsidiary of the Company,  of any class or series of
such  Subsidiary's  indebtedness  or any class or  series  of such  Subsidiary's
capital  stock),  (3) the  purchase  of  fractional  interests  in shares of the
Company's  capital  stock (or the capital  stock of a Subsidiary of the Company)
pursuant to the  conversion or exchange  provisions of such capital stock or the
security  being  converted or exchanged,  (4) any  declaration  of a dividend in
connection with any stockholders'  rights plan, or the issuance of rights, stock
or other  property  under any  stockholders'  rights plan, or the  redemption or
repurchase of rights  pursuant  thereto,  (5) any dividend in the form of stock,
warrants, options or other rights where the dividend stock or the stock issuable
upon  exercise of such  warrants,  options or other  rights is the same stock as
that on which the  dividend  is being paid or ranks PARI PASSU with or junior to
such  stock  and any  cash  payments  in lieu of  fractional  shares  issued  in
connection therewith, or (6) payments under the Capital Securities Guarantee).

         The  Debentures  are issuable  only in  registered,  certificated  form
without coupons and in minimum  denominations of $100,000.00 and any multiple of
$1,000.00 in excess  thereof.  As provided in the  Indenture  and subject to the
transfer  restrictions  and  limitations as may be contained  herein and therein
from time to time,  this Debenture is  transferable  by the holder hereof on the
Debenture  Register of the Company.  Upon due  presentment  for  registration of
transfer  of any  Debenture  at the  Principal  Office of the  Trustee or at any
office or agency of the  Company  maintained  for such  purpose as  provided  in
Section 3.2 of the  Indenture,  the Company  shall  execute,  the Company or the
Trustee  shall  register  and the  Trustee  or the  Authenticating  Agent  shall
authenticate  and make  available for delivery in the name of the  transferee or
transferees  a  new  Debenture  for  a  like  aggregate  principal  amount.  All
Debentures  presented  for  registration  of transfer or for exchange or payment
shall (if so required by the Company or the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent)
be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of
transfer  in  form   satisfactory  to,  the  Company  and  the  Trustee  or  the
Authenticating Agent duly executed by the holder or his attorney duly authorized
in writing.  No service charge shall be made for any exchange or registration of
transfer of Debentures,  but the Company or the Trustee may require payment of a
sum  sufficient to cover any tax, fee or other  governmental  charge that may be
imposed in connection therewith.

         Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of any Debenture,
the Company,  the Trustee,  any  Authenticating  Agent,  any paying  agent,  any
transfer  agent and any  Debenture  registrar  may deem the Person in whose name
such Debenture  shall be registered  upon the Debenture  Register to be, and may
treat  him as,  the  absolute  owner  of such  Debenture  (whether  or not  such
Debenture  shall be  overdue)  for the  purpose  of  receiving  payment of or on
account of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on such Debenture and
for all  other  purposes;  and  neither  the  Company  nor the  Trustee  nor any
Authenticating  Agent  nor any  paying  agent  nor any  transfer  agent  nor any
Debenture  registrar  shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.  All such
payments  so made to any holder  for the time  being or upon his order  shall be
valid,  and, to the extent of the sum or sums so paid,  effectual to satisfy and
discharge the liability for moneys payable upon any such Debenture.
