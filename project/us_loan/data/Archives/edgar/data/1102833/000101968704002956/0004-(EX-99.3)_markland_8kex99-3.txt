         5. DELIVERY OF WARRANT SHARES.

                  (a) To effect exercises hereunder, the Holder shall not be
required to physically surrender this Warrant unless the aggregate Warrant
Shares represented by this Warrant is being exercised. Upon delivery of the
Exercise Notice (in the form attached hereto) to the Company (with the attached
Warrant Shares Exercise Log) by facsimile showing confirmation of receipt and
upon payment of the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares
that the Holder intends to purchase hereunder, the Company shall promptly (but

herein)) issue and deliver to the Holder, a certificate for the Warrant Shares
issuable upon such exercise.

                  (b) If by the third Trading Day after a Date of Exercise the
Company fails to deliver the required number of Warrant Shares in the manner
required pursuant to Section 5(a), then the Holder will have the right to
rescind such exercise.

                  (c) The Company's obligations to issue and deliver Warrant
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional,
irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any
judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any
violation or alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other Person, and
irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such
obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of
Warrant Shares. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without
limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with
respect to the Company's failure to timely deliver certificates representing
Warrant Shares upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms
hereof.

         6. CHARGES, TAXES AND EXPENSES. Issuance and delivery of Warrant Shares
upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder for any
issue or transfer tax, withholding tax, transfer agent fee or other incidental
tax or expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates, all of which
taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the registration of any certificates for Warrant Shares
or Warrants in a name other than that of the Holder. The Holder shall be
responsible for all other tax liability that may arise as a result of holding or
transferring this Warrant or receiving Warrant Shares upon exercise hereof.

         7. REPLACEMENT OF WARRANT. If this Warrant is mutilated, lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and
substitution for and upon cancellation hereof, or in lieu of and substitution
for this Warrant, a New Warrant, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and
reasonable indemnity (which shall not include a surety bond), if requested.
Applicants for a New Warrant under such circumstances shall also comply with
such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable
third-party costs as the Company may prescribe. If a New Warrant is requested as
a result of a mutilation of this Warrant, then the Holder shall deliver such
mutilated Warrant to the Company as a condition precedent to the Company's
obligation to issue the New Warrant.


                                       3

         8. RESERVATION OF WARRANT SHARES. The Company covenants that it will at
all times reserve and keep available out of the aggregate of its authorized but
unissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the purpose of
enabling it to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as herein
provided, the number of Warrant Shares which are then issuable and deliverable
upon the exercise of this entire Warrant, free from preemptive rights or any
other contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (taking into
account the adjustments and restrictions of SECTION 9). The Company covenants
that all Warrant Shares so issuable and deliverable shall, upon issuance and the
payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance with the terms hereof, be
duly and validly authorized, issued and fully paid and nonassessable.

         9. CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to
time as set forth in this SECTION 9.

                  (a) STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SPLITS. If the Company, at any time
while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) pays a stock dividend on its Common Stock
or otherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable
in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a larger number of shares, or (iii) combines outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price
shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and of which
the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this
paragraph shall become effective immediately after the record date for the
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or distribution,
and any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) or (iii) of this paragraph shall
become effective immediately after the effective date of such subdivision or
combination.

                  (b) FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTIONS. If, at any time while this
Warrant is outstanding there is a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall
have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same
amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled
to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been,
immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of
Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the
"ALTERNATE CONSIDERATION"). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination
of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect
of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company
shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a
reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of
the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as
to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction,
then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental
Transaction. At the Holder's option and request, any successor to the Company or
surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall, either (1) issue to the
Holder a new warrant substantially in the form of this Warrant and consistent
with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder's right to purchase the
Alternate Consideration for the aggregate Exercise Price upon exercise thereof,
or (2) purchase the Warrant from the Holder for a purchase price, payable in
cash within five Trading Days after such request (or, if later, on the effective
date of the Fundamental Transaction), equal to the Black Scholes value of the
remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date of such request. The
terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected
shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply
with the provisions of this paragraph (c) and insuring that the Warrant (or any
such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent
transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction.

                                       4
<PAGE>

                  (c) NUMBER OF WARRANT SHARES. Simultaneously with any
adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 9, the number of
Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the
aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the adjusted number of Warrant
Shares shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment.

                  (d) CALCULATIONS. All calculations under this SECTION 9 shall
be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as applicable.
The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not
include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the
disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common
Stock.

                  (e) NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment pursuant to this SECTION 9, the Company at its expense will promptly
compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and prepare
a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of the
adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant Shares or other
securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable), describing
the transactions giving rise to such adjustments and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request, the Company will
promptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Holder and to the
Company's Transfer Agent.

                  (f) NOTICE OF CORPORATE EVENTS. If the Company (i) declares a
dividend or any other distribution of cash, securities or other property in
respect of its Common Stock, including without limitation any granting of rights
or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary, (ii) authorizes or approves, enters into any agreement contemplating
or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental Transaction or (iii)
authorizes the voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs
of the Company, then the Company shall deliver to the Holder a notice describing
the material terms and conditions of such transaction (but only to the extent
such disclosure would not result in the dissemination of material, non-public
information to the Holder) at least 10 calendar days prior to the applicable
record or effective date on which a Person would need to hold Common Stock in
order to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction, and the
Company will take all steps reasonably necessary in order to insure that the
Holder is given the practical opportunity to exercise this Warrant prior to such
time so as to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction; provided,
however, that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not
affect the validity of the corporate action required to be described in such
notice.

         10. PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. The Holder may pay the Exercise Price in
one of the following manners:

                  (a) CASH EXERCISE. The Holder may deliver immediately
available funds; or

                  (b) CASHLESS EXERCISE. If an Exercise Notice is delivered at a
time when a registration statement permitting the Holder to resell the Warrant
Shares is not then effective or the prospectus forming a part thereof is not
then available to the Holder for the resale of the Warrant Shares, then the
Holder may notify the Company in an Exercise Notice of its election to utilize
cashless exercise, in which event the Company shall issue to the Holder the
number of Warrant Shares determined as follows:

                    X = Y [(A-B)/A]

              where:

                    X = the number of Warrant Shares to be issued to the Holder.

                    Y = the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which this
                        Warrant is being exercised.

                    A = the average of the closing prices for the five Trading
                        Days immediately prior to (but not including) the
                        Exercise Date.

                    B = the Exercise Price.

For purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, it is intended,
understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a cashless
exercise transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and
the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on
the date this Warrant was originally issued.

         11. LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE.

                  (a) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired by the Holder upon any
exercise of this Warrant (or otherwise in respect hereof) shall be limited to
the extent necessary to insure that, following such exercise (or other
issuance), the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by
such Holder and its Affiliates and any other Persons whose beneficial ownership
of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder's for purposes of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act, does not exceed 4.999% of the total number of issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock (including for such purpose the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such exercise). For such purposes, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. This provision shall
not restrict the number of shares of Common Stock which a Holder may receive or
beneficially own in order to determine the amount of securities or other
consideration that such Holder may receive in the event of a Fundamental
Transaction as contemplated in Section 9 of this Warrant. By written notice to
the Company, an Investor may waive the provisions of this Section 11(a) as to
itself but any such waiver will not be effective until the 61st day after
delivery thereof and such waiver shall have no effect on any other Investor.

<PAGE>

                  (b) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein,
the number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired by the Holder upon any
exercise of this Warrant (or otherwise in respect hereof) shall be limited to
the extent necessary to insure that, following such exercise (or other
issuance), the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially owned by
such Holder and its Affiliates and any other Persons whose beneficial ownership
of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder's for purposes of Section
13(d) of the Exchange Act, does not exceed 9.999% of the total number of issued
and outstanding shares of Common Stock (including for such purpose the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon such exercise). For such purposes, beneficial
ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange
Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. This provision shall
not restrict the number of shares of Common Stock which a Holder may receive or
beneficially own in order to determine the amount of securities or other
consideration that such Holder may receive in the event of a Fundamental
Transaction as contemplated in Section 9 of this Warrant. This restriction may
not be waived.

         12. NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Warrant Shares will
be issued in connection with any exercise of this Warrant. In lieu of any
fractional shares which would, otherwise be issuable, the Company shall pay cash
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the closing price of one
Warrant Share as reported by the applicable Trading Market on the date of
exercise.

         13. NOTICES. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
hereunder (including, without limitation, any Exercise Notice) shall be in

such other address as the Company shall indicate in writing in accordance with
this Section), or (ii) if to the Holder, to the address or facsimile number
appearing on the Warrant Register or such other address or facsimile number as
the Holder may provide to the Company in accordance with this Section.

         14. WARRANT AGENT. The Company shall serve as warrant agent under this
Warrant. Upon 10 days' notice to the Holder, the Company may appoint a new
warrant agent. Any corporation into which the Company or any new warrant agent
may be merged or any corporation resulting from any consolidation to which the
Company or any new warrant agent shall be a party or any corporation to which
the Company or any new warrant agent transfers substantially all of its
corporate trust or shareholders services business shall be a successor warrant

                  (b) All questions concerning the construction, validity,

shall be invalid or unenforceable in any respect, the validity and
enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions of this Warrant shall not
