            CAUTIONARY STATEMENT REGARDING FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

         This report on Form 8-K contains "forward-looking statements" within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934. We intend the forward-looking statements to be
covered by the safe harbor provisions for forward-looking statements in these
sections. All statements regarding our expected publicity and marketing
activities, financial position, business and financing plans are forward-looking
statements. These statements can sometimes be identified by our use of
forward-looking words such as "may," "will," "should," "expect," "anticipate,"
"project," "designed," "estimate," "plan" and "continue." Although we believe
that our expectations in such forward-looking statements are reasonable, we
cannot promise that our expectations will turn out to be correct. These
forward-looking statements generally relate to plans and objectives for future
operations and are based upon reasonable estimates and assumptions regarding
future results or trends. These forward-looking statements are subject to
certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions relating to Markland Technologies,
Inc. ("Markland", the "Company", "we" or "our"). Factors that could cause actual
results to differ materially from Markland expectations include the uncertainty
regarding the fact that we do not control the performance of third parties with
whom we have contracts, Markland's possible ability to repay existing
indebtedness, possible inability of Markland to continue in business and other
risks detailed from time to time in Markland's SEC reports. No assurance can be
given that investors of Markland will retain any level of value. Should one or
more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, the Company's future performance and actual results
of operations may vary significantly from those anticipated, projected,
believed, expected, intended or implied. The Company undertakes no obligation to
update any of the forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date
they were made.

ITEM 1.01         ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT
ITEM 3.03         MATERIAL MODIFICATION TO RIGHTS OF SECURITY HOLDERS

Amendment to Warrants Issued to DKR Soundshore Oasis Holding Fund Ltd. and DKR
Soundshore Strategic Holding Fund Ltd.
- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

         On December 28, 2004, we entered into agreements (the "DKR AMENDMENTS")
with DKR Soundshore Oasis Holding Fund Ltd. and DKR Soundshore Strategic Holding
Fund Ltd. (collectively "DKR") to amend terms of warrants issued to DKR on
September 21, 2004 (the "DKR WARRANTS"), for the purchase of up to 5,200,000
shares of our common stock, $0.0001 par value per share (the "COMMON STOCK")
issued in connection with our September 21, 2004, private placement.
Specifically, subject to the terms and conditions contained in the DKR
Amendment, the parties have agreed:

         o        To amend the DKR Warrants so that DKR may exercise all or any
                  portion of the Warrants for an exercise price of $0.60 per
                  share of the Common Stock, from December 28, 2004 until
                  February 28, 2005 (the "DKR EXERCISE PERIOD"). At the end of
                  the DKR Exercise Period, the amendment shall expire and the
                  exercise terms of the DKR Warrants existing prior to December
                  28, 2004, shall be effective.

         o        That DKR shall exercise a minimum of $600,000 in exercise
                  price of the DKR Warrants, as amended, on or before the close
                  of business, New York City time, on December 31, 2004.

         o        That the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the DKR
                  Warrants shall not be adjusted as a result of the temporary
                  reduction in exercise price.

         o        That at the end of the DKR Exercise Period, we will issue to
                  DKR warrants to purchase a number of shares of Common Stock
                  equal to the number of shares purchased by DKR during the DKR
                  Exercise Period at an exercise price of $1.50 per share (the
                  "NEW DKR WARRANTS").

         The DKR Amendments and the form of the New DKR Warrants are filed
herewith as Exhibits 99.1, 99.2 and 99.3 and are incorporated herein by
reference.

- ---------------------------------------------------------------

         On December 29, 2004, we entered into an agreement (the "GREENFIELD

                  December 29, 2004 until January 31, 2005 (the "GREENFIELD

         o        That the number of shares of Common Stock subject to the
                  Greenfield Warrant shall not be adjusted as a result of the
                  temporary reduction in exercise price.

         o        That section 2(b) of the Greenfield Warrant shall be amended
                  so as to prohibit the exercise of the Greenfield Warrants to
                  the extent that such issuance would result in Greenfield
                  beneficially owning more than 9.99% of the outstanding shares
                  of Common Stock.

         The Greenfield Amendment is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.4 and is

         On September 22, 2004, we issued warrants, substantially the same in

Amendment to Warrants issued to Southridge Partners LP
- ------------------------------------------------------

         On December 29, 2004, we entered into an agreement (the "SOUTHRIDGE
AMENDMENT") with Southridge Partners LP ("SOUTHRIDGE") to amend the terms of a
warrant issued to Southridge on November 9, 2004 (the "SOUTHRIDGE WARRANT") for
the purchase of up to 568,750 shares of Common Stock in connection with our

         o        That section 11(a) of the Southridge Warrant shall be deleted
                  in its entirety so as to eliminate restrictions on the ability
                  of Southridge to exercise the Southridge Warrants based on the
                  number of shares of Common Stock beneficially owned by
                  Southridge.

         The Southridge Amendment is filed herewith as Exhibit 99.5 and is

ITEM 7.01         REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE

         We have identified a potential acquisition candidate, and we are
currently negotiating the terms of that potential acquisition. This acquisition
candidate is a privately held company with expertise in imaging and surveillance
whose primary customer is the U.S. Department of Defense. No assurances can be
given that this acquisition will be completed, however, if it is completed it
may be deemed to be the acquisition of a significant subsidiary requiring the
filing of a report on form 8-k. We expect the acquisition price to be
approximately $10,000,000 to be paid in a combination of cash and securities. To
finance the acquisition we expect to raise additional cash through sales of our
securities. If we are able to obtain financing, it may be on terms that are
dilutive to our existing stockholders and may limit, among other things, our
ability to acquire other businesses, invest in capital assets, sell or otherwise
dispose of our existing assets or incur additional indebtedness. We expect to
make this acquisition by acquiring majority ownership of a publicly traded
entity and using that entity to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of
the acquisition candidate. If we are successful, we will own a majority interest
in a publicly traded company.

         We may be unable to successfully negotiate or finance this proposed
acquisition, or, if the acquisition is consummated, effectively manage the
acquired business to realize benefits from the acquisition. The negotiation of
this acquisition and the management of the acquired business may require a
disproportionate amount of management's attention and resources. Furthermore,
the success of this acquisition may also depend upon a variety of other factors
including our ability to estimate accurately future production, future revenues,
and possible future liabilities. Even though we will perform a review of the
business and operations of the acquisition candidate prior to any closing, it
may not reveal all existing or potential problems or permit us to become
familiar enough with the business to accurately asses its potential or its
deficiencies.

         We are uncertain how long negotiations with the acquisition candidate
will take before we determine whether or not we will consummate the proposed
acquisition. Unless required by law, we do not intend to make any further
announcements concerning this potential acquisition.

         The information contained herein is furnished pursuant to Item 7.01 of
Form 8-K and shall not be deemed to be "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 or otherwise subject to the liabilities of
that Section, unless we specifically incorporate it by reference in a document
filed under the Securities Act of 1933 or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
By filing this Current Report on Form 8-K and furnishing this information, we
make no admission as to the materiality of any information in this Current
Report on Form 8-K.
