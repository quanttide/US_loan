threat or commencement of any action, such indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is
to be made against an indemnifying party under this Section&nbsp;7.3, promptly notify the indemnifying
party in writing of the claim; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party will not
relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party for contribution or
otherwise under the indemnity agreement contained in this Section&nbsp;7.3 or to the extent it is not
prejudiced as a result of such failure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(b)&nbsp;</B>In case any such action is brought against any indemnified party and such indemnified

indemnifying parties similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably
satisfactory to such indemnified party; <I>provided, however</I>, if the defendants in any such action

reasonably concluded that there may be a conflict between the positions of the indemnifying party

defenses available to it or other indemnified parties that are different from or additional to
those available to the indemnifying party, the indemnified party or parties shall have the right to
select separate counsel to assume such legal defenses and to otherwise participate in the defense
of such action on behalf of such indemnified party or parties. Upon receipt of notice from the
indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense of such
action and approval by the indemnified party of counsel, the indemnifying party will not be liable
to such indemnified party under this Section&nbsp;7.3 for any legal or other expenses subsequently
incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof unless:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(i) </B>the indemnified party shall have employed such counsel in connection with the assumption

counsel, approved by such indemnifying party representing all of the indemnified parties who are
parties to such action) or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>(ii) </B>the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel reasonably satisfactory to the

commencement of action, in each of which cases the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel shall be
at the expense of the indemnifying party. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.3, the

considerations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The respective relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and each Purchaser on
the other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the amount paid by such Purchaser to the

sold pursuant to the Registration Statement bears to the difference (the &#147;Difference&#148;) between the
amount such Purchaser paid for the Purchased Shares that were sold pursuant to the Registration
Statement and the amount received by such Purchaser from such sale. The relative fault of the
Company and each Purchaser shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission to state a
material fact or the inaccurate or the alleged inaccurate representation or warranty relates to
information supplied by the Company or by such Purchaser and the parties&#146; relative intent,
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.
The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of the losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses referred to above shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set forth in
Section&nbsp;7.3.3, any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in connection
with investigating or defending any action or claim. The provisions set forth in Section&nbsp;7.3.3
with respect to the notice of the threat or commencement of any threat or action shall apply if a
claim for contribution is to be made under this Section&nbsp;7.3.4; <I>provided, however</I>, that no
additional notice shall be required with respect to any threat or action for which notice has been
given under Section&nbsp;7.3 for purposes of indemnification. The Company and each Purchaser agree that
it would not be just and equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.3 were determined
solely by pro rata allocation (even if the Purchaser were treated as one entity for such purpose)
or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations
referred to in this paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;7.3, no Purchaser
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the Difference exceeds
the amount of any damages that such Purchaser has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of fraudulent
misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any person who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The
Purchasers&#146; obligations to contribute pursuant to this Section&nbsp;7.3 are several and not joint.

rendered herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any opinion herein relating to the Company&#146;s good standing is based solely upon the
above-referenced certificate of good standing and Articles of Incorporation as certified by the
Secretary of State of Ohio. With respect to other factual matters, we have relied exclusively upon
the facts provided to us by the Company and the representations and warranties contained in the
Purchase Agreement. Insofar as an opinion herein relates to our knowledge of factual matters set
forth in the Officers&#146; Certificate, we have relied solely upon such certificate with respect to the
accuracy of such matters and we have not independently verified or established the accuracy
thereof. In each place where the phrase &#147;to our knowledge&#148; or similar language appears, such
reference is based solely upon: (i)&nbsp;the certificates and documents expressly referred to herein,
including the Officers&#146; Certificate and (ii)&nbsp;the actual knowledge of the attorneys in this office
who have, as attorneys, devoted substantive attention to the transactions contemplated by the
Purchase Agreement (consisting solely of Thomas F. McKee, Arthur C. Hall III and Seth M. Jupin) and
of any other attorneys currently with our firm whom we have determined are likely, in the course of
representing any of said parties, to have knowledge of the matters covered by this opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering our opinions we have assumed the following:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;all records and documents examined by us in the preparation of this opinion are complete,
authentic and accurate;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;all signatures contained in such records and documents (other than the signatures of the
officers of the Company) are genuine signatures of the parties purporting to have signed the same;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;all natural persons signing such documents and records had, at the time of such signing,
full legal capacity to sign and deliver such documents;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;all documents submitted to us as copies in connection with our opinions conform to the
respective originals thereof;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;with respect to the Purchasers, each such Purchaser has all requisite power and authority
to enter into and to perform the Purchase Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;the execution, delivery and performance of the Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized
by each Purchaser and has been duly executed and delivered by each such Purchaser;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;the Purchase Agreement is the legal, valid and binding obligation of each Purchaser,
enforceable against such Purchaser in accordance with its terms;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;8.&nbsp;the execution, delivery and consummation of the Purchase Agreement by each Purchaser will
not (i)&nbsp;violate any provision of law applicable to such Purchaser, (ii)&nbsp;violate any order, judgment
or decree of any court or other agency of government binding on such Purchaser, or (iii)&nbsp;conflict
with, result in a breach of, constitute (with or without notice or lapse of time or both) a default

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;no action has been taken which amends, revokes or terminates any of the corporate or
organizational documents or records, certificates or representations which we have reviewed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon and subject to the foregoing, and based upon such investigation of law as we have
deemed necessary, and subject to the qualifications, exceptions, limitations and further
assumptions set forth below, we are of the opinion that:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;The Company is a corporation validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
State of Ohio. The Company has the requisite power to own or lease its property and assets and
conduct its business as currently conducted.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;The authorized capital stock of the Company consists of 25,000,000 Common Shares and
1,000,000 Serial Preferred Shares, the designation and terms of which may be established by
appropriate action of the Board of Directors. Relying solely on a certificate of the Company&#146;s
transfer agent, National City Bank, dated as of December &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;, 2004, the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of the Company as of September&nbsp;30, 2004 consisted of 6,101,532 Common
Shares. The issuance and sale of the Purchased Shares and the issuance of the Warrants pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized. When the Purchased Shares are issued and
delivered against payment of the consideration therefore in accordance with the Purchase Agreement,
such shares will be validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of any pre-emptive or
similar right. If any Warrant Shares are issued and delivered against payment of the consideration
therefore in accordance with the terms of the applicable Warrant, such shares will be validly
issued, fully paid and non-assessable and free of any pre-emptive or similar right.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;The Company has the requisite corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and perform
the Purchase Agreement and the Warrants and to consummate the transactions contemplated thereby.
The execution and delivery of the Purchase Agreement and the Warrants by the Company and the
consummation by it of the transactions contemplated thereby have been duly authorized by all
requisite corporate action of the Company. The Purchase Agreement and the Warrants have been duly
executed and delivered on behalf of the Company and each constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligation of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Neither the execution, delivery, performance nor consummation of the Purchase Agreement or
the Warrants by the Company will (a)&nbsp;conflict with, or result in a breach or a violation of, any
provision of the Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations of the Company or (b)&nbsp;constitute,
with or without notice or the passage of time or both, a breach, violation or default, or give rise
to any right of termination, modification, cancellation,

federal or Ohio statute, rule or regulation known to us, or, to our knowledge, any order, writ or
decree of any federal or state court, government or governmental agency or body having jurisdiction
over the Company or (2)&nbsp;any material agreement to which the Company is a party which was either
filed as an exhibit to the Company&#146;s periodic filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;The Company is not required to obtain any consent, approval or authorization of, or to make
any registration, declaration or filing with, any governmental entity or, to our knowledge, any
other third party as a condition to or in connection with the valid execution and delivery of the
Purchase Agreement or the Warrants or the consummation by the Company of its obligations under the
Purchase Agreement or the Warrants, except as may be necessary to qualify the sale of the Common
Shares or the Warrants under state securities or blue sky laws, including the filing of a Form&nbsp;D
pursuant to Regulation&nbsp;D (&#147;Regulation&nbsp;D&#148;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
&#147;Securities Act&#148;), and the filing of a Form&nbsp;D with the Securities Commissioners of the states in
which sales occur.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;6.&nbsp;Based on the representations of the Purchasers in Section&nbsp;5 of the Purchase Agreement, no
registration of the Purchased Shares or Warrants pursuant to the Securities Act is required for the
offer and sale thereof by the Company in the manner and under the circumstances contemplated by
reason of the exemption contained in Section&nbsp;4(2) of such act, and the offer and sale of the
Purchased Shares and the Warrants as contemplated by the Purchase Agreement has been and is being
made in compliance with applicable state securities laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;7.&nbsp;Relying solely on the representations in the Officers&#146; Certificate, there is no litigation
pending or threatened against the Company or involving any of its respective properties or assets
by or before any court or other governmental entity which would reasonably be expected to have a
material adverse effect on the Company, or which questions the validity or enforceability of, or
seeks to enjoin or invalidate, the Purchase Agreement or any action to be taken by the Company in
connection therewith.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing opinions are subject to the following further assumptions, limitations,

avoidance, reorganization, bulk transfer, moratorium or similar laws affecting the rights of
creditors generally, including, without limitation, statutory and other laws regarding fraudulent
transfers and conveyances and preferential transfers, and (ii)&nbsp;general principles of equity
(regardless of whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law). Moreover, the exercise of
the rights and remedies under the Purchase Agreement or Warrants could be subject to limitation if
(i)&nbsp;the enforcement of such rights and remedies by the Purchasers is not reasonably necessary for
the protection of the Purchasers, (ii)&nbsp;the penalties imposed bear no reasonable relation to the
damages suffered by the Purchasers, (iii)&nbsp;the enforcement of the rights and remedies violates the
obligations of the Purchasers of fair dealing and to act reasonably and in good faith, or would be
commercially unreasonable, (iv)&nbsp;any defaults or breaches by the Company are deemed by a court not
to be material, or (v)&nbsp;a court having jurisdiction finds that

the federal laws of the United States, state laws or public policy.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;We express no opinion as to the validity, binding effect or enforceability of any
provision in the Purchase Agreement or the Warrants to the extent that such provision: (i)&nbsp;purports
to waive any requirement of diligent performance or other care on any Purchaser&#146;s part, (ii)
provides that delays or course of dealing will not operate as a waiver or that a waiver must be in
writing, (iii)&nbsp;provides for the payment of attorneys&#146; fees, (iv)&nbsp;provides for the establishment of
evidentiary standards, (v)&nbsp;attempts to modify or waive any defenses that the Company may have
either at law or in equity, and (vi)&nbsp;provides for the waiver of objections to jurisdiction, venue
or statute of limitations or provides for a choice of governing laws other than the laws of the
State of Ohio.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;We express no opinion with respect to (i)&nbsp;the accuracy or completeness of any information
provided by the Company to the Purchasers regarding the Company or (ii)&nbsp;compliance by the Company

the effect of any noncompliance with such laws on the Purchase Agreement or the Warrants. With
respect to the opinion expressed in paragraph 6, we have assumed the accuracy of the
representations made by the Company&#146;s placement agent (the &#147;Placement Agent&#148;) in its placement
agency agreement with the Company, including that the Placement Agent has not taken any action in
connection with the sale of the Purchased Shares and the issuance of the Warrants as contemplated
by the Purchase Agreement which would cause such sale and issuance not to comply with Regulation&nbsp;D.
Further, the opinion expressed in paragraph 6 above shall not be construed as being applicable to
any subsequent sale of Purchased Shares or Warrant Shares, with respect to which we render no
opinion.

of Common Shares purchased hereunder on the date this Warrant is validly exercised pursuant to the
terms of subsection (a)&nbsp;above (the &#147;Exercise Date&#148;), irrespective of the date of delivery of the

stock transfer books of the Company are closed, such person will be deemed to have become the
holder of such shares at the close of business on the next succeeding date on which the stock

registered Holder becomes a registered Holder only upon delivery to the Company of the original

any class of common shares of the Company and any other stock of the Company, however designated,
that has the right to participate in any distribution of the assets or earnings of the Company

series of preferred stock).

number of shares, (iii)&nbsp;combine its outstanding shares of Common Shares into a smaller number of
shares, or (iv)&nbsp;issue by reclassification of its shares of Common Shares other securities of the
Company, then the Warrant Price in effect at the time of the record date for such dividend or on
the effective date of such subdivision, combination or reclassification, and/or the number and kind
of securities issuable on such date, shall be proportionately adjusted so that the Holder of any
Warrant thereafter exercised shall be entitled to receive the aggregate number and kind of shares
of Common Shares (or such other securities other than Common Shares) of the Company, at the same
aggregate Warrant Price, that, if such Warrant had been exercised immediately prior to such date,
the Holder would have owned upon such exercise and been entitled to receive by virtue of such
dividend, distribution, subdivision, combination or reclassification. Such adjustment shall be
made successively whenever any event listed above shall occur.

assets, or subscription rights or warrants, the Warrant Price to be in effect after such record
date shall be determined by multiplying the Warrant Price in effect immediately prior to such
record date by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the current market price per share of
Common Shares on such record date, less the amount of cash so to be distributed (or the fair market

fixed; and in the event that such distribution is not so made, the Warrant Price shall again be
adjusted to be the Warrant Price which would then be in effect if such record date had not been
fixed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;For the purpose of any computation under any subsection of this Section&nbsp;4 or under any
subsection of Section&nbsp;2, the &#147;current market price&#148; per share of Common Shares on any date shall be
the per share price of the Common Shares on the trading day immediately prior to the event
requiring an adjustment hereunder and shall be: (i)&nbsp;if the principal trading market for such
securities is a national or regional securities exchange, the closing price on such exchange on
such day; or (ii)&nbsp;if sales prices for shares of Common Shares are reported by the Nasdaq National
Market or Nasdaq Small Cap Market (or a similar system then in use), the last reported sales price
so reported on such day; or (iii)&nbsp;if neither (i)&nbsp;nor (ii)&nbsp;above are applicable, and if bid and ask
prices for shares of Common Shares are reported in the over-the-counter market by Nasdaq (or, if
not so reported, by the National Quotation Bureau), the average of the high bid and low ask prices
so reported on such day. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if there is no reported closing price,
last reported sales price, or bid and ask prices, as the case may be, for the day in question, then
the current market price shall be determined as of the latest date prior to such day for which such
closing price, last reported sales price, or bid and ask prices, as the case may be, are available,
unless such securities have not been traded on an exchange or in the over-the-counter market for 30
or more days immediately prior to the day in question, in which case the current market price shall
be determined in good faith by, and reflected in a formal resolution of, the Board of Directors of
the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, no adjustment in the Warrant Price
shall be required unless such adjustment would require an increase or decrease of at least 1% in
the Warrant Price; provided, however, that any adjustments which by reason of this subsection (d)
are not required to be made shall be carried forward and taken into account in any subsequent
adjustment. All calculations under this Section&nbsp;4 shall be made to the nearest cent or the nearest
one-hundredth of a share, as the case may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;In the event that at any time, as a result of an adjustment made pursuant to subsection
(a)&nbsp;above, the Holder of any Warrant thereafter exercised shall become entitled to receive any
shares of capital stock of the Company other than shares of Common Shares, thereafter the number of
such other shares so receivable upon exercise of any Warrant shall be subject to adjustment from
time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly equivalent as practicable to the provisions with
respect to the shares of Common Shares contained in this Section&nbsp;4, and the other provisions of
this Warrant shall apply on like terms to any such other shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;If the Company merges or consolidates into or with another corporation or entity, or if
another corporation or entity merges into or with the Company (excluding such a merger in which the
Company is the surviving or continuing corporation and which does not result in any
reclassification, conversion, exchange, or cancellation of the outstanding shares of Common
Shares), or if all or substantially all of the assets or business of the Company are sold or

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">(To be Executed by the Holder to Exercise the Rights To Purchase Common Shares Evidenced by the
Within Warrant)


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned hereby irrevocably subscribes for <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u>shares (the &#147;Shares&#148;) of the Common
Shares of DATATRAK International, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) pursuant to and in accordance with the terms
and conditions of the attached Warrant (the &#147;Warrant&#148;), and hereby exercises the Warrant:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;by making payment herewith of $<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> for the Shares ($<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> per Share) by tendering
cash, wire transferring or delivering a certified check or bank cashier&#146;s check, payable to the
order of the Company; or


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;in a &#147;cashless&#148; or &#147;net-issue exercise&#148; for, and to purchase the Shares (the &#147;Deliverable
Shares&#148;), and herewith makes payment therefor with <u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> Surrendered Shares (as defined in the
Warrant). Pursuant to Section&nbsp;2 of the Warrant, the undersigned attributed a value of $<u>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</u> per
Surrendered Share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The undersigned requests that a certificate for the Shares be issued in the name of the
undersigned and be delivered to the undersigned at the address stated below. If the Shares are not
all of the shares purchasable pursuant to the Warrant, the undersigned requests that a new Warrant
of like tenor for the balance of the remaining shares purchasable thereunder be delivered to the
undersigned at the address stated below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the issuance of the Shares, I hereby represent to the Company that I am
acquiring the Shares for my own account for investment and not with a view to, or for resale in
connection with, a distribution of the shares within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that because the Shares may not be registered at the time of exercise of the
Warrant under the Securities Act, I must hold such Shares indefinitely unless the Shares are
subsequently registered and qualified under the Securities Act or is exempt from such registration
and qualification. I shall make no transfer or disposition of the Shares unless (a)&nbsp;such transfer
or disposition can be made without registration under the Securities Act by reason of a specific
exemption from such registration and such qualification, or (b)&nbsp;a registration statement has been
filed pursuant to the Securities Act and has been declared effective with respect to such
disposition.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the event the Shares are not registered at the time of exercise of the Warrant, I agree
that each certificate representing the Shares delivered to me shall bear substantially the same
legend as set forth on the front page of the Warrant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further agree that the Company may place stop orders on the certificates evidencing the
Shares with the transfer agent, if any, to the same effect as the above legend. The legend and
stop transfer notice referred to above shall be removed only upon my furnishing to the Company of
an opinion of counsel (reasonably satisfactory to the Company) to the effect that such legend may
be removed.
