Laguna Hills, CA &#151; December&nbsp;20, 2004 &#151; Interchange Corporation (NASDAQ: INCX), a leading
provider of local and national paid-search services, today announced it has entered into an
agreement to sell 822,000 shares of its common stock to institutional investors for $18.25 per
share in a private placement transaction. The gross proceeds of approximately $15&nbsp;million are
expected to be used to fund the expansion of the company&#146;s paid search business. The private
placement is expected to close prior to December&nbsp;31, 2004 and is subject to customary closing
conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In connection with the sale of common stock, the company also issued to the investors warrants to
purchase up to 164,400 additional shares of the company&#146;s common stock at a price of $25.53,
exercisable for a period of five years after the closing date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The shares will not be registered under the Securities Act, or any state securities laws, and will
be sold in a private transaction under Regulation&nbsp;D. Unless the shares are registered, they may not
be offered or sold in the United States except pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state laws. Interchange has agreed to file a
registration statement covering resale by investors of the privately placed common stock, including
the common stock issuable upon conversion of the warrants discussed above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of an offer to buy any
security and shall not constitute an offer, solicitation or sale of any securities in any
jurisdiction in which such offer, solicitation or sale would be unlawful prior to registration or
qualification under the security laws of such jurisdiction.
