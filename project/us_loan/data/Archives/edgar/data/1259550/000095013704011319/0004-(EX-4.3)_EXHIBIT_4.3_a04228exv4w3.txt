The Company shall cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective

<PAGE>

Registration Statement, then the Company shall prepare and file by the Filing

continuous basis pursuant to Rule 415, on Form SB-2 (or on such other form

Distribution" attached hereto as Annex A. The Company shall cause each such
Registration Statement to be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon
as possible but, in any event, by its Effectiveness Date, and shall use its
reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement continuously
effective under the Securities Act during the entire Effectiveness Period.

                  (c) Promptly following any date on which the Company becomes
eligible to use a registration statement on Form S-3 to register the Registrable
Securities for resale, the Company shall file a registration statement on Form
S-3 covering the Registrable Securities (or a post-effective amendment on Form
S-3 to the then effective Registration Statement) and shall cause such
Registration Statement to be declared effective as soon as possible thereafter,
but in any event prior to the Effectiveness Date therefor. Such Registration
Statement shall contain (except if otherwise required pursuant to written
comments received from the Commission upon a review of such Registration
Statement) the "Plan of Distribution" attached hereto as Annex A. The Company
shall cause such Registration Statement to be declared effective under the
Securities Act as soon as possible but, in any event, by its Effectiveness Date,
and shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep such Registration Statement
continuously effective under the Securities Act during the entire Effectiveness
Period.

                  (d) If: (i) a Registration Statement is not filed on or prior
to its Filing Date, or (ii) a Registration Statement is not declared effective
by the Commission on or prior to its required Effectiveness Date, or (iii) after
its Effective Date, without regard for the reason thereunder or efforts
therefore, such Registration Statement ceases for any reason to be effective and
available to the Holders as to all Registrable Securities to which it is
required to cover at any time prior to the expiration of its Effectiveness
Period for more than an aggregate of 45 Trading Days (which need not be
consecutive) (any such failure or breach being referred to as an "EVENT," and
for purposes of clauses (i) or (ii) the date on which such Event occurs, or for
purposes of clause (iii) the date which such 45 Trading Day-period is exceeded,
being referred to as "EVENT DATE"), then in addition to any other rights the
Holders may have hereunder or under applicable law: (x) on each such Event Date
the Company shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash, as partial liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.5% of the aggregate Investment Amount
paid by such Holder for Shares pursuant to the Purchase Agreement; and (y) on
each monthly anniversary of each such Event Date (if the applicable Event shall
not have been cured by such date) until the applicable Event is cured, the
Company shall pay to each Holder an amount in cash, as partial liquidated
damages and not as a penalty, equal to 1.5% of the aggregate Investment Amount
paid by such Holder for Securities pursuant to the Purchase Agreement. The
parties agree that the Company will not be liable for liquidated damages under
this Section in respect of the Warrants. If the Company fails to pay any partial
liquidated damages pursuant to this Section in full within seven days after the
date payable, the Company will pay interest thereon at a rate of 10% per annum
(or such lesser maximum amount that is permitted to be paid by applicable law)
to the Holder, accruing daily from the date such partial

                                       B-4
<PAGE>

liquidated damages are due until such amounts, plus all such interest thereon,
are paid in full. The partial liquidated damages pursuant to the terms hereof
shall apply on a daily pro-rata basis for any portion of a month prior to the
cure of an Event, except in the case of the first Event Date. Notwithstanding
the other provisions of this Section 2, in no event shall the Company be liable
for partial liquidated damages under this Section 2(d) to any Holder in excess
of 10.5% of the Investment Amount paid by such Holder for Securities pursuant to
the Purchase Agreement.

                  (e) Each Holder agrees to furnish to the Company a completed
Questionnaire in the form attached to this Agreement as Annex B (a "SELLING
HOLDER QUESTIONNAIRE"). The Company shall not be required to include the
Registrable Securities of a Holder in a Registration Statement and shall not be
required to pay any liquidated or other damages under Section 2(d) to any Holder
who fails to furnish to the Company a fully completed Selling Holder
Questionnaire at least two Trading Days prior to the Filing Date (subject to the
requirements set forth in Section 3(a)).

         3. Registration Procedures.

                  In connection with the Company's registration obligations
hereunder, the Company shall:

                  (a) Not less than four Trading Days prior to the filing of a
Registration Statement or any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto, the Company shall furnish to each Holder copies of the "Selling
Stockholders" section of such document, the "Plan of Distribution" and any risk
factor contained in such document that addresses specifically this transaction
or the Selling Stockholders, as proposed to be filed which documents will be
subject to the review of such Holder. The Company shall not file a Registration
Statement, any Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto in which the
"Selling Stockholder" section thereof differs from the disclosure received from
a Holder in its Selling Holder Questionnaire (as amended or supplemented).

                  (b) (i) Prepare and file with the Commission such amendments,
including post-effective amendments, to each Registration Statement and the
Prospectus used in connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable
Securities for its Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the Commission
such additional Registration Statements in order to register for resale under
the Securities Act all of the Registrable Securities; (ii) cause the related
Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement,
and as so supplemented or amended to be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (iii)
respond as promptly as reasonably possible to any comments received from the
Commission with respect to each Registration Statement or any amendment thereto
and, as promptly as reasonably possible provide the Holders true and complete
copies of all correspondence from and to the Commission relating to such
Registration Statement that would not result in the disclosure to the Holders of
material and non-public information concerning the Company; and (iv) comply in
all material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange
Act with respect to the Registration Statements and the disposition of all
Registrable Securities covered by each Registration Statement.

                                       B-5
<PAGE>

                  (c) Notify the Holders as promptly as reasonably possible
(and, in the case of (i)(A) below, not less than three Trading Days prior to
such filing) and (if requested by any such Person) confirm such notice in
writing no later than one Trading Day following the day (i)(A) when a Prospectus
or any Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration
Statement is proposed to be filed; (B) when the Commission notifies the Company
whether there will be a "review" of such Registration Statement and whenever the
Commission comments in writing on such Registration Statement (the Company shall
provide true and complete copies thereof and all written responses thereto to
each of the Holders that pertain to the Holders as a Selling Stockholder or to
the Plan of Distribution, but not information which the Company believes would
constitute material and non-public information); and (C) with respect to each
Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment, when the same has become
effective; (ii) of any request by the Commission or any other Federal or state
governmental authority for amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement
or Prospectus or for additional information; (iii) of the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration
Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the initiation of
any Proceedings for that purpose; (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification or exemption
from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in any
jurisdiction, or the initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such
purpose; and (v) of the occurrence of any event or passage of time that makes
the financial statements included in a Registration Statement ineligible for
inclusion therein or any statement made in such Registration Statement or
Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference untrue in any material respect or that requires any revisions to such
Registration Statement, Prospectus or other documents so that, in the case of
such Registration Statement or the Prospectus, as the case may be, it will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

                  (d) Use its reasonable best efforts to avoid the issuance of,
or, if issued, obtain the withdrawal of (i) any order suspending the
effectiveness of a Registration Statement, or (ii) any suspension of the
qualification (or exemption from qualification) of any of the Registrable
Securities for sale in any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment.

                  (e) Furnish to each Holder, without charge, at least one
conformed copy of each Registration Statement and each amendment thereto and all
exhibits to the extent requested by such Person (including those previously
furnished) promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission.

                  (f) Promptly deliver to each Holder, without charge, as many
copies of each Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of prospectus)
and each amendment or supplement thereto as such Persons may reasonably request.
The Company hereby consents to the use of such Prospectus and each amendment or
supplement thereto by each of the selling Holders in connection with the
offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and
any amendment or supplement thereto.

                  (g) Prior to any public offering of Registrable Securities, to
register or qualify or cooperate with the selling Holders in connection with the
registration or qualification (or

                                       B-6
<PAGE>

exemption from such registration or qualification) of such Registrable
Securities for offer and sale under the securities or Blue Sky laws of all
jurisdictions within the United States, to keep each such registration or
qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during the Effectiveness Period
and to do any and all other acts or things necessary or advisable to enable the
disposition in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the
Registration Statements.

                  (h) Cooperate with the Holders to facilitate the timely
preparation and delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to
be delivered to a transferee pursuant to the Registration Statements, which
certificates shall be free, to the extent permitted by the Purchase Agreement,
of all restrictive legends, and to enable such Registrable Securities to be in
such denominations and registered in such names as any such Holders may request.

                  (i) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section
3(c)(v), as promptly as reasonably possible, prepare a supplement or amendment,
including a post-effective amendment, to the affected Registration Statements or
a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or deemed to
be incorporated therein by reference, and file any other required document so
that, as thereafter delivered, no Registration Statement nor any Prospectus will
contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in
light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

         4. Registration Expenses. All fees and expenses incident to the
performance of or compliance with this Agreement by the Company shall be borne
by the Company whether or not any Registrable Securities are sold pursuant to a
Registration Statement. The fees and expenses referred to in the foregoing

<PAGE>

Person who controls any such Holder (within the meaning of Section 15 of the

agents and employees of each such controlling Person, to the fullest extent
permitted by applicable law, from and against any and all losses, claims,
damages, liabilities, costs (including, without limitation, reasonable costs of
preparation and reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively,
"LOSSES"), as incurred, arising out of or relating to any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement or
any Prospectus, or arising out of or relating to any omission or alleged
omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
the statements therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form of prospectus or
supplement thereto, in light of the circumstances under which they were made)
not misleading, except to the extent, but only to the extent, that (1) such
untrue statements or omissions are based solely upon information regarding such
Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use
therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such
Holder's proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was
reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly for use in
the Registration Statement, such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or in any
amendment or supplement thereto (it being understood that the Holder has
approved Annex A hereto for this purpose) or (2) in the case of an occurrence of
an event of the type specified in Section 3(c)(ii)-(v), the use by such Holder
of an outdated or defective Prospectus after the Company has notified such
Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the
receipt by such Holder of an Advice or an amended or supplemented Prospectus,
but only if and to the extent that following the receipt of the Advice or the
amended or supplemented Prospectus the misstatement or omission giving rise to
such Loss would have been corrected. The Company shall notify the Holders
promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any Proceeding of which the
Company is aware in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement.

                  (b) Indemnification by Holders. Each Holder shall, severally
and not jointly, indemnify and hold harmless the Company, its directors,
officers, agents and employees, each Person who controls the Company (within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act),
and the directors, officers, agents or employees of such controlling Persons, to
the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against all Losses, as
incurred, arising solely out of or based solely upon: (x) such Holder's failure
to comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act or (y)
any untrue statement of a material fact contained in any Registration Statement,
any Prospectus, or any form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement
thereto, or arising solely out of or based solely upon any omission of a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading to the extent, but only to the extent that, (1) such
untrue statements or omissions are based solely upon information regarding such
Holder furnished in writing to the Company by such Holder expressly for use
therein, or to the extent that such information relates to such Holder or such
Holder's proposed method of distribution of Registrable Securities and was
reviewed and expressly approved in writing by such Holder expressly for use in
the Registration Statement (it being understood that the Holder has approved
Annex A hereto for this purpose), such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or
in any amendment or supplement thereto or (2) in the case of an occurrence of an
event of the type specified in Section 3(c)(ii)-(v), the use by such Holder of
an outdated or defective Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder
in writing that the Prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt
by such Holder of an Advice or an amended or supplemented

                                       B-8
<PAGE>

Prospectus, but only if and to the extent that following the receipt of the
Advice or the amended or supplemented Prospectus the misstatement or omission
giving rise to such Loss would have been corrected. In no event shall the
liability of any selling Holder hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar
amount of the net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the
Registrable Securities giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

                  (c) Conduct of Indemnification Proceedings. If any Proceeding
shall be brought or asserted against any Person entitled to indemnity hereunder
(an "INDEMNIFIED PARTY"), such Indemnified Party shall promptly notify the
Person from whom indemnity is sought (the "INDEMNIFYING PARTY") in writing, and
the Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the
employment of counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the
payment of all fees and expenses incurred in connection with defense thereof;
provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to
this Agreement, except (and only) to the extent that it shall be finally
determined by a court of competent jurisdiction (which determination is not
subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have proximately
and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

                  An Indemnified Party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof, but
the fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such
Indemnified Party or Parties unless: (1) the Indemnifying Party has agreed in
writing to pay such fees and expenses; (2) the Indemnifying Party shall have
failed promptly to assume the defense of such Proceeding and to employ counsel
reasonably satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding; or (3)
the named parties to any such Proceeding (including any impleaded parties)
include both such Indemnified Party and the Indemnifying Party, and such
Indemnified Party shall have been advised by counsel that a conflict of interest
is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified Party
and the Indemnifying Party (in which case, if such Indemnified Party notifies
the Indemnifying Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume the defense thereof and such counsel shall be at the expense of
the Indemnifying Party). The Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any
settlement of any such Proceeding effected without its written consent, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. No Indemnifying Party shall, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any
pending Proceeding in respect of which any Indemnified Party is a party, unless
such settlement includes an unconditional release of such Indemnified Party from
all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.

                  All fees and expenses of the Indemnified Party (including
reasonable fees and expenses to the extent incurred in connection with
investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding in a manner not
inconsistent with this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified Party, as
incurred, within ten Trading Days of written notice thereof to the Indemnifying
Party (regardless of whether it is ultimately determined that an Indemnified
Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder; provided, that the
Indemnifying Party may require such Indemnified Party to undertake to reimburse
all such fees and expenses to the extent it is finally judicially determined
that such Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification hereunder).

<PAGE>

                  (d) Contribution. If a claim for indemnification under Section
5(a) or 5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party (by reason of public policy
or otherwise), then each Indemnifying Party, in lieu of indemnifying such
Indemnified Party, shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such Losses, in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying Party and
Indemnified Party in connection with the actions, statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
The relative fault of such Indemnifying Party and Indemnified Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things, whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to
information supplied by, such Indemnifying Party or Indemnified Party, and the
parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent such action, statement or omission. The amount paid or
payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject
to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c), any reasonable attorneys' or other
reasonable fees or expenses incurred by such party in connection with any
Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or
expenses if the indemnification provided for in this Section was available to
such party in accordance with its terms.

                  The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section 5(d) were determined by pro
rata allocation or by any other method of allocation that does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding
paragraph. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), no Holder shall
be required to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount
by which the proceeds actually received by such Holder from the sale of the
Registrable Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any
damages that such Holder has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such
untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission.

                  The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this
Section are in addition to any liability that the Indemnifying Parties may have
to the Indemnified Parties.

         6. Miscellaneous.

                  (a) Remedies. In the event of a breach by the Company or by a
Holder, of any of their obligations under this Agreement, each Holder or the
Company, as the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all
rights granted by law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages,
will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The
Company and each Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide adequate
compensation for any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the
provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any
action for specific performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

                  (b) No Piggyback on Registrations. Except as and to the extent
specified in Schedule 3.1(u) to the Purchase Agreement, neither the Company nor
any of its security holders (other than the Holders in such capacity pursuant
hereto) may include securities of the Company in a Registration Statement other
than the Registrable Securities, and the Company shall not

                                      B-10
<PAGE>

during the Registration Period enter into any agreement providing any such right
to any of its security holders.

                  (c) Compliance. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will
comply with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as
applicable to it in connection with sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to
the Registration Statement.

                  (d) Discontinued Disposition. Each Holder agrees by its
acquisition of such Registrable Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from
the Company of the occurrence of any event of the kind described in Section
3(c), such Holder will forthwith discontinue disposition of such Registrable
Securities under the Registration Statement until such Holder's receipt of the
copies of the supplemented Prospectus and/or amended Registration Statement or
until it is advised in writing (the "ADVICE") by the Company that the use of the
applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in either case, has received copies
of any additional or supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or Registration Statement. The
Company may provide appropriate stop orders to enforce the provisions of this
paragraph.

                  (e) Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement,
including the provisions of this Section 6(e), may not be amended, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may not be given, unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company
and the Holders of no less than a majority in interest of the then outstanding
Registrable Securities. Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to
depart from the provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates
exclusively to the rights of certain Holders and that does not directly or
indirectly affect the rights of other Holders may be given by Holders of at
least a majority of the Registrable Securities to which such waiver or consent
relates.

                  (f) Notices. Any and all notices or other communications or
deliveries required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be in writing
and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (a) the date of

                                      To the address of such Holder as it
                                      appears in the stock transfer books

or such other address as may be designated in writing hereafter, in the same
manner, by such Person.

                  (g) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors and permitted assigns of each of
the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each Holder. The Company may not
assign its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Holder. Each Holder may assign their respective rights hereunder in the
manner and to the Persons as permitted under the Purchase Agreement.

                  (h) Execution and Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed
in any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to
be an original and, all of which taken together shall constitute one and the
same Agreement. In the event that any signature is delivered by facsimile
transmission, such signature shall create a valid binding obligation of the
party executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) the same with
the same force and effect as if such facsimile signature were the original
thereof.

                  (i) Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction,
validity, enforcement and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by
and construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of
New York, without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each
party agrees that all Proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement
and defense of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (whether brought
against a party hereto or its respective Affiliates, employees or agents) will
be commenced in the New York Courts. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably
submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York Courts for the
adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith or with any
transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby irrevocably
waives, and agrees not to assert in any Proceeding, any claim that it is not
personally subject to the jurisdiction of any New York Court, or that such
Proceeding has been commenced in an improper or inconvenient forum. Each party
hereto hereby irrevocably waives personal service of process and consents to
process being served in any such Proceeding by mailing a copy thereof via
registered or certified mail or overnight delivery (with evidence of delivery)
to such party at the address in effect for notices to it under this Agreement
and agrees that such service shall constitute good and sufficient service of
process and notice thereof. Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to limit in
any way any right to serve process in any

                                      B-12
<PAGE>

manner permitted by law. Each party hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the
fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any and all right to trial by jury
in any Proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby. If either party shall commence a Proceeding to
enforce any provisions of this Agreement, then the prevailing party in such
Proceeding shall be reimbursed by the other party for its attorney's fees and
other costs and expenses incurred with the investigation, preparation and
prosecution of such Proceeding.

                  (j) Cumulative Remedies. The remedies provided herein are
cumulative and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

                  (k) Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or
restriction of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable, the remainder of the terms, provisions,
covenants and restrictions set forth herein shall remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties
hereto shall use their reasonable efforts to find and employ an alternative
means to achieve the same or substantially the same result as that contemplated
by such term, provision, covenant or restriction. It is hereby stipulated and
declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have executed the
remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of
such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

                  (l) Headings. The headings in this Agreement are for
convenience of reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the
meaning hereof.

                  (m) Independent Nature of Investors' Obligations and Rights.
The obligations of each Investor under this Agreement are several and not joint
with the obligations of each other Investor, and no Investor shall be
responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations of any other
Investor under this Agreement. Nothing contained herein or in any Transaction
Document, and no action taken by any Investor pursuant thereto, shall be deemed
to constitute the Investors as a partnership, an association, a joint venture or
any other kind of entity, or create a presumption that the Investors are in any
way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such obligations or the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any other Transaction Document.
Each Investor acknowledges that no other Investor will be acting as agent of
such Investor in enforcing its rights under this Agreement. Each Investor shall
be entitled to independently protect and enforce its rights, including without
limitation the rights arising out of this Agreement, and it shall not be
necessary for any other Investor to be joined as an additional party in any
Proceeding for such purpose. The Company acknowledges that each of the Investors
has been provided with the same Registration Rights Agreement for the purpose of
closing a transaction with multiple Investors and not because it was required or
requested to do so by any Investor.

                              Plan of Distribution

         The Selling Stockholders and any of their pledgees, donees,
transferees, assignees and successors-in-interest may, from time to time, sell
any or all of their shares of Common Stock on any stock exchange, market or
trading facility on which the shares are traded or in private transactions.
These sales may be at fixed or negotiated prices. The Selling Stockholders may
use any one or more of the following methods when selling shares:

- - ordinary brokerage transactions and transactions in which the broker-dealer
  solicits Investors;

- - block trades in which the broker-dealer will attempt to sell the shares as
  agent but may position and resell a portion of the block as principal to
  facilitate the transaction;

- - purchases by a broker-dealer as principal and resale by the broker-dealer for
  its account;

- - an exchange distribution in accordance with the rules of the applicable
  exchange;

- - privately negotiated transactions;

- - to cover short sales made after the date that this Registration Statement is
  declared effective by the Commission;

- - broker-dealers may agree with the Selling Stockholders to sell a specified
  number of such shares at a stipulated price per share;

- - a combination of any such methods of sale; and

- - any other method permitted pursuant to applicable law.

         The Selling Stockholders may also sell shares under Rule 144 under the
Securities Act, if available, rather than under this prospectus.

         Broker-dealers engaged by the Selling Stockholders may arrange for
other brokers-dealers to participate in sales. Broker-dealers may receive
commissions or discounts from the Selling Stockholders (or, if any broker-dealer
acts as agent for the purchaser of shares, from the purchaser) in amounts to be
negotiated. The Selling Stockholders do not expect these commissions and
discounts to exceed what is customary in the types of transactions involved.

         The Selling Stockholders may from time to time pledge or grant a
security interest in some or all of the Securities owned by them and, if they
default in the performance of their secured obligations, the pledgees or secured
parties may offer and sell shares of Common Stock from time to time under this
prospectus, or under an amendment to this prospectus under Rule 424(b)(3) or
other applicable provision of the Securities Act of 1933 amending the list of
selling stockholders to include the pledgee, transferee or other successors in
interest as selling stockholders under this prospectus.

                                        1
<PAGE>

         Upon the Company being notified in writing by a Selling Stockholder
that any material arrangement has been entered into with a broker-dealer for the
sale of Common Stock through a block trade, special offering, exchange
distribution or secondary distribution or a purchase by a broker or dealer, a
supplement to this prospectus will be filed, if required, pursuant to Rule
424(b) under the Securities Act, disclosing (i) the name of each such Selling
Stockholder and of the participating broker-dealer(s), (ii) the number of shares
involved, (iii) the price at which such the shares of Common Stock were sold,
(iv)the commissions paid or discounts or concessions allowed to such
broker-dealer(s), where applicable, (v) that such broker-dealer(s) did not
conduct any investigation to verify the information set out or incorporated by
reference in this prospectus, and (vi) other facts material to the transaction.
In addition, upon the Company being notified in writing by a Selling Stockholder
that a donee or pledgee intends to sell more than 500 shares of Common Stock, a
supplement to this prospectus will be filed if then required in accordance with
applicable securities law.

         The Selling Stockholders also may transfer the shares of Common Stock
in other circumstances, in which case the transferees, pledgees or other
successors in interest will be the selling beneficial owners for purposes of
this prospectus.

         The Selling Stockholders and any broker-dealers or agents that are
involved in selling the shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the
meaning of the Securities Act in connection with such sales. In such event, any
commissions received by such broker-dealers or agents and any profit on the
resale of the shares purchased by them may be deemed to be underwriting
commissions or discounts under the Securities Act. Discounts, concessions,
commissions and similar selling expenses, if any, that can be attributed to the
sale of Securities will be paid by the Selling Stockholder and/or the
purchasers. Each Selling Stockholder has represented and warranted to the
Company that it acquired the securities subject to this registration statement
in the ordinary course of such Selling Stockholder's business and, at the time
of its purchase of such securities such Selling Stockholder had no agreements or
understandings, directly or indirectly, with any person to distribute any such
securities.

         The Company has advised each Selling Stockholder that it may not use
shares registered on this Registration Statement to cover short sales of Common
Stock made prior to the date on which this Registration Statement shall have
been declared effective by the Commission. If a Selling Stockholder uses this
prospectus for any sale of the Common Stock, it will be subject to the
prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act. The Selling Stockholders
will be responsible to comply with the applicable provisions of the Securities
Act and Exchange Act, and the rules and regulations thereunder promulgated,
including, without limitation, Regulation M, as applicable to such Selling
Stockholders in connection with resales of their respective shares under this
Registration Statement.

         The Company is required to pay all fees and expenses incident to the
registration of the shares, but the Company will not receive any proceeds from
the sale of the Common Stock. The Company has agreed to indemnify the Selling
Stockholders against certain losses, claims, damages and liabilities, including
liabilities under the Securities Act.
