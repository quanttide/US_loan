<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FIRST AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This First Amendment to Employment Agreement (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) is made and entered into as of
this 20th day of December&nbsp;2004 by and between Exelon Corporation, a Pennsylvania corporation (the
&#147;Company&#148;), and John W. Rowe (the &#147;Executive&#148;) as an amendment to the Amended and Restated
Employment Agreement between the Company and the Executive, dated as of November&nbsp;26, 2001 (the
&#147;Agreement&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, in connection with the transactions contemplated by the Agreement and Plan of Merger
between Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated and the Company dated as of the date hereof
(the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), as of the Effective Time (as defined in the Merger Agreement), the
Executive will continue to serve as the President and Chief Executive Officer of the Company and
Mr.&nbsp;E. James Ferland will be appointed as the Chairman of the Board of the Company, in each case on
the terms and conditions set forth in the Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company set forth as
an exhibit to the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Executive has agreed to such change in his position with the Company.

valuable consideration, the parties hereby amend the Agreement as set forth herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1.25 of the Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following at the end
thereof:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:12%; margin-right:15%; font-size: 10pt">Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, as of the Effective
Time of the Merger, as such terms are defined in the Agreement and
Plan of Merger between Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated,

and Mr.&nbsp;E. James Ferland will be appointed as the Chairman of the
Company Board, in each case on the terms and conditions set forth in
the Amended and Restated By-laws of the Company set forth as an
exhibit to the PSEG Merger Agreement. Such change in the
Executive&#146;s position and Mr.&nbsp;Ferland&#146;s appointment as Chairman of
the Company Board shall not constitute &#147;Good Reason&#148; or a &#147;Failure
to Appoint or Elect&#148; pursuant to this Section&nbsp;1.25; <U>provided
that</U> the Executive is reappointed to the office of Chairman of
the Company Board as of the earlier of (i)&nbsp;April&nbsp;1, 2007 and (ii)
the date that Mr.&nbsp;Ferland ceases to serve as Chairman of the Company
