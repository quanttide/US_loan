<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1 &#150; Registrant&#146;s Business and Operations.<BR>
Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2004, Exelon Corporation (&#147;Exelon&#148;) and Public Service Enterprise Group
Incorporated (&#147;PSEG&#148;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;).
Concurrently therewith, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (&#147;Generation&#148;) entered into an Operating
Services Contract with PSEG Nuclear LLC relating to the provision of operating services by
Generation in respect of PSEG&#146;s Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations. In addition,
concurrently therewith, Exelon entered into a first amendment to its employment agreement with John
W. Rowe, Exelon&#146;s current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2004,
Exelon and PSEG filed in separate reports a joint press release dated
December&nbsp;20, 2004 announcing the execution of the Merger
Agreement (the &#147;Press Release&#148;). &nbsp;A copy
of the Press Release is incorporated herein by reference to
Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 of Exelon&#146;s Current Report on Form 8-K,
File No.&nbsp;1-16169, filed on December&nbsp;20, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Merger Agreement</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Merger Agreement provides for a business combination whereby PSEG will be merged with and into
Exelon, with Exelon surviving (the &#147;Merger&#148;). At the effective time of and as a result of the
Merger, (i)&nbsp;each share of PSEG common stock (other than shares owned by Exelon or PSEG) will be
converted into the right to receive 1.225 shares of Exelon common stock (the &#147;Exchange Ratio&#148;) and
(ii)&nbsp;each share of Exelon common stock will remain outstanding. All outstanding PSEG stock options
will be converted into options to purchase the number of shares of Exelon common stock determined
by multiplying (a)&nbsp;the number of shares of PSEG common stock subject to such stock option
immediately prior to the effective time by (b)&nbsp;the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
of Exelon common stock equal to the exercise price per share of PSEG common stock under such stock
option immediately prior to the effective time divided by the Exchange Ratio.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Following the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will have an eighteen-member
board of directors, which will include twelve Exelon directors and six new members nominated by
PSEG. John W. Rowe, the current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon, will become the
President and Chief Executive Officer of the surviving corporation.
E. James Ferland, the current Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of PSEG, will become the non-executive Chairman of the Board of the surviving
corporation until his retirement on March&nbsp;31, 2007, at which time Mr.&nbsp;Rowe will become Chairman of
the surviving corporation.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Exelon and PSEG have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger
Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i)&nbsp;by PSEG not to
(a)&nbsp;solicit proposals relating to
alternative business combination transactions or (b)&nbsp;subject to certain exceptions, enter into
discussions concerning alternative business combination transactions, (ii)&nbsp;by Exelon and PSEG to
cause shareholder meetings to be held to consider approval of the Merger and related transactions,
(iii)&nbsp;subject to PSEG&#146;s right to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal (as
described in the Merger Agreement), for the board of directors of PSEG to recommend adoption and
approval by PSEG&#146;s shareholders of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and (iv)&nbsp;for the
board of directors of Exelon to recommend approval by Exelon&#146;s shareholders of the issuance of
shares of Exelon contemplated by the Merger Agreement subject to Exelon&#146;s board of directors&#146; right
to change its recommendation as required by its fiduciary duties.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Consummation of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including the requisite
approval by the shareholders of Exelon and PSEG, respectively, no legal impediment to the Merger,
the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the absence of a material adverse effect on Exelon,
PSEG or, prospectively, the surviving corporation and the absence of certain specified burdensome
actions as a condition to the regulatory approvals for the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains
certain termination rights for both Exelon and PSEG, and further provides that, upon termination of
the Merger Agreement, a termination fee may be payable under specified circumstances including (i)
if Exelon enters into a definitive agreement to be acquired, it must pay PSEG a termination fee of
$400&nbsp;million plus PSEG&#146;s transaction expenses up to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">$40&nbsp;million, (ii)&nbsp;if Exelon&#146;s board of
directors changes its recommendation, it must pay PSEG&#146;s
transactions expenses up to $40&nbsp;million
and (iii)&nbsp;if PSEG&#146;s board of directors changes its recommendation or if PSEG enters into a
definitive agreement for a superior proposal to be acquired it must pay Exelon a termination fee of
$400&nbsp;million plus Exelon&#146;s transaction expenses up to $40&nbsp;million.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Subsidiaries of Exelon and PSEG share ownership interests in certain nuclear facilities. Each of
the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2 is owned 57.41% by PSEG Nuclear LLC and 42.59%
by Generation. Each of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3 is owned 50% by PSEG
Nuclear LLC and 50% by Generation. PSEG Nuclear LLC is the operator of the Salem Nuclear
Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, and Generation is the operator of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power
Station, Units 2 and 3.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A copy of the Merger
Agreement is included herein as Exhibit&nbsp;2.1. &nbsp;The Merger Agreement is
incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Services Contract</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Operating Services Contract provides that, commencing on January&nbsp;17, 2005, Generation will
provide a chief nuclear officer and other key personnel to oversee daily plant operations at the
Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generating stations and to implement the Exelon Nuclear Management
Model, which defines practices that Exelon has used to manage its own nuclear performance
improvement program. PSEG Nuclear LLC will continue as the license holder with exclusive legal
authority to operate and maintain the plants, will retain responsibility for management oversight
and will have full authority with respect to the marketing of its share of the output from the
facilities. Generation will be entitled to receive reimbursement of its costs in discharging its
obligations, an annual operating services fee and incentive fees based on attainment of goals
relating to safety, capacity factors of the plants and operation and maintenance expenses. The
Operating Services Contract has a term of two years, subject to earlier termination in certain
events upon prior notice, including any termination of the Merger Agreement. In the event of
termination, Generation will continue to provide services under the Operating Services Contract for
a transition period of at least 180&nbsp;days and up to two years at the election of PSEG Nuclear LLC.
This period may be further extended by PSEG Nuclear LLC for up to an additional 12&nbsp;months if PSEG
Nuclear LLC determines that additional time is necessary to complete required activities during the
transition period.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A copy of the Operating Services Contract is included herein as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1. The Operating
Services Contract is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Operating
Services Contract is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Operating
Services Contract.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>First Amendment to Employment Agreement</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2004, Exelon and John W. Rowe, the current Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Exelon, entered into a First Amendment (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) to Mr.&nbsp;Rowe&#146;s Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement dated as of November&nbsp;26, 2001 (the &#147;Original Employment Agreement&#148;).
The Amendment provides that, as of the consummation of the Merger, Mr.&nbsp;Rowe will continue to serve
as the surviving corporation&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer but will not serve as Chairman. Mr.&nbsp;Rowe waives
his right to resign his employment for &#147;good reason&#148; or &#147;failure to appoint or elect&#148; as a result
of the Merger because of the change to his position or Mr.&nbsp;Ferland&#146;s appointment as Chairman;
provided that Mr.&nbsp;Rowe is reappointed as Chairman upon the earlier of April&nbsp;1, 2007 or the
resignation of Mr.&nbsp;E. James Ferland as Chairman and that the appointments and other matters
referred to above are on the terms and conditions specified in the Amended and Restated By-laws of
Exelon attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A to the Merger Agreement. Otherwise, the provisions of Mr.&nbsp;Rowe&#146;s
Original Employment Agreement remain in effect. If the Merger is not consummated, the Amendment
will automatically terminate and the Original Employment Agreement will remain in effect as if it
had not been amended by the Amendment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A copy of the Amendment is included herein as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.
A copy of the Original Employment Agreement is incorporated herein by
reference to Exhibit&nbsp;10.2 of Exelon&#146;s Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2001, File No.&nbsp;1-16169, filed on April&nbsp;1, 2002. The foregoing description of the Original Employment Agreement and the Amendment

the Amendment.


<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>* * * * *</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This combined Form 8-K is being filed separately by Exelon, Commonwealth Edison Company (&#147;ComEd&#148;),
PECO Energy Company (&#147;PECO&#148;) and Exelon Generation Company, LLC (&#147;Generation&#148;) (collectively, the
&#147;Exelon Registrants&#148;). Information contained herein relating to any individual Exelon Registrant
has been filed by such registrant on its own behalf. No individual Exelon Registrant makes any
representation as to information relating to any other Exelon Registrant.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Except for the historical information contained herein, certain of the matters discussed in this
report constitute &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding benefits of the
proposed merger, integration plans, and expected synergies, anticipated future financial and
operating performance and results, including estimates for growth. These statements are based on
the current expectations of management of the Exelon Registrants, and the current expectations of
management of PSEG, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (&#147;PSE&#038;G&#148;), PSEG Power LLC (&#147;PSEG
Power&#148;), and PSEG Energy Holdings LLC (&#147;PSEG Holdings&#148; and together with PSEG, PSE&#038;G and PSEG
Power, the &#147;PSEG Registrants&#148;). There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this report.
For example, (1)&nbsp;the companies may be unable to obtain shareholder approvals required for the
merger; (2)&nbsp;the companies may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for the merger, or
required regulatory approvals may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that
could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or cause the companies to abandon the
merger; (3)&nbsp;conditions to the closing of the merger may not be satisfied; (4)&nbsp;an unsolicited offer
of another company to acquire assets or capital stock of Exelon or PSEG could interfere with the
merger; (5)&nbsp;problems may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the companies, which
may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; (6)
the combined company may be unable to achieve cost-cutting synergies or it may take longer than
expected to achieve those synergies; (7)&nbsp;the merger may involve unexpected costs or unexpected
liabilities, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from the companies&#146;
expectations; (8)&nbsp;the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different
from what the companies expect; (9)&nbsp;the businesses of the companies may suffer as a result of
uncertainty surrounding the merger; (10)&nbsp;the companies may experience more difficulties than
expected in achieving operating improvements at jointly owned nuclear generating facilities; (11)
the companies may not realize the values expected to be obtained for properties expected or
required to be divested; (12)&nbsp;the industry may be subject to future regulatory or legislative
actions that could adversely affect the companies; and (13)&nbsp;the companies may be adversely affected
by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors
could also have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements of the
combined company. A discussion of some of these other important factors and assumptions is
contained in the Exelon Registrants&#146; and PSEG Registrants&#146; respective filings with the SEC,
including: (1)&nbsp;the Exelon Registrants&#146; 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#150; Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Business Outlook and the
Challenges in Managing Our Business for Each of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and Generation; (2)&nbsp;the Exelon
Registrants&#146; 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#150; Item&nbsp;8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:
Exelon &#150; Note 19, ComEd &#150; Note 15, PECO &#150; Note 14 and Generation &#150; Note 13; and (3)&nbsp;the PSEG
Registrants&#146; Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 &#150;
Forward Looking Statements. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the merger, will
be more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 that Exelon will file with the SEC in connection with the
proposed merger. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the
forward-looking events discussed in this report may not occur. Readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
None of the Exelon Registrants or PSEG Registrants undertakes any obligation to publicly release
any revision to its forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this report.
