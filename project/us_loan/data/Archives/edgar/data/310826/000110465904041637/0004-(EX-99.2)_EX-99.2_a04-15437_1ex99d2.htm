<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">OVERVIEW</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective Life Insurance Company (Protective) and its
subsidiaries provide financial services through the production, distribution,
and administration of insurance and investment products. Protective operates
five business segments.&#160; An operating
segment is generally distinguished by products and/or channels of
distribution.&#160; Protective&#146;s operating
segments are Life Marketing, Acquisitions, Annuities, Stable Value Products,
and Asset Protection.&#160; In addition,
Protective has another segment referred to as the Corporate and Other segment.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:22.5pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In 2003, Protective&#146;s net income increased 47.4% to
$232.0 million compared to $157.4 million in 2002.&#160; Included in 2003 net income were net realized
investment gains of $75.0 million compared to gains of $7.6 million in 2002.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Life Marketing segment&#146;s pretax operating income
was $160.0 million in 2003, an increase of 27.5% over the $125.4 million
reported in 2002.&#160; The increase was
primarily attributable to an increase in business-in-force.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Acquisitions segment&#146;s pretax operating income was
$96.7 million in 2003, up slightly from the $96.4 million reported in
2002.&#160; Increased earnings from recently
completed transactions were offset by the expected declining earnings from older
acquired blocks of business.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Annuities segment&#146;s pretax operating income was
$13.2 million in 2003, a decline of $1.5 million from the $14.7 million
reported in 2002.&#160; The decrease is
primarily due to interest spread compression and low sales of fixed annuities caused
by lower interest rates in 2003.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:22.5pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Stable Value Products pretax operating income was
$38.9 million in 2003, compared to $42.3 million in 2002.&#160; Average operating spreads decreased to 96
basis points in 2003, compared to 107 basis points in 2002.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Asset Protection segment had pretax operating
income of $16.0 million in 2003, compared to a loss of $6.7&nbsp;million in
2002.&#160; This increase in pretax operating
income was primarily due to improvements in service contract lines and charges
recorded in 2002 due to negative trends in service contract and other product
lines.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Corporate and Other had a pretax operating loss of
$20.8 million in 2003 compared to a loss of $27.9&nbsp;million in 2002.&#160; An increase in investment income and improved
results from the insurance lines contributed to the change.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective&#146;s accounting policies inherently require
the use of judgments relating to a variety of assumptions and estimates, in
particular expectations of current and future mortality, morbidity,
persistency, expenses, and interest rates.&#160;
Because of the inherent uncertainty when using the assumptions and
estimates, the effect of certain accounting policies</font></p>

<div>

<p align="center" style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-align:center;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">under different
conditions or assumptions could be materially different from those reported in
the consolidated financial statements.&#160; A
discussion of the various critical accounting policies is presented below.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective incurs significant costs in connection with
acquiring new insurance business.&#160; These
costs, which vary with and are primarily related to the production of new
business and coinsurance of blocks of policies, are deferred.&#160; The recovery of such costs is dependent on
the future profitability of the related policies.&#160; The amount of future profit is dependent
principally on investment returns, mortality, morbidity, persistency, and
expenses to administer the business and certain economic variables, such as
inflation.&#160; These factors enter into
management&#146;s estimates of future profits which generally are used to amortize
certain of such costs.&#160; Accounting for
other intangible assets such as goodwill also requires an estimate of the
future profitability of the associated lines of business.&#160; Revisions to estimates result in changes to
the amounts expensed in the reporting period in which the revisions are made
and could result in the impairment of the asset and a charge to income if
estimated future profits are less than the unamortized deferred amounts.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective has a deferred policy acquisition costs
asset of approximately $99.7 million related to its variable annuity product
line with an account balance of $2.2 billion at December 31, 2003.&#160; Protective monitors the rate of amortization
of the deferred policy acquisition costs associated with its variable annuity
product line.&#160; The methodologies employ
varying assumptions about how much and how quickly the stock markets will
appreciate.&#160; The primary assumptions used
to project future profits as part of the analysis include: a long-term equity
market growth rate of 9%, reversion to the mean methodology with a reversion to
the mean cap rate of 14%, reversion to the mean period of 5 years, and an
amortization period of 20 years.&#160; A
recovery in equity markets, or methodologies and assumptions that anticipate a
recovery, results in lower amounts of amortization, and a worsening of equity
markets results in higher amounts of amortization.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Establishing an adequate liability for Protective&#146;s
obligations to its policyholders requires the use of assumptions.&#160; Liabilities for future policy benefits on
traditional life insurance products require the use of assumptions relative to
future investment yields, mortality, persistency and other assumptions based on
Protective&#146;s historical experience, modified as necessary to reflect
anticipated trends and to include provisions for possible adverse deviation.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective also establishes liabilities for guaranteed
minimum death benefits (GMDB) on its variable annuity products.&#160; The methods used to estimate the liabilities
employ assumptions about mortality and the performance of equity markets.&#160; Protective assumes mortality of 60% of the
National Association of Insurance Commissioners 1994 Variable Annuity GMDB
Mortality Table to reflect improvements in mortality since the table was
derived and other factors.&#160; Future declines
in the equity market would increase Protective&#146;s GMDB liability.&#160; Differences between the actual experience and
the assumptions used result in variances in profit and could result in losses.
Protective&#146;s GMDB at December 31, 2003, are subject to a dollar-for-dollar
reduction upon withdrawal of related annuity deposits on contracts issued prior
to January&nbsp;1, 2003.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Determining whether a decline in the current fair
value of invested assets is an other-than-temporary decline in value can
involve a variety of assumptions and estimates, particularly for investments
that are not actively traded in established markets.&#160; For example, assessing the value of certain
investments requires Protective to perform an analysis of expected future cash
flows or rates of prepayments.&#160; Other
investments, such as collateralized mortgage or bond obligations, represent
selected tranches of a structured transaction, supported overall by underlying
investments in a wide variety of issuers.&#160;
Protective&#146;s specific accounting policies related to its invested assets
are discussed in the Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective utilizes derivative transactions primarily
in order to reduce its exposure to interest rate risk as well as currency
exchange risk.&#160; Assessing the
effectiveness of these hedging programs and evaluating the carrying values of
the related derivatives often involve a variety of assumptions and estimates.
Protective employs a variety of methods for determining the fair value of its
derivative instruments.&#160; The fair values
of interest rate swaps, interest rate swaptions, total return swaps and put or
call options are based upon industry standard models which present-value the
projected cash flows of the derivatives using current and implied future market
conditions.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Determining Protective&#146;s obligations to employees
under its defined benefit pension plan and stock-based compensation plans
requires the use of estimates.&#160; The
calculation of the liability related to Protective&#146;s defined benefit pension plan
requires assumptions regarding the appropriate weighted average discount rate,
estimated rate of increase in the compensation of its employees and the
expected long-term rate of return on the plan&#146;s assets.&#160; Accounting for other stock-based compensation
plans may require the use of option pricing models to estimate PLC&#146;s
obligations.&#160; Assumptions used in such
models relate to equity market volatility, the risk-free interest rate at the
date of grant, as well as the expected exercise date.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Premiums and policy fees were $810.0 million in 2002,
an increase of $191.4 million or 30.9% from the $618.7&nbsp;million reported
for 2001.&#160; During 2002, Protective
discovered that it had overpaid the reinsurance premiums due on certain life
insurance policies over a period of 10 years.&#160;
Protective recorded cash and receivables totaling $69.7&nbsp;million,
and a corresponding increase in premiums and policy fees, which reflected its
then current estimate of amounts to be recovered.&#160; Excluding this increase, premiums and policy
fees in the Life Marketing segment increased $29.5 million due to an increase
in sales.&#160; Premiums and policy fees in
the Acquisitions segment are expected to decline with time (due to the lapsing
of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or terminations of coverage)
unless new acquisitions are made.&#160; In June
2002, Protective coinsured a block of insurance policies from Conseco Variable
Insurance Company (Conseco).&#160; This
transaction resulted in an increase in premiums and policy fees of $18.8
million.&#160; The acquisition of Inter-State
and First Variable resulted in a $27.0 million increase in premiums and policy
fees.&#160; Premiums and policy fees from
older acquired blocks decreased $3.7 million.&#160;
Premiums and policy fees from the Annuities segment declined $2.3
million due to a decline in variable annuity management fees caused by the
general decline in the equity markets.&#160;
Premiums and policy fees related to the Asset Protection segment
increased $49.6 million due to continued higher sales in its service contracts
lines.&#160; Lower sales in other Asset
Protection lines during 2002 were more than offset by a decline in the amount
of reinsurance ceded.&#160; The decline in
reinsurance ceded was primarily due to a change in the form of a credit
reinsurance agreement in 2002.&#160; Premiums
and policy fees relating to various insurance lines in the Corporate and Other segment
increased $2.9 million.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Premiums and policy fees were $735.7 million in 2003,
a decrease of $74.4 million or 9.2% from 2002 premiums and policy fees.&#160; In 2003, Protective substantially completed
its recovery of all of the previously mentioned reinsurance overpayments.&#160; As a result, $18.4 million of premiums and
policy fees were recorded in 2003 related to the collection of the reinsurance
overpayment.&#160; Overall, premiums and
policy fees in the Life Marketing segment declined $21.5 million from 2002,
reflecting an increase in the use of reinsurance.&#160; Premiums and policy fees from the Conseco
transaction resulted in an increase of $7.2 million.&#160; Premiums and policy fees from older acquired
blocks decreased $17.8 million as a result of normal lapsing of policies
resulting from deaths of insureds or terminations of coverage.&#160; Premiums and policy fees in the Annuities
segment increased by $0.4 million in 2003.&#160;
Premiums and policy fees in the Asset Protection segment decreased by
$41.3 million due to reduced credit earned premiums attributable to lower sales
and the termination of non-core lines of business.&#160; Premiums and policy fees in the Corporate and
Other segment decreased by $1.4 million.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Net investment income in 2002 increased $136.6 million
or 16.4% over 2001, and in 2003 increased $8.9 million or 0.9% over 2002,
primarily due to increases in the average amount of invested assets.&#160; Invested assets have increased primarily due
to acquisitions, receiving stable value and annuity deposits, and the asset
growth that results from the sale of various insurance products.&#160; The Standard coinsurance transaction and the
acquisition of Inter-State and First Variable resulted in an increase in
investment income of $57.5 million in 2002.&#160;
The Conseco coinsurance transaction resulted in an increase in
investment income of $13.3 million in 2003.&#160;
This increase was more than offset by $19.3 million decline in
investment income from older acquisitions.</font></p>

derivative financial instruments primarily represent changes in the fair values
of certain derivative financial instruments.&#160;
Realized investment gains and losses related to derivatives include
periodic settlements related to interest rate swaps intended to mitigate the
risks associated with certain investments, but do not qualify as hedges under
SFAS No. 133.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The sales of investments that have occurred generally
result from portfolio management decisions to maintain proper matching of
assets and liabilities. Realized investment gains related to all other
investments in 2002 of $73.0&nbsp;million were largely offset by realized
investment losses of $60.7 million. Realized investment gains related to all
other investments in 2003 of $93.4 million were offset by realized investment
losses of $26.6 million. During 2002 and 2003, Protective recorded
other-than-temporary impairments in its investments of $17.8 million and $13.6
million, respectively.</font></p>

material unrealized losses and tests for other-than-temporary impairments.
Management analyzes various factors to determine if any specific
other-than-temporary asset impairments exist. Once a determination has been
made that a specific other-than-temporary impairment exists, a realized loss is
recognized and the cost basis of the impaired asset is adjusted to its fair
value. An other-than-temporary impairment loss is recognized based upon all
relevant facts and circumstances for each investment. With respect to
unrealized losses due to issuer-specific events, Protective considers the
creditworthiness and financial performance of the issuer and other available
information. With respect to unrealized losses that are not due to
issuer-specific events, such as losses due to</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Other income consists primarily of revenues of
Protective&#146;s direct response businesses, service contract businesses,
noninsurance subsidiaries, and rental of space in its administrative building
to PLC.&#160; In 2002, revenues from
Protective&#146;s service contract business increased $4.7 million.&#160; Income from all other sources decreased $1.8
million.&#160; In 2003, revenues from
Protective&#146;s service contract business increased $4.5 million.&#160; Income from all other sources increased $0.8

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Consistent with Protective&#146;s segment reporting in the
Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements, management evaluates the results of
Protective&#146;s segments on a before-income-tax basis as adjusted for certain
items which management believes are not indicative of Protective&#146;s core
operations.&#160; Segment operating income
(loss) excludes net realized investment gains and losses and the related
amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and gains (losses) on
derivative instruments because fluctuations in these items are due to changes
in interest rates and other financial market factors instead of mortality and
morbidity.&#160; Periodic settlements of
interest rate swaps associated with certain investments are included in
realized gains and losses but are considered part of operating income because
the interest rate swaps are hedging items affecting operating income.&#160; Also, segment operating income (loss)
excludes any net gains or losses on disposals of businesses, discontinued
operations, and the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles.&#160; Although the items excluded from segment
operating income (loss) may be significant components in understanding and
assessing Protective&#146;s overall financial performance, management believes that
operating segment income (loss) enhances an investor&#146;s understanding of
Protective&#146;s results of operations by highlighting the income (loss)
attributable to the normal, recurring operations of the insurance business
(i.e., mortality and morbidity), consistent with industry practice.&#160; However, Protective&#146;s segment operating
income (loss) measures may not be comparable to similarly titled measures
reported by other companies.&#160; Segment
operating income (loss) should not be construed as a substitute for net income
(loss) determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States of America (GAAP).&#160; &#147;Total
income from continuing operations before income tax&#148; is a GAAP measure to which
the non-GAAP measure &#147;total operating income&#148; may be compared.&#160; Unlike total operating income, total income
before income tax includes net realized investment gains and losses, the
related amortization of deferred policy acquisition costs and gains (losses) on
derivative instruments.&#160; In the Annuities
and Stable Value Products segments operating income excludes realized
investment gains and losses and related amortization.&#160; In the Corporate and Other segment operating
income includes derivative gains related to investments.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Life Marketing segment&#146;s 2002 pretax operating
income was $125.4 million, $33.4 million above 2001.&#160; In the third quarter of 2002, Protective
discovered that it had overpaid the reinsurance premiums due on certain life
insurance policies, and indicated that it would be seeking recovery of
approximately $94.5 million from several reinsurance companies.&#160; At December, 31, 2002, Protective had
recorded cash and receivables totaling $69.7 million, which reflected the amounts
received at that date, and Protective&#146;s estimate of amounts to be recovered in
the future, based upon the information then available.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The corresponding increase in premiums and policy fees
resulted in $62.5 million of additional amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs in 2002. The amortization of deferred policy acquisition
costs took into account the amortization relating to the increase in premiums
and policy fees as well as the additional amortization required should the
remainder of the overpayment not be collected. The Life Marketing segment&#146;s
pretax operating income thereby increased $7.2 million which is the difference
between the premiums recorded and the amount of such additional amortization.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Because the overpayments were made over a period of 10
years beginning in 1992, and had the effect of reducing the amortization of
deferred policy acquisition costs during that period, Protective believes that
no prior period results were materially understated and that no operating
trends were materially affected as a result.</font></p>

income was $160.0 million, an increase of $34.5 million over 2002.&#160; During 2003, Protective received payment from
substantially all of the affected reinsurance companies.&#160; As a result Protective increased premiums and
policy fees by $18.4 million and amortization of deferred policy acquisition
costs by $6.1 million, resulting in an increase in the Life Marketing segment&#146;s
pretax operating income of $12.3 million.&#160;
The remaining increase is attributable to growth of business-in-force
due to strong sales in 2002 and 2003 and favorable expense variances as
compared to pricing allowances.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In the ordinary course of business, the Acquisitions
segment regularly considers acquisitions of blocks of policies or smaller
insurance companies.&#160; Policies acquired
through the segment are usually administered as &#147;closed&#148; blocks; i.e., no new
policies are being marketed.&#160; Therefore,
earnings from the Acquisitions segment are normally expected to decline over
time (due to the lapsing of policies resulting from deaths of insureds or
terminations of coverage) unless new acquisitions are made.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In 2002, the segment&#146;s pretax operating income was
$96.4 million, $27.2 million above 2001.&#160;
The Conseco and Standard coinsurance transactions and the acquisition of
Inter-State and First Variable resulted in a $24.7 million increase in earnings
in 2002.&#160; Earnings on older acquired
blocks of policies increased $2.4 million.&#160;
In 2003, the segment&#146;s pretax operating income was $96.7 million, $0.3
million above 2002.&#160; The Conseco
transaction contributed a $9.1 million increase in earnings over 2002, and
earnings from older acquired blocks of business decreased by $8.8&nbsp;million.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The Annuities segment&#146;s pretax operating income for
2002 was $14.7 million as compared to $15.1 million in 2001.&#160; Fixed annuity earnings increased $1.2 million
due to higher account balances.&#160; This
increase was more than offset by a decline in variable annuity earnings of $2.4
million due to the general decline in the equity markets. The segment&#146;s 2003
pretax operating income was $13.2 million, a decrease of $1.5 million from
2002.&#160; The decrease is primarily
attributable to spread compression and the inability to capitalize excess
expenses due to lower sales of fixed annuities caused by lower interest rates
in 2003.&#160; The segment had a $0.3 million
realized investment gain (net of related amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs) in 2002 and a $3.8 million gain in 2003. As a result, total
pretax income was $15.0 million in 2002 and $17.0 million in 2003.</font></p>

feature (GMDB) on its variable annuity products.&#160; Protective&#146;s accounting policy has been to
calculate its total exposure to GMDB, and then apply a mortality factor to
determine the amount of claims that could be expected to occur in the coming
twelve months.&#160; Protective then accrues
to that amount over four quarters.&#160; At
December 31, 2003, the total GMDB reserve was $5.1 million.&#160; The total guaranteed amount payable under the
GMDB feature based on variable annuity account balances at December 31, 2003,
was $287.0&nbsp;million, a decrease of $252.0 million from December 31, 2002,
caused by an improvement in the equity markets.</font></p>

prescribed or permitted by regulatory authorities (which require the assumption
that equity markets will significantly worsen), the Annuities segment reported
GMDB related policy liabilities and accruals of $12.1 million at December 31,
2003, a decrease of $12.6 million from December 31, 2002.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Although positive performance in the equity markets in
2003 allowed Protective to decrease its GMDB related policy liabilities, the
Annuities segment&#146;s future results may be negatively affected by a slow
economy.&#160; Volatile equity markets could
negatively affect sales of variable annuities and the fees the segment assesses
on variable annuity contracts.&#160; Lower
interest rates have negatively affected sales of fixed annuities.&#160; In this segment, equity market volatility may
create uncertainty regarding the level of future profitability in the variable
annuity business and the related rate of amortization of deferred policy
acquisition costs.</font></p>

due primarily to higher average account balances and operating spreads.&#160; Average account balances were $3.9 billion in
2002 as compared to $3.5 billion in 2001.&#160;
Operating spreads averaged 107 basis points in 2002 compared to an

the spread compression was a reduction in yield caused by the high level of
prepayments in the mortgage-backed securities portfolio in 2003.&#160; The segments average quarterly account
balances increased by $189.6 million in 2003 to $4.1 billion.&#160; The segment had realized investment losses in
2002 of $7.1 million compared to gains of $9.8 million in 2003.&#160; As a result, total income before income tax

Securities and Exchange Commission in which up to $3&nbsp;billion of secured
medium-term notes may be issued to the institutional market and InterNotes<sup>&#174;</sup>
may be issued to the retail market on a delayed (or shelf) basis.&#160; Each series of notes will be issued by a

are vehicle and marine service contracts and credit insurance.&#160; The results of the Asset Protection segment
have been significantly affected by general economic conditions.&#160; The segment&#146;s claims and corresponding loss

income of $38.1 million in 2001.&#160; The
decrease included the $25.6 million charge discussed above.&#160; The segment also experienced lower service
contract administration fees of $2.8 million and lower earned credit premiums
that reduced income $5.8 million.&#160; Higher
loss ratios in the vehicle service contract line lowered earnings $2.8
million.&#160; Also, higher loss ratios in the
segment&#146;s ancillary lines led to higher losses of $5.2 million in 2002.&#160; Included in the segment&#146;s pretax loss for

insurance results in 2003, caused by reduced sales, were partially offset by

improved to contribute pretax operating income of $3.7 million in 2003, as compared
to a pretax operating loss of $2.8 million in 2002, due to improving loss

and contingency plans, and taken preventive measures and other precautions, no
predictions of specific scenarios can be made nor can assurance be given that
there are not scenarios that could have an adverse effect on Protective.&#160; A natural disaster or an outbreak of an
easily communicable disease could adversely affect the mortality or morbidity
experience of Protective or its reinsurers.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Protective operates in a mature, highly competitive
industry, which could limit its ability to gain or maintain its position in the

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Life and health
insurance is a mature industry.&#160; In
recent years, the industry has experienced little growth in life insurance
sales, though the aging population has increased the demand for retirement
savings products.&#160; Life and health
insurance is a highly competitive industry.&#160;
Protective encounters significant competition in all lines of business
from other insurance companies, many of which have greater financial resources
than Protective, as well as competition from other providers of financial
services.&#160; Competition could result in,
among other things, lower sales or higher lapses of existing products.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The</font> insurance industry is consolidating, with larger, potentially
more efficient organizations emerging from consolidation.&#160; Participants in certain of Protective&#146;s
independent distribution channels are also consolidating into larger
organizations.&#160; Some mutual insurance
companies are converting to stock ownership, which will give them greater
access to capital markets.&#160; Additionally,
commercial banks, insurance companies, and investment banks may now combine,
provided certain requirements are satisfied.&#160;
The ability of banks to increase their securities-related business or to
affiliate with insurance companies may materially and adversely affect sales of
all of Protective&#146;s products by substantially increasing the number and
financial strength of potential competitors.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective&#146;s</font> ability to compete is dependent upon, among other things, its
ability to attract and retain distribution channels to market its insurance and
investment products, its ability to develop competitive and profitable
products, its ability to maintain low unit costs, and its maintenance of strong
ratings from rating agencies.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">A ratings downgrade could adversely affect Protective&#146;s

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Rating</font> organizations periodically review the financial performance and
condition of insurers, including Protective&#146;s subsidiaries.&#160; In recent years, downgrades of insurance
companies have occurred with increasing frequency.&#160; A downgrade in the rating of Protective&#146;s
subsidiaries could adversely affect Protective&#146;s ability to sell its products,
retain existing business, and compete for attractive acquisition
opportunities.&#160; Specifically, a ratings
downgrade would materially harm Protective&#146;s ability to sell certain products,
including guaranteed investment products and funding agreements.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Rating</font> organizations assign ratings based upon several factors.&#160; While most of the factors relate to the rated
company, some of the factors relate to the views of the rating organization,
general economic conditions and circumstances outside the rated company&#146;s
control.&#160; In addition, rating organizations
use various models and formulas to assess the strength of a rated company, and
from time to time rating organizations have, in their discretion, altered the
models.&#160; Changes to the models could
impact the rating organizations&#146; judgment of the rating to be assigned to the
rated company.&#160; Protective cannot predict
what actions the rating organizations may take, or what actions Protective may
be required to take in response to the actions of the rating organizations,
which could adversely affect Protective.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In the conduct of
business, Protective makes certain assumptions regarding the mortality,
persistency, expenses and interest rates, or other factors appropriate to the
type of business it expects to experience in future periods.&#160; These assumptions are also used to estimate
the amounts of deferred policy acquisition costs, policy liabilities and
accruals, future earnings, and various components of Protective&#146;s balance
sheet.&#160; Protective&#146;s actual experience,
as well as changes in estimates, are used to prepare Protective&#146;s statements of
income.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The</font> calculations Protective uses to estimate various components of
its balance sheet and statements of income are necessarily complex and involve
analyzing and interpreting large quantities of data.&#160; Protective currently employs various
techniques for such calculations and it from time to time will develop and
implement more sophisticated administrative systems and procedures capable of
facilitating the calculation of more precise estimates.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Assumptions</font> and estimates involve judgment, and by their nature are imprecise
and subject to changes and revision over time.&#160;
Accordingly, Protective&#146;s results may be affected, positively or
negatively, from time to time, by actual results differing from assumptions, by
changes in estimates, and by changes resulting from implementing more
sophisticated administrative systems and procedures that facilitate the
calculation of more precise estimates.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">The use of reinsurance introduces variability in Protective&#146;s

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The timing of
premium payments to, and receipt of expense allowances from, reinsurers may
differ from Protective&#146;s receipt of customer premium payments and incurrence of
expenses.&#160; These timing differences
introduce variability in certain components of Protective&#146;s statements of
income, and may also introduce variability in Protective&#146;s quarterly results.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Protective could be forced to sell investments at a

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Many</font> of the products offered by Protective and its insurance
subsidiaries allow policyholders and contract holders to withdraw their funds
under defined circumstances.&#160; Protective
and its insurance subsidiaries manage their liabilities and configure their
investment portfolios so as to provide and maintain sufficient liquidity to
support anticipated withdrawal demands and contract benefits and
maturities.&#160; While Protective and its
life insurance subsidiaries own a significant amount of liquid assets, a
certain portion of their assets are relatively illiquid.&#160; If Protective or its subsidiaries experience
unanticipated withdrawal or surrender activity, Protective or its subsidiaries
could exhaust their liquid assets and be forced to liquidate other assets,
perhaps on unfavorable terms.&#160; If
Protective or its subsidiaries are forced to dispose of assets on unfavorable
terms, it could have an adverse effect on Protective&#146;s financial condition.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-style:italic;font-weight:bold;">Interest-rate fluctuations could negatively affect
Protective&#146;s spread income or otherwise impact its business.</font></i></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Significant
changes in interest rates expose insurance companies to the risk of not earning
anticipated spreads between the interest rate earned on investments and the
credited interest rates paid on outstanding policies and contracts.&#160; Both rising and declining interest rates can
negatively affect Protective&#146;s spread income.&#160;
While Protective develops and maintains asset/liability management
programs and procedures designed to preserve spread income in rising or falling
interest rate environments, no assurance can be given that changes in interest
rates will not affect such spreads.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">From time to time,
Protective has participated in securities repurchase transactions that have
contributed to Protective&#146;s investment income.&#160;
Such transactions involve some degree of risk that the counterparty may
fail to perform its obligations to pay amounts owed and the collateral has
insufficient value to satisfy the obligation.&#160;
No assurance can be given that such transactions will continue to be
entered into and contribute to Protective&#146;s investment income in the future.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Changes</font> in interest rates may also impact its business in other
ways.&#160; Lower interest rates may result in
lower sales of certain of Protective&#146;s insurance and investment products.&#160; In addition, certain of Protective&#146;s
insurance and investment products guarantee a minimum credited interest rate,
and Protective could become unable to earn its spread income should interest
rates decrease significantly.</p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Higher</font> interest rates may create a less favorable environment for the
origination of mortgage loans and decrease the investment income Protective
receives in the form of prepayment fees, make-whole payments, and mortgage participation
income.&#160; Higher interest rates may also
increase the cost of debt and other obligations having floating rate or rate
reset provisions and may result in lower sales of variable products.</p>

incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term
interest rates (i.e., the slope of the yield curve) and relationships between
risk-adjusted and risk-free interest rates, market liquidity, and other factors.&#160; The effectiveness of Protective&#146;s
asset/liability management programs and procedures may be negatively affected

include policy information, policy rates, expenses, mortality and morbidity
experience.&#160; To the extent that data
input errors, systems errors, or systems failures are not identified and
corrected by Protective&#146;s internal controls, the information generated by the

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In the third
quarter of 2002, Protective discovered that the rates payable on certain life
insurance policies were incorrectly entered into its reinsurance administrative
system in 1991.&#160; As a result, Protective
overpaid to several reinsurance companies the reinsurance premiums related to
such policies of approximately $94.5 million over a period of 10 years beginning
in 1992.&#160; Protective has received payment
from substantially all of the affected reinsurance companies.</font></p>

increases are not approved in full by regulators in a timely fashion. &#160;From time to time, regulators raise issues

could adversely affect Protective and its ability to compete with non-insurance

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended
(the &#147;Code&#148;), income tax payable by policyholders on investment earnings is
deferred during the accumulation period of certain life insurance and annuity
products.&#160; This favorable tax treatment
may give certain of Protective&#146;s products a competitive advantage over other
non-insurance products.&#160; To the extent
that the Code is revised to reduce the tax-deferred status of life insurance
and annuity products, or to increase the tax-deferred status of competing
products, all life insurance companies, including Protective and its
subsidiaries, would be adversely affected with respect to their ability to sell
such products, and, depending upon grandfathering provisions, would be affected
by the surrenders of existing annuity contracts and life insurance policies.&#160; For example, changes in laws or regulations
could restrict or eliminate the advantages of certain corporate or bank-owned
life insurance products.&#160; Recent changes
in tax law, which have reduced the federal income tax rates on corporate
dividends in certain circumstances, could make the tax advantages of investing
in certain life insurance or annuity products less attractive.&#160; Additionally, changes in tax law based on
proposals to establish new tax advantaged retirement and life savings plans, if
enacted, could reduce the tax advantage of investing in certain life insurance
or annuity products.&#160; In addition, life
insurance products are often used to fund estate tax obligations.&#160; Legislation has been enacted that would, over
time, reduce and eventually eliminate the estate tax.&#160; If the estate tax is significantly reduced or
eliminated, the demand for certain life insurance products could be adversely
affected.&#160; Additionally, Protective is
subject to the federal corporation income tax.&#160;
Protective cannot predict what changes to tax law or interpretations of
existing tax law could adversely affect Protective.</font></p>

verdicts have been returned against insurers, broker-dealers, and other
providers of financial services involving sales practices, alleged agent
misconduct, failure to properly supervise representatives, relationships with
agents or other persons with whom the insurer does business, and other
matters.&#160; Increasingly these lawsuits
have resulted in the award of substantial judgments that are disproportionate
to the actual damages, including material amounts of punitive non-economic
compensatory damages. &#160;In some states,
juries, judges, and arbitrators have substantial discretion in awarding
punitive and non-economic compensatory damages, which creates the potential for
unpredictable material adverse judgments or awards in any given lawsuit or
arbitration.&#160; Arbitration awards are
subject to very limited appellate review. In addition, in some class action and
other lawsuits, companies have made material settlement payments.</font></p>

based, in part, on the assumption that reinsurance will be available at a
certain cost.&#160; Under certain reinsurance
agreements, the reinsurer may increase the rate it charges Protective for the
reinsurance, though Protective does not anticipate increases to occur with
respect to existing reinsurance contracts.&#160;
Therefore, if the cost of reinsurance were to increase or if reinsurance
were to become unavailable, or if a reinsurer should fail to meet its

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><font style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective</font>
has recently deployed significant amounts of capital to support its sales and
acquisitions efforts. Capital has also been consumed as Protective increased
its reserves on the residual value product.&#160;
Although positive performance in the equity markets has recently allowed
Protective to decrease its GMDB related policy liabilities and accruals,
deterioration in these markets could lead to further capital consumption.&#160; Although Protective believes it has
sufficient capital to fund its immediate growth and capital needs, the amount
of capital available can vary significantly from period to period due to a
variety of circumstances, some of which are neither predictable nor
foreseeable, nor within Protective&#146;s control.&#160;
A lack of sufficient capital could impair Protective&#146;s ability to grow.</font></p>

publicly traded companies, PLC is required to comply with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America (GAAP).&#160; A number of organizations are instrumental in
the development of GAAP such as the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC),
the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB), and the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants (AICPA).&#160;
GAAP is subject to constant review by these organizations and others in
an effort to address emerging issues and otherwise improve financial
reporting.&#160; In this regard, these
organizations adopt new accounting rules and issue interpretive accounting
guidance on a continual basis.&#160; PLC and
Protective can give no assurance that future changes to GAAP will not have a
negative impact on Protective&#146;s reported financial results.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">On January 1, 2001, Protective adopted Statement of
Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No.&nbsp;133, &#147;Accounting for Derivative
Instruments and Hedging Activities&#148;.&#160;
SFAS No. 133, as amended by SFAS Nos. 137, 138, and 149, requires
Protective to record all derivative financial instruments at fair value on the
balance sheet.&#160; Changes in fair value of
a derivative instrument are reported in net income or other comprehensive
income, depending on the designated use of the derivative instrument.&#160; The adoption of SFAS No. 133 resulted in a
cumulative charge to net income, net of income tax, of $8.3 million and a
cumulative after-tax increase to other comprehensive income of $4.0 million on
January 1, 2001.&#160; The charge to net
income and increase to other comprehensive income primarily resulted from the
recognition of derivative instruments embedded in Protective&#146;s corporate bond
portfolio.&#160; In addition, the charge to
net income includes the recognition of the ineffectiveness on existing hedging
relationships including the difference in spot and forward exchange rates
related to foreign currency swaps used as an economic hedge of
foreign-currency-denominated stable value contracts.&#160; The adoption of SFAS No. 133 has introduced
volatility into Protective&#146;s reported net income and other comprehensive income
depending on market conditions and Protective&#146;s hedging activities.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">On January 1, 2002, Protective adopted SFAS No. 142, &#147;Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets.&#148; SFAS No. 142 revises the standards for accounting
for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets.&#160; The standard replaces the requirement to
amortize goodwill with one that calls for an annual impairment test, among
other provisions.&#160; Protective has
performed an impairment test and determined that its goodwill was not impaired
at October 31, 2003, and 2002.&#160; The
following table illustrates adjusted income from continuing operations before
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle as if this pronouncement
was adopted as of January&nbsp;1, 2001:</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In January 2003, the Financial Accounting Standards
Board (FASB) issued FASB Interpretation No. (FIN) 46, &#147;Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,&#148; which was revised in December 2003.&#160; FIN 46 clarifies the application of
Accounting Research Bulletin No. 51, &#147;Consolidated Financial Statements,&#148; to
certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a
controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the
entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated support from
other parties.&#160; The effective date of FIN
46 is March&nbsp;31, 2004, for Protective.&#160;
Protective is currently evaluating the impact of FIN 46 on entities to
be consolidated as of March 31, 2004.&#160;
Although Protective does not expect the implementation of the provisions
of FIN 46, on March 31, 2004, to have a material impact on its results of
operations, had the provisions been effective at December&nbsp;31, 2003,
Protective&#146;s reported assets and liabilities would have increased by
approximately $70 million.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">On October 1, 2003, Protective adopted Derivatives
Implementation Group Issue No. B36, &#147;Embedded Derivatives: Modified Coinsurance
Arrangements and Debt Instruments That Incorporate Credit Risk Exposures That
Are Unrelated or Only Partially Related to the Creditworthiness of the Obligor
under Those Instruments&#148; (DIG B36).&#160; DIG
B36 requires the bifurcation of embedded derivatives within certain modified
coinsurance and funds withheld coinsurance arrangements that expose the
creditor to credit risk of a company other than the debtor, even if the debtor
owns as investment assets the third-party securities to which the creditor is
exposed.&#160; The adoption did not have a
material impact on its financial condition or results of operations.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In July 2003, the American Institute of Certified
Public Accountants issued Statement of Position (SOP) 03-1, &#147;Accounting and
Reporting by Insurance Enterprises for Certain Nontraditional Long-Duration
Contracts and for Separate Accounts.&#148;&#160;
SOP 03-1 is effective for fiscal years beginning after December&nbsp;15,
2003.&#160; SOP 03-1 provides guidance related
to the reporting and disclosure of certain insurance contracts and separate
accounts, including the calculation of guaranteed minimum death benefits
(GMDB).&#160; SOP 03-1 also addresses the
capitalization and amortization of sales inducements to contract holders.&#160; Had the provision been effective at December
31, 2003, Protective would have reported a GMDB accrual $0.3 million higher
than currently reported.&#160; Although the
original intent of SOP 03-1 was to address the accounting for contract
provisions not addressed by SFAS No. 97, such as guaranteed minimum death
benefits within a variable annuity contract, it appears that SOP 03-1 contains
language that may impact the accounting for universal life products in a
material way.&#160; The life insurance
industry and some insurance companies have filed letters with the American
Institute of Certified Public Accountants seeking clarification, guidance,
delay and/or revision to more appropriately reflect the underlying economic
issues of universal life insurance products.&#160;
Protective is currently evaluating the impact of SOP 03-1 on the
accounting for its universal life products.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">On December 31, 2003, Protective adopted SFAS No. 132,
&#147;Employers&#146; Disclosures about Pensions and Other Postretirement Benefits,&#148; as
revised by the FASB in December 2003.&#160;
The FASB revised disclosure requirements for pension plans and other
postretirement benefit plans to require more information.&#160; The revision of SFAS No. 132 did not have a
material effect on Protective&#146;s financial position or results of operations.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">On December 8, 2003, President Bush signed into law
the Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act of 2003
(Medicare Act).&#160; The Medicare Act
introduces a prescription drug benefit for Medicare-eligible retirees in 2006,
as well as a federal subsidy to plan sponsors that provide prescription drug
benefits.&#160; In accordance with FASB Staff
Position No. 106-1, Protective has elected to defer recognizing the effects of
the Medicare Act for its postretirement plans under FASB Statement No. 106,
Employers&#146; Accounting for Postretirement Benefits Other than Pension until
authoritative guidance on accounting for the federal subsidy is issued.&#160; Protective anticipates that the Medicare Act
will not have a material impact on the financial results of Protective;
therefore the costs reported in Note L to the consolidated financial statements
do not reflect these changes.&#160; The final
accounting guidance could require changes to previously reported information.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective&#146;s operations usually produce a positive
cash flow.&#160; This cash flow is used to
fund an investment portfolio to finance future benefit payments.&#160; Since future benefit payments largely
represent medium- and long-term obligations reserved using certain assumed
interest rates, Protective&#146;s investments are predominantly in medium- and
long-term, fixed-rate investments such as bonds and mortgage loans.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective&#146;s investment portfolio consists primarily
of fixed maturity securities (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks) and
commercial mortgage loans.&#160; Protective
generally purchases its investments with the intent to hold to maturity by
purchasing investments that match future cash flow needs.&#160; However, Protective may sell any of its
investments to maintain proper matching of assets and liabilities.&#160; Accordingly, Protective has classified its
fixed maturities and certain other securities as &#147;available for sale.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective&#146;s investments in debt and equity securities
are reported at market value, and investments in mortgage loans are reported at
amortized cost.&#160; At December 31, 2003,
Protective&#146;s fixed maturity investments (bonds and redeemable preferred stocks)
had a market value of $12.9&nbsp;billion, which is 5.0% above amortized cost of
$12.3&nbsp;billion.&#160; Protective had
$2.7&nbsp;billion in mortgage loans at December 31, 2003.&#160; While Protective&#146;s mortgage loans do not have
quoted market values, at December&nbsp;31, 2003, Protective estimates the
market value of its mortgage loans to be $3.0&nbsp;billion (using discounted
cash flows from the next call date), which is 8.2% above amortized cost. Most
of Protective&#146;s mortgage loans have significant prepayment fees.&#160; These assets are invested for terms
approximately corresponding to anticipated future benefit payments.&#160; Thus, market fluctuations are not expected to
adversely affect liquidity.</font></p>

investments had a market value of $11.7&nbsp;billion, which was 3.9% above
amortized cost of $11.2&nbsp;billion.&#160;
Protective estimated the market value of its mortgage loans to be

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Estimated market values were derived from the
durations of Protective&#146;s fixed maturities and mortgage loans. Duration measures
the relationship between changes in market value to changes in interest
rates.&#160; While these estimated market
values generally provide an indication of how sensitive the market values of
Protective&#146;s fixed maturities and mortgage loans are to changes in interest
rates, they do not represent management&#146;s view of future market changes, and
actual market results may differ from these estimates.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective participates in securities lending,
primarily as an investment yield enhancement, whereby securities that are held
as investments are loaned to third parties for short periods of time.&#160; Protective requires collateral of 102% of the
market value of the loaned securities to be separately maintained.&#160; The loaned securities&#146; market value is
monitored, on a daily basis, with additional collateral obtained as
necessary.&#160; At December 31, 2003,
securities with a market value of $324.5 million were loaned under these
agreements.&#160; As collateral for the loaned
securities, Protective receives short-term investments, which are recorded in &#147;short-term
investments&#148; with a corresponding liability recorded in &#147;other liabilities&#148; to
account for Protective&#146;s obligation to return the collateral.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">During 2003,
Protective recorded pretax other-than-temporary impairments in its investments
of $13.6 million.&#160; In 2002, Protective
recorded pretax other-than-temporary impairments in its investments of $17.8
million.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective&#146;s
management considers a number of factors when determining the impairment status
of individual securities.&#160; These include the
economic condition of various industry segments and geographic locations and
other areas of identified risks.&#160;
Although it is possible for the impairment of one investment to affect
other investments, Protective engages in ongoing risk management to safeguard
against and limit any further risk to its investment portfolio. Special
attention is given to correlative risks within specific industries, related
parties and business markets.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Once management
has determined that a particular investment has suffered an
other-than-temporary impairment, the asset is written down to its estimated
fair value.&#160; Protective generally
considers a number of factors in determining whether the impairment is
other-than-temporary.&#160; These include, but
are not limited to: 1) actions taken by rating agencies, 2) default by the
issuer, 3) the significance of the decline, 4) the intent and ability of
Protective to hold the investment until recovery, 5) the time period during
which the decline has occurred, 6) an economic analysis of the issuer&#146;s
industry, and 7) the financial strength, liquidity, and recoverability of the
issuer.&#160; Management performs a security
by security review each quarter in evaluating the need for any
other-than-temporary impairments.&#160;
Although no set formula is used in this process, the investment
performance and continued viability of the issuer are significant measures.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">There are certain
risks and uncertainties associated with determining whether declines in market
values are other-than-temporary.&#160; These
include significant changes in general economic conditions and business
markets, trends in certain industry segments, interest rate fluctuations,
rating agency actions, changes in significant accounting estimates and
assumptions, commission of fraud and legislative actions.&#160; Protective continuously monitors these
factors as they relate to the investment portfolio in determining the status of
each investment.&#160; Provided below are
additional facts concerning the potential effect upon Protective&#146;s earnings
should circumstances lead management to conclude that some of the current
declines in market value are other-than-temporary.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Market values for
private, non-traded securities are determined as follows: 1) Protective obtains
estimates from independent pricing services or 2) Protective estimates market
value based upon a comparison to quoted issues of the same issuer or issues of
other issuers with similar terms and risk characteristics.&#160; The market value of private, non-traded securities
was $1,956.7 million at December 31, 2003, representing 11.5% of Protective&#146;s
total invested assets.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The majority of
unrealized losses in Protective&#146;s investment portfolio can be attributed to
interest rate fluctuations and have been deemed temporary.&#160; As indicated above, when Protective&#146;s
investment management deems an investment&#146;s market value decline as

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">At December 31, 2003, $24.5 million of securities in
an unrealized loss position were securities issued in Protective-sponsored
commercial mortgage loan securitizations, including $19.2 million in an
unrealized loss position greater than five years.&#160; Protective does not consider these unrealized
loss positions to be other-than-temporary, because the underlying mortgage
loans continue to perform consistently with Protective&#146;s original expectations.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">At December 31, 2003, $21.1 million of below
investment grade securities in an unrealized loss position were securities
issued in Protective-sponsored commercial mortgage loan securitizations,
including $18.1 million in an unrealized loss position greater than five
years.&#160; Protective does not consider
these unrealized positions to be other-than-temporary, because the underlying
mortgage loans continue to perform consistently with Protective&#146;s original
expectations.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Realized losses are comprised of both write-downs on
other-than-temporary impairments and actual sales of investments.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">During the year ended December 31, 2003, Protective
recorded pretax other-than-temporary impairments in its investments of $13.6
million as compared to $17.8 million in the year ended December 31, 2002.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">As discussed earlier, Protective&#146;s management
considers several factors when determining other-than-temporary
impairments.&#160; Although Protective
generally intends to hold securities until maturity, Protective may change its
position as a result of a change in circumstances.&#160; Any such decision is consistent with
Protective&#146;s classification of its investment portfolio as available for
sale.&#160; During the year ended December 31,
2003, Protective sold securities in an unrealized loss position with a market
value of $524.8 million resulting in a realized loss of $6.3 million.&#160; For such securities, the proceeds, realized
loss and total time period that the security had been in an unrealized loss
position are presented in the table below.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective records mortgage loans net of an allowance
for credit losses.&#160; This allowance is
calculated through analysis of specific loans that are believed to be at a
higher risk of becoming impaired in the near future.&#160; At December&nbsp;31, 2003, Protective&#146;s
allowance for mortgage loan credit losses was $4.7 million.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">For several years Protective has offered a type of
commercial mortgage loan under which Protective will permit a slightly higher
loan-to-value ratio in exchange for a participating interest in the cash flows
from the underlying real estate.&#160; As of
December 31, 2003, approximately $382.7 million of Protective&#146;s mortgage loans
have this participation feature.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">At December 31, 2003, delinquent mortgage loans and
foreclosed properties were 0.1% of invested assets.&#160; Protective does not expect these investments
to adversely affect its liquidity or ability to maintain proper matching of
assets and liabilities.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In the ordinary course of its commercial mortgage
lending operations, Protective will commit to provide a mortgage loan before
the property to be mortgaged has been built or acquired.&#160; The mortgage loan commitment is a contractual
obligation to fund a mortgage loan when called upon by the borrower. &#160;The commitment is not recognized in Protective&#146;s
financial statements until the commitment is actually funded.&#160; The mortgage loan commitment contains terms,
including the rate of interest, which may be less than prevailing interest
rates.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">At December 31, 2003, Protective had outstanding
mortgage loan commitments of $578.5 million with an estimated fair value of
$595.7 million (using discounted cash flows from the first call date).&#160; At December 31, 2002, Protective had
outstanding commitments of $455.7 million with an estimated fair value of
$494.1 million.&#160; The following table sets
forth the estimated fair value of Protective&#146;s mortgage loan commitments
resulting from a hypothetical immediate 1 percentage point increase in interest
rate levels prevailing at December 31, and the percent change in fair value the
following estimated fair values would represent.</font></p>

of Protective&#146;s stable value product and annuity account balances.&#160; While these estimated fair values generally
provide an indication of how sensitive the fair values of Protective&#146;s stable
value and annuity account balances are to changes in interest rates, they do
not represent management&#146;s view of future market changes, and actual market
results may differ from these estimates.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Approximately 10% of Protective&#146;s liabilities relate
to products (primary whole life insurance), the profitability of which could be
affected by changes in interest rates.&#160;
The effect of such changes in any one year is not expected to be
material.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective uses a risk management strategy that
incorporates the use of derivative financial instruments, primarily to reduce
its exposure to interest rate risk as well as currency exchange risk.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Combinations of interest rate swap contracts, futures
contracts, and option contracts are sometimes used to mitigate or eliminate
certain financial and market risks, including those related to changes in
interest rates for certain investments, primarily outstanding mortgage loan
commitments and mortgage-backed securities.&#160;
Interest rate swap contracts generally involve the exchange of fixed and
variable rate interest payments between two parties, based on a common notional
principal amount and maturity date.&#160;
Interest rate futures generally involve exchange traded contracts to buy
or sell treasury bonds and notes in the future at specified prices. Interest
rate options allow the holder of the option to receive cash or purchase, sell
or enter into a financial instrument at a specified price within a specified period
of time.&#160; Protective used interest rate
swap contracts, swaptions (options to enter into interest rate swap contracts),
caps, and floors to modify the interest characteristics of certain investments,
and liabilities.&#160; Swap contracts are also
used to alter the effective durations of assets and liabilities.&#160; Protective uses foreign currency swaps to
reduce its exposure to currency exchange risk on certain stable value contracts
denominated in foreign currencies, primarily the European euro and the British
pound.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Derivative instruments expose Protective to credit and
market risk.&#160; Protective minimizes its
credit risk by entering into transactions with highly rated
counterparties.&#160; Protective manages the
market risk associated with interest rate and foreign exchange contracts by
establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degrees of risk that may
be undertaken.</font></p>

connection with its overall asset/liability management programs and procedures.
Protective&#146;s asset/liability committee is responsible for implementing various
strategies to mitigate or eliminate certain financial and market risks.&#160; These strategies are developed through the
committee&#146;s analysis of data from financial simulation models and other
internal and industry sources and are then incorporated into Protective&#146;s
overall interest rate and currency exchange risk management strategies.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective&#146;s
asset/liability management programs and procedures involve the monitoring of
asset and liability durations for various product lines; cash flow testing
under various interest rate scenarios; and the continuous rebalancing of assets
and liabilities with respect to yield, risk, and cash flow
characteristics.&#160; It is Protective&#146;s
policy to generally maintain asset and liability durations within one-half year
of one another, although, from time to time, a broader interval may be allowed.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective
believes its asset/liability management programs and procedures and certain
product features provide protection for Protective against the effects of
changes in interest rates under various scenarios.&#160; Additionally, Protective believes its
asset/liability management programs and procedures provide sufficient liquidity
to enable it to fulfill its obligation to pay benefits under its various
insurance and deposit contracts.&#160;
However, Protective&#146;s asset/liability management programs and procedures
incorporate assumptions about the relationship between short-term and long-term
interest rates (i.e., the slope of the yield curve), relationships between
risk-adjusted and risk-free interest rates, market liquidity and other factors,
and the effectiveness of Protective&#146;s asset/liability management programs and
procedures may be negatively affected whenever actual results differ from those
assumptions.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Cash outflows
related to stable value contracts (primarily maturing contracts, scheduled
interest payments, and expected withdrawals) were approximately $1,100.1
million during 2003. Cash outflows related to stable value contracts are
estimated to be approximately $1,106.1 million in 2004. Protective&#146;s
asset/liability management programs and procedures take into account maturing
contracts and expected withdrawals. Accordingly, Protective does not expect
stable value contract related cash outflows to have an unusual effect on the
future operations and liquidity of Protective.</font></p>

insurance subsidiaries were committed at December 31, 2003, to fund mortgage
loans in the amount of $578.5 million.&#160;
Protective held $621.7 million in cash and short-term investments at
December 31, 2003. Protective Life Corporation had an additional $1.1 million
in cash and short-term investments available for general corporate purposes.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">While Protective
generally anticipates that the cash flow of its subsidiaries will be sufficient
to meet their investment commitments and operating cash needs, Protective
recognizes that investment commitments scheduled to be funded may, from time to
time, exceed the funds then available.&#160;
Therefore, Protective has arranged sources of credit for its insurance
subsidiaries to use when needed.&#160;
Protective expects that the rate received on its investments will equal
or exceed its borrowing rate.&#160;
Additionally, Protective may, from time to time, sell short-duration
stable value products to complement its cash management practices.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Protective has

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">As disclosed in the Notes to the Consolidated
Financial Statements, at December 31, 2003, approximately $1,386.9 million of
consolidated share-owner&#146;s equity, excluding net unrealized investment gains
and losses, represented net assets of Protective that cannot be transferred to
PLC.&#160; In addition, the states in which
Protective and its insurance subsidiaries are domiciled impose certain
restrictions on their ability to pay dividends to PLC.&#160; In general, dividends up to specified levels
are considered ordinary and may be paid thirty days after written notice to the
insurance commissioner of the state of domicile unless such commissioner
objects to the dividend prior to the expiration of such period.&#160; Dividends in larger amounts are considered
extraordinary and are subject to affirmative prior approval by such
commissioner.&#160; The maximum amount that
would qualify as ordinary dividends to PLC by Protective in 2004 is estimated
to be $293.8 million.</font></p>

generally accepted in the United States of America and are intended to reflect
a more conservative view by, for example, requiring immediate expensing of

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The table above excludes liabilities related to
separate accounts of $2,220.8 million.&#160;
Separate account liabilities represent funds maintained for contract
holders who bear the related investment risk.&#160;
These liabilities are supported by assets that are legally segregated
and are not subject to claims that arise from other business activities of
Protective.&#160; These assets and liabilities
are separately identified on the consolidated balance sheets of
Protective.&#160; The table also excludes
future cash flows related to certain insurance liabilities due to the
uncertainty with respect to the timing of the cash flows.</font></p>

<p style="font-size:10.0pt;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">IMPACT</font></b>  <b><font style="font-weight:bold;">OF INFLATION</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Inflation increases the need for life insurance. Many
policyholders who once had adequate insurance programs may increase their life
insurance coverage to provide the same relative financial benefit and
protection.&#160; Higher interest rates may
result in higher sales of certain of Protective&#146;s investment products.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:.25in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The higher interest rates that have traditionally
accompanied inflation could also affect Protective&#146;s operations.&#160; Policy loans increase as policy loan interest
rates become relatively more attractive.&#160;
As interest rates increase, disintermediation of stable value and
annuity account balances and individual life policy cash values may
increase.&#160; The market value of Protective&#146;s
fixed-rate, long-term investments may decrease, Protective may be unable to
implement fully the interest rate reset and call provisions of its mortgage
loans, and Protective&#146;s ability to make attractive mortgage loans, including
participating mortgage loans, may decrease.&#160;
In addition, participating mortgage loan income may decrease.&#160; The difference between the interest rate
earned on investments and the interest rate credited to life insurance and
investment products may also be adversely affected by rising interest rates.</font></p>
