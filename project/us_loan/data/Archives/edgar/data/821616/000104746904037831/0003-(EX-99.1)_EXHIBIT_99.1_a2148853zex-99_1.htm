<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B><I>&#151;Renewed Plan replaces existing Plan that expires on December 21, 2004&#151;  </I></B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>EXETER, NH, December 21, 2004</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> &#151; Bentley Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NYSE: BNT), a specialty pharmaceutical
company focused on advanced drug delivery technologies, which also manufactures and markets a growing branded and generic product line in Europe, today announced that its Board of Directors has
adopted a Renewed Shareholder Rights Plan to replace its Shareholder Rights Plan that expires on December 21, 2004. The Renewed Plan is designed to protect long-term shareholder value and to ensure
that all shareholders receive fair and equal treatment in the event of any coercive takeover tactics which may be used to gain control of Bentley. The Renewed Plan will not prevent a takeover, but
should encourage anyone seeking to acquire Bentley to negotiate with the Board of Directors prior to attempting a takeover. The Renewed Plan was not adopted in response to any specific effort to
acquire control of Bentley. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bentley
believes shareholder rights plans have been used as an effective tool by many public companies seeking to preserve and enhance shareholder value," said James R. Murphy,
President and Chief Executive Officer. "The Renewed Rights Plan is intended to provide the Board of Directors with sufficient time to consider any and all alternatives to coercive takeover attempts.
By adopting this Renewed Rights Plan to replace the existing Plan, the Board of Directors believes it is protecting the interests of all of its shareholders." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the adoption of the Renewed Shareholder Rights Plan, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of one preferred stock purchase right for each outstanding share of
Bentley's Common Stock. Each of these rights, when exercisable, will entitle the holder to purchase one one-thousandth (1/1000) of a share of Bentley's Series A Junior Participating Preferred Stock at
a purchase price of $72.55. In the event that any person or group (other than Michael McGovern, one of Bentley's directors, who holds approximately 14% of Bentley's stock), together with its
affiliated entities acquires beneficial ownership of 15% or more of the outstanding shares of Bentley's Common Stock, each holder of a right, other than the acquirer, would be entitled to receive,
upon payment of the exercise price, a number of shares of Common Stock having a market value equal to two times the purchase price of the right. In order to retain flexibility and the ability to
maximize shareholder value in the event of transactions that may arise in the future, the Board retains the power to redeem the rights for $0.001 per right. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
distribution of the rights will be made to shareholders of record as of the close of business on December 21, 2004. Initially, the rights will be attached to certificates
representing outstanding shares of common stock and no separate rights certificates will be distributed. The rights will expire on December 19, 2014 unless earlier redeemed or exchanged in accordance
with the Renewed Shareholder Rights Plan. </FONT></P>

Rights Agreement, which will be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission as an exhibit to a current report on Form 8-K.</I></FONT></P>
