ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 17, 2004, Elephant & Castle Group Inc. (the "Company")
entered into a series of agreements intended to improve the Company's balance
sheet and cash availability. The transactions have resulted in a substantial
dilution of the current equity, all as described hereinafter.

TRANSACTIONS WITH GE INVESTMENT PRIVATE PLACEMENT PARTNERS II ("GEIPPP")
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

In consideration for the surrender of US$3,900,000 of the existing Senior Notes,
the surrender of US$5,000,000 of the existing Junior Notes and the waiver of
US$1,208,811 of accrued interest on these Notes the Company has issued
US$4,203,879 of new Senior Notes, 3,653,972 of CDN$2 (US$1.57) preferred shares
and a warrant to purchase 1,750,000 shares of common stock. The Senior Notes
bear interest at 14%, which accrues until payments commence in March, 2007,
except in certain circumstances, and are fully repayable on December 18th, 2009.
The preferred shares accrue a cumulative annual dividend of 6%, payable only
when the Crown debt and Senior Notes are repaid in full. The preferred shares
are redeemable at the Company's option at 100% of redemption principal plus a
redemption premium of up to 50% of the principal amount. Unless redeemed
earlier, the preferred shares are automatically convertible, subject to the
Company achieving an EBITDA target of US$3,500,000, at the rate of 3 shares of
common stock for every 2 preferred shares. The warrants are exerciseable for a
period of ten years at a price of CDN$0.667 per share. By these transactions,
the Company reduced its indebtedness by US$5,904,932, and postponed the due date
on the remaining balance of US$4,203,879 from September, 2005 until December,
2009 in exchange for equity securities representing, on a fully converted basis,
approximately 53% of the new total outstanding, and a higher coupon on the debt
component.


TRANSACTIONS WITH CROWN CAPITAL PARTNERS ("CROWN")
- --------------------------------------------------

Prior to the transactions described herein, the Company had no business
relationship with Crown or any affiliates thereof. The Company has entered into
a credit agreement with Crown, pursuant to which it borrowed CDN$5,000,000 (US$
4,040,000). The loan bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum. Interest is
payable monthly and monthly principal payments of CDN$40,000 (US$32,320)
commence in December, 2006, rising to CDN$60,000 (US$48,480) in December 2007
and CDN$100,000 (US$80,800) in December 2008, with the balance of CDN$2,600,000
(US$2,100,800) repayable by 17th December, 2009. In connection with the making
of the loan, Crown received a first secured position over all of the Company's
assets and properties, including the capital stock of the subsidiary companies,
in respect of the loan indebtedness. Additionally, the Company granted Crown a
warrant to purchase 1,399,301 shares of common stock of the Company and 730,794
preferred shares of the Company for $100, representing 15% of the outstanding
shares of both classes of stock of the Company. By the Crown transactions, the
company realised a CDN$5,000,000 (US$4,040,000) (less expenses of the
transaction) improvement in its balance sheet for a fixed interest rate of 12%,
which management believes to be highly favourable under the heavily leveraged
circumstances of the borrowing. The added cost of doing so, however, was the
grant of a 15% equity stake in the company to Crown.


TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT
- ----------------------------

The Company has entered into an agreement with the three senior managers of the
Company ("Management"), whereby Management has committed to purchase for
CDN$265,000, over a period of 18 months, 932,867 common shares and 487,196
preferred shares, representing 10% of the outstanding shares of both classes of
stock of the Company. Management has made an initial payment of CDN$115,000
(US$92,920) and only receive share ownership in respect of fully paid
securities. In connection with this purchase, Management have also been issued a
warrant for the purchase of an additional 5% of both classes of stock for
CDN$132,500.


AGREEMENTS BETWEEN INVESTORS
- ----------------------------

GEIPPP and Crown have entered into an inter-creditor agreement, which
establishes the seniority of the Crown security and the subordination of the
GEIPPP security over the assets of the Company.

GEIPPP, Crown and Management have entered into an inter-shareholder agreement.
Under this agreement all parties agree to appoint two GEIPPP nominees, one Crown
nominee and one Management nominee to the board of the Company. Additionally the
parties have agreed conditions and entitlements associated with the sale or
transfer of their shares.

Investors in US$661,171 of 8% convertible, subordinated notes of the company
issued in 2000 ("Delphi Investors") have agreed to the amendment of their notes
such that the coupon will be increased to 9.25% and repayment will be scheduled
to re-commence in March, 2007.

The total common shares required for the issuance of all of the shares
necessary, upon conversion of all of the preferred shares and all of the
warrants issued in the transactions described above, is in excess of the
20,000,000 common shares currently authorized by the Memorandum of the Company.
GEIPPP, Crown and Management have committed to authorising and approving an
increase in the authorised share capital of the Company.

     if such proceeding is being contested by the Company or such Subsidiary in
     good faith, the same shall (a) result in the entry of an order for relief
     or any such adjudication or appointment or (b) continue undismissed, or

then, upon the happening of any event described in clauses (ix) and (x) in this
paragraph 6 (with respect to the Company), the Notes shall be and become
immediately due and payable without any notice of any kind at the principal
amount thereof together with accrued interest thereon, or, during the
continuance of any event referred to in this paragraph 6 other than such clauses
(ix) and (x) (with respect to the Company), any holder or holders of 66-2/3% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may, at their option
and in addition to any right, power or remedy permitted by law or equity or
herein granted, by notice in writing to the Company, declare all of the Notes to
be, and such Notes shall thereupon be and become, forthwith due and payable at
the

<Page>
                                      -18-


principal amount thereof, together with interest accrued thereon and a
premium equal to that amount which is sufficient to provide a return equal to
the Defined Rate, per annum on the principal amount thereof, taking into account
any interest on such Notes paid to and including the date of final payment
thereof, compounded quarterly, from the date of issuance to the date of such
payment.

          The above provision with respect to any acceleration of the Notes is
subject to the condition that if for any reason after the principal of the Notes
shall have so become due and payable, the Company shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the holders in their sole judgment that it is able to pay all
matured installments of interest upon the Notes and to make any required
payments which shall have become due other than by reason of such acceleration
(with interest upon such payments and, to the extent that payment of such
interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of
interest) and all defaults under this Agreement, other than nonpayment of the
principal of or interest on the Notes which have become due by such
acceleration, shall have been remedied or waived by holders representing at
least the percentage in aggregate principal amount of Notes requesting such
acceleration, then and in such instance such default may be waived and its
consequences rescinded and annulled by the holders representing at least the
percentage in aggregate principal amount of Notes requesting such acceleration
by written notice to the Company, which waiver shall be binding upon all
holders. It is expressly understood and agreed that the decision so to waive any
default and so to rescind and annul any consequences is within the sole judgment
and control of the holders of the Notes, and such holders shall be under no
obligation so to do.

          7. REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES. The Company represents,

each Subsidiary is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign or extra
provincial corporation or other legal entity to do business in every
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the
nature of any business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary and

taken as a whole. The Company has no Subsidiary other than those set forth in
Exhibit 7A and except as set forth on such Exhibit 7A, such Subsidiaries are
wholly owned. Attached hereto as Exhibit 7A2 are complete and correct copies of

     corporate authority. This Agreement, the Notes and the Purchased Shares
     constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company
     enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
     enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization or other similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally
     and the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
     such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and
     with respect to the indemnification provisions contained herein, by

securities is subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraph 11 of that
certain Amended and Restated Note and Stock Purchase Agreement, dated December
17, 2004 between Elephant & Castle Group Inc. and GE Investment Private
Placement Partners II, a Limited Partnership, copies of which are available for
inspection at the offices of Elephant & Castle Group Inc., and such securities
may be transferred only in compliance with the terms and conditions of said
paragraph 11 of said Amended and Restated Note and Stock Purchase Agreement.

          11C. NOTICE OF PROPOSED TRANSFER; OPINIONS OF COUNSEL; CERTAIN
RESTRICTIONS. Each holder of any Notes, Purchased Shares, Warrants or of any
Restricted Securities, by its acceptance thereof, agrees that, except as
otherwise expressly provided below in this paragraph 11C, prior to the taking of
any Restricted Action, such holder will give written notice to the Company of
such holder's intention to take such Restricted Action and to comply in all
other respects with this paragraph 11C. Each such notice (i) shall describe the
manner and circumstances of the proposed Restricted Action in sufficient detail
to enable counsel to render the opinions referred to below and (ii) shall
designate counsel for the holder giving such notice (who may be house counsel
for such holder). The holder giving such notice will submit a copy thereof to
the counsel designated in such notice, and the Company will promptly submit a
copy thereof to its counsel (who may be house counsel for the Company), and the
following provisions shall apply:

          (a) If in the opinion of each such counsel the proposed Restricted
     Action may be effected without registration under the Securities Act or any
     applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws of any Note or Restricted
     Securities involved in, or issuable upon conversion of any Purchased Shares
     or exercise any Warrant involved in, such Restricted Action, then the
     Company will promptly notify the holder thereof and such holder shall
     thereupon be entitled to effect such Restricted Action in accordance with
     the terms of the notice delivered by such holder to the Company, and the
     Company will promptly effect any transfer of any Notes or Restricted
     Securities involved in such Restricted Action and either deliver new Notes
     in accordance with paragraph 13E, or certificates for Restricted Securities
     bearing (or not bearing, if in the opinion of each such counsel such legend
     is no longer required to insure compliance with the Securities Act) the
     legend set forth in paragraph 11B, or both, as the case may be. If for any
     reason counsel for the Company (after having been furnished with the
     information required to be

<Page>
                                      -29-


     furnished by clause (i) of this paragraph 11C) shall fail to deliver an
     opinion to the Company (with a copy to such holder), or the Company shall
     fail to notify such holder thereof as aforesaid, within 15 days after
     counsel for such holder shall have delivered its opinion to such holder
     (with a copy to the Company), then for all purposes hereof the opinion of
     counsel for the Company shall be deemed to be the same as the opinion of
     counsel for such holder.

          (b) If in the opinion of either or both of such counsel (such opinion
     or opinions to state the basis of the legal conclusions reached therein)
     the proposed Restricted Action may not legally be effected without
     registration under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities or
     Blue Sky laws of any Note or Restricted Securities involved in, or issuable
     upon conversion of any Purchased Shares or exercise of any Warrant involved
     in, such Restricted Action, the Company shall promptly so notify the holder
     thereof and thereafter such holder shall not be entitled to effect such
     Restricted Action until receipt of a further notice from the Company under
     clause (a) of this paragraph 11C.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder shall be permitted to
transfer any Note or Notes or any Restricted Security or Restricted Securities
attributable to Notes in one or more transactions to a limited number of
institutional investors similar in nature to the Buyer or "accredited investors"
as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x)
each such investor shall represent in writing that it is acquiring such Note or
Restricted Security for investment and not with a view to the distribution
thereof (subject, however, to any requirement of law that the disposition
thereof shall at all times be within the control of such transferee), (y) each
such investor shall agree in writing to be bound by all the restrictions on
transfer of such Note or Restricted Security contained in paragraph 11 hereof
and (z) such holder shall deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel (who
shall be satisfactory to the Company) stating that such transfer may be effected
without registration under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
or Blue Sky laws. The Company will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel (other than house counsel) for any holder of Notes or Restricted
Securities and of counsel for the Company in connection with all opinions
rendered by them pursuant to this paragraph 11C, and will reimburse any such
holder for all other out-of-pocket expenses (other than Registration Expenses)
incurred by such holder in complying with this paragraph 11C.

          11D. REGISTRATION OF RESTRICTED SECURITIES ON REQUEST. Upon the
written request of the holders of no less than 50% of the outstanding Restricted
Securities, which request (a) shall describe the Restricted Action proposed to
be effected by such holder and the intended method of disposition by such holder
of the Restricted Securities involved in such proposed Restricted Action, and
(b) shall request that the Company effect the registration of all or part of
such holder's Restricted Securities under the Securities Act, the Company will
promptly give written notice of such requested registration to all holders of
outstanding Notes, Warrants or Restricted Securities and thereupon will use its
best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of (i) the
Restricted Securities which the Company has been so requested to register, for
disposition in accordance with the intended method of disposition stated in such
request,

<Page>
                                      -30-


and (ii) all other Restricted Securities the holders of which shall
have, within 30 days after the receipt of such written notice from the Company,
made written request (stating the intended method of disposition of such
securities by such holders) to the Company for registration thereof, all to the
extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended
method thereof as aforesaid) by all such holders of the Restricted Securities so
to be registered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated to
effect any such registration pursuant to this paragraph 11D (a) at any time
prior to the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement (b) at any time
prior to the first anniversary of the effective date of a registration statement
filed with the Commission pursuant to a written notice of requested registration
pursuant to this paragraph 11D, or (c) at any time subsequent to the third such
registration made pursuant to this paragraph 11D which shall have become
effective with respect to all Restricted Securities requested to be included
therein and not have been interfered with by any order or requirement of the
Commission or any other governmental agency or any court. The holders requesting
any registration pursuant to this paragraph shall select the underwriter or
underwriters to be used in connection with any public offering of securities
registered pursuant to this paragraph; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that so long as the
Buyer shall hold any Restricted Securities, the Buyer shall have the right, in
its sole discretion, to approve or disapprove of any underwriter in which
General Electric Company has a direct or indirect interest of 5% or more.

          11E. PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATION. If the Company at any time proposes to
register any of its equity securities (other than securities issued with respect
to any acquisition or any employee stock option, stock purchase, or similar plan
or any other securities to be registered pursuant to a special purpose
registration) under the Securities Act on Form S-1, Form S-2, Form S-3 or any
other form of general application for sale of securities to the public in an
underwritten offering upon which may be registered securities similar to the
Restricted Securities, it will each such time at least 60 days prior to the
anticipated filing date of such proposed registration statement give written
notice to all holders of all outstanding Notes or Restricted Securities of its
intention so to do and, upon the written request of any such holder made within
30 days after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the
Restricted Securities intended to be disposed of by such holder and state the
intended method of disposition thereof), the Company will use its best efforts
to effect the registration under the Securities Act of Restricted Securities
which the Company has been so requested to register, to the extent requisite to
permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof as
aforesaid) by such holders of the Restricted Securities to be so registered,
subject to the discretion of the managing underwriter to limit or exclude any of
such equity securities from the offering if it determines that the inclusion
thereof would adversely affect the marketing of the securities to be sold by the
Company therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any of such equity securities are to
be included in such underwriting for the account of any person other than the
Buyer, the number of such equity securities to be included by any such person
shall be reduced first; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that if any Restricted
Securities are to be distributed pursuant to this paragraph through a firm of
underwriters to the public and the Buyer shall be participating in such offering
the Buyer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to approve or disapprove
of any underwriter in which General Electric Company has a direct or indirect
interest of 5% or more. No registration effected

<Page>
                                      -31-


pursuant to this paragraph 11E shall relieve the Company from its obligation to
effect any registration upon request pursuant to paragraph 11D hereof.

          11F. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. The Registration Expenses in connection
with any registration in which Restricted Securities or Notes shall be included
pursuant to paragraph 11D, 11E or 11F shall be borne by the Company.

          11G. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. If and whenever the Company is required
to effect the registration of any Restricted Securities under the Securities Act
as provided in this Agreement, the Company will promptly:

          (i) prepare and (in any event within 90 days after the end of the
     period within which requests for registration may be given to the Company)
     file with the Commission a registration statement with respect to such
     Restricted Securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration
     statement to become effective;

          (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
     supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
     connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration
     statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
     with respect to the disposition of all such Restricted Securities and other
     securities covered by such registration statement until such time as all of
     such Restricted Securities and other securities have been disposed of in
     accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or
     sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement, but in no event
     for a period of more than 270 days after such registration statement
     becomes effective;

          (iii) furnish to each seller of such Restricted Securities such number
     of copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and
     supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), such number of
     copies of the prospectus included in such registration statement (including
     each preliminary prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the
     Securities Act, and such other documents, as such seller may reasonably
     request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Restricted Securities
     owned by such seller;

          (iv) use its best efforts to register or qualify such Restricted
     Securities covered by such registration statement under such other
     applicable securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the
     United States of America (including territories and commonwealths thereof)
     as each seller shall reasonably request, except that the Company shall not
     for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a
     foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified, to
     subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to consent to
     general service of process in any jurisdiction;

          (v) notify each seller of any such Restricted Securities covered by
     such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto
     is required to be delivered under the Securities Act within the period
     mentioned in

<Page>
                                      -32-


     subdivision (ii) of this paragraph 11H, of the happening of any event as a
     result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as
     then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
     state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
     the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under
     which they were made (and upon receipt of such notice and until a
     supplemented or amended prospectus as set forth below is available, each
     such seller shall not offer or sell any securities covered by such
     registration statement and shall return all copies of such prospectus to
     the Company if requested to do so by it), and at the request of any such
     seller prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable number of copies of
     a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so
     that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Restricted
     Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light
     of the circumstances under which they were made; and

          (vi) furnish to each holder for which Restricted Securities are
     registered or are to be registered at the time of the disposition of such
     Restricted Securities by such holder, a signed copy of an opinion of
     counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to, and which opinion
     shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to, such holder) to
     the effect that: (a) a registration statement covering such Restricted
     Securities has been filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and
     has been made effective by order of the Commission, (b) said registration
     statement and the prospectus contained therein comply as to form in all
     material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, and (after
     due inquiry) such counsel has no reason to believe that either said
     registration statement or such prospectus contains any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such
     prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
     misleading, (c) after due inquiry said counsel knows of no legal or
     governmental proceedings required to be described in said registration
     statement or prospectus which are not described as required, or of any
     contracts or documents of a character required to be described in said
     registration statement or prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to said
     registration statement or to be incorporated by reference therein which is
     not described and filed as required, (d) no stop order has been issued by
     the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement
     and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for the
     issuance of such a stop order are pending or threatened, and (e) the
     applicable provisions of the securities or Blue Sky laws of each state in
     which the Company shall be required, pursuant to clause (iv) of this
     paragraph 11G, to register or qualify such Notes or Restricted Securities,
     have been complied with, assuming the accuracy and completeness of the
     information furnished to such counsel with respect to each filing relating
     to such laws; it being understood that such opinion may contain such
     qualifications and assumptions as are customary in the rendering of similar
     opinions, and that such counsel may rely, as to all factual matters treated
     therein, on certificates of the Company (copies of which shall be delivered
     to such holder).
<Page>
                                      -33-


          The Company may require each seller of any Restricted Securities as to
which any registration is being effected to furnish the Company such information
regarding such seller and the distribution of such Restricted Securities as the
Company may from time to time request in writing and as shall be required by law
to effect such registration.

          11H. TERMINATION OF RESTRICTIONS. All restrictions imposed by
paragraph 11 hereof upon the transferability of Notes or Restricted Securities
shall cease and terminate as to any particular Notes or Restricted Securities,
(a) when such securities shall have been effectively registered under the
Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the registration statement
covering such securities, or (b) when, in the opinion of counsel for the holder
thereof and counsel for the Company, such restrictions are no longer required in
order to insure compliance with the Securities Act. Whenever such restrictions
shall terminate as to any Notes or Restricted Securities, the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive from the Company without expense a new certificate
or certificates representing such securities not bearing the legend set forth in
paragraph 11B hereof.

          11I. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) In the event of any registration of any
     Restricted Securities under the Securities Act pursuant to this Agreement,
     the Company will indemnify and hold harmless the seller of such securities
     and its directors and officers and each underwriter of such securities and
     each other person, if any, who controls such seller or underwriter within
     the meaning the Securities Act, against any losses, claims, damages or
     liabilities, joint or several, to which such seller, director or officer or
     underwriter or controlling person may become subject under the Securities
     Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
     (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based
     upon (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material
     fact contained in any registration statement under which such securities
     were registered under the Securities Act, any preliminary prospectus or
     final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
     or (ii) any omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
     required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
     not misleading; and the Company will reimburse such seller, each such
     director and officer, each such underwriter and each such controlling
     person for any legal or any other expenses reasonably incurred by them in
     connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
     liability, action or proceeding; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall
     not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
     loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of or is based upon any untrue
     statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission made
     in such registration statement, any such preliminary prospectus, final
     prospectus, amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with
     written information furnished to the Company through an instrument duly
     executed by such seller, officer or director, underwriter or controlling
     person specifically for use in the preparation thereof. Such indemnity
     shall remain in full force and effect irrespective of any investigation by
     any person indemnified above.
<Page>
                                      -34-


          (b) The Company may require, as a condition to including any
     Restricted Securities in any registration statement filed pursuant to
     paragraph 11 hereof, that the Company shall have received an undertaking
     satisfactory to it from the prospective seller and underwriter of such
     securities to indemnify and hold harmless (in the same manner and to the
     same extent as set forth in subdivision (a) of this paragraph 11J, but only
     to an amount, with respect to such prospective seller, not in excess of the
     gross proceeds realized by such seller from the sale of Restricted
     Securities registered pursuant to such registration statement) the Company,
     each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who shall sign
     such registration statement and any person who controls the Company within
     the meaning of the Securities Act, with respect to any statement in or
     omission from such registration statement, any preliminary prospectus or
     final prospectus contained therein, or any amendment or supplement thereto,
     if such statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in conformity
     with written information furnished to the Company through an instrument
     duly executed by such seller or underwriter, specifically for use in the
     preparation of such registration statement, preliminary prospectus, final
     prospectus, amendment or supplement.

          (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party of notice of the
     commencement of any action involving a claim referred to in the preceding
     paragraphs of this paragraph 11J, such indemnified party shall, if a claim
     in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying party, give
     written notice to the latter of the commencement of such action; PROVIDED,
     HOWEVER, that the failure of any indemnified party to give notice as
     provided herein shall not relieve the indemnifying party of its obligations
     under the preceding paragraphs of this paragraph 11J, except to the extent
     that the indemnifying party is actually prejudiced by such failure to give
     notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party,
     the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate in and to assume
     the defense thereof, jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly
     notified to the extent that it may wish, with counsel reasonably
     satisfactory to such indemnified party, and after notice from the
     indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume
     the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be liable to such
     indemnified party for any legal or other expense subsequently incurred by
     the latter in connection with the defense thereof. No indemnifying party,
     in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall, except with the
     consent of each indemnified party, consent to entry of any judgment or
     enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional term
     thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to such indemnified party
     of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

          11J. AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION. The Company will comply with the
reporting requirements of Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act applicable
to it and shall use its best efforts to comply with all other public information
reporting requirements of the Commission (including reporting requirements which
serve as a condition to utilization of Rule 144 promulgated by the Commission
under the Securities Act) applicable to it from time to time in effect and
relating to the availability of an

<Page>
                                      -35-


exemption from the Securities Act for the sale of any Notes or Restricted
Securities. The Company will also cooperate with each holder of any Notes or
Restricted Securities in supplying such information and documentation as may be
necessary for such holder to complete and file any information reporting forms
presently or hereafter required by the Commission as a condition to the
availability of an exemption from the Securities Act for the sale of any Notes
or Restricted Securities.

          11K. DURATION OF OBLIGATIONS. The obligations of the Company under
paragraph 11 hereof, and the obligations under paragraph 11I hereof of the
Company and any seller of Restricted Securities becoming obligated thereunder,
shall continue for so long as any Notes or Restricted Securities shall be
outstanding, except as otherwise provided in paragraph 11 hereof.

nominal date.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the day

                                 TO THE COMPANY

OPINION AS TO UNITED STATES LAW MATTERS TO BE PROVIDED BY D. DAVID COHEN, ESQ.
COVERING THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS:

          (1) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada
and has all requisite corporate power and authority (a) to carry on the business
in which it is engaged and to own, operate and encumber the properties that it
owns, (b) to enter into the Agreement, the Amendment No. 2 to the U.S. Security
Agreement and the amended UCC-1 Financing Statements (collectively, the
"Transaction Documents"), (c) to issue and deliver the Notes and the Purchased
Shares and to incur the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and (d) to carry out
the provisions of the Transaction Documents and the Notes to be carried out by
it.

          (2) The Company is duly authorized to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which it operates and has been duly qualified and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary or desirable.

          (3) Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the
corporate power and authority to own, operate and encumber its assets, to
transact its business, as presently operated, and to execute the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder and
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary or desirable.

          (4) Each of the Transaction Documents, the Notes, the Purchased Shares
and the Warrants being acquired by you under the Agreement has been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (no action by the stockholders of the Company being required by
law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise), has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and its Subsidiaries and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, enforceable against
the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited (a) by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, (b) by general principles of equity, regardless of
whether enforcement of any obligation therein mentioned is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law and (c) with respect to the indemnification
provisions contained in the Agreement, by applicable securities laws or
principles of public policy.

          (5) The Purchased Shares have been duly authorized for issuance, are
subject to no preemptive rights, are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.

                                      -2-


          (6) The shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon the
conversion of the Purchased Shares or the exercise of the Warrant, as the case
may be, Notes have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance, are subject
to no preemptive rights, and when and if issued, will be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.

          (7) There are, except as disclosed in the Agreement and the Exhibits
thereto, no options, warrants, conversion or other rights, agreements or
commitments of any kind obligating, or which might in the future obligate, the
Company to sell any shares of its capital stock of any class or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock of any
class, and no authorization therefore has been granted by the Company.

          (8) The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents, the
Notes, the Purchased Shares and the Warrant and the performance by the Company
and its Subsidiaries of its agreements, covenants and obligations thereunder and
the issuance of the Notes do not and will not (a) require any consent which has
not been provided for in the Transaction Documents and obtained, (b) contravene,
conflict with or result in any violation of the provisions of any federal or
state statute, rule or regulation binding on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or require registration with any governmental
authority, (c) contravene, conflict with or result in a breach or constitute a
default under or give rise to any right to accelerate or require payment,
repurchase or redemption of any obligation or require any consent under any
indenture or loan or credit agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation, Notice
of Articles or Articles of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other agreement,
lease or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of their property is bound, (d) result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any lien, security interest or other encumbrance (other than as
contemplated by the Transaction Documents) upon or with respect to any of the
properties now owned or hereafter acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary, or
(e) cause the Company or any Subsidiary to be in default under any law, order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree, agreement, lease or instrument.

          (9) The issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Purchased Shares by
the Company under the circumstances contemplated by the Agreement constitute
transactions exempt from registration under applicable state securities and Blue
Sky laws and from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and do not, under existing law, require the registration of the Notes
and the Purchased Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
compliance with any requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

          (10) All consents, approvals or authorizations, if any, of any
governmental authority required on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in connection with the execution and delivery or performance of the Transaction
Documents or the offer, issue or delivery of the Notes and the Purchased Shares
to you have been duly obtained, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied with any applicable provisions of law requiring any declaration,
filing, registration and/or qualification with any governmental authority in
connection with such offer, issue or delivery.
<Page>
                                      -3-


          (11) There is no action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity by or
before any governmental authority or tribunal or other agency now pending or
threatened against or affecting either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any properties or rights of any thereof (i) wherein an unfavorable decision,
ruling or finding would have a material adverse effect on the validity or
enforceability of the Transaction Documents or the Notes and the Purchased
Shares or would materially and adversely affect the business, property, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise), results of operation or prospects of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) that seeks
to enjoin or otherwise prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents or the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the
Purchased Shares.

          (12) The U.S. Security Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1,
continues to create valid and enforceable security interest in favor of you in
the Collateral specified therein that the U.S. Security Agreement purports to
create to secure the Secured Obligations, subject to the effect of (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights and remedies, and (ii) general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

          (13) Upon filing of the amendments to financing statements in the
states where the Company and its Subsidiaries are incorporated, the Secured
Party will continue to have a perfected security interest in any Collateral in
which a security interest may be perfected through the filing of the financing
statements under Article 9 of the NYUCC, or under any parallel provisions of the
UCC applicable in the states where the Company and its Subsidiaries are
incorporated, subject to the effect of (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general application relating
to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies, and (ii)
general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law.

equivalent are the rates so determined, multiplied by the actual number of days
in the year divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365) or three hundred and
sixty-six (366), as the case may be.

4.5  MAXIMUM INTEREST.

It is the intent of the parties that the rate of interest and the other charges
to the Borrower under this Agreement shall be lawful; therefore, if for any
reason the interest or other charges payable under this Agreement are found by a
court of competent jurisdiction, in a final determination, to exceed the limit
which the Lender may lawfully charge the Borrower, then the obligation to pay
interest and other charges shall automatically be reduced with retroactive
effect to such limit and, if any amount in excess of such limit shall have been
paid, then such amount shall be refunded to the Borrower.

4.6  CLOSING FEE.

The Borrower shall pay to the Lender a financing fee equal to $100,000, (of
which $50,000 has already been paid to the Lender) which fee shall be fully
earned, non-refundable and payable in full on the earlier of the dates of such
payment and the Closing Date.

                                     -14-

4.7  CLOSING EXPENSES.

The Borrower shall reimburse the Lender for all reasonable costs and expenses
including, without limitation, consultant's fees and expenses, legal expenses
and reasonable legal fees, incurred by the Lender in connection with the
documentation and consummation of this transaction (whether or not this
transaction is consummated) including, without limitation, security and other
public record searches, lien filings, express mail or similar express or
messenger delivery, due diligence costs and expenses, and in seeking to collect,
protect or enforce any rights in or to the Collateral or incurred by the Lender
in seeking to collect any Liabilities and to administer and enforce any of their
rights under this Agreement. The Borrower shall also pay all normal service
charges with respect to accounts, if any, maintained by the Lender for the
benefit of the Borrower. All such costs, expenses and charges shall constitute
Liabilities hereunder, shall be payable by the Borrower to the Lender on demand
and, until paid, shall bear interest at the Deemed Interest Rate.

4.8  INCREASED COSTS.

Notwithstanding any other provision herein, in the event that the introduction
of or any change in any law, rule, regulation, treaty or directive or in the
interpretation or application thereof, or compliance by the Lender with any
request or directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any
governmental authority, agency or instrumentality or regulatory body:

     (a)  subjects the Lender to any tax of any kind whatsoever with respect to
          this Agreement, the Other Agreements or the Loan, or changes the basis
          of taxation of payments to the Lender of principal, interest or any
          other amount payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax
          imposed on the overall net income of the Lender); or

     (b)  imposes, modifies, holds applicable any reserve, special deposit,
          compulsory loan or similar requirement against Property held by, or
          deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances or
          loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of
          funds by, any office of the Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to materially increase the cost to the
Lender of agreeing to make, making, continuing or maintaining or participating
in the Loan, or to materially reduce any amount receivable thereunder or to
materially increase the withholding taxes payable then, in any such case, the
Borrower shall pay the Lender, after demand by such Lender, any additional
amounts necessary to compensate such Lender on an after-tax basis for such
additional cost or reduced amount receivable or increased withholding taxes
payable with respect to this Agreement or the Loan made hereunder;.

                        ARTICLE 5 - LOAN ADMINISTRATION

5.1  DISBURSEMENT OF LOAN.

The Borrower hereby irrevocably authorizes the Lender to disburse the proceeds
of the Loan on the Closing Date in accordance with the terms of a written
disbursement letter acceptable to the Lender from the Borrower.

6.1  TERMINATION.

This Agreement shall be in effect from the date hereof until the Maturity Date
unless the Liabilities become due and payable pursuant to Section 3.2 or ARTICLE
13 hereof in which case the Borrower shall immediately pay all of the
Liabilities. If the due date of the Liabilities is accelerated pursuant to
Section 3.2 or ARTICLE 13 hereof or if the Borrower prepays the Loan in
accordance with Section 3.3 hereof, this Agreement shall terminate on the date
that all such Liabilities are paid in full. At such time as the Borrower has
repaid all of the Liabilities and this Agreement has terminated:

     (a)  the Borrower shall provide a release of any obligations and
          liabilities of the Lender, and their respective officers, directors,
          employees, agents, Affiliates and Subsidiaries, in form and substance
          satisfactory to the Lender, in its sole discretion; and

     (b)  upon the Borrower's request, the Lender shall, at the Borrower's cost
          and expense, deliver to the Borrower a termination, discharge and
          release of all security in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
          to the Borrower.

6.2  CONTINUING LIABILITIES.

Nothing in Section 6.1 shall effect any liabilities and obligations of the
Borrower set out in this Agreement or the Other Agreements which are stated to
survive payment of the Liabilities and termination of this Agreement or the
Other Agreements, as the case may be.

                  ARTICLE 7 - SECURITY INTEREST AND COLLATERAL

7.1  SECURITY INTEREST TO THE LENDER.

Without limiting any other provision hereof or of the Other Agreements, as
security for all of the Liabilities, including without limitation the payment of

only to Permitted Liens) and perfected and duly registered security interest
(the "Security Interest") in, Lien on and assignment of all of the undertaking
and Property of the Borrower, whether now or hereafter owned, existing, acquired
or arising, tangible or intangible, real or personal, movable or immovable and

     (d)  all Goods (other than Inventory) including Equipment, vehicles and
          fixtures of the Borrower;

     (e)  all deposits and cash and any other property of the Borrower now or
          hereafter in the possession, custody or control of the Lender or any
          agent or any parent, Affiliate or Subsidiary of the Lender or any
          participant with the Lender in the Loan for any purpose (whether for
          safekeeping, deposit, collection, custody, pledge, transmission or
          otherwise);

     (f)  all real, immovable and leasehold property of the Borrower and all
          easements, rights-of-ways, privileges, benefits, licences,

          appurtenant thereto or separately owned or held, including without
          limitation, all structures, plants and other fixtures now owned or
          hereafter owned or acquired; and

     (g)  all additions and accessions to, substitutions for, and replacements,

          property, and all of the Borrower's books and records relating to any
          of the foregoing and to the Borrower's business.

7.2  PRESERVATION OF COLLATERAL AND PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTERESTS THEREIN.

The Borrower shall, at the Lender's request and at the Borrower's expense, at
any time and from time to time, execute and deliver to the Lender such financing
statements, documents and other agreements and instruments (and the Borrower
shall pay the cost of filing or recording the same in all public offices deemed
reasonably necessary or desirable by the Lender) and do such other acts and
things as the Lender may deem necessary or desirable in order to establish and
maintain a valid, attached and perfected security interest in the Collateral in
favour of the Lender (free and clear of all other Liens except Permitted Liens)
to secure payment of the Liabilities, and in order to facilitate the collection
of the Collateral, the Borrower irrevocably hereby makes, constitutes and
appoints the Lender (and all Persons designated by such Lender for that purpose)
as the Borrower's true and lawful attorney and agent to execute such financing
statements, documents and other agreements and instruments and do such other
acts and things as may be necessary to preserve and perfect the Security
Interest of the Lender or such Lender in the Collateral to the extent that the
Borrower does not do so after request by the Lender or such Lender or after an
Event of Default.

                                     -17-

<Page>

7.3  POSSESSION OF COLLATERAL AND RELATED MATTERS.

Until an Event of Default has occurred, the Borrower shall have the right,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the ordinary course of the
Borrower's business, to:

     (a)  sell or furnish under contracts of supply or service any of the
          Borrower's Inventory normally held by the Borrower for any such
          purpose; and

     (b)  use and consume any raw materials, work in process or other materials
          normally held by the Borrower for such purpose;

provided however that a sale in the ordinary course of business shall not
include any transfer or sale in satisfaction, partial or complete, of a debt
owed by the Borrower, or a transfer, sale or other disposition to any Parent,
Subsidiary, Affiliate or shareholder of the Borrower, or to any other Person in
whom the Borrower holds any interest or any other related party, which is at a
price or on terms more favourable to the recipient than would be given to an
unrelated party.

7.4  COLLECTIONS.

     (a)  The Lender may, at any time and from time to time after the occurrence
          of an Event of Default which is continuing, in addition to the
          remedies set out in Section 13.1, whether before or after notification
          to any Account Debtor and whether before or after the maturity of any
          of the Liabilities:

          (i)  enforce collection of any of the Borrower's Accounts or contract
               rights by suit or otherwise;

          (ii) exercise all of the Borrower's rights and remedies with respect
               to proceedings brought to collect any of the Borrower's Accounts;

          (iii) surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any Accounts
               of the Borrower, or compromise or extend or renew for any period
               (whether or not longer than the original period) any indebtedness
               thereunder;

          (iv) sell or assign any Account of the Borrower upon such terms, for
               such amount and at such time or times as the Lender deems
               advisable;

          (v)  prepare, file and sign any of the Borrower's names on any proof
               of claim in bankruptcy or other similar document against any
               Account Debtor indebted on an Account of the Borrower; and

          (vi) do all other acts and things which are necessary, in the Lender's
               sole discretion, to fulfil the Borrower's obligations under this
               Agreement and the Other Agreements and to allow the Lender to
               collect the Accounts. In addition to any other provision hereof,
               the Lender may at any time on or after the occurrence of an Event
               of Default which is continuing, at the Borrower's expense, notify
               any parties obligated on any of the Accounts

                                     -18-

<Page>

               of the Borrower to make payment directly to the Lender of any
               amounts due or to become due thereunder.

     (b)  The Lender shall, upon receipt by it of cash or other immediately
          available funds from collections of items of payment and proceeds of
          any Collateral, apply the whole or any part of such collections or
          proceeds against the Liabilities in such order as the Lender shall
          determine in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of this
          Agreement.

     (c)  In its sole credit judgment, without waiving or releasing any
          obligation, liability or duty of the Borrower under this Agreement or
          the Other Agreements or any Default, at any time or times hereafter,
          the Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) pay, acquire or accept
          an assignment of any security interest, hypothec, lien, encumbrance or
          claim asserted by any Person in, upon or against the Collateral. All
          sums paid by the Lender in respect thereof and all costs, fees and
          expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
          disbursements (on a solicitor-client basis) for both inside and
          outside counsel, all court costs and all other charges relating
          thereto) incurred by the Lender shall constitute Liabilities, payable
          by the Borrower on demand and, until paid, shall bear interest at the
          Deemed Interest Rate.

     (d)  Immediately upon the Borrower's receipt of any portion of the
          Collateral consisting of an Instrument, Document of Title or Chattel
          Paper, the Borrower shall, at the Lender's request, deliver the
          original thereof to the Lender together with an appropriate
          endorsement or other specific evidence of assignment thereof to the
          Lender (in form and substance acceptable to the Lender). If an
          endorsement or assignment of any such items shall not be made for any
          reason, the Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized, as the attorney
          and agent of the Borrower, to endorse or assign the same on such
          Person's behalf.

7.5 ATTACHMENT.

The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) value has been given, (ii) the
Borrower has rights in the Collateral, and (iii) the Security Interest shall
attach to existing Collateral upon execution of this Agreement by the Borrower
and to each item of after-acquired Collateral at the time that the Borrower
acquires any rights therein.

7.6  EXCEPTION RE LEASEHOLD INTERESTS AND CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS.

The last day of the term of any lease, sublease or agreement therefore is
specifically excepted from the Security Interest, but the Borrower agrees to
stand possessed of such last day in trust for any Person acquiring such interest
of the Borrower. To the extent that the creation of the Security Interest would
constitute a breach or cause the acceleration of any agreement, right, licence
or permit to which the Borrower is a party, the Security Interest shall not
attach thereto, but the Borrower shall hold its interest therein in trust for
the Lender, and the Security Interest shall attach to such agreement, right,
license or permit forthwith upon obtaining the consent of the other party
thereto.

          enforceability may be limited by applicable

          adequate licenses, patents, patent applications, copyrights, service
          marks, trademarks, trademark applications, tradestyles and tradenames

          knowledge after due inquiry, there are no actions, suits,
          counterclaims or proceedings which are pending or threatened against
          any Obligor which are likely to be adversely determined and if
          adversely determined would have a Material Adverse Effect, and the
          Borrower shall, promptly, upon becoming aware of any such pending or
          threatened action or proceeding, give written notice thereof to the
          Lender;

          well-being. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of
          the Obligors is in arrears in respect of any material lease, rental or
          other payment due

          Collateral having priority over all other Liens on the Collateral
          (except Permitted Liens) and all claims of other creditors, securing
          all of the Liabilities and enforceable against the Obligors and all
          third parties in accordance with their terms;

          instrument evidencing Permitted Liens;

     (m)  each of the Obligors is the lawful owner of all Collateral now
          purportedly owned or hereafter purportedly acquired by it, free from

     (n)  the financial statements delivered or to be delivered to the Lender at
          or prior to the date of this Agreement accurately reflect the
          financial condition of the Obligors and since the date such financial
          statements were most recently delivered to the Lender prior to the
          date of this Agreement, no event or condition has occurred which would
          have, a Material Adverse Effect;

          loans or other indebtedness or liability (contingent or otherwise)
          other than:

          owns property having a value both at fair valuation and at present
          fair saleable value greater than the amount required to pay its debts,

          default by any Obligor, or to the knowledge of the Borrower, by any
          other party to such leases or subleases exists;

     (t)  if any of the Collateral consists of goods of a type normally used in
          more than one jurisdiction, whether or not actually so used, the
          Borrower shall immediately give written notice to the Lender of any
          use of any such goods in any jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in
          which the Borrower has previously advised the Lender such goods shall
          be used, and such goods shall not, unless the Lender shall otherwise
          consent in writing, be used outside of such jurisdiction so advised;

     (u)  each Obligor has complied in all material respects with all
          Environmental Laws applicable to the construction and operation of its
          Properties and businesses; to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, no

               Material of Environmental Concern in any manner which is not in
               compliance in all material respects with all applicable
               Environmental Laws; and

               any such item has become a fixture to real or immovable property
               or an accession to other personal or movable property by
               operation of law without first assuring that the Lender's Liens

               well-being of such Obligor; and

          (iii) each Obligor is in compliance in all material respects with all
               federal, provincial, state and local laws respecting employment

          with the negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this
          Agreement contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to

          information as to the Obligors and each of their properties,
          businesses and affairs.

8.2  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

The Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that all representations,
warranties and covenants of the Borrower contained in this Agreement (whether
appearing in ARTICLE 8 and ARTICLE 10 hereof or elsewhere) shall be true,
correct and complete at the time of the Borrower's execution of this Agreement,
shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance hereof by the parties
hereto and the closing of the transactions described herein or related hereto,
shall, except for representations and warranties that relate solely to an
earlier date, remain true, correct and complete until the repayment in full of
all of the Liabilities and termination of this Agreement.

                       ARTICLE 9 - SCHEDULES AND REPORTS

9.1  FINANCIAL INFORMATION.

The Borrower shall deliver to the Lender the following financial information,

9.2  COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE.

With each financial statement delivered pursuant to Section 9.1, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Lender a certificate substantially in the form of Schedule
9.2 hereto, of the president and chief financial officer of the Borrower setting
forth in reasonable detail the calculations required to establish that the
Borrower was in compliance with the covenants set forth in Section 10.1 during
the period covered in such financial statements and as at the end thereof and
stating that, except as explained in reasonable detail in such certificate:

     (a)  all of the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in
          this Agreement and of the Obligors in the Other Agreements are true,
          correct and complete as of the date of such certificate as if made at

     (b)  at the date of such certificate, the Borrower is in compliance with

relating to any of the Borrower's Accounts, by mail, telephone, telegraph or

                             ARTICLE 10 - COVENANTS

10.1 COVENANTS.

Until payment or satisfaction in full of all Liabilities and termination of this
Agreement, unless the Borrower obtains the prior written consent of the Lender
waiving or modifying any covenants hereunder in any specific instance, the
Borrower covenants and agrees as follows:

     (a)  each Obligor shall at all times keep accurate and complete books,
          records and accounts with respect to all of its business activities,
          in accordance with sound accounting practices and GAAP consistently
          applied, and shall keep such books, records and accounts, and any
          copies thereof, only at the addresses indicated for such purpose on
          Schedule 1.1(2);

     (b)  the Borrower shall advise the Lender in writing of any Material
          Adverse Effect or the occurrence of any Default within one day of its
          becoming aware of such Material Adverse Effect or Default;

     (c)  the Lender or any Persons designated by the Lender, shall have the
          right, on prior notice at any reasonable time (and at any time without
          the need for prior notice when the Lender has reasonable grounds for
          believing that a Default exists), including, without limitation, to
          call at any of the Obligor's places of business or at any warehouse,
          storage facility or other location where property of any Obligor may
          be located at any reasonable times, and, without hindrance or delay,
          to inspect the Collateral and to inspect, audit, check and make
          extracts from the Obligors' books, records, journals, orders, receipts
          and any correspondence and other data relating to the Obligors'
          business, the Collateral or any transactions between the parties
          hereto, and shall have the right to make such verification concerning
          the Obligors' business as the Lender may consider reasonable under the
          circumstances. The Borrower shall furnish to the Lender such
          information relevant to the Lender's rights under this Agreement
          (including without limitation information on sales, receivables,
          collections, accounts payable and inventory aging) as the Lender shall
          at any time and from time to time, in its sole discretion, request.
          The Lender is authorized to discuss the affairs, finances and business
          of the Obligors with any officers or directors of the Obligors or any
          Affiliate of the Obligors, or with those employees of the Obligor with
          whom the Lender has determined in its commercially reasonable judgment
          to be necessary or desirable to converse, and to discuss the financial
          condition of the Obligor with the independent chartered accountants of
          each Obligor. Any such discussions shall be without liability to the
          Lender or to such accountants. The Borrower shall pay to or reimburse
          the Lender for all reasonable fees, costs, and out-of-pocket expenses
          incurred by the Lender in the exercise of their rights hereunder and
          all of such costs, fees and expenses shall be payable on demand and,
          until paid, shall bear interest at the Deemed Interest Rate.

     (d)  Each Obligor shall keep the Collateral properly housed and insured
          against such risks (including, without limitation, business
          interruption) and in such amounts as

                                     -28-

<Page>

          are customarily insured against by Persons engaged in businesses
          similar to that of the Borrower with such companies, in such amounts
          and under policies in such form as shall be reasonably satisfactory to
          the Lender. Originals or certified copies of such policies of
          insurance have been delivered to the Lender together with evidence of
          payment of all premiums therefor, and contain, INTER ALIA, an
          endorsement, in form and substance acceptable to the Lender, showing
          loss under such insurance policies payable to the Lender as its
          interest may appear. Such endorsement, the other terms of the said
          policies, or an independent instrument furnished to the Lender, shall
          provide that the insurance company shall give the Lender at least
          thirty (30) days' prior written notice before any such policy of
          insurance is altered or cancelled and includes a standard mortgage
          clause providing, INTER ALIA, that no act, whether wilful or
          negligent, or default of the Borrower or any other Person shall affect
          the right of the Lender to recover under such policy of insurance in
          case of loss or damage. All insurers are directed and shall be
          directed under such policies of insurance to pay all proceeds payable
          thereunder directly to the Lender to apply to the Liabilities as the
          Lender elects in its sole discretion. So long as no Event of Default
          has occurred, the Lender shall pay any such proceeds received to the
          Borrower on the Borrower's request only if such proceeds are used by
          the Borrower to repair or replace lost or damaged property of an
          Obligor as approved by the Lender. The Lender (and all officers,
          employees or agents designated by the Lender) is irrevocably made,
          constituted and appointed as the Borrower's true and lawful attorney
          (and agent) for the purpose of making, settling and adjusting claims
          under such policies of insurance, endorsing the names of any Obligor
          on any cheque, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the
          proceeds of such policies of insurance and making all determinations
          and decisions with respect to such policies of insurance; provided
          however that the Lender shall exercise such rights only upon and
          following and during the occurrence of an Event of Default;

     (e)  each Obligor shall maintain, at its expense, such public liability and
          third party property damage insurance as is customary for Persons
          engaged in businesses similar to that of such Obligor with such
          companies and in such amounts, with such deductibles and under
          policies in such form as shall be satisfactory to the Lender and
          originals or certified copies of such policies have been delivered to
          the Lender together with evidence of payment of all premiums therefor;
          each such policy shall contain an endorsement showing the Lender as
          additional insured thereunder and providing that the insurance company
          shall give the Lender at least thirty (30) days' written notice before
          any such policy shall be altered or cancelled;

     (f)  if any Obligor at any time or times hereafter fails to obtain or
          maintain any of the policies of insurance required above or to pay any
          premium in whole or in part relating thereto, then the Lender, without
          waiving or releasing any obligation or default by the Borrower
          hereunder, may (but shall be under no obligation to) obtain and
          maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premiums and take
          such other actions with respect thereto as the Lender, in its sole
          discretion, deems advisable. All sums disbursed by the Lender in
          connection with any such actions,

                                     -29-

<Page>

          including, without limitation, court costs, expenses, other charges
          relating thereto and reasonable legal fees and disbursements (on a
          solicitor-client basis), shall constitute Liabilities hereunder and,
          until paid, shall bear interest at the Deemed Interest Rate;

     (g)  no Obligor shall use the Collateral, or any part thereof, in any
          unlawful business or for any unlawful purpose or use or maintain any
          of the Collateral in any manner that does or could result in material
          damage to the environment or a violation of any applicable
          Environmental Laws; the Obligors shall keep the Collateral in good
          condition, repair and order, ordinary wear and tear excepted; no
          Obligor shall permit the Collateral, or any part thereof, to be levied
          upon under execution, attachment, distraint or other legal process; no
          Obligor shall sell, lease, grant a security interest in or otherwise
          dispose of any of the Collateral except as expressly permitted by this
          Agreement; no Obligor shall secrete or abandon any of the Collateral,
          or remove or permit removal of any of the Collateral from any of the

          Obligors' Inventory sold in the ordinary course of the Obligors'
          business as permitted herein, the removal of motor vehicles in the
          ordinary course of business, and the removal of the Obligors'
          Equipment if the purpose of such removal or sales permitted hereunder
          is the repair or replacement of any such Equipment which requires
          repair;

     (h)  the Loan will be used by the Borrower only in the financing of
          additional Borrower locations and in the refurbishing of existing
          locations and to pay the costs, fees, disbursements and expenses (and
          taxes on them) in connection with this Agreement and the Other
          Agreements;

     (i)  each Obligor shall, at the request of the Lender, acting reasonably,
          indicate on its records concerning the Collateral a notation, in form
          satisfactory to the Lender, of the Security Interest granted to the
          Lender by the Security Agreements, and no Obligor shall maintain
          duplicates or copies of such records at any address other than the
          Borrower's principal places of business set forth on Schedule 1.1(2);
          provided, however, that the Obligors, in the ordinary course of their
          businesses, may furnish copies of such records to accountants, legal
          counsel and other agents or advisors as they may reasonably determine
          to be necessary or desirable;

     (j)  each Obligor shall file all required tax returns and pay all of its
          taxes when due, including, without limitation, taxes imposed by
          federal, provincial, state or municipal agencies; provided that an
          Obligor shall have the right to contest the payment of such taxes in
          good faith by appropriate proceedings so long as:

          (i)  the amount so contested is shown on such Obligor's (and the
               Borrower's consolidated) financial statements;

          (ii) the contesting of any such payment does not give rise to a Lien
               for taxes or, if such contesting does give rise to a Lien for
               taxes, a reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall
               be required by GAAP shall have

                                     -30-

               been made therefor on such Obligor's (and the Borrower's
               consolidated) financial statements and a stay of enforcement of
               such Lien is in effect; and

         (iii) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Borrower keeps
               on deposit with the Lender (such deposit to be held without
               interest) an amount of money which, in the sole judgment of the
               Lender, is sufficient to pay such taxes and any interest or
               penalties that may accrue thereon.

               If such Obligor fails to prosecute such contest with reasonable
               diligence, the Lender may apply the money so deposited in payment
               of such taxes. If such Obligor fails to pay any such taxes, in
               the absence of any such contest by such Obligor, the Lender, in
               its sole discretion, may (but shall be under no obligation to)
               advance and pay any sums required to pay any such taxes and/or to
               secure the release of any Lien therefor, and any sums so advanced
               by the Lender shall constitute Liabilities hereunder, shall be
               payable by the Borrower to the Lender on demand, and, until paid,
               shall bear interest at the Deemed Interest Rate;

     (k)  no Obligor shall without the prior written consent of the Lender:

          (i)  incur, create, assume or suffer to exist any Funded Debt, Current
               Debt or other indebtedness other than:

               A.   indebtedness arising under this Agreement;

               B.   unsecured indebtedness owing in the ordinary course of
                    business to trade suppliers;

               C.   any other indebtedness described in Schedule 8.1(o) hereof,
                    subject to all other applicable limitations set out in this
                    Agreement;

               D.   any indebtedness permitted under subsection (v) of the
                    definition of "Permitted Liens", subject to all other
                    applicable limitations set out in this Agreement and without
                    duplicating Section 10.1(k)(i)(C);

               E.   capital lease obligations in an aggregate amount not to

                    which does not exceed ten thousand Canadian dollars (Cdn.
                    $10,000).

          (ii) except where the Lender have given its prior written approval,
               assume, guarantee or endorse, or otherwise become liable in
               connection with, the obligations of any Person, except by
               endorsement of instruments for deposit or collection or similar
               transactions in the ordinary course of business;

          such loan or investment shall be made if a Default has occurred or is
          continuing or would result therefrom;

     (o)  no Obligor shall amend its organizational documents or change its

          Other Agreements shall have been made in all jurisdictions as the

          until all Liabilities have been paid and performed in full, as the
          Lender shall reasonably consider necessary or appropriate in its
          discretion.

     (i)  No order, judgment or decree of any court, arbitrator or governmental
          authority shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain the Lender
          from providing the Loan, and no law, rule, regulation, request or

          reasonably.

          with respect to the Obligors, in regard to past and ongoing compliance
          with laws (including Environmental Laws), union and labour relations

          discretion that the Borrower is adequately capitalized, the fair,
          saleable value of its Property exceeds its liabilities at the Closing
          Date, and that the Borrower has sufficient working capital to pay its
          debts as they become due, and the Lender shall have received such
          documentation it considers necessary or appropriate in its discretion
          in regard to the foregoing matters, including, without limitation,
          compliance with Environmental Laws.

          analogous statutory or non-statutory proceedings involving any Obligor
          and, if brought against such Obligor, such proceeding is not being

          the Lender, or, if so contested, remains outstanding, undismissed and
          unstayed more than fifteen (15) days from the institution of such
          first mentioned proceedings;

     (f)  the appointment of a receiver, receiver and manager, trustee,
          liquidator, administrator, sequestrator, custodian, monitor or similar
          official for any Obligor, for any of the Collateral or for any
          substantial part of any Obligor's Property, or the institution of any

          against such Obligor, such proceeding is not being contested in good
          faith by appropriate proceedings, as determined by the Lender, acting
          reasonably, or, if so contested, remains outstanding, undismissed and

          unenforceable, or an Obligor denies, to any extent, its
          obligations under the Security Agreement;

     (j)  any loss, theft, damage or destruction of any item or items of
          Collateral occurs which:

          (i)  materially and adversely affects the operation of the Borrower's
               business; or

          (ii) is material in amount and is not adequately covered by insurance;

               thereto without having been waived, under any agreement or
               instrument other than this Agreement evidencing indebtedness for
               borrowed money permitted hereunder in excess of ten thousand
               dollars ($10,000) (or the Equivalent thereof in U.S. dollars)
               executed or delivered by the Borrower, or pursuant to which
               agreement or instrument the Borrower or its properties is or may
               be bound, or if any such indebtedness shall be declared due and
               payable prior to the stated maturity thereof or if the Borrower
               otherwise defaults in the performance of any material term or
               condition contained in any document relating to a Permitted Lien;

          (l)  any condition exists in connection with any Plan which might

               such Plan or to be deregistered under any applicable law or
               regulations unless the existence of such conditions would not
               have a Material Adverse Effect; or the Borrower shall fail to

                             ARTICLE 13 - REMEDIES

13.1 REMEDIES.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 12.1(e), all of
the Liabilities shall immediately and automatically become due and payable,
without demand, notice or legal process of any kind. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default (other than as described in Section 12.1(e)), all of the
Liabilities may, at the option of the Lender, be declared by the Lender to be
immediately due and payable, upon which declaration all such Liabilities shall
immediately become due and payable without demand, notice or legal process of
any kind. Upon any such occurrence, the Lender may, in addition to any other
right or remedy which they may have at law or in equity, proceed to realize its
security hereunder and to enforce its rights by:

     (a)  entry onto any premise where the Collateral may be located;

     (b)  the appointment by instrument in writing of a receiver or receivers of
          the Collateral or any part thereof (which receiver or receivers may be
          any person or persons, whether an officer or officers or employee or
          employees of either Lender or not and the Lender may remove any
          receiver or receivers so appointed and appoint another or others in
          his or their stead);

     (c)  proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
          of a receiver or receivers or for sale of the Collateral or any part
          thereof; or

     (d)  any other action, suit, remedy or proceeding authorized or permitted
          hereby or by law or by equity.

In addition, the Lender may file such proofs of claim and other documents as may
be necessary or advisable in order to have its claim lodged in any bankruptcy,
winding-up or other judicial proceedings.

Any receiver or receivers so appointed shall have power to:

          (i)  take possession of and to use the Collateral or any part thereof;

          (ii) carry on the business of the Borrower (including, but not limited
               to, the taking or defending of any actions or legal proceedings,
               and the doing or refraining from doing all other things as to the
               receiver may deem necessary or desirable in connection with the
               business, operations and affairs of the Borrower);

         (iii) borrow money required for the maintenance, preservation or
               protection of the Collateral or any part thereof or the carrying
               on of the business of the Borrower;

          (iv) further charge the Collateral in priority to the security
               interests of the Security Agreements as security for money so
               borrowed; and

                                     -42-

<Page>

          (v)  sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of the
               Collateral on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the
               receiver shall determine.

The Lender shall not be responsible for any actions or errors of omission by the
receiver or receivers in exercising any such powers.

In addition, the Lender may enter upon, use, occupy and possess the Collateral
or any part thereof, free from all encumbrances, Liens and charges, except for
Permitted Liens, without hindrance, interruption or denial of the same by the
Borrower or by any other person or persons, and may lease or sell the whole or
any part or parts of the Collateral. Any sale hereunder may be made by public
auction, by public tender or by private contract, with or without notice and
with or without advertising and without any other formality (except as required
by law), all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower. Such sale shall be on
such terms and conditions as to credit or otherwise and as to upset or reserve
bid or price as to the Lender, in its sole discretion, may seem advantageous.
Such sale may take place whether or not the Lender has taken possession of the
Collateral.

No remedy for the realization of the security interests granted to the Lender or
for the enforcement of the rights of the Lender shall be exclusive of or
dependent on any other such remedy, but any one or more of such remedies may
from time to time be exercised independently or in combination. Any failure by
the Lender to exercise any right or remedy set out in this Agreement or the
Other Agreements shall not constitute a waiver thereof. The term "receiver" as
used in this Agreement includes a receiver and manager.

At the Lender's request, the Borrower shall, at the Borrower's expense, assemble
the Collateral and make it available to the Lender at one or more places to be
designated by the Lender and reasonably convenient to the Lender. The Borrower
recognizes that if it fails to perform, observe or discharge any of their
obligations under this Agreement or the Other Agreements, no remedy at law will
provide adequate relief to the Lender, and the Borrower agrees that the Lender
shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case
without the necessity of proving actual damages. Without limiting any of the
Lender's rights to provide any lesser period of notice to the extent permitted
by applicable law, any notification of intended disposition of any of the
Collateral required by law will be deemed reasonably and properly given if given
at least fifteen (15) calendar days before such disposition. Any proceeds of any
disposition by the Lender of any of the Collateral may be applied by the Lender
to the payment of expenses and any borrowings in connection with the Collateral
and its realization including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
disbursements (on a solicitor-client basis) (both in-house and outside counsel)
and any balance of such proceeds may be applied by the Lender toward the payment
of such of the Liabilities, and in such order of application, as the Lender may
from time to time elect or re-elect in its sole discretion.

                                     -43-

                       ARTICLE 14 - INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

14.1 GENERAL INDEMNITY.

The Borrower agrees to defend (with counsel satisfactory to the Lender),
protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Lender, and each of its Affiliates, and
Subsidiaries, and its respective officers, directors, employees, legal counsel
and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature (including,
without limitation, the disbursements and the fees (on a solicitor-client basis)
of legal counsel for each Indemnified Party in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not the
Indemnified Party shall be designated a party thereto), (collectively, "Losses")
which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Party
(whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal,
provincial, state or local laws or regulations, including, without limitation,
securities, environmental and commercial laws and regulations, under common law
or in equity, or based on contract or otherwise) in any manner relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Other Agreement, or any act, event or
transaction related or attendant thereto, the making and/or the management of
the Loan or the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan; provided,
however that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party to the extent that such Losses were caused by or resulted from the wilful
misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Party. To the extent that the
undertaking to indemnify set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable against the Borrower because it violates any law or public policy,
the Borrower shall satisfy such undertaking to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law. Any Losses covered by this indemnity shall be paid to each
Indemnified Party on demand, and, failing prompt payment, shall, together with
interest thereon at the Deemed Interest Rate from the date incurred by each
Indemnified Party until paid in full, be added to the Liabilities and be secured
by the Collateral. The provisions of this Section shall survive the satisfaction
and payment of all Liabilities and the termination of this Agreement.

14.2 TAXES.

All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement and the Other Agreements
shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on
account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies,
assessments, imposts, deductions, charges, or withholdings imposed by any
foreign, federal, provincial, state, local or other jurisdiction or any
governmental agency thereof or political subdivision or taxing authority
therein, excluding taxes imposed on the net income or the capital of the Lender
(all such non-excluded taxes being hereinafter called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts so payable to the Lender hereunder or
under any Other Agreements the amounts so payable shall be increased to the
extent necessary to yield to the recipient (after payment of all Taxes) interest
or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts
specified in this Agreement or Other Agreement. If the Borrower is required by
law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any Taxes or other amount
from any sum paid or expressed to be payable to either Lender under this
Agreement or any Other Agreement, then: (A) the Borrower shall notify such
Lender of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as
the Borrower becomes aware of it; (B) the Borrower shall pay any such Taxes or
other amount

                                     -44-

<Page>

before the date on which penalties attached thereto become due and
payable; (C) the sum payable by the Borrower in respect of which the relevant
deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the extent
necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or
payment, the recipient receives on the due date and retains (free from any
liability in respect of any such deduction, withholding or payment) a sum equal
to that which it would have received and so retained had no such deduction,

     (d)  Failure of the Lender, at any time or times hereafter, to require
          strict performance by the Borrower of any provision of this Agreement

          right of the Lender thereafter to demand strict compliance and
          performance therewith. Any suspension or waiver by the Lender of a
          Default under this Agreement or any default under any of the Other
          Agreements shall not suspend, waive or affect any other Default under

          whether the same is prior or subsequent thereto and whether of the
          same or of a different kind or character. No delay on the part of the
          Lender in the exercise of any right or remedy under this Agreement or
          any Other Agreement shall preclude any other or further exercise

          the Borrower contained in this Agreement or any of the Other
          Agreements and no Default under this Agreement or default under any of
          the Other Agreements shall be deemed to have been suspended or waived
          by the Lender unless such suspension or waiver is in writing, signed
          by duly authorized officer(s) of the applicable Lender and directed to
          the Borrower specifying such suspension or waiver.

     (e)  Borrower hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Lender shall be
          permitted to share with each other and with any of their affiliates,
          any information concerning Borrower, the other Obligors, this
          Agreement and all related agreements, and the subject matter thereof,
          that the Lender have or will have in their possession.

15.8 TIMING OF PAYMENTS.

Any payment required to be made by Borrower to a Lender hereunder or under any
of the Other Agreements shall be made in the currency in which the obligation
requiring such payment arose. Any payment received by such Lender after 3:00
p.m. (Vancouver time) on a Business Day, or on any day that is not a Business
Day, shall be credited to the account of the Borrower on the next following
Business Day.

15.9 CURRENCY.

All dollar amounts specified herein are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise
indicated.

15.10 JUDGMENT CURRENCY.

If in the recovery by the Lender of any amount owing hereunder in any currency,
judgment can only be obtained in another currency and because of changes in the
exchange rate of such currencies between the date of judgment and payment in
full of the amount of such judgment, the amount of recovery under the judgment
differs from the full amount owing hereunder, the Borrower shall pay any such
shortfall to the applicable Lender, and such shortfall can be claimed by the
applicable Lender against the Borrower as an alternative or additional cause of
action and any surplus received by the applicable Lender will be repaid to the
Borrower.

15.11 SEVERABILITY.

                                     -47-

<Page>

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or remaining provisions of this Agreement.

15.12 CONFLICTS.

In the event there occurs any conflict or inconsistency between any provision
hereof and any provision of the Other Agreements, the provision hereof shall, to
the extent of any such conflict or inconsistency, govern.

15.13 RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the
Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived) to the fullest extent
permitted by law to set-off any and all deposits of any kind at any time held to
the credit or for the account of the Borrower, against any of the obligations of
the Borrower hereunder or under any Other Agreement, whether or not the Lender
have made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may
be unmatured.

15.14 JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE OBLIGORS

Since part of the credit advanced by Lender to the Borrower will be advanced by
the Borrower to some or all of the Co-Borrowers to acquire certain assets which
are integral to the consolidated business of the Obligors, the Co-Borrowers have
agreed to be made a party to this Agreement. Accordingly, each of the
Co-Borrowers agrees to be jointly and severally liable for the obligations,
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the Obligors set forth
in this Agreement, as principal debtor and obligor and not as surety.
Furthermore, each of the Co-Borrowers agrees that it shall observe, fulfil and
keep and cause the other Obligors to observe, fulfil and keep, as the case may
be, all obligations, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement.

Each of the Obligors shall for all purposes of this Agreement be regarded and be
in the same position as a principle debtor and obligor and each Obligor-
Borrower expressly waives demand, presentment, protest and notice thereof
respectively and of default and agrees that its liability under this Agreement
shall not in any way be limited or affected by any transaction which may take
place between the Lender and any other Obligor or any neglect or default of the
Lender which might otherwise operate as a discharge, whether partial or
absolute, of any Obligor if it were a surety of the other Obligors. Each Obligor
further agrees that the Lender shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse
against the Borrower or any of the other Co-Borrowers or other parties or any
security which it holds for the payment of the moneys owing under this Agreement
before acquiring payment from such Obligor, and the Lender may enforce the
various remedies available to it and may realize the power of various securities
held by it or any part thereof in such order as the Lender may determine.

                                     -48-

<Page>

No obligation, liability or undertaking whatsoever of, and no security
whatsoever given by, any Obligor under this Agreement or under any agreement,
document or instrument collateral to this Agreement shall be limited or affected
by the granting of time, renewals, extensions, releases or discharges by the
Lender to any Obligor or to any other person whomsoever, or by the acceptance of
compositions by the Lender from any Obligor, or by any dealings whatsoever
between the Lender and any of the Obligors Partnership or any other person
whomsoever, or for any cause or reason for which sureties or joint and several
debtors may be relieved or for which any such obligation, liability, undertaking
or security may be limited or affected. Without restricting the generality of
the foregoing, no such obligation, liability, undertaking or security shall be
limited or affected by the Lender taking, or by the Lender's abstention from
taking or perfecting, or by the Lender giving up any rights, privileges,
mortgages or securities whatsoever.

15.15 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

This Agreement and the Other Agreements embody the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto and thereto and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings between such parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior or
contemporaneous agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral
agreements between the parties related to the subject matter of this Agreement
and the Other Agreements.

15.16 NON-MERGER.

The taking of any judgment shall not operate as a merger of any Liabilities or
any part thereof or in any way suspend payment or affect or prejudice the
rights, remedies and powers, legal or equitable, which the Lender may have in
connection with the Liabilities.

15.17 ENGLISH LANGUAGE.

At the request of the parties, this Agreement and the Other Agreements have been

         make the investment in the Securities shall be absolute and
         unconditional.

1.2      The Securities shall be, when issued, validly issued and
         non-assessable, and subject only to the restrictions set forth

2.2      The obligations herein stated shall otherwise be joint and several.
         Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the absence of any other provision

not affect the construction or interpretation of this Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 2
                                    CONSENTS

2.1      CLIC CONSENT

CLIC hereby consents to the creation and issue by the Borrower Parties to GEIPPP
II of the GEIPPP II Security, and to the incurring by the Borrower Parties of
the GEIPPP II Debt.

2.2      GEIPPP II CONSENT

GEIPPP II hereby consents to the creation and issue by the Borrower Parties to
CLIC of the Senior Security and to the incurring by the Borrower Parties of the
Senior Debt.

                                   ARTICLE 3
                          SUBORDINATION AND PRIORITIES

3.1      SUBORDINATION AND POSTPONEMENT OF SECURITY

Notwithstanding the dates of execution and delivery by the Borrower Parties of
the Senior Security or the GEIPPP II Security, the dates of filing or perfecting
thereof, the giving of notice in respect thereof, the nature of the security
interests granted by the Borrower Parties, the time of crystallization thereof
or the dates of any advances thereunder, it is understood and agreed by and
between the parties that the priority of the Security shall be determined on the
following basis:



                                      -3-
<Page>

The Senior Security shall have priority over the GEIPPP II Security as to all of
the real and personal property of the Borrower Parties with respect to the
Senior Debt. For greater certainty, the priority granted hereunder to the Senior
Debt shall be reduced dollar for dollar as payments are made by any of the
Borrower Parties and applied by CLIC toward the repayment of principal under the
Senior Debt, and shall not thereafter be increased by any additional or
replacement advances of any debt to any of the Borrower Parties by CLIC. For
greater certainty, the foregoing reference to additional or replacement advances
does not constitute consent by GEIPPP II to such advances, which shall be
subject to Section 6.1 of this Agreement.

3.2      SUBORDINATION OF DEBT

The parties hereto agree that in the event of any distribution, division or
application, partial or complete, voluntary or involuntary, by operation of law
or otherwise, of all or any part of the assets and property of any of the
Borrower Parties by reason of the liquidation, dissolution or other winding up
of any of the Borrower Parties' businesses or any sale, receivership, insolvency
or bankruptcy proceedings, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or any
proceedings by or against any of the Borrower Parties for any relief under
bankruptcy or insolvency law or laws relating to the relief of debtors,
readjustment of indebtedness, reorganizations, arrangements, compositions or
extensions, then and in every such event all proceeds of distributions of any
kind or character, either in cash, securities or other property which shall be
payable or deliverable upon or relating to the realization of such property and
assets of the Borrower Parties shall be payable in accordance with the
priorities set forth in Article 3 hereof. GEIPPP II hereby subordinates its
rights, whether at law, in equity, under its Security or otherwise, to each and
all such distributions to the rights of CLIC under the Senior Security to the
extent necessary to give effect to the priorities set forth in this Article 3.
All payments or distributions provided for in this Section 3.2 received by
GEIPPP II that are not consistent with the priorities set forth in this Article
3 shall be held in trust by it for the benefit of and shall be forthwith paid to
CLIC in accordance with the priorities in this Article 3.

3.3      POSTPONEMENT OF DEBT

Without the consent of CLIC, none of the Borrower Parties shall make and GEIPPP
II shall not be permitted to receive any interest payment on account of the
GEIPPP II Debt prior to December 17, 2006, except as required by terms of the
Note Agreement and the New Senior Note as such documents exist on the date of
this Agreement (which terms for greater certainty require the approval of the
Elephant & Castle Group, Inc. board of directors). Thereafter, none of the
Borrower Parties shall be permitted to make and GEIPPP II shall not be permitted
to receive any payment under the GEIPPP II Debt unless at the time such payment
is made and immediately after the making of such payment (i) there shall not
have occurred and be continuing any default or breach under the terms of any of
the Senior Debt or the Senior Security and (ii) the making of such payment by a
Borrower Party would not cause a default or breach by any Borrower Parties of
its obligations under the Senior Security or the Senior Debt. If at any time
CLIC, acting reasonably, determines that (i) there has been a breach or default
under the terms of the Senior Debt or the Senior Security, or (ii) the making of
any payment by a Borrower Party on account of the GEIPPP II Debt would result in
such a breach or default by any Borrower Party of its obligations under the
Senior Debt or the Senior Security, then CLIC shall be entitled to notify the
Borrower Parties and GEIPPP II that no further repayments of any GEIPPP II Debt
shall be



                                      -4-
<Page>

made by the Borrower Parties after GEIPPP II's receipt of such notification. For
greater certainty, nothing in this section 3.3 is intended to limit GEIPPP II's
rights to take enforcement action against the Borrower subject to and in
accordance with Article 4.

Should GEIPPP II receive sums of money in payment of the GEIPPP II Debt at any
time or times after which CLIC has provided notice to GEIPPP II pursuant to the
immediately preceding paragraph that no further repayments of GEIPPP II Debt
shall be made, GEIPPP II shall hold such sums as a depositary and trustee for
CLIC, and shall deliver the same to CLIC without delay.

CLIC agrees that it shall consent to the Borrower Parties re-commencing payments
on account of the GEIPPP II Debt if CLIC, acting reasonably, determines that (i)
any breach or default under the terms of the Senior Debt and the Senior Security
has been fully rectified to CLIC's satisfaction such that there is no continuing
breach or default; and (ii) any such payment shall not result in any default or
breach under the terms of the Senior Debt or the Senior Security.

3.4      REALIZATION

CLIC agrees to act in a prudent and commercially reasonable manner on any
realization of the Senior Security with a view to maximizing the proceeds of the
realization in as expeditious a manner as is reasonably possible.

3.5      INSURANCE PROCEEDS

Subject to the rights of the Borrower Parties in respect of insurance proceeds
under the Loan Agreement, any insurance proceeds received by the Borrower
Parties or by any of the Lenders in respect of assets of the Borrower Parties
charged by the Security shall be dealt with according to the preceding
provisions hereof as though such insurance proceeds were paid or payable as
proceeds of realization of the collateral for which they compensate and all
insurance proceeds received by the Borrower Parties shall be held in trust by it
for the benefit of the Lenders in accordance with the provisions hereof.

                                    ARTICLE 4

                                     DEFAULT

4.1      STANDSTILL

GEIPPP II hereby acknowledges, confirms and agrees that its rights as to demand,
acceleration and realization of the GEIPPP II Debt and the GEIPPP II Security
are, until such time as the Senior Debt has been satisfied and paid in full,
subject to the following specific agreement:

         (a)      GEIPPP II shall not, for a period of 90 days (the "standstill
                  period") from the earlier of the date of receipt by any
                  Borrower Party of a notice of default issued by GEIPPP II, or
                  the date of receipt by GEIPPP II of a notice from CLIC that a
                  default has occurred in respect of the Senior Debt or the
                  Senior Security, take any steps or actions to enforce payment
                  of the GEIPPP II Debt or to commence realization upon the
                  GEIPPP II Security including, without limitation, issuance of
                  demand, acceleration of



                                      -5-
<Page>

                  indebtedness and obligation, issuance of all statutorily
                  required notices, exercising rights of set-off, commencement
                  of bankruptcy proceedings, foreclosure, power of sale, taking
                  of possession, giving in payment, appointing or making
                  application to a court for an order appointing an agent or a
                  receiver or receiver-manager or by any other means of
                  enforcement thereof; provided that: (i) notwithstanding the
                  foregoing, the standstill period shall be deemed to expire and
                  be terminated upon (A) the taking of any step, action or
                  proceeding by CLIC (including any Receiver appointed by it)
                  for the purpose of realizing on the Security which step,
                  action or proceeding occurs after the issuance of the
                  preparatory notices in connection with the Senior Security by
                  any one of the foregoing, or (B) after an order has been
                  rendered declaring any Borrower Party a bankrupt; and (ii)
                  GEIPPP II may issue one or more preparatory notices in
                  connection with the GEIPPP II Security at any time after any
                  preparatory notices have been issued in connection with the
                  Senior Security by CLIC or a Receiver appointed by it;

         (b)      at the expiry of the standstill period and provided that the
                  event of default or, if more than one, all of the events of
                  default, set out in the notice of default has or have not been
                  cured, waived or otherwise revoked on or before the expiry of
                  such standstill period, GEIPPP II shall be free to take such
                  steps to enforce payment of the GEIPPP II Debt as it shall
                  determine; and

         (c)      for greater certainty, if at any time, or from time to time,
                  (i) the event of default or, if more than one, all of the
                  events of default, set out in a notice of default is or are
                  cured or waived or the notice of default is otherwise revoked
                  and (ii) the Borrower Parties have paid GEIPPP II all arrears
                  of principal and interest in respect of any scheduled payment
                  that was not paid when due as a result of the blockage of such
                  payment as provided for herein (which payment may be made and
                  accepted, provided that the conditions set forth in the
                  preceding clause (i) are satisfied), then the standstill
                  period applicable to such notice of default will cease to be
                  applicable and a new standstill period will commence upon the
                  issuance of any new notice of default, provided that the
                  aggregate number of days in any 365-day period during which a
                  standstill period is in force shall not exceed 130 days (the
                  "Annual Standstill Period Limit").

4.2      CROSS NOTICES AND CONTROL OF RECEIVERSHIP

Each Lender shall as soon as is reasonably possible notify in writing the other
Lender of any default under its respective Security. In the event any Lender
appoints a Receiver by private instrument or is successful in obtaining a court
order for the appointment of a Receiver of all or by any portion of the assets
of any of the Borrower Parties, the other Lender shall have the right to
privately appoint its own Receiver or make separate application to the court for
the appointment of its own separate Receiver in respect of any or all of the
Borrower Parties subject to such court order, provided that any Receiver
appointed by CLIC or appointed by a court upon application of CLIC shall have
complete management, control and possession of the property, assets and
undertaking of any or all of the Borrower Parties in priority to the rights of
any receiver appointed by GEIPPP II or appointed by the court upon application
of GEIPPP II until such time as CLIC has lawfully received all amounts owing on
account of the Senior Debt. Each



                                      -6-
<Page>

Lender agrees to consent to all orders of the court as may be applied for by the
other Lender in order to carry out the terms of this provision.

4.3      INDEPENDENT RIGHT TO ACT

Except as otherwise provided herein, a Lender's right to demand or accelerate
payment of any indebtedness owing by the Borrower Parties or to take such steps
as such Lender may deem appropriate from time to time to realize on its Security
shall not be limited hereby.

4.4      CO-OPERATION IN RECEIVERSHIP APPOINTMENT

Subject to Section 4.1 hereof, each Lender shall promptly and in good faith
co-operate with the other Lender in order to implement and appoint any Receiver
which the other Lender elects to have appointed or elects to apply to a court
for appointment and, to that end, each Lender shall promptly do such acts and
things and execute and deliver such instruments as may be reasonably required in
that regard.

                                   ARTICLE 5

Agreement, and agrees not to take, or to participate with CLIC or GEIPP II in
taking, any action that would constitute a breach by CLIC or GEIPPP II, as the
case may be, of its obligations hereunder. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, no Borrower Party shall enter into any amendment or modification
to the Senior Debt or Senior Security, or incur any additional obligations to
CLIC, except as permitted under Section 6.1.

5.2      AGREEMENT TO BE BOUND

Each of the Borrower Parties hereby confirms to and agrees with the Lenders that
so long as any of the indebtedness of the Borrower Parties herein referred to
remains outstanding to any of the Lenders, it shall stand possessed of its
assets so charged for the Lenders, in accordance with their respective rights as
herein set out and all funds, monies, or proceeds received by any Borrower Party
from the sale or other disposition of its property shall be held in trust by the
Borrower Parties for the benefit of the Lenders in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement.

5.3      DEFAULT

Each of the Borrower Parties agrees that any default by the Borrower Parties in
complying with, fulfilling, observing and performing the terms and provisions of
this Agreement shall be and shall be deemed to be an Event of Default by the
Borrower Parties under the terms and provisions of the Senior Security and the
GEIPPP II Security and shall entitle CLIC and GEIPPP II or any of them to
immediately proceed to enforce the terms and provisions of the Senior Security
or the GEIPPP II Security, as the case may be, in accordance with and subject to
the terms thereof.

                                   ARTICLE 6
                                    GENERAL

6.1      CLIC DEBT

CLIC shall not make any Material Modification to the Senior Debt or Senior
Security without the prior written consent of GEIPPP II, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed. For the purposes of this section 6.1,
"Material Modification" means any amendment or modification to the Senior Debt
or the Senior Security which would:

         (a)      increase the interest rate or principal amount of the Senior
                  Debt except for increases in principal to cover workout costs
                  and enforcement costs (including closing costs in connection
                  therewith) and any advances to protect or preserve the
                  collateral ("Protective Advances");

         (b)      increase in any other material respect any monetary
                  obligations of any of the Borrower Parties under the Loan
                  Agreement or the Senior Security;

         (c)      shorten the scheduled maturity date of the Senior Debt (other
                  than by acceleration of the Senior Debt);

         (d)      increase the amount of any principal payments required under
                  the Senior Debt or modify any related principal amortization
                  schedule in a manner which would increase the amount of
                  principal payments except if increased in connection with (a)
                  above;

         (e)      convert or exchange the Senior Debt into or for any other
                  indebtedness or subordinate any of the Senior Debt to any
                  indebtedness of the Borrower Parties;

         (f)      extend the period during which voluntary prepayments are
                  prohibited or impose any prepayment fee or premium or yield or
                  spread maintenance charge in connection with a prepayment of
                  the Senior Debt in excess of that which is currently provided
                  under the Loan Agreement or after the current maturity date of
                  the Senior Debt or increase the amount of such prepayment fee,
                  premium or yield or spread maintenance charge;

         (g)      grant CLIC the right to any contingent interest, additional
                  interest or any so-called "kicker" measured on the basis of
                  the cash flow or appreciation of any property subject to the
                  Senior Security (or other similare equity participation);

         (h)      shorten any cure periods under the Senior Debt or Senior
                  Security;

         (i)      make any additional occurrences or circumstances a breach,
                  default or "Event of Default" under the Senior Debt or the
                  Senior Security.

No sums funded by CLIC under the Loan Agreement as a result of the making of any
Protective Advances, or interest accruals or accretions provided for in the Loan
Agreement as of the date hereof and any compounding thereof (including default
interest), shall be deemed to contravene this section 6.1.



                                      -8-
<Page>

CLIC shall not make any additional loans or advances to or for the account of
the Borrower Parties, or commit to do so, without the prior written consent of
GEIPPP II which consent may be withheld by GEIPPP II in its sole discretion.

6.2      NON-DISPOSAL OF SECURITY OR DEBT

No Lender shall sell, transfer, assign or otherwise dispose of its Security or
any Debt secured thereby without first causing the assignee to execute a
counterpart of this Agreement whereby such assignee shall agree to be bound by
the terms hereof to the same extent as if it had been an original party hereto.

6.3      NOT TO ATTACK SECURITY

No Lender shall do any act or thing to contest or bring into question the
validity, priority, perfection or enforceability of all or any part of the
Security.

6.4      TAKING OF ADDITIONAL SECURITY

Subject always to the provisions herein (including, without limitation, Section
6.1), any Lender may, from time to time, at its sole discretion, and without
notice to or consent of the other Lender, but without affecting the priorities,
postponements or subordinations hereunder, take all or any of the following
actions:

         (a)      amend, modify or supplement its Security;

         (b)      retain or obtain any additional security in any property to
                  secure any of its Debt;

         (c)      retain or obtain the primary or secondary obligation of any
                  other person with respect to any of its Debt;

         (d)      extend, renew for one or more periods (whether or not longer
                  than the original period) alter or exchange any of its Debt,
                  or release or compromise any obligation of any nature of any
                  obligor with respect to any of its Debt; or

         (e)      fail to obtain or perfect or release, any of its security
                  interest or rights of set-off in respect of, or surrender,
                  release or permit any substitution or exchange for, all or any
                  party of any property subject to any of its Security or
                  otherwise securing any of its Debt, or extend or renew for one
                  or more periods (whether or not longer than the original
                  period) or release, compromise, alter or exchange any
                  obligations of any nature of any person with respect to any
                  such property.

For greater certainty, each Lender agrees not to enter into any arrangement with
the Borrower Parties which would have the effect of giving to it preference or
priority over the other Lender's Security that is contrary to the priorities
provided for in this Agreement.



                                      -9-

6.5      ENFORCEMENT

Subject only to Section 3.4 of this Agreement, no Lender shall be bound to take
any action whatsoever whether legal or otherwise, for the purpose of collecting
debts, monies or any part thereof payable under any of its Security and no
Lender shall be liable or responsible for any loss or damage which may accrue by
reason of any action or failure to take any such action in respect of the
collection of any of the Senior Debt or GEIPPP II Debt, as the case may be.

No Lender shall be prejudiced in its rights hereunder by any act or failure to
act of either the Borrower Parties or the other Lender, or any non-compliance of
either the Borrower Parties or the other Lender with any agreement or
obligation, regardless of any knowledge thereof which the first Lender may have
or with which the other Lender may be charged; and no action of the first Lender
permitted hereunder shall in any way affect or impair the rights of the other
Lender or the obligations of the first Lender hereunder.

6.6      INDEPENDENT BUSINESS ANALYSIS

Each Lender has been and will continue to be solely responsible for making its
own independent appraisal of and investigation into the financial condition,
business and affairs of the Borrower Parties, and each Lender confirms to the
other Lender that it has not relied on and it will not hereafter rely on any
other Lender:

         (a)      to check or inquire on its behalf into the adequacy, accuracy
                  or completeness of any information provided by the Borrower
                  Parties in connection with any of the Security (whether or not
                  such information has been or is hereafter circulated to any
                  Lender); or

         (b)      to assess or keep under review on its behalf the financial
                  condition, business or affairs of the Borrower Parties.

6.7      BREACH BY THE BORROWER PARTIES

No Lender shall be prejudiced in its rights hereunder by any act or failure to
act of the Borrower Parties or any non-compliance by the Borrower Parties with
any agreement or obligation, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any
Lender may have.

6.8      WAIVER

No delay on the part of any of the Lenders or of any agent thereof in the
exercise of any right or remedy referred to herein shall operate as a waiver
thereof, and no single or partial exercise by either of the Lenders or any agent
thereof of any such right or remedy shall preclude other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right or remedy, nor shall any
modification, waiver or discharge of any of the provisions hereof be binding
upon any of the Lenders except as expressly set forth in writing duly signed and
delivered on behalf of such Lender, and no waiver or consent shall constitute a
consent or waiver to any further breach or default unless therein specifically
so stated.



                                      -10-

6.9      INVALIDITY

Any provision of this Agreement which is or becomes prohibited or unenforceable
in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate, affect or impair the remaining
provisions or invalidate or render unenforceable the provision concerned in any
other jurisdiction.

6.10     TERM OF AGREEMENT

This Agreement shall terminate when all of the Senior Debt has been repaid in
full, provided that such termination shall not effect the priorities and
agreements established herein with respect to the Security prior to the
effective date of such termination.

6.11     NO MODIFICATION OF THE BORROWER PARTIES' OBLIGATIONS

Each of the Borrower Parties hereby acknowledges and agrees that this Agreement
shall not modify, relieve or release it from any of its obligations or
liabilities to:

                  Debt.

         3.3 NON-ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTIONS

Following repayment by the Company in full of all indebtedness owed to both of
GEIPPP II and Crown Life and until such time as Crown Life shall have been
offered an opportunity to exercise Tag-Along Rights (and the transactions
contemplated in connection with such opportunity have closed), and provided that
GEIPPP II continues to hold a majority of the Common Shares of the Company on a
fully diluted basis, the Company agrees that it will not enter into or amend any
contract, loan or other advance to, guarantee of, investment in, acquisition of
or merger with any business of any Person that is not arm's length to the
Company (within the meaning of the INCOME TAX ACT (Canada), without first having
obtained the prior written consent of GEIPP and Crown Life, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                        ARTICLE 4 : DISPOSITION OF SHARES

         4.1 AGREEMENTS WITH TRANSFEREES

Notwithstanding anything else herein contained, every Transfer of any Shares
held by a Party shall be subject to the condition that the proposed transferee,
if not already bound by this Agreement, shall first enter into a Participation
Agreement with the other Parties hereto, except that a Participation Agreement
shall not be required in respect of any transaction in which GEIPPP II has
offered the other Parties Tag-Along Rights in accordance with Section 4.3
hereof.

         4.2 SALE OF SHARES TO THIRD PARTIES

Subject to the provisions of this Article 4, the Parties shall be entitled to
sell or transfer their Shares or any other securities in the capital of the
Company to third parties at any time.

         4.3 TAG-ALONG RIGHTS

After giving effect to Section 4.5, if applicable, in any transaction, other
than a transaction that is subject to Rule 144 of the U.S. Securities of 1933,
as amended, where GEIPP proposes to sell any of its Shares in the Company (the
"Subject Shares") to a third party (the "Offeree") and subject to Section 4.5,
then:

         (a)      GEIPP shall offer to each other Party holding Shares of such
                  class the right (the "Tag-Along Right") to participate in the
                  sale in proportion to the number of Subject Shares of such
                  class owned by GEIPP relative to the total number of Shares of
                  such class then owned by GEIPP as at the time that the offer
                  to participate was made and on the same terms and conditions
                  applicable to the sale of the Subject Shares, assuming the
                  transaction is completed by GEIPP; provided, however, that
                                                     --------
                  this Section 4.3 shall not apply to any Transfer by GEIPP in
                  connection with which GEIPP elects to exercise its right to
                  compel a sale pursuant to Section 4.4; and

         (b)      GEIPP will give each other Party not less than five business
                  days' written notice ("Notice") of the proposed sale and will
                  specify in the Notice the identity of the Offeree, the number
                  of Shares offered for sale, and the price and other terms of

<Page>

                  sale. Each other Party will have five business days from
                  receipt of a Notice to exercise the right contained in
                  paragraph (a) above by giving written notice to GEIPP
                  specifying the number of Shares in respect of which it
                  proposes to exercise its applicable right (the "Exercise
                  Notice"). Each Party that does not timely deliver an Exercise
                  Notice within 15 days of its receipt of the Notice will be
                  deemed to have waived all rights under this Section 4.3 with
                  respect to the proposed Transfer. Delivery of the Exercise
                  Notice by a Party will constitute an irrevocable commitment by
                  such Party to sell in the proposed Transfer the Shares
                  specified in such Exercise Notice, on the terms set forth in
                  the Notice; PROVIDED, however, that if the principal terms of
                  the proposed Transfer change with the result that the
                  per share price shall be less than the share price set forth
                  in the Notice or the other principal terms shall be materially
                  less favourable to GEIPP or the Party exercising its Tag-Along
                  Right than those set forth in the Notice, each participating
                  Party shall be permitted to withdraw the commitment contained
                  in its Exercise Notice and shall be released from its
                  obligations thereunder; and

         (c)      the failure of any Party (other than GEIPP) to perform its
                  obligations under this Section 4.3 in respect of any Transfer
                  contemplated by a Notice shall result in the termination of
                  such Party's rights under this Section 4.3 in respect of such
                  Transfer.

         4.4 DRAG-ALONG RIGHTS

If:

         (a)      GEIPPP II has received a bona fide offer from a Person, or
                  Persons acting in concert, (a "Purchaser"), in any case at
                  arm's length to GEIPPP II, to purchase all of the Shares owned
                  by it; and

         (b)      the Purchaser offers to purchase the remaining Shares held by
                  the other Parties (the "Specified Securities") at the same
                  price per Shares and on other equivalent terms and conditions
                  as those agreed to by GEIPPP II, all of which terms and
                  conditions are set out in writing and promptly delivered to
                  the other Parties (the "Drag Along Offer");

then the other Parties shall be required to sell their Specified Securities to
the Purchaser in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Drag Along
Offer. If any of the other Parties (the "Delinquent Holders") fail to sell their
Specified Securities to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Drag Along Offer, the Purchaser shall have the right to
deposit the applicable purchase price for those Specified Securities of the
Delinquent Holders in a special account at any financial institution in Canada,
to be paid proportionately with interest, to the respective Delinquent Holders
upon presentation and surrender to such financial institution of the
certificates or documents representing such holders' Specified Securities duly
endorsed for transfer to the Purchaser. Upon such deposit being made, the
Specified Securities in respect of which the deposit was made shall hereby
automatically (without any further action of any kind on the part of the
Delinquent Holders or the Purchaser) be transferred to and purchased by the
Purchaser and shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation to the
Purchaser and the rights of the Delinquent Holders in respect of those Specified
Securities after such deposit shall hereby


<Page>

be limited to receiving, with interest, their respective portion of the total
amount so deposited against presentation and surrender of the certificates or
documents representing their respective Specified Securities duly endorsed for
transfer to the Purchaser.

         4.5 RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER

In any transaction other than an open market transaction where any Party (the
"Seller"), wishes to sell any or all of its respective Shares (the "Offered
Shares") (except where such proposed sale is a result of an unsolicited bid to
purchase all of the Seller's Shares, in which case this Section 4.5 shall not
apply), then:

         (a)      the Seller will first deliver to the other Parties (the "Other
                  Parties"), an offer (the "Offer") to sell the Offered Shares
                  at a price and on the conditions set out in the Offer;

         (b)      any of the Other Parties may, within 15 days of delivery of
                  the Invitation, accept the terms of the Offer and specify an
                  Offer to Purchase which shall specify the price and the terms
                  upon which the Other Party shall purchase the Offered Shares.
                  The Offer to Purchase will state that the offer contained
                  therein is irrevocable;

         (c)      if no Other Party makes an Offer to Purchase within the time
                  period specified in paragraph (b) above, then this paragraph
                  4.5 shall no longer apply and the Seller shall be free to sell
                  any or all of the Offered Shares thereafter, subject to the
                  Tag-Along Rights;

         (d)      if one or more of the Other Parties makes an Offer to Purchase
                  the Offered Shares within the time period specified in
                  paragraph (b) above, then the Seller shall have 90 days to
                  sell the Offered Shares to a third party provided that such
                  sale shall be carried out on the terms that are the same or
                  that are no less favourable from a reasonable vendor's
                  perspective than the terms set forth in each Offer to Purchase
                  received; and

         (e)      if the Seller does not complete a sale pursuant to paragraph
                  (d) above, then the Seller shall sell its shares:

                  (i)      in the case that only Other Party has made an Offer
                           to Purchase, to such Other Party on the terms set
                           forth in the Offer to Purchase; or

                  (ii)     in the case that more than one Other Party has made
                           an Offer to Purchase, to the Other Party whose Offer
                           to Purchase is superior from a reasonable vendor's
                           perspective on the terms set forth in such Offer to
                           Purchase or, if the Offers to Purchase are identical,
                           to the Other Parties which made the identical Offers
                           to Purchase in proportion to the number of Shares
                           then held by the Other Parties.

Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 do not apply to the following Transfers of Shares:

         (a)      Transfer to a Controlled Company - A Party shall be entitled
                  at all times and from time to time to Transfer all or any part
                  of his, her or its Shares to a Person which is under the
                  Control of the Party;

         (b)      Transfer on Death - A Party that is a natural person shall be
                  entitled to transfer his or her Shares by testamentary
                  instrument upon the death of such Party; and

         (c)      Management Transfers - Each member of Management shall be
                  entitled at all times and from time to time to Transfer all or
                  any part of his Shares to a Person pursuant to Multilateral
                  Instrument 45-105--Trades to Employees, Senior Officers,
                  Directors, and Consultants, as amended, restated or replaced
                  from time to time.

4.7      PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS

         (a)      Each time the Company proposes to issue any Common Shares or a
                  security that is convertible into a Common Share (collectively
                  referred to herein as "Equity Securities"), the Company shall
                  offer to the other Parties the right to purchase that number
                  of such Equity Securities equal to the number of Common Shares
                  owned by such Party (calculated on a fully diluted basis,
                  assuming that such Parties have exercised or converted all of
                  their respective Warrants and Preferred Shares into Common
                  Shares) divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares
                  of the Company (calculated on an undiluted basis) multiplied
                  by the number of Equity Securities to be issued by the Company
                  as of the date of the written notice described below.

         (b)      The Company will deliver written notice of its intention to
                  issue Equity Securities to each other Party stating the number
                  of Equity Securities that such Party is entitled to purchase
                  along with the terms and conditions of such offering. Each
                  such Party will have five business days from the receipt of
                  the written notice to offer to purchase, in whole or in part,
                  the number of Equity Securities that it is entitled to
                  purchase. The closing of the purchase by each such Party will
                  be concurrent with the closing of the Equity Security
                  financing; provided, however, that such Party's obligation to
                  purchase the Equity Securities will be conditioned upon the
                  closing of the entire offering, which condition such Party may
                  waive in whole or in part. The Company may sell to a third
                  party any Equity Securities not purchased by the other Parties
                  in accordance with these terms.

         (c)      This pro-rata pre-emptive right does not apply to options
                  issued pursuant to the Company's stock option plan or the
                  issuance of any security upon the conversion or exercise of
                  any outstanding security or any issuance where the Company's
                  shareholders are treated equally such as a subdivision,
                  amalgamation or reorganization.

                  the Series A Redemption Price, together with all unpaid
                  declared dividends thereon, which for such purpose shall be
                  treated as accruing up to but excluding the date of such

                  appearing on the records of the Company, then to the last
                  known address of such holder; provided, however, that

                  presentation and surrender of the certificates for the shares
                  so called for redemption as such place or places as may be
                  specified in such notice, and the certificates for such shares
                  shall thereupon be cancelled, and the shares represented
                  thereby shall thereupon be redeemed.

         (d)      No partial redemption of the outstanding Preferred Shares,
                  Series A may at any time be made except with the unanimous
                  prior written consent of all holders of the Preferred Shares,
                  Series A and the holders of any outstanding warrants for the
                  purchase thereof. If a part only of the Preferred Shares,
                  Series A represented by any certificate shall be redeemed, a
                  new certificate for the balance shall be issued at the expense
                  of the Company.

                  notice, the holders of the Preferred Shares, Series A called
                  for redemption shall cease to be entitled to dividends and
                  shall not be entitled to exercise any rights in respect
                  thereof, except to receive the Series A Redemption Amount per
                  share, unless payment of the Series A Redemption Amount per
                  share shall not be made by the Company in accordance with the
                  foregoing provisions, in which case the rights of the holders

                  in respect of which such deposit shall have been made shall

                  rights of the holder thereof after such deposit shall be
                  limited to receiving without interest the amount so deposited
                  upon presentation and surrender to the Trustee of the
                  certificate(s) representing the Preferred Shares, Series A to

                  belong to the Company.

         (f)      If the Company shall fail to redeem any Preferred Shares,
                  Series A required to be redeemed by it within 30 days of the
                  Retraction Date, then until such time as the Company shall
                  have redeemed all such shares so called for redemption, the
                  dividend payable to the holders of the Preferred Shares,
                  Series A to be redeemed shall thereafter be preferential and
                  cumulative computed from the Retraction Date.

         (g)      Notwithstanding anything contained in this Part, the Company
                  shall be under no obligation to redeem any Preferred Shares,
                  Series A to the extent that such redemption would, in the
                  reasonable opinion of the Directors, be in violation of the
                  laws of the Act or any other applicable law.

         (h)      Any redemption monies that are represented by a cheque which
                  has not been presented to the Company's bankers for payment or
                  that otherwise remains unclaimed (including monies held on

Company is required to deduct and withhold with respect to such payment under
any provision of provincial, federal, territorial, state, local or foreign tax

withheld amounts are actually remitted to the appropriate taxing authority. To
the extent that the amount so required to be deducted and withheld from any
payment to a holder exceeds the cash portion of the amount otherwise payable to
the holder, the Company is hereby authorized to sell or otherwise disposed of

sufficient funds to the Company to enable it to comply with such deduction and
withholding requirement and the Company shall notify the holder thereof and
remit to such holder any unapplied balance of the net proceeds of such sale.
