     shall apply), including without limitation the furnishing in writing of any

     reorganization or insolvency proceeding, or corporate action shall be taken
     by it for the purpose of effecting any of the foregoing; or

          (x) if without the application, approval or consent of the Company or

     if such proceeding is being contested by the Company or such Subsidiary in
     good faith, the same shall (a) result in the entry of an order for relief
     or any such adjudication or appointment or (b) continue undismissed, or

then, upon the happening of any event described in clauses (ix) and (x) in this
paragraph 6 (with respect to the Company), the Notes shall be and become
immediately due and payable without any notice of any kind at the principal
amount thereof together with accrued interest thereon, or, during the
continuance of any event referred to in this paragraph 6 other than such clauses
(ix) and (x) (with respect to the Company), any holder or holders of 66-2/3% in
aggregate principal amount of the Notes then outstanding may, at their option
and in addition to any right, power or remedy permitted by law or equity or
herein granted, by notice in writing to the Company, declare all of the Notes to
be, and such Notes shall thereupon be and become, forthwith due and payable at
the

<Page>
                                      -18-


principal amount thereof, together with interest accrued thereon and a
premium equal to that amount which is sufficient to provide a return equal to
the Defined Rate, per annum on the principal amount thereof, taking into account
any interest on such Notes paid to and including the date of final payment
thereof, compounded quarterly, from the date of issuance to the date of such
payment.

          The above provision with respect to any acceleration of the Notes is
subject to the condition that if for any reason after the principal of the Notes
shall have so become due and payable, the Company shall demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the holders in their sole judgment that it is able to pay all
matured installments of interest upon the Notes and to make any required
payments which shall have become due other than by reason of such acceleration
(with interest upon such payments and, to the extent that payment of such
interest is enforceable under applicable law, on overdue installments of
interest) and all defaults under this Agreement, other than nonpayment of the
principal of or interest on the Notes which have become due by such
acceleration, shall have been remedied or waived by holders representing at
least the percentage in aggregate principal amount of Notes requesting such
acceleration, then and in such instance such default may be waived and its
consequences rescinded and annulled by the holders representing at least the
percentage in aggregate principal amount of Notes requesting such acceleration
by written notice to the Company, which waiver shall be binding upon all
holders. It is expressly understood and agreed that the decision so to waive any
default and so to rescind and annul any consequences is within the sole judgment
and control of the holders of the Notes, and such holders shall be under no
obligation so to do.

          7. REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS AND WARRANTIES. The Company represents,
covenants and warrants as follows:

Subsidiary is duly organized and existing in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction in which it is formed or incorporated, as the case may be, and the
Company has and each Subsidiary has the power to own its respective property and
to carry on its respective business as now being conducted. The Company is and
each Subsidiary is duly qualified and in good standing as a foreign or extra
provincial corporation or other legal entity to do business in every
jurisdiction where the character of the properties owned or leased by it or the
nature of any business transacted by it makes such qualification necessary and
where such nonqualification or lack of good standing would have a material
adverse effect on the business of the Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries
taken as a whole. The Company has no Subsidiary other than those set forth in
Exhibit 7A and except as set forth on such Exhibit 7A, such Subsidiaries are
wholly owned. Attached hereto as Exhibit 7A2 are complete and correct copies of
its Certificate of Incorporation, Notice of Articles and Articles, as amended
and in full force and effect on the date hereof.

          7B. CORPORATE AUTHORITY. (a) The execution and delivery by the
Company of all transactions and obligations contemplated hereby are within its

<Page>
                                      -19-


     corporate authority. This Agreement, the Notes and the Purchased Shares
     constitute the legal, valid and binding obligations of the Company
     enforceable in accordance with its terms, except to the extent that
     enforcement may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
     reorganization or other similar laws affecting creditor's rights generally
     and the application of general principles of equity (regardless of whether
     such enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law), and
     with respect to the indemnification provisions contained herein, by
     applicable securities laws or principles of public policy.

          (b) The execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
     issuance of the Notes, the Purchased Shares, the Warrants and the shares of
     Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Purchased Shares and exercise
     of the Warrant have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate
     proceedings on the part of the Company. This Agreement and the Notes have
     been duly executed and delivered. The Purchased Shares delivered to the
     Buyer on the date hereof have been validly issued and are fully paid and
     nonassessable and not subject to any preemptive rights. The shares of
     Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the Purchased Shares and exercise
     of the Warrant have been duly authorized and duly reserved for issuance,
     are subject to no preemptive rights, and when and if issued, will be
     validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.

          7C. FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. The Company has furnished the Buyer with (i)
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K filed with the Securities and Exchange

case the related schedules and notes.

          All such financial statements (including any related schedules and/or
notes) have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles as in effect in Canada consistently applied, except to the extent set
forth in the notes to such financial statements, throughout the periods involved
and to the extent required by such principles show all liabilities, direct and

outstanding indebtedness other than the Notes. There exists no event of default
by the Company or any Subsidiary under the provisions of any instrument
evidencing such Current Indebtedness or Funded Indebtedness and there exists no
event of default by the Company or any Subsidiary, or any default by the Company
or any Subsidiary the effect of which would have a material adverse effect on
the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as a whole, under the provisions of any
other Indebtedness of the Company or of any Subsidiary or of any agreement
relating thereto that is or could be material to the Company or such Subsidiary.

          7F. TITLE, LIENS. The Company has, and each of its Subsidiaries has,

Company and its Subsidiaries have taken all necessary actions to protect
material intellectual property.

          11. RESTRICTIONS ON TRANSFER; REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

          11A. APPLICABILITY OF RESTRICTIONS. Notwithstanding any provisions to
the contrary contained in this Agreement, any Restricted Securities or the
Company's Notice of Articles or Articles, the provisions of this paragraph 11
shall apply to: (a) the transfer of any Note, (b) the transfer of any Purchased
Shares, (c) the transfer of any Warrant and (d) the transfer of any Restricted
Security (each such transfer being herein called a "RESTRICTED ACTION"). The
holder of any Note, Warrant or Restricted Security, by its acceptance thereof,
agrees that, unless otherwise permitted hereunder, it will not take any
Restricted Action prior to the delivery to the Company of the opinion or
opinions of counsel referred to in, and to the effect described in, clause (a)
of paragraph 11C (or the penultimate sentence of the last paragraph of paragraph
11C), or until registration under the SECURITIES ACT of the Restricted
Securities involved in, or issuable upon conversion of the Purchased Shares or
exercise of the Warrant involved in, such Restricted Action has become
effective.

                                      -28-


          11B. RESTRICTIVE LEGENDS. Each Note, Warrant and certificate for
Purchased Shares and Restricted Securities (unless at the time of issuance such
Restricted Securities are registered under the SECURITIES ACT), and each Note,
Warrant and certificate issued upon the transfer or exchange of any such Note or
certificate for Restricted Securities (except as otherwise permitted by this
paragraph 11), shall bear a legend in substantially the following form:

          The securities represented by this certificate have not been
registered under the SECURITIES Act of 1933, as amended, and neither the
securities nor any interest therein may be sold, transferred, pledged or
otherwise disposed of in the absence of such registration or an exemption under
such Act and the rules and regulations thereunder. The transfer of such
securities is subject to the restrictions set forth in paragraph 11 of that
certain Amended and Restated Note and Stock Purchase Agreement, dated December
17, 2004 between Elephant & Castle Group Inc. and GE Investment Private
Placement Partners II, a Limited Partnership, copies of which are available for
inspection at the offices of Elephant & Castle Group Inc., and such securities
may be transferred only in compliance with the terms and conditions of said
paragraph 11 of said Amended and Restated Note and Stock Purchase Agreement.

          11C. NOTICE OF PROPOSED TRANSFER; OPINIONS OF COUNSEL; CERTAIN
RESTRICTIONS. Each holder of any Notes, Purchased Shares, Warrants or of any
Restricted Securities, by its acceptance thereof, agrees that, except as
otherwise expressly provided below in this paragraph 11C, prior to the taking of
any Restricted Action, such holder will give written notice to the Company of
such holder's intention to take such Restricted Action and to comply in all
other respects with this paragraph 11C. Each such notice (i) shall describe the
manner and circumstances of the proposed Restricted Action in sufficient detail
to enable counsel to render the opinions referred to below and (ii) shall
designate counsel for the holder giving such notice (who may be house counsel
for such holder). The holder giving such notice will submit a copy thereof to
the counsel designated in such notice, and the Company will promptly submit a
copy thereof to its counsel (who may be house counsel for the Company), and the
following provisions shall apply:

          (a) If in the opinion of each such counsel the proposed Restricted
     Action may be effected without registration under the Securities Act or any
     applicable state securities or Blue Sky laws of any Note or Restricted
     Securities involved in, or issuable upon conversion of any Purchased Shares
     or exercise any Warrant involved in, such Restricted Action, then the
     Company will promptly notify the holder thereof and such holder shall
     thereupon be entitled to effect such Restricted Action in accordance with
     the terms of the notice delivered by such holder to the Company, and the
     Company will promptly effect any transfer of any Notes or Restricted
     Securities involved in such Restricted Action and either deliver new Notes
     in accordance with paragraph 13E, or certificates for Restricted Securities
     bearing (or not bearing, if in the opinion of each such counsel such legend
     is no longer required to insure compliance with the Securities Act) the
     legend set forth in paragraph 11B, or both, as the case may be. If for any
     reason counsel for the Company (after having been furnished with the
     information required to be

<Page>
                                      -29-


     furnished by clause (i) of this paragraph 11C) shall fail to deliver an
     opinion to the Company (with a copy to such holder), or the Company shall
     fail to notify such holder thereof as aforesaid, within 15 days after
     counsel for such holder shall have delivered its opinion to such holder
     (with a copy to the Company), then for all purposes hereof the opinion of
     counsel for the Company shall be deemed to be the same as the opinion of
     counsel for such holder.

          (b) If in the opinion of either or both of such counsel (such opinion
     or opinions to state the basis of the legal conclusions reached therein)
     the proposed Restricted Action may not legally be effected without
     registration under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities or
     Blue Sky laws of any Note or Restricted Securities involved in, or issuable
     upon conversion of any Purchased Shares or exercise of any Warrant involved
     in, such Restricted Action, the Company shall promptly so notify the holder
     thereof and thereafter such holder shall not be entitled to effect such
     Restricted Action until receipt of a further notice from the Company under
     clause (a) of this paragraph 11C.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, each holder shall be permitted to
transfer any Note or Notes or any Restricted Security or Restricted Securities
attributable to Notes in one or more transactions to a limited number of
institutional investors similar in nature to the Buyer or "accredited investors"
as defined in Rule 501 under the Securities Act; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that (x)
each such investor shall represent in writing that it is acquiring such Note or
Restricted Security for investment and not with a view to the distribution
thereof (subject, however, to any requirement of law that the disposition
thereof shall at all times be within the control of such transferee), (y) each
such investor shall agree in writing to be bound by all the restrictions on
transfer of such Note or Restricted Security contained in paragraph 11 hereof
and (z) such holder shall deliver to the Company an opinion of counsel (who
shall be satisfactory to the Company) stating that such transfer may be effected
without registration under the Securities Act or any applicable state securities
or Blue Sky laws. The Company will pay the reasonable fees and disbursements of
counsel (other than house counsel) for any holder of Notes or Restricted
Securities and of counsel for the Company in connection with all opinions
rendered by them pursuant to this paragraph 11C, and will reimburse any such
holder for all other out-of-pocket expenses (other than Registration Expenses)
incurred by such holder in complying with this paragraph 11C.

          11D. REGISTRATION OF RESTRICTED SECURITIES ON REQUEST. Upon the
written request of the holders of no less than 50% of the outstanding Restricted
Securities, which request (a) shall describe the Restricted Action proposed to
be effected by such holder and the intended method of disposition by such holder
of the Restricted Securities involved in such proposed Restricted Action, and
(b) shall request that the Company effect the registration of all or part of
such holder's Restricted Securities under the Securities Act, the Company will
promptly give written notice of such requested registration to all holders of
outstanding Notes, Warrants or Restricted Securities and thereupon will use its
best efforts to effect the registration under the Securities Act of (i) the
Restricted Securities which the Company has been so requested to register, for
disposition in accordance with the intended method of disposition stated in such
request,

<Page>
                                      -30-


and (ii) all other Restricted Securities the holders of which shall
have, within 30 days after the receipt of such written notice from the Company,
made written request (stating the intended method of disposition of such
securities by such holders) to the Company for registration thereof, all to the
extent required to permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended
method thereof as aforesaid) by all such holders of the Restricted Securities so
to be registered; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Company shall not be obligated to
effect any such registration pursuant to this paragraph 11D (a) at any time
prior to the second anniversary of the date of this Agreement (b) at any time
prior to the first anniversary of the effective date of a registration statement
filed with the Commission pursuant to a written notice of requested registration
pursuant to this paragraph 11D, or (c) at any time subsequent to the third such
registration made pursuant to this paragraph 11D which shall have become
effective with respect to all Restricted Securities requested to be included
therein and not have been interfered with by any order or requirement of the
Commission or any other governmental agency or any court. The holders requesting
any registration pursuant to this paragraph shall select the underwriter or
underwriters to be used in connection with any public offering of securities
registered pursuant to this paragraph; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that so long as the
Buyer shall hold any Restricted Securities, the Buyer shall have the right, in
its sole discretion, to approve or disapprove of any underwriter in which
General Electric Company has a direct or indirect interest of 5% or more.

          11E. PIGGY-BACK REGISTRATION. If the Company at any time proposes to
register any of its equity securities (other than securities issued with respect
to any acquisition or any employee stock option, stock purchase, or similar plan
or any other securities to be registered pursuant to a special purpose
registration) under the Securities Act on Form S-1, Form S-2, Form S-3 or any
other form of general application for sale of securities to the public in an
underwritten offering upon which may be registered securities similar to the
Restricted Securities, it will each such time at least 60 days prior to the
anticipated filing date of such proposed registration statement give written
notice to all holders of all outstanding Notes or Restricted Securities of its
intention so to do and, upon the written request of any such holder made within
30 days after the receipt of any such notice (which request shall specify the
Restricted Securities intended to be disposed of by such holder and state the
intended method of disposition thereof), the Company will use its best efforts
to effect the registration under the Securities Act of Restricted Securities
which the Company has been so requested to register, to the extent requisite to
permit the disposition (in accordance with the intended methods thereof as
aforesaid) by such holders of the Restricted Securities to be so registered,
subject to the discretion of the managing underwriter to limit or exclude any of
such equity securities from the offering if it determines that the inclusion
thereof would adversely affect the marketing of the securities to be sold by the
Company therein; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that if any of such equity securities are to
be included in such underwriting for the account of any person other than the
Buyer, the number of such equity securities to be included by any such person
shall be reduced first; PROVIDED, FURTHER, HOWEVER, that if any Restricted
Securities are to be distributed pursuant to this paragraph through a firm of
underwriters to the public and the Buyer shall be participating in such offering
the Buyer shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to approve or disapprove
of any underwriter in which General Electric Company has a direct or indirect
interest of 5% or more. No registration effected

<Page>
                                      -31-


pursuant to this paragraph 11E shall relieve the Company from its obligation to
effect any registration upon request pursuant to paragraph 11D hereof.

          11F. REGISTRATION EXPENSES. The Registration Expenses in connection
with any registration in which Restricted Securities or Notes shall be included
pursuant to paragraph 11D, 11E or 11F shall be borne by the Company.

          11G. REGISTRATION PROCEDURES. If and whenever the Company is required
to effect the registration of any Restricted Securities under the Securities Act
as provided in this Agreement, the Company will promptly:

          (i) prepare and (in any event within 90 days after the end of the
     period within which requests for registration may be given to the Company)
     file with the Commission a registration statement with respect to such
     Restricted Securities and use its best efforts to cause such registration
     statement to become effective;

          (ii) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
     supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
     connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration
     statement effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act
     with respect to the disposition of all such Restricted Securities and other
     securities covered by such registration statement until such time as all of
     such Restricted Securities and other securities have been disposed of in
     accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the seller or
     sellers thereof set forth in such registration statement, but in no event
     for a period of more than 270 days after such registration statement
     becomes effective;

          (iii) furnish to each seller of such Restricted Securities such number
     of copies of such registration statement and of each such amendment and
     supplement thereto (in each case including all exhibits), such number of
     copies of the prospectus included in such registration statement (including
     each preliminary prospectus), in conformity with the requirements of the
     Securities Act, and such other documents, as such seller may reasonably
     request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Restricted Securities
     owned by such seller;

          (iv) use its best efforts to register or qualify such Restricted
     Securities covered by such registration statement under such other
     applicable securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the
     United States of America (including territories and commonwealths thereof)
     as each seller shall reasonably request, except that the Company shall not
     for any such purpose be required to qualify generally to do business as a
     foreign corporation in any jurisdiction wherein it is not so qualified, to
     subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or to consent to
     general service of process in any jurisdiction;

          (v) notify each seller of any such Restricted Securities covered by
     such registration statement, at any time when a prospectus relating thereto
     is required to be delivered under the Securities Act within the period
     mentioned in

<Page>
                                      -32-


     subdivision (ii) of this paragraph 11H, of the happening of any event as a
     result of which the prospectus included in such registration statement, as
     then in effect, includes an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
     state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
     the statements therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under
     which they were made (and upon receipt of such notice and until a
     supplemented or amended prospectus as set forth below is available, each
     such seller shall not offer or sell any securities covered by such
     registration statement and shall return all copies of such prospectus to
     the Company if requested to do so by it), and at the request of any such
     seller prepare and furnish to such seller a reasonable number of copies of
     a supplement to or an amendment of such prospectus as may be necessary so
     that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of such Restricted
     Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of a
     material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading in light
     of the circumstances under which they were made; and

          (vi) furnish to each holder for which Restricted Securities are
     registered or are to be registered at the time of the disposition of such
     Restricted Securities by such holder, a signed copy of an opinion of
     counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably acceptable to, and which opinion
     shall be reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to, such holder) to
     the effect that: (a) a registration statement covering such Restricted
     Securities has been filed with the Commission under the Securities Act and
     has been made effective by order of the Commission, (b) said registration
     statement and the prospectus contained therein comply as to form in all
     material respects with the requirements of the Securities Act, and (after
     due inquiry) such counsel has no reason to believe that either said
     registration statement or such prospectus contains any untrue statement of
     a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
     therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of such
     prospectus, in light of the circumstances under which they were made) not
     misleading, (c) after due inquiry said counsel knows of no legal or
     governmental proceedings required to be described in said registration
     statement or prospectus which are not described as required, or of any
     contracts or documents of a character required to be described in said
     registration statement or prospectus or to be filed as an exhibit to said
     registration statement or to be incorporated by reference therein which is
     not described and filed as required, (d) no stop order has been issued by
     the Commission suspending the effectiveness of such registration statement
     and, to the best of such counsel's knowledge, no proceedings for the
     issuance of such a stop order are pending or threatened, and (e) the
     applicable provisions of the securities or Blue Sky laws of each state in
     which the Company shall be required, pursuant to clause (iv) of this
     paragraph 11G, to register or qualify such Notes or Restricted Securities,
     have been complied with, assuming the accuracy and completeness of the
     information furnished to such counsel with respect to each filing relating
     to such laws; it being understood that such opinion may contain such
     qualifications and assumptions as are customary in the rendering of similar
     opinions, and that such counsel may rely, as to all factual matters treated
     therein, on certificates of the Company (copies of which shall be delivered
     to such holder).
<Page>
                                      -33-


          The Company may require each seller of any Restricted Securities as to
which any registration is being effected to furnish the Company such information
regarding such seller and the distribution of such Restricted Securities as the
Company may from time to time request in writing and as shall be required by law
to effect such registration.

          11H. TERMINATION OF RESTRICTIONS. All restrictions imposed by
paragraph 11 hereof upon the transferability of Notes or Restricted Securities
shall cease and terminate as to any particular Notes or Restricted Securities,
(a) when such securities shall have been effectively registered under the
Securities Act and disposed of in accordance with the registration statement
covering such securities, or (b) when, in the opinion of counsel for the holder
thereof and counsel for the Company, such restrictions are no longer required in
order to insure compliance with the Securities Act. Whenever such restrictions
shall terminate as to any Notes or Restricted Securities, the holder thereof
shall be entitled to receive from the Company without expense a new certificate
or certificates representing such securities not bearing the legend set forth in
paragraph 11B hereof.

          11I. INDEMNIFICATION. (a) In the event of any registration of any

          (b) The Company may require, as a condition to including any

     each director of the Company, each officer of the Company who shall sign
     such registration statement and any person who controls the Company within

     notice. In case any such action is brought against an indemnified party,

the provisions of paragraph 13C) only by an agreement in writing signed by the
party against whom enforcement is sought.

          13M. HEADINGS; TABLE OF CONTENTS. The descriptive headings of the
several paragraphs of this Agreement and the table of contents are inserted for
convenience only and do not constitute a part of this Agreement.

          13N. COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in
two or more counterparts, all of which shall be deemed but one and the same
instrument and each of which shall be deemed an original, and it shall not be
necessary in making proof of this Agreement to produce or account for more than
one such counterpart.

          13O. NON EXCLUSIVITY OF REMEDIES AND SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE. The rights
and remedies of any of the parties hereunder shall not be mutually exclusive,
and the exercise of one or more of the provisions of this Agreement shall not
preclude the exercise of any other provisions of this Agreement. Each of the
parties confirms that damages at law may be an inadequate remedy for breach or
threat of breach of any provisions of this Agreement. The respective rights and
obligations arising out of or under this Agreement shall be enforceable by
specific performance, injunction, or other equitable remedy, but nothing in this
Agreement is intended to limit or affect any rights at law or by statute or
otherwise of any party aggrieved as against the other parties for a breach or
threat of breach of any provision of this Agreement, it being the intention by
this paragraph to make clear that under this Agreement the respective rights and
obligations of the parties shall be enforceable in equity as well as at law or
otherwise.

          13P. NON BUSINESS DAYS. If the date for making any payment or the last
date for performance of any act or the exercising of any right, as provided in
this Agreement, shall not be a business day, such payment may be made or act
performed or right exercised on the next succeeding business day, with the same
force and effect as if done on the nominal date provided in this Agreement,
except that interest shall accrue and be payable for the period after such
nominal date.

          IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be executed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized as of the day
and year first above written.

forth in the Security Agreement.

          Each right, power or remedy of the holder hereof upon the occurrence
of any Event of Default as provided in the Agreement or now or hereafter

waive the right either to require payment when due of all other amounts payable

and the rights of the holder shall not be subject to any defense, set-off,

                           FORM OF OPINIONS OF COUNSEL
                                 TO THE COMPANY

OPINION AS TO UNITED STATES LAW MATTERS TO BE PROVIDED BY D. DAVID COHEN, ESQ.
COVERING THE FOLLOWING OPINIONS:

          (1) The Company is a corporation duly incorporated, validly existing
and in good standing under the laws of the Province of British Columbia, Canada
and has all requisite corporate power and authority (a) to carry on the business
in which it is engaged and to own, operate and encumber the properties that it
owns, (b) to enter into the Agreement, the Amendment No. 2 to the U.S. Security
Agreement and the amended UCC-1 Financing Statements (collectively, the
"Transaction Documents"), (c) to issue and deliver the Notes and the Purchased
Shares and to incur the Indebtedness evidenced by the Notes and (d) to carry out
the provisions of the Transaction Documents and the Notes to be carried out by
it.

          (2) The Company is duly authorized to conduct its business in each
jurisdiction in which it operates and has been duly qualified and is in good
standing as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of
its properties or the nature of its activities makes such qualification
necessary or desirable.

          (3) Each Subsidiary is a corporation duly incorporated, validly
existing and in good standing in the jurisdiction of its incorporation, has the
corporate power and authority to own, operate and encumber its assets, to
transact its business, as presently operated, and to execute the Transaction
Documents to which it is a party and to perform its obligations thereunder and
is duly qualified to do business and is in good standing as a foreign
corporation in each jurisdiction where the character of its properties or the
nature of its activities makes such qualification necessary or desirable.

          (4) Each of the Transaction Documents, the Notes, the Purchased Shares
and the Warrants being acquired by you under the Agreement has been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and its
Subsidiaries (no action by the stockholders of the Company being required by
law, by the Certificate of Incorporation or otherwise), has been duly executed
and delivered by the Company and its Subsidiaries and constitutes a legal, valid
and binding obligation of the Company and its Subsidiaries, enforceable against
the Company and its Subsidiaries in accordance with its terms, except as may be
limited (a) by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium or similar laws affecting
creditors' rights generally, (b) by general principles of equity, regardless of
whether enforcement of any obligation therein mentioned is sought in a
proceeding in equity or at law and (c) with respect to the indemnification
provisions contained in the Agreement, by applicable securities laws or
principles of public policy.

          (5) The Purchased Shares have been duly authorized for issuance, are
subject to no preemptive rights, are validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable.
<Page>
                                      -2-


          (6) The shares of Common Stock of the Company issuable upon the
conversion of the Purchased Shares or the exercise of the Warrant, as the case
may be, Notes have been duly authorized and reserved for issuance, are subject
to no preemptive rights, and when and if issued, will be validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable.

          (7) There are, except as disclosed in the Agreement and the Exhibits
thereto, no options, warrants, conversion or other rights, agreements or
commitments of any kind obligating, or which might in the future obligate, the
Company to sell any shares of its capital stock of any class or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for any shares of its capital stock of any
class, and no authorization therefore has been granted by the Company.

          (8) The execution and delivery of the Transaction Documents, the
Notes, the Purchased Shares and the Warrant and the performance by the Company
and its Subsidiaries of its agreements, covenants and obligations thereunder and
the issuance of the Notes do not and will not (a) require any consent which has
not been provided for in the Transaction Documents and obtained, (b) contravene,
conflict with or result in any violation of the provisions of any federal or
state statute, rule or regulation binding on the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries or of the Certificate of Incorporation or the By-laws of the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or require registration with any governmental
authority, (c) contravene, conflict with or result in a breach or constitute a
default under or give rise to any right to accelerate or require payment,
repurchase or redemption of any obligation or require any consent under any
indenture or loan or credit agreement, the Certificate of Incorporation, Notice
of Articles or Articles of the Company or any Subsidiary or any other agreement,
lease or instrument to which the Company or any Subsidiary is a party or by
which any of their property is bound, (d) result in, or require, the creation or
imposition of any lien, security interest or other encumbrance (other than as
contemplated by the Transaction Documents) upon or with respect to any of the
properties now owned or hereafter acquired by the Company or any Subsidiary, or
(e) cause the Company or any Subsidiary to be in default under any law, order,
writ, judgment, injunction, decree, agreement, lease or instrument.

          (9) The issuance and delivery of the Notes and the Purchased Shares by
the Company under the circumstances contemplated by the Agreement constitute
transactions exempt from registration under applicable state securities and Blue
Sky laws and from the registration provisions of the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, and do not, under existing law, require the registration of the Notes
and the Purchased Shares under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, or
compliance with any requirements of the Trust Indenture Act of 1939.

          (10) All consents, approvals or authorizations, if any, of any
governmental authority required on the part of the Company or its Subsidiaries
in connection with the execution and delivery or performance of the Transaction
Documents or the offer, issue or delivery of the Notes and the Purchased Shares
to you have been duly obtained, and the Company and its Subsidiaries have
complied with any applicable provisions of law requiring any declaration,
filing, registration and/or qualification with any governmental authority in
connection with such offer, issue or delivery.
<Page>
                                      -3-


          (11) There is no action, suit or proceeding at law or in equity by or
before any governmental authority or tribunal or other agency now pending or
threatened against or affecting either the Company or any of its Subsidiaries or
any properties or rights of any thereof (i) wherein an unfavorable decision,
ruling or finding would have a material adverse effect on the validity or
enforceability of the Transaction Documents or the Notes and the Purchased
Shares or would materially and adversely affect the business, property, assets,
condition (financial or otherwise), results of operation or prospects of the
Company and its consolidated Subsidiaries, taken as a whole, or (ii) that seeks
to enjoin or otherwise prevent the consummation of the transactions contemplated
by the Transaction Documents or the issuance and delivery of the Notes and the
Purchased Shares.

          (12) The U.S. Security Agreement, as amended by Amendment No. 1,
continues to create valid and enforceable security interest in favor of you in
the Collateral specified therein that the U.S. Security Agreement purports to
create to secure the Secured Obligations, subject to the effect of (i)
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws of general application relating to or affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights and remedies, and (ii) general principles of equity, whether
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law.

          (13) Upon filing of the amendments to financing statements in the
states where the Company and its Subsidiaries are incorporated, the Secured
Party will continue to have a perfected security interest in any Collateral in
which a security interest may be perfected through the filing of the financing
statements under Article 9 of the NYUCC, or under any parallel provisions of the
UCC applicable in the states where the Company and its Subsidiaries are
incorporated, subject to the effect of (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws of general application relating
to or affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights and remedies, and (ii)
general principles of equity, whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at
law.

                    Corporation or its Subsidiary, taken as a whole, pending or
                    threatened against or affecting the Corporation or its
                    Subsidiary, taken as a whole, at law or in equity, before or
                    by any federal, provincial, municipal or governmental
                    department, commission, board, bureau, agency or
                    instrumentality, domestic or foreign, which involves the
                    Transaction Documents or the transactions contemplated
                    thereby or the validity of the issuance of the Notes, the

                    any regulatory authority in British Columbia is required, in
                    order to permit the offering, issuance and delivery of the
                    Securities by the Company to GEIPPP. We note that the

                    45-103F4, prepared, executed and filed in accordance with
