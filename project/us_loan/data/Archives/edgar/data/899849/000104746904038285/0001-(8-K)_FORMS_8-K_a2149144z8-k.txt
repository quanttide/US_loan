ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 17, 2004, Elephant & Castle Group Inc. (the "Company")
entered into a series of agreements intended to improve the Company's balance
sheet and cash availability. The transactions have resulted in a substantial
dilution of the current equity, all as described hereinafter.

TRANSACTIONS WITH GE INVESTMENT PRIVATE PLACEMENT PARTNERS II ("GEIPPP")
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------

In consideration for the surrender of US$3,900,000 of the existing Senior Notes,
the surrender of US$5,000,000 of the existing Junior Notes and the waiver of
US$1,208,811 of accrued interest on these Notes the Company has issued
US$4,203,879 of new Senior Notes, 3,653,972 of CDN$2 (US$1.57) preferred shares
and a warrant to purchase 1,750,000 shares of common stock. The Senior Notes
bear interest at 14%, which accrues until payments commence in March, 2007,
except in certain circumstances, and are fully repayable on December 18th, 2009.
The preferred shares accrue a cumulative annual dividend of 6%, payable only
when the Crown debt and Senior Notes are repaid in full. The preferred shares
are redeemable at the Company's option at 100% of redemption principal plus a
redemption premium of up to 50% of the principal amount. Unless redeemed
earlier, the preferred shares are automatically convertible, subject to the
Company achieving an EBITDA target of US$3,500,000, at the rate of 3 shares of
common stock for every 2 preferred shares. The warrants are exerciseable for a
period of ten years at a price of CDN$0.667 per share. By these transactions,
the Company reduced its indebtedness by US$5,904,932, and postponed the due date
on the remaining balance of US$4,203,879 from September, 2005 until December,
2009 in exchange for equity securities representing, on a fully converted basis,
approximately 53% of the new total outstanding, and a higher coupon on the debt
component.


TRANSACTIONS WITH CROWN CAPITAL PARTNERS ("CROWN")
- --------------------------------------------------

Prior to the transactions described herein, the Company had no business
relationship with Crown or any affiliates thereof. The Company has entered into
a credit agreement with Crown, pursuant to which it borrowed CDN$5,000,000 (US$
4,040,000). The loan bears interest at the rate of 12% per annum. Interest is
payable monthly and monthly principal payments of CDN$40,000 (US$32,320)
commence in December, 2006, rising to CDN$60,000 (US$48,480) in December 2007
and CDN$100,000 (US$80,800) in December 2008, with the balance of CDN$2,600,000
(US$2,100,800) repayable by 17th December, 2009. In connection with the making
of the loan, Crown received a first secured position over all of the Company's
assets and properties, including the capital stock of the subsidiary companies,
in respect of the loan indebtedness. Additionally, the Company granted Crown a
warrant to purchase 1,399,301 shares of common stock of the Company and 730,794
preferred shares of the Company for $100, representing 15% of the outstanding
shares of both classes of stock of the Company. By the Crown transactions, the
company realised a CDN$5,000,000 (US$4,040,000) (less expenses of the
transaction) improvement in its balance sheet for a fixed interest rate of 12%,
which management believes to be highly favourable under the heavily leveraged
circumstances of the borrowing. The added cost of doing so, however, was the
grant of a 15% equity stake in the company to Crown.


TRANSACTIONS WITH MANAGEMENT
- ----------------------------

The Company has entered into an agreement with the three senior managers of the
Company ("Management"), whereby Management has committed to purchase for
CDN$265,000, over a period of 18 months, 932,867 common shares and 487,196
preferred shares, representing 10% of the outstanding shares of both classes of
stock of the Company. Management has made an initial payment of CDN$115,000
(US$92,920) and only receive share ownership in respect of fully paid
securities. In connection with this purchase, Management have also been issued a
warrant for the purchase of an additional 5% of both classes of stock for
CDN$132,500.


AGREEMENTS BETWEEN INVESTORS
- ----------------------------

GEIPPP and Crown have entered into an inter-creditor agreement, which
establishes the seniority of the Crown security and the subordination of the
GEIPPP security over the assets of the Company.

GEIPPP, Crown and Management have entered into an inter-shareholder agreement.
Under this agreement all parties agree to appoint two GEIPPP nominees, one Crown
nominee and one Management nominee to the board of the Company. Additionally the
parties have agreed conditions and entitlements associated with the sale or
transfer of their shares.

Investors in US$661,171 of 8% convertible, subordinated notes of the company
issued in 2000 ("Delphi Investors") have agreed to the amendment of their notes
such that the coupon will be increased to 9.25% and repayment will be scheduled
to re-commence in March, 2007.

The total common shares required for the issuance of all of the shares
necessary, upon conversion of all of the preferred shares and all of the
warrants issued in the transactions described above, is in excess of the
20,000,000 common shares currently authorized by the Memorandum of the Company.
GEIPPP, Crown and Management have committed to authorising and approving an
increase in the authorised share capital of the Company.
