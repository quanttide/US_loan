         3.3 NON-ARM'S LENGTH TRANSACTIONS

Following repayment by the Company in full of all indebtedness owed to both of
GEIPPP II and Crown Life and until such time as Crown Life shall have been
offered an opportunity to exercise Tag-Along Rights (and the transactions
contemplated in connection with such opportunity have closed), and provided that
GEIPPP II continues to hold a majority of the Common Shares of the Company on a
fully diluted basis, the Company agrees that it will not enter into or amend any
contract, loan or other advance to, guarantee of, investment in, acquisition of
or merger with any business of any Person that is not arm's length to the
Company (within the meaning of the INCOME TAX ACT (Canada), without first having
obtained the prior written consent of GEIPP and Crown Life, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld or delayed.

                        ARTICLE 4 : DISPOSITION OF SHARES

         4.1 AGREEMENTS WITH TRANSFEREES

Notwithstanding anything else herein contained, every Transfer of any Shares
held by a Party shall be subject to the condition that the proposed transferee,
if not already bound by this Agreement, shall first enter into a Participation
Agreement with the other Parties hereto, except that a Participation Agreement
shall not be required in respect of any transaction in which GEIPPP II has
offered the other Parties Tag-Along Rights in accordance with Section 4.3
hereof.

         4.2 SALE OF SHARES TO THIRD PARTIES

Subject to the provisions of this Article 4, the Parties shall be entitled to
sell or transfer their Shares or any other securities in the capital of the
Company to third parties at any time.

         4.3 TAG-ALONG RIGHTS

After giving effect to Section 4.5, if applicable, in any transaction, other
than a transaction that is subject to Rule 144 of the U.S. Securities of 1933,
as amended, where GEIPP proposes to sell any of its Shares in the Company (the
"Subject Shares") to a third party (the "Offeree") and subject to Section 4.5,
then:

         (a)      GEIPP shall offer to each other Party holding Shares of such
                  class the right (the "Tag-Along Right") to participate in the
                  sale in proportion to the number of Subject Shares of such
                  class owned by GEIPP relative to the total number of Shares of
                  such class then owned by GEIPP as at the time that the offer
                  to participate was made and on the same terms and conditions
                  applicable to the sale of the Subject Shares, assuming the
                  transaction is completed by GEIPP; provided, however, that
                                                     --------
                  this Section 4.3 shall not apply to any Transfer by GEIPP in
                  connection with which GEIPP elects to exercise its right to
                  compel a sale pursuant to Section 4.4; and

         (b)      GEIPP will give each other Party not less than five business
                  days' written notice ("Notice") of the proposed sale and will
                  specify in the Notice the identity of the Offeree, the number
                  of Shares offered for sale, and the price and other terms of

<Page>

                  sale. Each other Party will have five business days from
                  receipt of a Notice to exercise the right contained in
                  paragraph (a) above by giving written notice to GEIPP
                  specifying the number of Shares in respect of which it
                  proposes to exercise its applicable right (the "Exercise
                  Notice"). Each Party that does not timely deliver an Exercise
                  Notice within 15 days of its receipt of the Notice will be
                  deemed to have waived all rights under this Section 4.3 with
                  respect to the proposed Transfer. Delivery of the Exercise
                  Notice by a Party will constitute an irrevocable commitment by
                  such Party to sell in the proposed Transfer the Shares
                  specified in such Exercise Notice, on the terms set forth in
                  the Notice; PROVIDED, however, that if the principal terms of
                  the proposed Transfer change with the result that the
                  per share price shall be less than the share price set forth
                  in the Notice or the other principal terms shall be materially
                  less favourable to GEIPP or the Party exercising its Tag-Along
                  Right than those set forth in the Notice, each participating
                  Party shall be permitted to withdraw the commitment contained
                  in its Exercise Notice and shall be released from its
                  obligations thereunder; and

         (c)      the failure of any Party (other than GEIPP) to perform its
                  obligations under this Section 4.3 in respect of any Transfer
                  contemplated by a Notice shall result in the termination of
                  such Party's rights under this Section 4.3 in respect of such
                  Transfer.

         4.4 DRAG-ALONG RIGHTS

If:

         (a)      GEIPPP II has received a bona fide offer from a Person, or
                  Persons acting in concert, (a "Purchaser"), in any case at
                  arm's length to GEIPPP II, to purchase all of the Shares owned
                  by it; and

         (b)      the Purchaser offers to purchase the remaining Shares held by
                  the other Parties (the "Specified Securities") at the same
                  price per Shares and on other equivalent terms and conditions
                  as those agreed to by GEIPPP II, all of which terms and
                  conditions are set out in writing and promptly delivered to
                  the other Parties (the "Drag Along Offer");

then the other Parties shall be required to sell their Specified Securities to
the Purchaser in accordance with the terms and conditions of the Drag Along
Offer. If any of the other Parties (the "Delinquent Holders") fail to sell their
Specified Securities to the Purchaser in accordance with the terms and
conditions of the Drag Along Offer, the Purchaser shall have the right to
deposit the applicable purchase price for those Specified Securities of the
Delinquent Holders in a special account at any financial institution in Canada,
to be paid proportionately with interest, to the respective Delinquent Holders
upon presentation and surrender to such financial institution of the
certificates or documents representing such holders' Specified Securities duly
endorsed for transfer to the Purchaser. Upon such deposit being made, the
Specified Securities in respect of which the deposit was made shall hereby
automatically (without any further action of any kind on the part of the
Delinquent Holders or the Purchaser) be transferred to and purchased by the
Purchaser and shall be transferred on the books of the Corporation to the
Purchaser and the rights of the Delinquent Holders in respect of those Specified
Securities after such deposit shall hereby


<Page>

be limited to receiving, with interest, their respective portion of the total
amount so deposited against presentation and surrender of the certificates or
documents representing their respective Specified Securities duly endorsed for
transfer to the Purchaser.

         4.5 RIGHT OF FIRST OFFER

In any transaction other than an open market transaction where any Party (the
"Seller"), wishes to sell any or all of its respective Shares (the "Offered
Shares") (except where such proposed sale is a result of an unsolicited bid to
purchase all of the Seller's Shares, in which case this Section 4.5 shall not
apply), then:

         (a)      the Seller will first deliver to the other Parties (the "Other
                  Parties"), an offer (the "Offer") to sell the Offered Shares
                  at a price and on the conditions set out in the Offer;

         (b)      any of the Other Parties may, within 15 days of delivery of
                  the Invitation, accept the terms of the Offer and specify an
                  Offer to Purchase which shall specify the price and the terms
                  upon which the Other Party shall purchase the Offered Shares.
                  The Offer to Purchase will state that the offer contained
                  therein is irrevocable;

         (c)      if no Other Party makes an Offer to Purchase within the time
                  period specified in paragraph (b) above, then this paragraph
                  4.5 shall no longer apply and the Seller shall be free to sell
                  any or all of the Offered Shares thereafter, subject to the
                  Tag-Along Rights;

         (d)      if one or more of the Other Parties makes an Offer to Purchase
                  the Offered Shares within the time period specified in
                  paragraph (b) above, then the Seller shall have 90 days to
                  sell the Offered Shares to a third party provided that such
                  sale shall be carried out on the terms that are the same or
                  that are no less favourable from a reasonable vendor's
                  perspective than the terms set forth in each Offer to Purchase
                  received; and

         (e)      if the Seller does not complete a sale pursuant to paragraph
                  (d) above, then the Seller shall sell its shares:

                  (i)      in the case that only Other Party has made an Offer
                           to Purchase, to such Other Party on the terms set
                           forth in the Offer to Purchase; or

                  (ii)     in the case that more than one Other Party has made
                           an Offer to Purchase, to the Other Party whose Offer
                           to Purchase is superior from a reasonable vendor's
                           perspective on the terms set forth in such Offer to
                           Purchase or, if the Offers to Purchase are identical,
                           to the Other Parties which made the identical Offers
                           to Purchase in proportion to the number of Shares
                           then held by the Other Parties.

         4.6 PERMITTED TRANSFERS

Sections 4.3, 4.4 and 4.5 do not apply to the following Transfers of Shares:

         (a)      Transfer to a Controlled Company - A Party shall be entitled
                  at all times and from time to time to Transfer all or any part
                  of his, her or its Shares to a Person which is under the
                  Control of the Party;

         (b)      Transfer on Death - A Party that is a natural person shall be
                  entitled to transfer his or her Shares by testamentary
                  instrument upon the death of such Party; and

         (c)      Management Transfers - Each member of Management shall be
                  entitled at all times and from time to time to Transfer all or
                  any part of his Shares to a Person pursuant to Multilateral
                  Instrument 45-105--Trades to Employees, Senior Officers,
                  Directors, and Consultants, as amended, restated or replaced
                  from time to time.

4.7      PRE-EMPTIVE RIGHTS

         (a)      Each time the Company proposes to issue any Common Shares or a
                  security that is convertible into a Common Share (collectively
                  referred to herein as "Equity Securities"), the Company shall
                  offer to the other Parties the right to purchase that number
                  of such Equity Securities equal to the number of Common Shares
                  owned by such Party (calculated on a fully diluted basis,
                  assuming that such Parties have exercised or converted all of
                  their respective Warrants and Preferred Shares into Common
                  Shares) divided by the number of issued and outstanding shares
                  of the Company (calculated on an undiluted basis) multiplied
                  by the number of Equity Securities to be issued by the Company
                  as of the date of the written notice described below.

         (b)      The Company will deliver written notice of its intention to
                  issue Equity Securities to each other Party stating the number
                  of Equity Securities that such Party is entitled to purchase
                  along with the terms and conditions of such offering. Each
                  such Party will have five business days from the receipt of
                  the written notice to offer to purchase, in whole or in part,
                  the number of Equity Securities that it is entitled to
                  purchase. The closing of the purchase by each such Party will
                  be concurrent with the closing of the Equity Security
                  financing; provided, however, that such Party's obligation to
                  purchase the Equity Securities will be conditioned upon the
                  closing of the entire offering, which condition such Party may
                  waive in whole or in part. The Company may sell to a third
                  party any Equity Securities not purchased by the other Parties
                  in accordance with these terms.

         (c)      This pro-rata pre-emptive right does not apply to options
                  issued pursuant to the Company's stock option plan or the
                  issuance of any security upon the conversion or exercise of
                  any outstanding security or any issuance where the Company's
                  shareholders are treated equally such as a subdivision,
                  amalgamation or reorganization.
