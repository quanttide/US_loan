in arrears in accordance with Section 4.2.

the Loan and the outstanding amount of other Liabilities monthly in arrears in
cash on each Interest Payment Date.

4.3  DEFAULT RATE OF INTEREST.

payable on demand by the Lender.

Interest hereunder shall be determined daily and compounded monthly not in
advance, both before and after demand, default and judgment and shall be
computed on the actual number of days elapsed over a year of three hundred and
sixty-five (365) days. For the purpose of the INTEREST ACT (Canada) only, the
yearly rates of interest to which the rates applicable to the Loan are
equivalent are the rates so determined, multiplied by the actual number of days
in the year divided by three hundred and sixty-five (365) or three hundred and
sixty-six (366), as the case may be.

4.5  MAXIMUM INTEREST.

It is the intent of the parties that the rate of interest and the other charges
to the Borrower under this Agreement shall be lawful; therefore, if for any
reason the interest or other charges payable under this Agreement are found by a
court of competent jurisdiction, in a final determination, to exceed the limit
which the Lender may lawfully charge the Borrower, then the obligation to pay
interest and other charges shall automatically be reduced with retroactive
effect to such limit and, if any amount in excess of such limit shall have been
paid, then such amount shall be refunded to the Borrower.

4.6  CLOSING FEE.

The Borrower shall pay to the Lender a financing fee equal to $100,000, (of
which $50,000 has already been paid to the Lender) which fee shall be fully

payment and the Closing Date.

          loans by, or other credit extended by, or any other acquisition of
          funds by, any office of the Lender;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to materially increase the cost to the
Lender of agreeing to make, making, continuing or maintaining or participating
in the Loan, or to materially reduce any amount receivable thereunder or to
materially increase the withholding taxes payable then, in any such case, the
Borrower shall pay the Lender, after demand by such Lender, any additional

          participant with the Lender in the Loan for any purpose (whether for
          safekeeping, deposit, collection, custody, pledge, transmission or
          otherwise);

     (f)  all real, immovable and leasehold property of the Borrower and all
          easements, rights-of-ways, privileges, benefits, licences,
          improvements and rights of the Borrower whether connected therewith or
          appurtenant thereto or separately owned or held, including without
          limitation, all structures, plants and other fixtures now owned or
          hereafter owned or acquired; and

     (g)  all additions and accessions to, substitutions for, and replacements,
          products and proceeds of the foregoing property, including, without
          limitation, proceeds of all insurance policies insuring the foregoing
          property, and all of the Borrower's books and records relating to any
          of the foregoing and to the Borrower's business.

7.2  PRESERVATION OF COLLATERAL AND PERFECTION OF SECURITY INTERESTS THEREIN.

The Borrower shall, at the Lender's request and at the Borrower's expense, at
any time and from time to time, execute and deliver to the Lender such financing
statements, documents and other agreements and instruments (and the Borrower
shall pay the cost of filing or recording the same in all public offices deemed
reasonably necessary or desirable by the Lender) and do such other acts and
things as the Lender may deem necessary or desirable in order to establish and
maintain a valid, attached and perfected security interest in the Collateral in
favour of the Lender (free and clear of all other Liens except Permitted Liens)
to secure payment of the Liabilities, and in order to facilitate the collection
of the Collateral, the Borrower irrevocably hereby makes, constitutes and
appoints the Lender (and all Persons designated by such Lender for that purpose)
as the Borrower's true and lawful attorney and agent to execute such financing
statements, documents and other agreements and instruments and do such other
acts and things as may be necessary to preserve and perfect the Security
Interest of the Lender or such Lender in the Collateral to the extent that the
Borrower does not do so after request by the Lender or such Lender or after an
Event of Default.

                                     -17-

<Page>

7.3  POSSESSION OF COLLATERAL AND RELATED MATTERS.

Until an Event of Default has occurred, the Borrower shall have the right,
except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, in the ordinary course of the
Borrower's business, to:

     (a)  sell or furnish under contracts of supply or service any of the
          Borrower's Inventory normally held by the Borrower for any such
          purpose; and

     (b)  use and consume any raw materials, work in process or other materials
          normally held by the Borrower for such purpose;

provided however that a sale in the ordinary course of business shall not
include any transfer or sale in satisfaction, partial or complete, of a debt
owed by the Borrower, or a transfer, sale or other disposition to any Parent,
Subsidiary, Affiliate or shareholder of the Borrower, or to any other Person in
whom the Borrower holds any interest or any other related party, which is at a
price or on terms more favourable to the recipient than would be given to an
unrelated party.

7.4  COLLECTIONS.

     (a)  The Lender may, at any time and from time to time after the occurrence
          of an Event of Default which is continuing, in addition to the
          remedies set out in Section 13.1, whether before or after notification
          to any Account Debtor and whether before or after the maturity of any
          of the Liabilities:

          (i)  enforce collection of any of the Borrower's Accounts or contract
               rights by suit or otherwise;

          (ii) exercise all of the Borrower's rights and remedies with respect
               to proceedings brought to collect any of the Borrower's Accounts;

          (iii) surrender, release or exchange all or any part of any Accounts
               of the Borrower, or compromise or extend or renew for any period
               (whether or not longer than the original period) any indebtedness
               thereunder;

          (iv) sell or assign any Account of the Borrower upon such terms, for
               such amount and at such time or times as the Lender deems
               advisable;

          (v)  prepare, file and sign any of the Borrower's names on any proof
               of claim in bankruptcy or other similar document against any
               Account Debtor indebted on an Account of the Borrower; and

          (vi) do all other acts and things which are necessary, in the Lender's
               sole discretion, to fulfil the Borrower's obligations under this
               Agreement and the Other Agreements and to allow the Lender to
               collect the Accounts. In addition to any other provision hereof,
               the Lender may at any time on or after the occurrence of an Event
               of Default which is continuing, at the Borrower's expense, notify
               any parties obligated on any of the Accounts

                                     -18-

<Page>

               of the Borrower to make payment directly to the Lender of any
               amounts due or to become due thereunder.

     (b)  The Lender shall, upon receipt by it of cash or other immediately
          available funds from collections of items of payment and proceeds of
          any Collateral, apply the whole or any part of such collections or
          proceeds against the Liabilities in such order as the Lender shall
          determine in its sole discretion, subject to the terms of this
          Agreement.

     (c)  In its sole credit judgment, without waiving or releasing any
          obligation, liability or duty of the Borrower under this Agreement or
          the Other Agreements or any Default, at any time or times hereafter,
          the Lender may (but shall not be obligated to) pay, acquire or accept
          an assignment of any security interest, hypothec, lien, encumbrance or
          claim asserted by any Person in, upon or against the Collateral. All
          sums paid by the Lender in respect thereof and all costs, fees and
          expenses (including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
          disbursements (on a solicitor-client basis) for both inside and
          outside counsel, all court costs and all other charges relating
          thereto) incurred by the Lender shall constitute Liabilities, payable
          by the Borrower on demand and, until paid, shall bear interest at the
          Deemed Interest Rate.

     (d)  Immediately upon the Borrower's receipt of any portion of the
          Collateral consisting of an Instrument, Document of Title or Chattel
          Paper, the Borrower shall, at the Lender's request, deliver the
          original thereof to the Lender together with an appropriate
          endorsement or other specific evidence of assignment thereof to the
          Lender (in form and substance acceptable to the Lender). If an
          endorsement or assignment of any such items shall not be made for any
          reason, the Lender is hereby irrevocably authorized, as the attorney
          and agent of the Borrower, to endorse or assign the same on such
          Person's behalf.

7.5 ATTACHMENT.

The Borrower acknowledges and agrees that (i) value has been given, (ii) the
Borrower has rights in the Collateral, and (iii) the Security Interest shall
attach to existing Collateral upon execution of this Agreement by the Borrower
and to each item of after-acquired Collateral at the time that the Borrower
acquires any rights therein.

7.6  EXCEPTION RE LEASEHOLD INTERESTS AND CONTRACTUAL RIGHTS.

The last day of the term of any lease, sublease or agreement therefore is
specifically excepted from the Security Interest, but the Borrower agrees to
stand possessed of such last day in trust for any Person acquiring such interest
of the Borrower. To the extent that the creation of the Security Interest would
constitute a breach or cause the acceleration of any agreement, right, licence
or permit to which the Borrower is a party, the Security Interest shall not
attach thereto, but the Borrower shall hold its interest therein in trust for
the Lender, and the Security Interest shall attach to such agreement, right,
license or permit forthwith upon obtaining the consent of the other party
thereto.

          standing in all jurisdictions where the nature and extent of the
          business transacted by it or the ownership of its Property makes such
          qualification necessary (except for such jurisdictions in which the
          failure to so qualify would not have a Material Adverse Effect) and
          has all requisite power and authority to own or lease its property and
          to carry on its business.

     (b)  each Obligor has the right and power and is duly authorized and
          empowered to enter into, execute and deliver this Agreement and the
          Other Agreements to which it is a party and perform its respective
          obligations hereunder and thereunder; each Obligor's execution,
          delivery and performance of this Agreement and the Other Agreements to
          which it is a party does not and shall not:

          (i)  conflict with, or constitute a violation or breach of or

          (ii) conflict with, or constitute a violation or breach of or
               constitute a default, except where such conflict, violation,

               any mortgage, indenture, lease, Lien, instrument, agreement,
               contract or other document which may now or hereafter be binding
               on such Obligor; or

          (iii) conflict with, or constitute a violation or breach of or
               constitute a default under the certificate or articles of
               incorporation, amendment, continuation or amalgamation, by-laws,

               shareholders' agreement affecting such Obligor or its property
               (or declaration having like effect); and such Obligor's
               execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement and the
               Other Agreements to which it is a party shall not result in the
               imposition of any Lien upon any of its property under any
               existing indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan or credit
               agreement or other agreement or instrument by which such Obligor
               or any of their property may be bound or affected other than

     (c)  this Agreement and the Other Agreements to which each Obligor is a
          party are legal, valid and binding obligations of each such Obligor,
          and are enforceable against each such Obligor, as the case may be, in
          accordance with their respective terms, except to the extent that such
          enforceability may be limited by applicable

                                     -20-

          bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium and similar laws
          affecting the rights of creditors generally and general equitable
          principles;

     (d)  each of the Obligors has obtained and holds all applicable licenses,
          authorizations, approvals and permits, the lack of which would have a
          Material Adverse Effect, and each of the Obligors is and shall remain
          in compliance in all material respects with all applicable federal,
          provincial, state, local and foreign statutes, orders, regulations,
          rules and ordinances (including, without limitation, statutes, orders,
          regulations, rules and ordinances relating to taxes, employer and
          employee contributions and similar items, securities, employee
          retirement and welfare benefits, employee health and safety or
          environmental matters), the failure to comply with which could have a
          Material Adverse Effect;

     (e)  each of the Obligors possesses, and shall continue to possess,
          adequate licenses, patents, patent applications, copyrights, service
          marks, trademarks, trademark applications, tradestyles and tradenames
          to continue to conduct its business as heretofore conducted by it,
          details of all of which are described on Schedule 8.1(e);

     (f)  each of the Obligors' current and prior names, tradenames and division
          names are described on Schedule 8.1(f); the Borrower shall notify the

          Obligors' name or the use of any tradenames or division names not
          previously disclosed to the Lender in writing;

     (g)  Schedule 8.1(g) is a correct and complete list of all Affiliates and
          divisions of the Borrower setting out the relationships to the

          nor such Affiliates and divisions are engaged in any joint venture or
          partnership with any other Person, and Schedule 8.1(g) provides a
          correct description of all such partnerships and joint ventures;

     (h)  The authorized and issued capital stock of each of the Obligors and
          the registered and beneficial holders thereof are correctly and
          completely described in Schedule 8.1(h);

     (i)  except as described in Schedule 8.1(i), to the best of the Borrower's
          knowledge after due inquiry, there are no actions, suits,
          counterclaims or proceedings which are pending or threatened against
          any Obligor which are likely to be adversely determined and if
          adversely determined would have a Material Adverse Effect, and the
          Borrower shall, promptly, upon becoming aware of any such pending or
          threatened action or proceeding, give written notice thereof to the
          Lender;

     (j)  to the best of the Borrower's knowledge after due inquiry none of the
          Obligors is in default under any material contract, lease or
          commitment to which it is a party or by which it is bound, nor does
          the Borrower know of any dispute regarding any contract, lease or
          commitment which is material to its continued financial success and
          well-being. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, none of
          the Obligors is in arrears in respect of any material lease, rental or
          other payment due

                                     -21-

          under any real (or immovable) property lease or to any warehousemen,
          bailee or similar Person;

     (k)  the provisions of the Security Agreement creates legal and valid Liens
          on all of the Collateral in favour of the Lender and, when all proper
          filings, recordings, and other actions necessary to perfect such Liens
          have been made or taken by or on behalf of the Lender, such Liens will
          constitute perfected, duly registered, and continuing Liens on all the
          Collateral having priority over all other Liens on the Collateral
          (except Permitted Liens) and all claims of other creditors, securing
          all of the Liabilities and enforceable against the Obligors and all
          third parties in accordance with their terms;

     (l)  no security agreement, financing statement or analogous instrument
          exists as at the Closing Date with respect to any of the Collateral
          other than any security agreement, financing statement or analogous
          instrument evidencing Permitted Liens;

     (m)  each of the Obligors is the lawful owner of all Collateral now
          purportedly owned or hereafter purportedly acquired by it, free from
          all Liens, whether voluntarily or involuntarily created and whether or
          not perfected, other than Permitted Liens;

     (n)  the financial statements delivered or to be delivered to the Lender at
          or prior to the date of this Agreement accurately reflect the
          financial condition of the Obligors and since the date such financial
          statements were most recently delivered to the Lender prior to the
          date of this Agreement, no event or condition has occurred which would
          have, a Material Adverse Effect;

     (o)  the Borrower is not obligated, whether directly or indirectly, for any
          loans or other indebtedness or liability (contingent or otherwise)
          other than:

          (i)  the Liabilities;

          (ii) the GEIPP Loan;

          (iii) the indebtedness disclosed to the Lender on Schedule 8.1(o);

          (iv) unsecured indebtedness to trade creditors arising in the ordinary
               course of the Borrower's business;

          (v)  unsecured indebtedness arising from the endorsement of drafts and
               other instruments for collection, in the ordinary course of the
               Borrower's business; and

          (vi) other indebtedness permitted under Section 10.1(k);

          No Obligor is in arrears in payment of any amount to any governmental
          body or agency including, without limitation, amounts owing or to be
          remitted with respect to employee withholdings for income tax,
          unemployment insurance

          provincial sales taxes.

     (p)  each Obligor is solvent, is able to pay its debts as they become due
          and has capital sufficient to carry on its business; each Obligor now
          owns property having a value both at fair valuation and at present
          fair saleable value greater than the amount required to pay its debts,
          and will not be rendered insolvent by the execution and delivery of
          this Agreement or any of the Other Agreements to which it is a party
          or by completion of the transactions contemplated hereunder or
          thereunder including, without limitation, the making and incurring of
          the Loan;

     (q)  no Obligor owns any margin securities, and none of the proceeds of the
          Loan hereunder shall be used for the purpose of purchasing or carrying

          indebtedness which was originally incurred to purchase any margin
          securities;

     (r)  the offices where each Obligor keeps its respective books, records and
          accounts (or copies thereof) concerning the Collateral, each Obligor's

          business, locations of Collateral and post office boxes are as set
          forth in Schedule 1.1(2). The Borrower shall promptly (but in no event
          less than ten (10) days prior thereto) advise the Lender in writing of
          the proposed opening of any new place of business of any Obligor, the
          closing of any existing place of business of any Obligor, any change
          in the location of any Obligors' books, records and accounts (or
          copies thereof) or the opening or closing of any post office box of
          any Obligor;

     (s)  the Collateral is and shall be kept, or, in the case of vehicles,
          based, only at the addresses set forth on the first page of this
          Agreement or on Schedule 1.1(2); Schedule 1.1(2) hereto contains a
          correct and complete list of all real or immovable property owned by
          the Obligors, all leases and subleases of real or immovable property
          by the Obligors, as lessee or sublessee, and all leases and subleases
          of real or immovable property by the Obligors as lessor or sublessor;
          and each of such leases or subleases is valid and enforceable in
          accordance with its terms and is in full force and effect, and no
          default by any Obligor, or to the knowledge of the Borrower, by any
          other party to such leases or subleases exists;

     (t)  if any of the Collateral consists of goods of a type normally used in
          more than one jurisdiction, whether or not actually so used, the
          Borrower shall immediately give written notice to the Lender of any
          use of any such goods in any jurisdiction other than a jurisdiction in
          which the Borrower has previously advised the Lender such goods shall
          be used, and such goods shall not, unless the Lender shall otherwise
          consent in writing, be used outside of such jurisdiction so advised;

     (u)  each Obligor has complied in all material respects with all
          Environmental Laws applicable to the construction and operation of its
          Properties and businesses; to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, no
          Obligor has any material contingent liability with respect to
          non-compliance with Environmental Laws or the

                                     -23-

          wastes or substances; no Obligor has received any Action Request,
          Violation Notice, summons, complaint, order or other notice that it is
          not in compliance with, or that any governmental or regulatory
          authority is investigating its compliance with, Environmental Laws;
          and without limiting the generality of the foregoing:

          (i)  the Borrower has no knowledge or reason to believe that
               operations or any Property of or occupied by any Obligor or in
               any Obligor's charge, management or control are not in compliance
               in all material respects with all applicable Environmental Laws
               and each of its Properties is free:

               A.   from contamination by, and there has not been thereon a
                    release, discharge or emission of, any hazardous substance,
                    gas or liquid or any other substance, gas or liquid which is
                    prohibited, controlled or regulated under any Environmental
                    Law; and

                    dumps;

          (ii) no Obligor, nor to the best of the Borrower's knowledge after due
               inquiry, any predecessor of any Obligor, has filed any notice, or
               received notice, under any federal, provincial, state or local
               law, including any Environmental Law, indicating past or present
               treatment, storage or disposal of a Material of Environmental
               Concern or reporting a spill or release of a Material of
               Environmental Concern into the environment;

          (iii) no Obligor has any contingent liability of which the Borrower
               has knowledge or reasonably should have knowledge in connection
               with any release of any Material of Environmental Concern;

          (iv) no Obligor generates, transports, treats or disposes of any
               Material of Environmental Concern in any manner which is not in
               compliance in all material respects with all applicable
               Environmental Laws; and

          (v)  to the best of the Borrower's knowledge, after due inquiry, no

               Equipment in good operating condition and repair;

          (ii) such Obligor has not permitted and the Borrower shall not permit
               any Equipment to become a fixture to real or immovable property

               to the extent that

                                     -24-

<Page>

               any such item has become a fixture to real or immovable property
               or an accession to other personal or movable property by
               operation of law without first assuring that the Lender's Liens
               on any such item is prior to any interest or Lien then held or
               thereafter acquired by any mortgagee or hypothecary creditor of
               such real or immovable property (other than the the Lender) or
               the owner or purchaser of any interest in such real or immovable
               property or the owner or purchaser of any such accession;

               threatened strike, work stoppage, material unfair labour practice
               claims, or other material labour dispute against or affecting any
               Obligor or its employees;

          (ii) there are no controversies pending or threatened between each
               Obligor and any of its employees, other than employee grievances
               arising in the ordinary course of business which are not, in the
               aggregate, material to the continued financial success and
               well-being of such Obligor; and

          (iii) each Obligor is in compliance in all material respects with all
               federal, provincial, state and local laws respecting employment
               and employment terms, conditions and practices, except where the

          as a participating employer in any Plan which is a registered pension
          plan or withdrawn from any Plan in a complete or partial withdrawal,
          nor has a condition occurred which if continued would result in a
          complete or partial withdrawal;

          due, are properly reflected in the applicable Obligor's books and
          records;

          either Obligor to the Lender is and shall be true, correct and
          complete in all material respects as of the date with respect to which
          such information was or is furnished (except for

                                     -25-

          with the negotiation of the transactions contemplated by this
          Agreement contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
          state any material fact necessary to make any such statement or
          representation not misleading to a prospective lender seeking full
          information as to the Obligors and each of their properties,
          businesses and affairs.

8.2  SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

The Borrower represents, warrants and covenants that all representations,
warranties and covenants of the Borrower contained in this Agreement (whether
appearing in ARTICLE 8 and ARTICLE 10 hereof or elsewhere) shall be true,
correct and complete at the time of the Borrower's execution of this Agreement,
shall survive the execution, delivery and acceptance hereof by the parties
hereto and the closing of the transactions described herein or related hereto,
shall, except for representations and warranties that relate solely to an
earlier date, remain true, correct and complete until the repayment in full of
all of the Liabilities and termination of this Agreement.

                       ARTICLE 9 - SCHEDULES AND REPORTS

          the Lender.

9.2  COMPLIANCE CERTIFICATE.

With each financial statement delivered pursuant to Section 9.1, the Borrower
shall deliver to the Lender a certificate substantially in the form of Schedule
9.2 hereto, of the president and chief financial officer of the Borrower setting
forth in reasonable detail the calculations required to establish that the
Borrower was in compliance with the covenants set forth in Section 10.1 during
the period covered in such financial statements and as at the end thereof and
stating that, except as explained in reasonable detail in such certificate:

     (a)  all of the representations and warranties of the Borrower contained in
          this Agreement and of the Obligors in the Other Agreements are true,
          correct and complete as of the date of such certificate as if made at
          such time;

     (b)  at the date of such certificate, the Borrower is in compliance with

representative of the Borrower, and shall be in such form and contain such
information as the Lender shall in its sole discretion request. The Lender,
through its officers, employees or agents, shall have the right, at any time and
from time to time in the Lender's name, in the name of a nominee of the Lender
or in the Borrower's name, to verify the validity, amount or any other matter
relating to any of the Borrower's Accounts, by mail, telephone, telegraph or
otherwise. The Borrower shall reimburse the Lender, on demand, for all
reasonable receipted costs, fees and expenses incurred by the Lender in this

                             ARTICLE 10 - COVENANTS

10.1 COVENANTS.

Until payment or satisfaction in full of all Liabilities and termination of this
Agreement, unless the Borrower obtains the prior written consent of the Lender
waiving or modifying any covenants hereunder in any specific instance, the
Borrower covenants and agrees as follows:

     (a)  each Obligor shall at all times keep accurate and complete books,
          records and accounts with respect to all of its business activities,
          in accordance with sound accounting practices and GAAP consistently
          applied, and shall keep such books, records and accounts, and any
          copies thereof, only at the addresses indicated for such purpose on
          Schedule 1.1(2);

     (b)  the Borrower shall advise the Lender in writing of any Material
          Adverse Effect or the occurrence of any Default within one day of its
          becoming aware of such Material Adverse Effect or Default;

     (c)  the Lender or any Persons designated by the Lender, shall have the
          right, on prior notice at any reasonable time (and at any time without
          the need for prior notice when the Lender has reasonable grounds for
          believing that a Default exists), including, without limitation, to
          call at any of the Obligor's places of business or at any warehouse,
          storage facility or other location where property of any Obligor may
          be located at any reasonable times, and, without hindrance or delay,
          to inspect the Collateral and to inspect, audit, check and make
          extracts from the Obligors' books, records, journals, orders, receipts
          and any correspondence and other data relating to the Obligors'
          business, the Collateral or any transactions between the parties
          hereto, and shall have the right to make such verification concerning
          the Obligors' business as the Lender may consider reasonable under the
          circumstances. The Borrower shall furnish to the Lender such
          information relevant to the Lender's rights under this Agreement
          (including without limitation information on sales, receivables,
          collections, accounts payable and inventory aging) as the Lender shall
          at any time and from time to time, in its sole discretion, request.
          The Lender is authorized to discuss the affairs, finances and business
          of the Obligors with any officers or directors of the Obligors or any
          Affiliate of the Obligors, or with those employees of the Obligor with
          whom the Lender has determined in its commercially reasonable judgment
          to be necessary or desirable to converse, and to discuss the financial
          condition of the Obligor with the independent chartered accountants of
          each Obligor. Any such discussions shall be without liability to the
          Lender or to such accountants. The Borrower shall pay to or reimburse
          the Lender for all reasonable fees, costs, and out-of-pocket expenses
          incurred by the Lender in the exercise of their rights hereunder and
          all of such costs, fees and expenses shall be payable on demand and,
          until paid, shall bear interest at the Deemed Interest Rate.

     (d)  Each Obligor shall keep the Collateral properly housed and insured
          against such risks (including, without limitation, business
          interruption) and in such amounts as

                                     -28-

<Page>

          are customarily insured against by Persons engaged in businesses
          similar to that of the Borrower with such companies, in such amounts
          and under policies in such form as shall be reasonably satisfactory to
          the Lender. Originals or certified copies of such policies of
          insurance have been delivered to the Lender together with evidence of
          payment of all premiums therefor, and contain, INTER ALIA, an
          endorsement, in form and substance acceptable to the Lender, showing
          loss under such insurance policies payable to the Lender as its
          interest may appear. Such endorsement, the other terms of the said
          policies, or an independent instrument furnished to the Lender, shall
          provide that the insurance company shall give the Lender at least
          thirty (30) days' prior written notice before any such policy of
          insurance is altered or cancelled and includes a standard mortgage
          clause providing, INTER ALIA, that no act, whether wilful or
          negligent, or default of the Borrower or any other Person shall affect
          the right of the Lender to recover under such policy of insurance in
          case of loss or damage. All insurers are directed and shall be
          directed under such policies of insurance to pay all proceeds payable
          thereunder directly to the Lender to apply to the Liabilities as the
          Lender elects in its sole discretion. So long as no Event of Default
          has occurred, the Lender shall pay any such proceeds received to the
          Borrower on the Borrower's request only if such proceeds are used by
          the Borrower to repair or replace lost or damaged property of an
          Obligor as approved by the Lender. The Lender (and all officers,
          employees or agents designated by the Lender) is irrevocably made,
          constituted and appointed as the Borrower's true and lawful attorney
          (and agent) for the purpose of making, settling and adjusting claims
          under such policies of insurance, endorsing the names of any Obligor
          on any cheque, draft, instrument or other item of payment for the
          proceeds of such policies of insurance and making all determinations
          and decisions with respect to such policies of insurance; provided
          however that the Lender shall exercise such rights only upon and
          following and during the occurrence of an Event of Default;

     (e)  each Obligor shall maintain, at its expense, such public liability and
          third party property damage insurance as is customary for Persons
          engaged in businesses similar to that of such Obligor with such
          companies and in such amounts, with such deductibles and under
          policies in such form as shall be satisfactory to the Lender and
          originals or certified copies of such policies have been delivered to
          the Lender together with evidence of payment of all premiums therefor;
          each such policy shall contain an endorsement showing the Lender as
          additional insured thereunder and providing that the insurance company
          shall give the Lender at least thirty (30) days' written notice before
          any such policy shall be altered or cancelled;

     (f)  if any Obligor at any time or times hereafter fails to obtain or
          maintain any of the policies of insurance required above or to pay any
          premium in whole or in part relating thereto, then the Lender, without
          waiving or releasing any obligation or default by the Borrower
          hereunder, may (but shall be under no obligation to) obtain and
          maintain such policies of insurance and pay such premiums and take
          such other actions with respect thereto as the Lender, in its sole
          discretion, deems advisable. All sums disbursed by the Lender in
          connection with any such actions,

                                     -29-

<Page>

          including, without limitation, court costs, expenses, other charges
          relating thereto and reasonable legal fees and disbursements (on a
          solicitor-client basis), shall constitute Liabilities hereunder and,
          until paid, shall bear interest at the Deemed Interest Rate;

     (g)  no Obligor shall use the Collateral, or any part thereof, in any
          unlawful business or for any unlawful purpose or use or maintain any
          of the Collateral in any manner that does or could result in material
          damage to the environment or a violation of any applicable
          Environmental Laws; the Obligors shall keep the Collateral in good
          condition, repair and order, ordinary wear and tear excepted; no
          Obligor shall permit the Collateral, or any part thereof, to be levied
          upon under execution, attachment, distraint or other legal process; no
          Obligor shall sell, lease, grant a security interest in or otherwise
          dispose of any of the Collateral except as expressly permitted by this
          Agreement; no Obligor shall secrete or abandon any of the Collateral,
          or remove or permit removal of any of the Collateral from any of the
          locations listed on Schedule 1.1(2), except for the removal of the
          Obligors' Inventory sold in the ordinary course of the Obligors'
          business as permitted herein, the removal of motor vehicles in the
          ordinary course of business, and the removal of the Obligors'
          Equipment if the purpose of such removal or sales permitted hereunder
          is the repair or replacement of any such Equipment which requires
          repair;

     (h)  the Loan will be used by the Borrower only in the financing of
          additional Borrower locations and in the refurbishing of existing
          locations and to pay the costs, fees, disbursements and expenses (and
          taxes on them) in connection with this Agreement and the Other
          Agreements;

     (i)  each Obligor shall, at the request of the Lender, acting reasonably,
          indicate on its records concerning the Collateral a notation, in form
          satisfactory to the Lender, of the Security Interest granted to the
          Lender by the Security Agreements, and no Obligor shall maintain
          duplicates or copies of such records at any address other than the
          Borrower's principal places of business set forth on Schedule 1.1(2);
          provided, however, that the Obligors, in the ordinary course of their
          businesses, may furnish copies of such records to accountants, legal
          counsel and other agents or advisors as they may reasonably determine
          to be necessary or desirable;

     (j)  each Obligor shall file all required tax returns and pay all of its
          taxes when due, including, without limitation, taxes imposed by
          federal, provincial, state or municipal agencies; provided that an
          Obligor shall have the right to contest the payment of such taxes in
          good faith by appropriate proceedings so long as:

          (i)  the amount so contested is shown on such Obligor's (and the
               Borrower's consolidated) financial statements;

          (ii) the contesting of any such payment does not give rise to a Lien
               for taxes or, if such contesting does give rise to a Lien for
               taxes, a reserve or other appropriate provision, if any, as shall
               be required by GAAP shall have

                                     -30-

<Page>

               been made therefor on such Obligor's (and the Borrower's
               consolidated) financial statements and a stay of enforcement of
               such Lien is in effect; and

         (iii) upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Borrower keeps
               on deposit with the Lender (such deposit to be held without
               interest) an amount of money which, in the sole judgment of the
               Lender, is sufficient to pay such taxes and any interest or
               penalties that may accrue thereon.

               If such Obligor fails to prosecute such contest with reasonable
               diligence, the Lender may apply the money so deposited in payment
               of such taxes. If such Obligor fails to pay any such taxes, in
               the absence of any such contest by such Obligor, the Lender, in
               its sole discretion, may (but shall be under no obligation to)
               advance and pay any sums required to pay any such taxes and/or to
               secure the release of any Lien therefor, and any sums so advanced
               by the Lender shall constitute Liabilities hereunder, shall be
               payable by the Borrower to the Lender on demand, and, until paid,
               shall bear interest at the Deemed Interest Rate;

     (k)  no Obligor shall without the prior written consent of the Lender:

          (i)  incur, create, assume or suffer to exist any Funded Debt, Current
               Debt or other indebtedness other than:

               A.   indebtedness arising under this Agreement;

               B.   unsecured indebtedness owing in the ordinary course of
                    business to trade suppliers;

               C.   any other indebtedness described in Schedule 8.1(o) hereof,
                    subject to all other applicable limitations set out in this
                    Agreement;

               D.   any indebtedness permitted under subsection (v) of the
                    definition of "Permitted Liens", subject to all other
                    applicable limitations set out in this Agreement and without
                    duplicating Section 10.1(k)(i)(C);

               E.   capital lease obligations in an aggregate amount not to
                    exceed Fifty Thousand Canadian Dollars per annum (Cdn.
                    $50,000); and

               F.   indebtedness not falling into subsections 10.1(k)(A) through
                    (e), above the aggregate outstanding principal amount of
                    which does not exceed ten thousand Canadian dollars (Cdn.
                    $10,000).

          (ii) except where the Lender have given its prior written approval,
               assume, guarantee or endorse, or otherwise become liable in
               connection with, the obligations of any Person, except by

          against such Obligor, such proceeding is not being contested in good
          faith by appropriate proceedings, as determined by the Lender, acting

          obligations under the Security Agreement;

     (j)  any loss, theft, damage or destruction of any item or items of
          Collateral occurs which:

          (i)  materially and adversely affects the operation of the Borrower's

               dollars ($10,000) (or the Equivalent thereof in U.S. dollars)
               executed or delivered by the Borrower, or pursuant to which
               agreement or instrument the Borrower or its properties is or may
               be bound, or if any such indebtedness shall be declared due and
               payable prior to the stated maturity thereof or if the Borrower
               otherwise defaults in the performance of any material term or
               condition contained in any document relating to a Permitted Lien;

          (l)  any condition exists in connection with any Plan which might

          (m)  the occurrence of any event or condition (including, without
               limitation, any change in the operation of business or senior

                             ARTICLE 13 - REMEDIES

13.1 REMEDIES.

Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default described in Section 12.1(e), all of
the Liabilities shall immediately and automatically become due and payable,
without demand, notice or legal process of any kind. Upon the occurrence of any
Event of Default (other than as described in Section 12.1(e)), all of the
Liabilities may, at the option of the Lender, be declared by the Lender to be
immediately due and payable, upon which declaration all such Liabilities shall
immediately become due and payable without demand, notice or legal process of
any kind. Upon any such occurrence, the Lender may, in addition to any other
right or remedy which they may have at law or in equity, proceed to realize its
security hereunder and to enforce its rights by:

     (a)  entry onto any premise where the Collateral may be located;

     (b)  the appointment by instrument in writing of a receiver or receivers of
          the Collateral or any part thereof (which receiver or receivers may be
          any person or persons, whether an officer or officers or employee or
          employees of either Lender or not and the Lender may remove any
          receiver or receivers so appointed and appoint another or others in
          his or their stead);

     (c)  proceedings in any court of competent jurisdiction for the appointment
          of a receiver or receivers or for sale of the Collateral or any part
          thereof; or

     (d)  any other action, suit, remedy or proceeding authorized or permitted
          hereby or by law or by equity.

In addition, the Lender may file such proofs of claim and other documents as may
be necessary or advisable in order to have its claim lodged in any bankruptcy,
winding-up or other judicial proceedings.

Any receiver or receivers so appointed shall have power to:

          (i)  take possession of and to use the Collateral or any part thereof;

          (ii) carry on the business of the Borrower (including, but not limited
               to, the taking or defending of any actions or legal proceedings,
               and the doing or refraining from doing all other things as to the
               receiver may deem necessary or desirable in connection with the
               business, operations and affairs of the Borrower);

         (iii) borrow money required for the maintenance, preservation or
               protection of the Collateral or any part thereof or the carrying
               on of the business of the Borrower;

          (iv) further charge the Collateral in priority to the security
               interests of the Security Agreements as security for money so
               borrowed; and

                                     -42-

<Page>

          (v)  sell, lease or otherwise dispose of the whole or any part of the
               Collateral on such terms and conditions and in such manner as the
               receiver shall determine.

The Lender shall not be responsible for any actions or errors of omission by the
receiver or receivers in exercising any such powers.

In addition, the Lender may enter upon, use, occupy and possess the Collateral
or any part thereof, free from all encumbrances, Liens and charges, except for
Permitted Liens, without hindrance, interruption or denial of the same by the
Borrower or by any other person or persons, and may lease or sell the whole or
any part or parts of the Collateral. Any sale hereunder may be made by public
auction, by public tender or by private contract, with or without notice and
with or without advertising and without any other formality (except as required
by law), all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower. Such sale shall be on
such terms and conditions as to credit or otherwise and as to upset or reserve
bid or price as to the Lender, in its sole discretion, may seem advantageous.
Such sale may take place whether or not the Lender has taken possession of the
Collateral.

No remedy for the realization of the security interests granted to the Lender or
for the enforcement of the rights of the Lender shall be exclusive of or
dependent on any other such remedy, but any one or more of such remedies may
from time to time be exercised independently or in combination. Any failure by
the Lender to exercise any right or remedy set out in this Agreement or the
Other Agreements shall not constitute a waiver thereof. The term "receiver" as
used in this Agreement includes a receiver and manager.

At the Lender's request, the Borrower shall, at the Borrower's expense, assemble
the Collateral and make it available to the Lender at one or more places to be
designated by the Lender and reasonably convenient to the Lender. The Borrower
recognizes that if it fails to perform, observe or discharge any of their
obligations under this Agreement or the Other Agreements, no remedy at law will
provide adequate relief to the Lender, and the Borrower agrees that the Lender
shall be entitled to temporary and permanent injunctive relief in any such case
without the necessity of proving actual damages. Without limiting any of the
Lender's rights to provide any lesser period of notice to the extent permitted
by applicable law, any notification of intended disposition of any of the
Collateral required by law will be deemed reasonably and properly given if given
at least fifteen (15) calendar days before such disposition. Any proceeds of any
disposition by the Lender of any of the Collateral may be applied by the Lender
to the payment of expenses and any borrowings in connection with the Collateral
and its realization including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and
disbursements (on a solicitor-client basis) (both in-house and outside counsel)
and any balance of such proceeds may be applied by the Lender toward the payment
of such of the Liabilities, and in such order of application, as the Lender may
from time to time elect or re-elect in its sole discretion.

                       ARTICLE 14 - INDEMNIFICATION, ETC.

14.1 GENERAL INDEMNITY.

The Borrower agrees to defend (with counsel satisfactory to the Lender),
protect, indemnify and hold harmless the Lender, and each of its Affiliates, and
Subsidiaries, and its respective officers, directors, employees, legal counsel
and agents (each an "Indemnified Party") from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
claims, costs, expenses and disbursements of any kind or nature (including,
without limitation, the disbursements and the fees (on a solicitor-client basis)
of legal counsel for each Indemnified Party in connection with any
investigative, administrative or judicial proceeding, whether or not the
Indemnified Party shall be designated a party thereto), (collectively, "Losses")
which may be imposed on, incurred by, or asserted against, any Indemnified Party
(whether direct, indirect or consequential and whether based on any federal,
provincial, state or local laws or regulations, including, without limitation,
securities, environmental and commercial laws and regulations, under common law
or in equity, or based on contract or otherwise) in any manner relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any Other Agreement, or any act, event or
transaction related or attendant thereto, the making and/or the management of
the Loan or the use or intended use of the proceeds of the Loan; provided,
however that the Borrower shall have no obligation hereunder to any Indemnified
Party to the extent that such Losses were caused by or resulted from the wilful
misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnified Party. To the extent that the
undertaking to indemnify set forth in the preceding sentence may be
unenforceable against the Borrower because it violates any law or public policy,
the Borrower shall satisfy such undertaking to the maximum extent permitted by
applicable law. Any Losses covered by this indemnity shall be paid to each
Indemnified Party on demand, and, failing prompt payment, shall, together with
interest thereon at the Deemed Interest Rate from the date incurred by each
Indemnified Party until paid in full, be added to the Liabilities and be secured
by the Collateral. The provisions of this Section shall survive the satisfaction
and payment of all Liabilities and the termination of this Agreement.

14.2 TAXES.

All payments made by the Borrower under this Agreement and the Other Agreements
shall be made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on
account of, any present or future income, stamp or other taxes, levies,
assessments, imposts, deductions, charges, or withholdings imposed by any
foreign, federal, provincial, state, local or other jurisdiction or any
governmental agency thereof or political subdivision or taxing authority
therein, excluding taxes imposed on the net income or the capital of the Lender
(all such non-excluded taxes being hereinafter called "Taxes"). If any Taxes are
required to be withheld from any amounts so payable to the Lender hereunder or
under any Other Agreements the amounts so payable shall be increased to the
extent necessary to yield to the recipient (after payment of all Taxes) interest
or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in the amounts
specified in this Agreement or Other Agreement. If the Borrower is required by
law to make any deduction or withholding on account of any Taxes or other amount
from any sum paid or expressed to be payable to either Lender under this
Agreement or any Other Agreement, then: (A) the Borrower shall notify such
Lender of any such requirement or any change in any such requirement as soon as
the Borrower becomes aware of it; (B) the Borrower shall pay any such Taxes or
other amount

                                     -44-

<Page>

before the date on which penalties attached thereto become due and
payable; (C) the sum payable by the Borrower in respect of which the relevant
deduction, withholding or payment is required shall be increased to the extent
necessary to ensure that, after the making of that deduction, withholding or
payment, the recipient receives on the due date and retains (free from any
liability in respect of any such deduction, withholding or payment) a sum equal
to that which it would have received and so retained had no such deduction,
withholding or payment been required or made; and (D) within thirty (30) days
after payment of any sum from which the Borrower is required by law to make any
deduction or withholding, and within thirty (30) days after the due date of
payment of any Taxes or other amount which it is required by clause (B) above to
pay, it shall deliver to such Lender all such certified documents and other
evidence as to the making of such deduction, withholding or payment as (1) are
reasonably satisfactory to such Lender as proof of such deduction, withholding
or payment and of the remittance thereof to the relevant taxing or other
authority and (2) are reasonably required by such Lender to enable it to claim a
tax credit with respect to such deduction, withholding or payment. If the
Borrower fails to pay any Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing authority,
the Borrower shall indemnify such Lender for any incremental taxes, interest or
penalties that may become payable by such Lender as a result of any such
failure. The provisions of this Section shall survive the satisfaction and
payment of all Liabilities and the termination of this Agreement.

                        ARTICLE 15 - GENERAL PROVISIONS

Collateral may be litigated in courts having SITUS within the Province of

in accordance with this paragraph.

This Agreement and the Other Agreements may not be modified, altered or amended

hereby consents to the sale, assignment, transfer or other disposition to a

hereafter, of this Agreement, or the Other Agreements, or of any portion
thereof, or participation therein including, without limitation, the right,
title, interest, remedies, powers and/or duties of the Lender thereunder. The
Borrower agrees that it shall execute and deliver such documents as a Lender may
request in connection with any such sale, assignment, transfer or other
disposition. This Agreement shall enure to the benefit of, and be binding upon,
the parties hereto and their successors and permitted assigns.

15.5 HEADINGS OF SUBDIVISIONS.

The headings of subdivisions in this Agreement are for convenience of reference
only, and shall not govern the interpretation of any of the provisions of this
Agreement.

15.6 POWER OF ATTORNEY.

attorney and agent for the purposes specified in this Agreement is an
appointment coupled with an interest and shall be irrevocable until all of the

15.7 WAIVERS, CONFIDENTIALITY, INFORMATION SHARING.

     (a)  In no event shall the Lender be liable for lost profits or other
          special or consequential damages.

     (b)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives all
          rights to notice and hearing of any kind prior to the exercise by the

          process or to replevy, attach or levy upon such Collateral without
          prior notice or hearing.

     (c)  To the maximum extent permitted by law, the Borrower hereby waives
          demand, presentment, protest and notice of nonpayment.

                                     -46-

     (d)  Failure of the Lender, at any time or times hereafter, to require
          strict performance by the Borrower of any provision of this Agreement
          or any of the Other Agreements shall not waive, affect or diminish any
          right of the Lender thereafter to demand strict compliance and
          performance therewith. Any suspension or waiver by the Lender of a
          Default under this Agreement or any default under any of the Other
          Agreements shall not suspend, waive or affect any other Default under
          this Agreement or any other default under any of the Other Agreements,
          whether the same is prior or subsequent thereto and whether of the
          same or of a different kind or character. No delay on the part of the
          Lender in the exercise of any right or remedy under this Agreement or
          any Other Agreement shall preclude any other or further exercise
          thereof or the exercise of any right or remedy. None of the
          undertakings, agreements, warranties, covenants and representations of
          the Borrower contained in this Agreement or any of the Other
          Agreements and no Default under this Agreement or default under any of
          the Other Agreements shall be deemed to have been suspended or waived
          by the Lender unless such suspension or waiver is in writing, signed
          by duly authorized officer(s) of the applicable Lender and directed to
          the Borrower specifying such suspension or waiver.

     (e)  Borrower hereby agrees and acknowledges that the Lender shall be
          permitted to share with each other and with any of their affiliates,
          any information concerning Borrower, the other Obligors, this
          Agreement and all related agreements, and the subject matter thereof,

requiring such payment arose. Any payment received by such Lender after 3:00

15.9 CURRENCY.

All dollar amounts specified herein are in Canadian dollars unless otherwise
indicated.

15.10 JUDGMENT CURRENCY.

If in the recovery by the Lender of any amount owing hereunder in any currency,
judgment can only be obtained in another currency and because of changes in the
exchange rate of such currencies between the date of judgment and payment in
full of the amount of such judgment, the amount of recovery under the judgment
differs from the full amount owing hereunder, the Borrower shall pay any such
shortfall to the applicable Lender, and such shortfall can be claimed by the
applicable Lender against the Borrower as an alternative or additional cause of
action and any surplus received by the applicable Lender will be repaid to the
Borrower.

15.11 SEVERABILITY.

                                     -47-

<Page>

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be prohibited by or invalid under
applicable law, such provision shall be ineffective only to the extent of such
prohibition or invalidity, without invalidating the remainder of such provision
or remaining provisions of this Agreement.

15.12 CONFLICTS.

In the event there occurs any conflict or inconsistency between any provision
hereof and any provision of the Other Agreements, the provision hereof shall, to
the extent of any such conflict or inconsistency, govern.

15.13 RIGHT OF SET-OFF.

Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, the
Lender is authorized at any time and from time to time, without notice to the
Borrower (any such notice being expressly waived) to the fullest extent
permitted by law to set-off any and all deposits of any kind at any time held to
the credit or for the account of the Borrower, against any of the obligations of
the Borrower hereunder or under any Other Agreement, whether or not the Lender
have made any demand hereunder or thereunder and although such obligations may
be unmatured.

15.14 JOINT AND SEVERAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE OBLIGORS

Since part of the credit advanced by Lender to the Borrower will be advanced by
the Borrower to some or all of the Co-Borrowers to acquire certain assets which
are integral to the consolidated business of the Obligors, the Co-Borrowers have
agreed to be made a party to this Agreement. Accordingly, each of the
Co-Borrowers agrees to be jointly and severally liable for the obligations,
covenants, agreements, representations and warranties of the Obligors set forth
in this Agreement, as principal debtor and obligor and not as surety.
Furthermore, each of the Co-Borrowers agrees that it shall observe, fulfil and
keep and cause the other Obligors to observe, fulfil and keep, as the case may
be, all obligations, covenants, agreements, representations and warranties set
forth in this Agreement.

Each of the Obligors shall for all purposes of this Agreement be regarded and be
in the same position as a principle debtor and obligor and each Obligor-
Borrower expressly waives demand, presentment, protest and notice thereof
respectively and of default and agrees that its liability under this Agreement
shall not in any way be limited or affected by any transaction which may take
place between the Lender and any other Obligor or any neglect or default of the
Lender which might otherwise operate as a discharge, whether partial or
absolute, of any Obligor if it were a surety of the other Obligors. Each Obligor
further agrees that the Lender shall not be bound to exhaust its recourse
against the Borrower or any of the other Co-Borrowers or other parties or any
security which it holds for the payment of the moneys owing under this Agreement
before acquiring payment from such Obligor, and the Lender may enforce the
various remedies available to it and may realize the power of various securities
held by it or any part thereof in such order as the Lender may determine.

                                     -48-

<Page>

No obligation, liability or undertaking whatsoever of, and no security
whatsoever given by, any Obligor under this Agreement or under any agreement,
document or instrument collateral to this Agreement shall be limited or affected
by the granting of time, renewals, extensions, releases or discharges by the
Lender to any Obligor or to any other person whomsoever, or by the acceptance of
compositions by the Lender from any Obligor, or by any dealings whatsoever
between the Lender and any of the Obligors Partnership or any other person
whomsoever, or for any cause or reason for which sureties or joint and several
debtors may be relieved or for which any such obligation, liability, undertaking
or security may be limited or affected. Without restricting the generality of
the foregoing, no such obligation, liability, undertaking or security shall be
limited or affected by the Lender taking, or by the Lender's abstention from
taking or perfecting, or by the Lender giving up any rights, privileges,
mortgages or securities whatsoever.

15.15 ENTIRE AGREEMENT.

This Agreement and the Other Agreements embody the entire agreement and
understanding between the parties hereto and thereto and supersede all prior
agreements and understandings between such parties relating to the subject
matter hereof and thereof and may not be contradicted by evidence of prior or
contemporaneous agreements of the parties. There are no unwritten oral
agreements between the parties related to the subject matter of this Agreement
and the Other Agreements.

15.16 NON-MERGER.

The taking of any judgment shall not operate as a merger of any Liabilities or
any part thereof or in any way suspend payment or affect or prejudice the
rights, remedies and powers, legal or equitable, which the Lender may have in
connection with the Liabilities.
