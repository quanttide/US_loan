               This FIRST AMENDMENT TO THE LIMITED  LIABILITY  COMPANY AGREEMENT
OF TRIPLE NET  IVNESTMENT  COMPANY LLC,  dated as of April 22, 2004, is made and

Company Agreement, dated as of April 22, 2004, by and among LXP, as a member and

               WHEREAS,   pursuant  to  Section  12.12  of  the  Agreement,  the
Agreement may not be amended  without the written consent of all of the Members;
and

               WHEREAS,  the parties  hereto,  constituting  all of the Members,
desire to amend the Agreement in the manner set forth herein.  Unless  otherwise
defined,  all defined  terms used herein shall have such meaning  ascribed  such

               NOW,  THEREFORE,  the Members,  in consideration of the covenants
and  agreements  set forth  herein,  hereby amend the  Partnership  Agreement as
follows.

               1. Amendment to Section 1.1. - Revised  Definitions.  Section 1.1
of the  Agreement is hereby  amended by deleting the  definition  of  "Qualified
Property" or  "Qualified  Properties"  in its entirety and replacing it with new
definition of "Qualified  Property" or "Qualified  Properties," which shall read
as follows:

        "Qualified  Property"  or  "Qualified  Properties"  shall  mean  (x) the
        interest of the Partnership in each parcel of real property  acquired as
        provided in Section 3.6 hereof, together with all buildings,  structures
        and  improvements   located   thereon,   fixtures   contained   therein,
        appurtenances  thereto and all  personal  property  owned in  connection
        therewith,  and (y) subject to the provisions of Section 2.8 hereof, the
        Malvern Property.

               2.  Amendment to Section 1.1. - New  Definitions.  Section 1.1 of
the Partnership  Agreement is hereby amended by adding the following new defined
terms thereto:

        "Lexington  TNI"  shall  mean  Lexington  TNI LLC,  a  Delaware  limited
        liability company and wholly-owned subsidiary of LXP.

        "Other  Partner's  Interest" shall mean the limited partner  interest in
        Triple Net Investment L.P. held by another Member.


<PAGE>

        "Partnership  Agreement" shall mean the agreement of limited partnership
        of the Partnership dated as of December 8, 2004.

        "Partnership  Properties" shall mean all Approved  Qualified  Properties

               3.  Amendment  to  Article  II.  Article  II of  the  Partnership

as follows:

        2.8    Treatment of the Partnership Properties as Qualified Properties.

               (a) It is the  intention  of the  parties  that  the  Partnership
        Properties be regarded as Qualified Properties, notwithstanding that (i)
        the  Partnership is not an SP Subsidiary,  and (ii) the Company does not
        have  an  interest  in  the  Partnership  Properties.  Accordingly,  for
        purposes  of  this  Agreement  (and  the  agreements  and   arrangements
        contemplated by this Agreement),  the Members agree that, subject to the
        provisions  of this  Section 2.8, the  Partnership  Properties  shall be
        deemed to be "Qualified Properties" for purposes of this Agreement as of
        the date they are acquired by the Partnership and that, without limiting
        the generality of the foregoing:  (i) LXP, acting through Lexington TNI,
        shall  manage  the   Partnership   Properties  and  the  Partnership  in
        accordance  with,  and subject to, the  provisions of Article III hereof
        and that LXP shall  obtain the  consent of the Fund in each  instance in
        which such consent would otherwise have been required if the Partnership
        Properties were owned by the Company; (ii) capital contributions made by
        the LXP and the Fund to the  Partnership  shall be  credited  toward the
        Members' Capital  Commitment  requirements  under this Agreement;  (iii)
        capital  contributions  made by the LXP and the Fund to the Partnership,
        Acquisition  Fees and Financing Fees paid by the Fund in its capacity as
        a limited partner of the Partnership, and distributions, if any, paid by
        the  Partnership  to LXP  and  the  Fund  shall  be  factored  into  the
        calculation of "12% IRR" under this Agreement;  (iv) the Manager and the
        Asset  Manager,  as  applicable,   shall  be  entitled  to  receive  the
        Acquisition  Fees,  Financing  Fees,  Management Fees and Oversight Fees
        with respect to the Partnership Properties;  (v) for purposes of Section
        3.7, and Section 11.1, the Right of First Refusal and Buy/Sell Property,
        as applicable,  shall be deemed to include the Other Partner's Interest;
        (vi) for purposes of Section  3.8,  the total debt of the Company  shall
        include  any debt  related  to the  Partnership  Properties;  (vii)  for
        purposes  of Section  8.3,  the  Removal  Amount  shall  include the net
        proceeds  from the sale of the  Partnership  Properties;  and (viii) for
        purposes of Section 11.2 and  Schedule 5, the average  maturity and Fair
        Market Value tests which are applicable to the Redemption  Right granted
        to the Fund shall include the Partnership  Properties and the references
        to "Retained  Qualified  Properties"  and "Proposed  Tendered  Qualified
        Properties" shall include,  with respect to the Partnership  Properties,
        the Other Partner's Interest, as applicable.


                                       2
<PAGE>


               (b)  Notwithstanding  the  provisions  of clause (a), the Members
        agree that while their intent is to treat the Partnership  Properties as
        if they were Qualified Properties  hereunder,  in order to avoid "double
        counting",  the Members further  acknowledge that: (i) the Company shall
        not call for capital  from the Members,  and the Members  shall not make
        capital  contributions  to the  Company,  in respect of the  Partnership
        Properties,  provided,  however,  that if either LXP or the Fund  fails,
        with  respect  to the  Partnership  Properties,  to (x) make a  required
        Capital  Contribution,  Additional Capital  Contribution,  Extraordinary
        Capital Contribution or Extraordinary Loan (as such terms are defined in
        the Malvern Owner LP Agreement) or (y) satisfy a claim under the Default
        Amount or Claim  Amount  (as such terms are  defined in the  Partnership
        Agreement),  as the case may be, with respect thereto shall be a Default
        Amount or Claim  Amount,  as the case may be, under this  Agreement  (as
        well as the Partnership Agreement) which results in an adjustment to the
        Percentage  Interests  in this  Agreement  (as  well as the  Partnership
        Agreement);  (ii) the Members shall not receive  distributions  from the
        Company  in  respect of the  Partnership  Properties  by virtue of their
        interests in the Company  (which  distributions  shall be payable by the
        Partnership  pursuant to the Partnership  Agreement);  (iii) the Members
        shall not be allocated  profits and losses (or items thereof) in respect
        of the  Partnership  Properties  by  virtue  of their  interests  in the
        Company (which allocations shall be applied by the Partnership  pursuant
        to the Partnership Agreement); (iv) expenses exclusively attributable to
        the  Partnership  Properties  shall not be  treated as  expenses  of the
        Company; (v) revenues generated by the Partnership  Properties shall not
        be  treated  as  revenues  of  the  Company;   and  (vi)  the  governing
        instruments of the Partnership and the SP Subsidiaries formed to acquire
        Partnership  Properties may not be amended without consent of all of the
        Members.

               4.   Amendment  to  Section   3.8(a)  -  Limitation   on  Company
Indebtedness.  Section 3.8 of the  Agreement  is hereby  amended by deleting the
figure "$92,857,143" and replacing it with "$225,510,204.08."

entirety and replacing it with:

               6.  Amendment to Paragraph  12(a)(ii) of Schedule 5 - Calculation
of Purchase Price.

               (a)  Paragraph  12(a)(ii)(y)  of Schedule 5 of the  Agreement  is

hereby amended by deleting the figure "$21.20" and replacing it with "$21.87."

Changes. Except as modified by this Amendment,  the Agreement is hereby ratified
and affirmed in all  respects.  Nothing  herein shall be held to alter,  vary or
otherwise  affect  the  terms,  conditions  and  provision  of  the  Partnership
Agreement, other than as stated above.

               8. Further  Assurances.  Each of the parties hereto covenants and
agrees to promptly  take such action,  and to cause such party's  affiliates  to
promptly take such action,  as may be reasonably  required to effectively  carry
out the intent and purposes of this Amendment.

               9. Governing Law. This Amendment shall be construed in accordance
with and governed by the laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to
the provisions, policies or principles thereof relating to choice or conflict of
laws.
