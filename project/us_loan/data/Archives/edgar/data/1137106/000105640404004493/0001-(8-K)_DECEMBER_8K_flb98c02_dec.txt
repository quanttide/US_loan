 (1) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures
 become available from borrowers on an asset level. In all cases the most current
 DSCR provided by the Servicer is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by
 the Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The Trustee makes
 no representations as to the accuracy of the data provided by the borrower for
 this calculation. "NAP" means not applicable and relates to the omission of
 credit lease loans in the calculation of DSCR.

 (2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term
 from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if
 applicable, and the maturity date.
