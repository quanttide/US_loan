<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">BREAM VENTURES ANNOUNCES NAME CHANGE



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;December&nbsp;17, 2004, Vancouver, Canada: Bream Ventures Inc. (BRMV:OTCBB) is pleased to
announce that it has changed its name to &#147;Sino Silver Corp.&#148; effective December&nbsp;9, 2004. The Board
of Directors believes that the name change is more appropriate for the Company considering the new
business opportunities it anticipates and impresses upon the investing public that the Company is
moving in a new direction. Sino Silver Corp. is a mining and metal company focused on exploring
for silver and developing mines in China.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As previously announced, the Company entered into a Memorandum of Understanding (&#147;MOU&#148;) with
Sino-Top Technologies, Ltd., an entity incorporated under the laws of the People&#146;s Republic of
China (&#147;Sino-Top&#148;), for the purpose of forming a joint venture to participate in the exploration
and evaluation, and if feasible, the development and mining of resources on between four to eleven
properties located in the Inner Mongolia region of China. The MOU provides for the formation,
subject to certain conditions, of a joint venture to be known as Sino Silver China, Ltd. Sino
Silver agreed to contribute up to a total of $3,000,000 in return for a 60% equity interest in Sino
Silver China. Sino Silver has used a portion of the proceeds from a recent sale of its common
stock and warrants to deposit $100,000 in escrow that was due by December&nbsp;15, 2004 under the MOU.
An additional $400,000 will be due at the closing of the joint venture, which presently is
scheduled for February&nbsp;15, 2004. The balance is to be paid in installments over three years.
