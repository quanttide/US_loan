(the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), to be entered into by and among
IndyMac MBS, Inc, as depositor, IndyMac Bank, F.S.B., as seller and master
servicer and Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as trustee. Certain classes

      In connection with the expected sale of the Underwritten Certificates,
