ITEM 1.01   ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

ITEM 2.03   CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION

     On December 21, 2004, Telewest UK Limited and Telewest  Communications
Networks Ltd.  ("TCN") and certain of its direct and indirect  subsidiaries
and  associated  partnerships  (together,  the "TCN Group")  entered into a
pound  1,550,000,000  Senior Facilities  Agreement (the "Senior  Facilities
Agreement") and a pound 250,000,000  Second Lien Facilities  Agreement (the
"Second Lien Facility  Agreement",  and together with the Senior Facilities
Agreement,  the "Facilities  Agreements").  Barclays Capital,  BNP Paribas,
Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank
AG London and Royal Bank of Scotland  acted as  bookrunners.  Barclays Bank
plc acted as  Facility  Agent,  Security  Trustee  and US  Paying  Agent in
connection with the Facilities Agreements and GE Capital Structured Finance
Group Limited acted as  Administrative  Agent in connection with the Senior
Facilities  Agreement.  All  capitalized  terms not defined herein have the
meaning  given to them in the Senior  Facilities  Agreement  and the Second
Lien Facility Agreement, as applicable.

     The  proceeds  of the Term  Facilities  and the Second  Lien  Facility
(described  below) are intended to finance the repayment of amounts due and
payable under  Telewest's  existing senior  facilities  (including  without
limitation, by way of principal,  interest, break costs, fees and expenses,
commission and any other premiums) and any fees, costs and expenses due and
payable  in  connection  with  this  financing.   The  Revolving   Facility
(described  below) is  intended  to finance  the  general  working  capital
requirements and the general corporate purposes of the TCN Group.

     It is anticipated  that Telewest will draw down all of the Facilities,
except the Revolving  Facility,  on [30] December.  The  Facilities  remain
subject to normal closing conditions.

TRANCHES, AVAILABILITY AND AMORTIZATION

     The Facilities under the Facilities  Agreements comprise the following
tranches:

 (a) A 7-year amortizing term loan facility of pound 700,000,000, available
     in Sterling in a single  drawing  ("Tranche  A").  Tranche A amortizes
     semi-annually starting with a pound 5 million payment on June 30, 2005
     and  increasing  incrementally  to pound 80 million  for the last five
     payments;

 (b) An 8-year  multi-currency  term loan  facility  of pound  425,000,000,
     available in Euro,  U.S.  Dollars and/or Sterling in a single drawing,
     payable in two equal  instalments  7 1/2 and 8 years after the date of
     the Senior Facilities Agreement (the "Closing Date") ("Tranche B");

 (c) A 9-year  multi-currency  term  loan  facility  of pound  325,000,000,
     available in Euro,  U.S.  Dollars and/or Sterling in a single drawing,
     payable in two equal  instalments  8 1/2 and 9 years after the Closing
     Date  ("Tranche  C" and,  together  with  Tranche A and Tranche B, the
     "Senior Term Facilities");

 (d) A  7-year  revolving  loan  facility  in a  maximum  amount  of  pound
     100,000,000,  available in Sterling  (the  "Revolving  Facility"  and,
     together with the Senior Term  Facilities,  the "Senior  Facilities");
     and

 (e) A 9 1/2 year  second  lien term loan  facility  of pound  250,000,000,
     available in Sterling in a single  drawing,  payable 9 1/2 years after
     the date of the Second  Lien  Facility  Agreement  (the  "Second  Lien
     Facility" and, together with the Senior Facilities, the "Facilities").

INTEREST

     Tranches A, B and C and the Revolving Facility will bear interest at a
rate of (a) EURIBOR  (for any  Euro-denominated  advance) or LIBOR (for any
advance  denominated in another  currency) plus (b) the applicable  cost of
complying  with any reserve  requirements  plus an applicable  margin.  The
applicable  margin for  Tranche A and the  Revolving  Facility is 2.25% per
annum, for Tranche B, in case of an  Euro-denominated  advance,  2.375% per
annum, in case of a  Dollar-denominated  advance,  2.25% per annum,  and in
case of a Sterling-denominated  advance, 2.50% per annum, for Tranche C, in
case  of an  Euro-denominated  advance,  2.875%  per  annum,  in  case of a
Dollar-denominated   advance,   2.75%   per   annum,   and  in  case  of  a
Sterling-denominated  advance,  3.00% per annum,  and for the  Second  Lien
Facility 4.00% per annum.

     In addition,  the  applicable  margin for Tranche A and the  Revolving
Facility is subject to a margin  ratchet  from and after the first  quarter
date  occurring  at least 6 months  after the  Closing  Date based upon the
ratio of Consolidated  Net Borrowings to Consolidated  Annualized TCN Group
Net Operating  Cash Flow ranging  between 1.50% and 2.25%.  The  applicable
margin for the Tranche B is subject to a margin ratchet such that, from and
after the first quarter date  occurring at least 6 months after the Closing
Date on which the ratio of  Consolidated  Net  Borrowings  to  Consolidated
Annualized  TCN Group Net Operating  Cash Flow is less than or equal to 3.0
to 1.0, the Tranche B margin shall be reduced by 25 basis points.

MANDATORY PREPAYMENTS

     The TCN Group is  subject to certain  customary  mandatory  prepayment
events under the Facilities Agreements, including:

  o  To the extent Excess Cash Flow exceeds  pound 10 million,  50% of such
     Excess  Cash Flow in the event  that the ratio of  Consolidated  Total
     Debt to  Consolidated  Annualised TCN Group Net Operating Cash Flow is
     greater  than 3.5 to 1.0, or 25% of such Excess Cash Flow in the event
     such  ratio  is 3.5 to 1.0 or less  but  more  than  2.75  to 1.0.  No
     mandatory prepayment from Excess Cash Flow is required if the ratio of
     Consolidated  Total  Debt to  Consolidated  Annualised  TCN  Group Net
     Operating Cash Flow is 2.75 to 1.0 or less.

  o  Net  Proceeds  received by any member of the TCN Group from  Disposals
     and Insurance Recoveries, subject to certain exemptions, to the extent
     such Net Proceeds exceed, in each case, pound 6 million.

  o  Subject to certain  exemptions,  50% of the Net  Proceeds in excess of
     pound 10 million of any Financial  Indebtedness raised by the Ultimate
     Parent,  Telewest UK or any member of the TCN Group in connection with
     any single raising of Financial Indebtedness.

  o  Subject  to  certain  exemptions  and to the  extent  Equity  Proceeds
     (proceeds  from  certain  public  equity  offerings)  exceed  pound 10
     million,  50% of such Equity Proceeds in respect of any single raising
     of equity in the event  that the ratio of  Consolidated  Total Debt to
     Consolidated Annualised TCN Group Net Operating Cash Flow is more than
     3.5 to 1.0,  or 25% of such  Equity  Proceeds in respect of any single
     raising of  equity,  in the event such ratio is 3.5 to 1.0 or less but
     is more than 3.0 to 1.0. No mandatory  prepayment from Equity Proceeds
     is required if the ratio of  Consolidated  Total Debt to  Consolidated
     Annualised TCN Group Net Operating Cash Flow is 3.0 to 1.0 or less.

COVENANTS

Affirmative Covenants

     The Facilities  Agreements contain a number of affirmative  covenants,
including  requirements  on each  party  to own the  assets  necessary  and
material  in the conduct of its  business.  In  addition,  the TCN Group is
subject to financial maintenance tests,  including the following liquidity,
coverage and leverage ratio tests:

  o  The ratio of the TCN Group's  Consolidated  Net  Borrowings  as at the
     relevant test date to Consolidated  Annualised TCN Group Net Operating
     Cash Flow for the  Semi-Annual  Period ending on that test date cannot
     exceed a stated ratio which  decreases  each quarter from 4.40 for the
     quarter  ending March 21, 2005 to 2.50 for the quarter ending June 30,
     2010 and thereafter;

  o  The ratio of the TCN  Group's  Consolidated  Annualised  TCN Group Net
     Operating Cash Flow for the Semi-Annual  Period ending on the relevant
     test date to Total Interest Charges  calculated on an annualised basis
     based on the  Total  Interest  Charges  for such  Semi-Annual  Period,
     cannot be less than a stated ratio,  which increases each quarter from
     2.35 for the  quarter  ending  March 31,  2005 to 4.50 for the quarter
     ended June 30, 2010 and thereafter;

  o  The ratio of TCN Group's  Consolidated  TCN Group Cash Flow in respect
     of the  twelve  month  period  ending on each  relevant  testing  date
     commencing  with 30 June 2005 to  Consolidated  Debt  Service for such
     twelve month period, cannot be less than 1.0; and

  o  The total amount of Capital  Expenditure during each financial year of
     the TCN Group cannot exceed the  aggregate of the Capital  Expenditure
     Allowance plus up to 25% of the Capital Expenditure  Allowance for the
     immediately   preceding   financial  year.  The  Capital   Expenditure
     Allowance for the financial  year ending 31 December 2005 is pound 315
     million,  for the financial year ending December 31, 2006 is pound 330
     million;  thereafter  such allowance  decreases each financial year to
     pound 285 million for the financial year ending on December 31, 2011.

Negative Covenants

     The TCN Group is  further  subject  to  customary  negative  covenants
including, among other things,  limitations on Indebtedness,  Encumbrances,
Asset Dispositions,  Restricted Payments, Affiliate Transactions, Change of
Business, Dividends, Distributions and increases in Share Capital.

     The  covenants  contained in the  Facilities  Agreements  could affect
Telewest's  ability to operate  its  business  and may limit its ability to
take advantage of potential business opportunities as they arise.

EVENTS OF DEFAULT

     The  Facilities  Agreements  are  subject to  acceleration,  after the
passage of any applicable  grace period,  by written notice to TCN upon the
occurrence of an event of default.  Events of default under the  Facilities
Agreements include:

  o  Non-Payment of sums due under any of the relevant finance documents;

  o  Failure  of  an  entity  to  comply  with  certain  of  the  covenants
     applicable to it;

  o  Failure by any member of the borrowing group to perform or comply with
     any obligations in any of the relevant finance documents;

  o  Any material  misrepresentation  by any member of the borrowing  group
     (or,  prior to its  accession,  Telewest  Global  Finance  LLC) in any
     applicable  finance  document  or other  document  delivered  pursuant
     thereto;

  o  Non-payment  of  certain  indebtedness  of any TCN  Group  member,  or
     cancellation of any commitments for any of that  indebtedness,  if the
     aggregate amount of such indebtedness is more than pound 35 million;

  o  The insolvency of certain entities;

  o  The winding-up, dissolution, reorganization of certain entities or the
     appointment of a liquidator or receiver of such entities' revenues and
     assets;

  o  Any  execution,  distress or diligence  being levied  against  certain
     entities,  or an encumbrancer  taking possession of property or assets
     having an aggregate value of more than pound 1 million;

  o  The  occurrence  of events  under the laws of any  jurisdiction  which
     would  have a similar  effect to  certain  entities  being  insolvent,
     wound-up or under distress;

  o  Any  member of the  borrowing  group  repudiating  any of the  finance
     documents to which it is party;

  o  The  unlawfulness  for any member of the borrowing group to perform or
     comply with its obligations under the relevant finance documents;

  o  The  failure by any member of the  borrowing  group to comply with the
     applicable intercreditor deeds;

  o  The revocation of certain authorizations which is reasonably likely to
     have  a  material  adverse  effect,   as  defined  in  the  Facilities
     Agreements (a "Material Adverse Effect");

  o  The  occurrence  of any  event or  circumstances  which  would  have a
     Material Adverse Effect;

  o  The  resignation  of  Telewest's  auditors  of  their  appointment  as
     auditors   to  the  Group  or  the  TCN  Group  as  a  result  of  the
     investigation  detailed in Telewest's press release dated December 15,
     2004, under circumstances which, in the opinion of the Facility Agent,
     acting on the  instructions  of lenders to whom in aggregate more than
     66  2/3%  of the  aggregate  amount  of  outstandings  are  owed,  are
     materially  adverse to the credit of the  lenders  (taken as a whole);
     and

  o  The   commencement   of  any  material   litigation,   arbitration  or
     administrative  proceeding  which  is  reasonably  likely  to  have  a
     Material Adverse Effect.

     As a result of a default, Telewest's senior lenders could cause all of
the  outstanding  indebtedness  under  the  Facilities  to  become  due and
payable,   require  Telewest  to  apply  all  of  its  cash  to  repay  the
indebtedness or prevent  Telewest from making debt service  payments on any
other   indebtedness   that  its  owes.  If  Telewest's   indebtedness   is
accelerated,  it may not be able to  repay  its debt or  borrow  sufficient
funds  to  refinance  that  debt.  In  addition,   any  default  under  the
Facilities,  or agreements  governing  Telewest's  other existing or future
indebtedness,  is likely to lead to an acceleration  of indebtedness  under
any other debt instruments that contain cross-acceleration or cross-default
provisions.  If the  indebtedness  under the Facilities is accelerated as a
result of a default,  Telewest  is unlikely  to have  sufficient  assets to
repay that debt, and/or other indebtedness then outstanding.

CALL PROTECTION ON THE SECOND LIEN FACILITY

     Any prepayment of the Second Lien Facility  within 12 months after the
Closing Date ("Non-Call Period") will be subject to payment of a Make Whole
Premium.  Such Make Whole Premium is calculated on the basis of the greater
of (a) 1.00 % of the  Outstandings  to be repaid and (b) the  difference on
the proposed  prepayment  date between (i) the present  value of 102.00% of
the relevant  Outstandings and any interest that would have accrued on such
Outstandings  from the proposed  prepayment  date to and including the last
day of the Non-Call  Period,  computed  using a discount  rate equal to the
Gilt  Rate  plus  0.50%,  and (ii) the  principal  amount  of the  relevant
Outstandings.  After the end of the Non-Call Period, prepayment may be made
in whole or in part, subject to a Prepayment Premium equal to the following
percentages of the principal  amount of the  Outstandings  under the Second
Lien Facility being prepaid:  (i) 2.00% prior to the second  anniversary of
the Closing Date,  (ii) 1.00% after the second  anniversary  of the Closing
Date but prior to the third  anniversary  of the  Closing  Date,  and (iii)
0.00% thereafter.

             TELEWEST ANNOUNCES EXECUTION OF POUND 1.8 BILLION
                       LOAN AGREEMENT DOCUMENTATION

London, 21 December 2004--Telewest Global, Inc. (Nasdaq: TLWT) today
announces that the Telewest group executed final documentation relating to
new pound 1.8 billion credit facilities. Barclays Capital, BNP Paribas,
Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Credit Suisse First Boston, Deutsche Bank
and The Royal Bank of Scotland acted as book runners. Proceeds of the new
facilities will be used to repay borrowings under the group's existing
pound 2.03 billion senior credit facilities. The new facilities
significantly extend the maturity profile of the group's senior debt and
reduce its overall long-term cost of borrowing.

The new credit facilities reflect better pricing terms than previously
announced and are comprised of five tranches: tranche A, a 7-year,
amortising term facility of pound 700 million initially bearing interest
of LIBOR plus 2.25%; tranche B, an 8-year term facility of pound 425
million equivalent initially bearing interest of LIBOR plus 2.375% for
loans denominated in Euro, 2.25% for loans denominated in U.S. dollars and
2.50% for loans denominated in Sterling; tranche C, a 9-year term facility
of a pound 325 million equivalent bearing interest of LIBOR plus 2.875%
for loans denominated in Euro, 2.75% for loans denominated in U.S. dollars
and 3.00% for loans denominated Sterling; a 7-year revolving loan facility
of pound 100 million initially bearing interest of LIBOR plus 2.25%; and a
9 1/2-year second lien term facility of pound 250 million bearing interest
of LIBOR plus 4.00%.

Cob Stenham, Chairman of Telewest Global, Inc., said "We are extremely
pleased to announce execution of our new loan agreement on better terms
than previously announced and we look forward to working with our new
senior lenders. Combined with the financial restructuring completed last
summer, this refinancing completes the rebuilding of Telewest's balance
sheet providing us with a significantly improved capital structure and a
strong platform for future growth".
