Item 1.01         Entry Into a Material Definitive Agreement
Item 3.02         Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

         On December 16, 2004, BriteSmile, Inc. (the "Company") entered into
definitive agreements with seven investors (the "Investors") for the private
placement (the "Note Offering") of $12 million in principal amount of Senior
Convertible Notes (the "Notes").

         The Investors have the option within 180 days to purchase up to an
additional $4 million in Notes on the same terms. The Investors include
qualified institutional buyers and LCO Investments Limited, the Company's
largest shareholder. The proceeds from the sale of the Notes will be used to
fund the continuation of the Company's spa roll-out strategy, expansion of the
International Associated Center footprint, the establishment of International
spas, and for working capital purposes.

         The Notes accrue interest at 5% per annum, or 6 month LIBOR plus 300
basis points, whichever is greater (capped at 8%), payable in cash or registered
Common Stock. The Notes are convertible into shares of the Company's Common
Stock at a per share conversion price of $7.61, which is 115% of the
volume-weighted average price of the Common Stock during the ten day period
immediately prior to signing of the transaction documents. The Notes will be
repaid in monthly installments over 36 months beginning in June 2006 in cash or
registered stock. The Company also issued to the investors five year warrants to
purchase up to 544,253 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $7.61 per
share.

     Merriman  Curhan Ford & Co., acted as the sole placement  agent in the Note
Offering.

         Pursuant to a Registration Rights Agreement between the Investors and
the Company, the Company agreed to register with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, within 120 days from the closing date, the shares of Common Stock
into which the Notes are convertible and underlying the Warrants for offer and
sale under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

         The terms of the Private Placement are set forth in full in the forms
of Securities Purchase Agreement, Convertible Subordinated Note, Warrant to
Purchase Common Stock, and Additional Investment Right filed as exhibits to this
Report.
