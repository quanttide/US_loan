Item 8.01  Other Events and Regulation FD Disclosure.

         The Company has been unable to complete and file its most recent
quarterly reports on Form 10-QSB and Annual Reports on Form 10-KSB as a result
of its bankruptcy filing in November 2002. The Company is electing to
voluntarily file the monthly reports delivered to the Bankruptcy Trustee ,
including monthly financial statements. These financial statements are not
audited and have not been reviewed or compiled by independent auditors, and
therefore may not be prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles. However, the management of the Company believes that the financial
statements accurately reflect the financial condition of the Company.
