FINAL

                 IMPAX LABORATORIES ANNOUNCES RETIREMENT OF CFO

HAYWARD, CALIF. (DECEMBER 23, 2004) - IMPAX LABORATORIES, INC. (NASDAQ NM: IPXL)
today announced that Chief Financial Officer, Cornel C. Spiegler, plans to
retire from the company in 2005. The Company has begun the search process for a
new CFO.

"My decision to retire was based on a desire to move on to the next phase of my
career, as well as spend more time with my family. Nevertheless, I want to
assure everyone that I plan to stay on until a new CFO is hired and an orderly
transition has taken place. Therefore, the exact timing of my departure can only
be approximated as sometime in early 2005. This timing is consistent with my
desire to continue in my role and responsibilities through the end of our fiscal
year, and with the completion of Sarbanes-Oxley 404 requirements and our 2004
10-K," said Mr. Spiegler.

Barry R. Edwards, IMPAX's Chief Executive Officer, commented: ""On behalf of the
Board of Directors I want to thank Cornel for his dedicated service and
contributions to the Company over the past 9 years. We all wish him well during
his retirement. We respect Cornel's decision and we especially appreciate his
cooperation in ensuring that an orderly transition occurs. In the interim we
will continue to rely upon him as a valued member of the executive team."

Mr. Spiegler will stay on in the position of Chief Financial Officer during the
appointment and orientation of his successor. Following that time, the Company
expects Mr. Spiegler will serve for the remainder of 2005 as a special
consultant and project manager, reporting to the CEO.
