          (f)  Governing Law. All questions concerning the construction,
validity, and interpretation of this Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the domestic laws of the State of New York without
giving effect to any choice or conflict of law provision or rule (whether of the
State of New York or any other jurisdiction) that would cause the application of
the laws of any jurisdiction other than the State of New York. The state or
federal courts located within the state of New York shall have jurisdiction over
any and all disputes between the parties hereto, whether in law or equity,
arising out of or relating to this Agreement and the agreements, instruments and
documents contemplated hereby and the parties hereto consent to and agree to
submit to the jurisdiction of such courts. Each of the parties hereby waives and
agrees not to assert in any such dispute, to the fullest extent permitted by
applicable law, any claim that (i) such party is not personally subject to the
jurisdiction of such courts, (ii) such party and such party's property is immune
from any legal process issued by such courts or (iii) any litigation or other
proceeding commenced in such courts is brought in an inconvenient forum. The
parties hereto hereby agree that mailing of process or other papers in
connection with any such action or proceeding in the manner provided in section
4(e), or in such other manner as may be permitted by law, shall be valid and
sufficient service thereof and hereby waive any objections to service
accomplished in the manner herein provided.

          (g)  Waiver of Jury Trial. Each of the parties hereto hereby
irrevocably waives, and agrees to cause its subsidiaries to waive, all right to
a trial by jury in any action, proceeding or counterclaim arising out of or
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby.

          (h)  Amendments and Waivers. This Agreement may be amended, or any
provision of this Agreement may be waived upon a written approval, executed by
the parties hereto. No course of dealing between or among the parties hereto
shall be deemed effective to modify, amend, or discharge any part of this
Agreement or any rights or obligations of any such party or such holder under or
by reason of this Agreement.

          (i)  Severability. Any term or provision of this Agreement that is
invalid or unenforceable in any situation in any jurisdiction shall not affect
the validity or enforceability of the remaining terms and provisions hereof or
the validity or enforceability of the offending term or provision in any other
situation or in any other jurisdiction.

          (j)  Expenses. Each of the Contributors and Holdings and the Company
will bear its own costs and expenses (including legal fees and expenses)
incurred in connection with this Agreement and the transactions contemplated
hereby; provided, however, that the Company will bear the reasonable legal fees
and expenses of Winston & Strawn LLP, counsel to certain of the Contributors, in
connection with the Restructuring.

          (k)  Construction. The parties hereto have participated jointly in the
