<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">HOUSTON, Dec. 27 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ &#151; Navidec, Inc. (&#147;Navidec&#148; or
the &#147;Company&#148;) (OTC Bulletin Board: NVDC - News) announced that on December&nbsp;22,
2004, the Company received from the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;)
an Order Directing a Private Investigation and Designating Officers to Take Testimony.
&#160;The Company intends to fully cooperate
with the SEC in its investigation.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The precise nature and scope of the SEC&#146;s investigation is presently
unknown. &#160;However, the Company believes
that the SEC&#146;s investigation relates, at least in part, to the restatement of
reported earnings for the first and second quarters of 2003 by Navidec, Inc.
This restatement was reported in Navidec, Inc.&#146;s Form 10-Q for the third
quarter of 2003 filed on December&nbsp;11, 2003.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Effective September&nbsp;10, 2004, BPZ Energy, Inc. completed a reverse
merger of Navidec, Inc., whereby the operations and management of BPZ Energy
became the continuing entity. &#160;Pursuant
to the reverse merger, the present management of Navidec, Inc. consists solely
of the principals of BPZ Energy, Inc. &#160;None of these individuals held management
positions at the Company during the first and second quarters of 2003. &#160;Those persons who did hold management
positions at Navidec, Inc. during the first and second quarters of 2003 are no
longer employed by the Company.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Pursuant to the reverse merger, the parties agreed that all pre-merger
operations, assets and liabilities of Navidec, Inc. would be spun off into a
separate corporation, Navidec Financial Services, Inc. (&#147;NFS&#148;), to be owned by
the shareholders of record on September&nbsp;9, 2004. &#160;This record date is prior to the reverse
merger with BPZ Energy, Inc. The spin-off has not been consummated as of this
date. &#160;In connection with the spin-off,
NFS has a requirement to indemnify the Company with respect to the costs of
this matter, including the expenses related to the Company&#146;s response to SEC
subpoenas and other discovery requests and indemnification obligations to its
former officers and directors.</font></p>
