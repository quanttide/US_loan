<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>En Pointe Technologies, Inc. Reports Financial Results for the Fourth Quarter and Fiscal Year Ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-left: 3%"> &#151;  <B>Fifth Consecutive Profitable Quarter</B><BR>
 &#151;  <B>Fiscal 2004 Net Income of $1.4 Million</B><BR>
 &#151;  <B>Fiscal 2004 Diluted EPS of $0.20</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Los Angeles, CA &#150; December&nbsp;20, 2004 &#151; En Pointe Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPT), a leading
national provider of business-to-business information technology products, services and solutions,
today announced consolidated results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30,
2004. Full-year net income for fiscal 2004 totaled $1.4&nbsp;million, or $0.21 per basic share and
$0.20 per diluted share, which represents an improvement of $3.8&nbsp;million over the $2.4&nbsp;million loss
reported for fiscal 2003. Total revenue for fiscal 2004 was $279.2&nbsp;million, a decline of $10.6
million, or 3.6%, from fiscal 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Net income for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $478,000, or $0.07 per basic and diluted
share, up 24.8% from the $383,000 reported in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003. Total revenue in
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 was $71.5&nbsp;million, off $716,000, or 1.0%, from the comparable
period in fiscal 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are extremely pleased to report that En Pointe&#146;s fiscal year ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 was
profitable and that the September&nbsp;2004 quarter represented our fifth sequential quarter of
profitability,&#148; said Bob Din, CEO of En Pointe Technologies, Inc. &#147;As we move into fiscal 2005 and
beyond, we will continue to focus our efforts on driving revenue in three markets: Services,
including logistics; expanding our software licensing business; and, continuing to meet our
customers&#146; IT fulfillment requirements through operational excellence.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Service revenue in the 2004 fiscal year totaled $42.5&nbsp;million, an increase of $5.2&nbsp;million or 14.0%
over the service revenue generated in fiscal 2003. Full-year fiscal 2004 service revenue
represented 15.2% of total revenue and generated 49.0% of the Company&#146;s gross profit. Service
revenue for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 was $9.8&nbsp;million, a decline of 8.2% from the $10.7
million reported for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2003. The fourth quarter fiscal 2004 service
revenue represented 13.7% of total revenue and generated 38.3% of the Company&#146;s gross profit.
Gross margins realized on service revenues were 31.4% and 39.7% for the quarter and twelve month
periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Full-year fiscal 2004 product sales were $236.7&nbsp;million, off 6.3% from fiscal 2003. During the
quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company generated product sales of $61.7&nbsp;million, which were
comparable to the $61.6&nbsp;million in product sales reported for the quarter ended September&nbsp;30, 2003.
Gross margins realized on product revenues were 8.0% and 7.4% for the quarter and twelve month
periods ended September&nbsp;30, 2004, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are excited about the investment we&#146;ve made over the last several months to develop and
implement a new customer asset processing and logistics management system within SAP,&#148; continued
Bob Din. &#147;With these new tools integrated into our ERP and CRM packages, our large enterprise
customers will be able to derive even greater value from En Pointe&#146;s product life-cycle management
services. This includes tracking products from the time of procurement through on-site deployment
and then, potentially, from de-installation through refurbishment and

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">redeployment, or through decommissioning and disposal. We anticipate that these tools will be
available in the first quarter of calendar year 2005.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Selling and marketing expenses for the year ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 were $22.9&nbsp;million, down by
$4.6&nbsp;million, or 16.8%, from $27.6&nbsp;million in the prior fiscal year. This improvement resulted
from Company&#146;s efforts to reduce costs. At $6.0&nbsp;million, selling and marketing expenses in the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 were 4.4% lower than the $6.2&nbsp;million reported for the fourth quarter
of fiscal 2003.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">General and Administrative (G&#038;A) expenses increased slightly (0.5%) to $10.0&nbsp;million in the fiscal
year ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 from the prior fiscal year. G&#038;A expenses declined from $2.8&nbsp;million
in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003 to $2.0&nbsp;million in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">During fiscal year 2004, En Pointe invested $509,000 in Premier BPO, Inc. (formerly known as En
Pointe Global Services, Inc.), an offshore business process outsourcing provider, resulting in an
ownership interest of approximately 38%. In addition, the Company provided Premier BPO with a
$600,000 five-year 6% interest-bearing note that was converted to convertible preferred stock
subsequent to year end.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Due to the structure of Premier BPO&#146;s capitalization and financing and the application of FIN 46 &#150;
Financial Accounting Standards Board Interpretation No.&nbsp;46 &#147;Accounting for Consolidation of
Variable Interest Entities,&#148; the Company recognized nearly all of the losses generated by Premier
BPO and may be required to do so in future periods. Premier BPO&#146;s expenses included in the
Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements as selling, general and administrative (SG&#038;A) expenses
for the three and twelve months ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 totaled $453,000 and $1.1&nbsp;million,
respectively. These SG&#038;A expenses were partially reduced by loss allocations to the minority
interest shareholders of $117,000 and $136,000 for the three and twelve months ended September&nbsp;30,
2004, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company&#146;s cash balance increased to $16.1&nbsp;million as of September&nbsp;30, 2004 from $3.2&nbsp;million as
of September&nbsp;30, 2003. This increase resulted primarily from increases in accounts payable and
borrowings under lines of credit along with an improvement in accounts receivable days sales
outstanding from 44 at September&nbsp;30, 2003 to 41 at September&nbsp;30, 2004.
