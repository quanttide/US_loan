question brought before such meeting, unless the question is one upon which by express provision of the statutes, or the Certificate of Incorporation, or these Bylaws, a different vote is required in
which case such express provision shall govern and control the decision of such question. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
each meeting of the stockholders, each stockholder having the right to vote may vote in person or may authorize another person or persons to act for him by proxy
appointed by an instrument in writing subscribed by such stockholder and bearing a date not more than three years prior to said meeting, unless said instrument provides for a longer period. All
proxies must be filed with the Secretary of the Corporation at the beginning of each meeting in order to be counted in any vote at the meeting. Each stockholder shall have one vote for each share of
stock having voting power, </FONT></P>

filling any vacancy or any newly created directorship, the directors then in office shall constitute less than a majority of the whole Board (as constituted immediately prior to any such increase),
the Court of Chancery may, upon application of any stockholder or stockholders holding at least ten (10)&nbsp;percent of the total number of the shares at the time outstanding having the right to
