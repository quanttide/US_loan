<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=3><B>Acquisition of AMC Entertainment by Affiliates of J.P. Morgan Partners<BR>
and Apollo Management is Completed  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kansas City, Missouri (December&nbsp;23, 2004)&#151;AMC Entertainment&nbsp;Inc. (AMEX: AEN), one of the world's leading theatrical
exhibition companies, announced today that the acquisition of AMC by Marquee Holdings&nbsp;Inc. has been completed. Marquee Holdings&nbsp;Inc. is an investment vehicle controlled by affiliates of
J.P.&nbsp;Morgan Partners, LLC, the private equity arm of JPMorgan Chase&nbsp;&amp; Co. (NYSE:&nbsp;JPM), and Apollo Management, L.P., a private investment firm. AMC stockholders approved the merger
agreement governing the transaction at a special stockholders meeting held on December&nbsp;23, 2004 in Leawood, Kansas. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
accordance with the terms of the merger agreement, each outstanding share of AMC Common Stock and Class&nbsp;B Stock has been converted into the right to receive $19.50 per share in
cash, and each outstanding share of AMC Series&nbsp;A Convertible Preferred Stock has been converted into the right to receive $2,727.27 in cash. Shares of AMC Common Stock will continue to trade on
the American Stock Exchange until the market closes on December&nbsp;23, 2004 at 4:00 pm (EST) in accordance with American Stock Exchange trading policies; however, those shares will represent
solely the right to receive the merger consideration of $19.50 per share. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
transaction is valued at approximately $2&nbsp;billion ($1.67&nbsp;billion in equity and the assumption of approximately $750&nbsp;million in indebtedness, less approximately
$400&nbsp;million in cash and cash equivalents). AMC expects to continue to operate under its current name. As a result of the acquisition, AMC will cease to be publicly traded and accordingly will
no longer be listed on the American Stock Exchange after the market closes on December&nbsp;23, 2004. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMC
stockholders who have stock certificates in their own name will receive instructions by mail from UMB Bank, n.a., the exchange agent, concerning how and where to forward their
certificates for payment. AMC stockholders should exchange their stock certificates for the merger consideration
promptly following receipt of these materials. Brokers will handle conversion for those holding AMC stock through a brokerage account. </FONT></P>
