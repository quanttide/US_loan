<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;23, 2004, AMC Entertainment&nbsp;Inc. ("AMCE") completed a merger in which Marquee Holdings&nbsp;Inc. ("Holdings") acquired AMCE pursuant
to an Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of July&nbsp;22, 2004 (the "Merger Agreement"), by and among AMCE, Holdings and Marquee&nbsp;Inc. Marquee&nbsp;Inc., a wholly owned subsidiary of
Holdings, merged with and into AMCE, with AMCE remaining as the surviving entity (the "Merger") and becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of Holdings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the terms of the Merger Agreement, each issued and outstanding share of AMCE's common stock and Class&nbsp;B stock was converted into the right to receive $19.50 in cash
and each issued and outstanding share of AMCE's preferred stock was converted into the right to receive $2,727.27 in cash. The total amount of consideration to be paid in the Merger is approximately
$1.67&nbsp;billion. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holdings
used the net proceeds from the sale of AMCE notes (as described below), together with existing AMCE cash balances and the proceeds from the equity contribution from Holdings
(consisting of equity contributed by the Sponsors (as defined below), the co-investors and certain members of management and the net proceeds of an offering of Holdings notes), to finance
the Merger. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMCE
is 100% owned by Holdings. Holdings is owned by J.P. Morgan Partners (BHCA), L.P. and certain other affiliated funds managed by J.P. Morgan Partners, LLC (collectively, "JPMP") and
Apollo Investment Fund V, L.P. and certain related investment funds (collectively, "Apollo," and together with JPMP, the "Sponsors"), other co-investors and by certain members of
management as follows: JPMP (approximately 35.0%); Apollo (approximately 35.0%); Weston Presidio Capital IV, L.P. and WPC Entrepreneur Fund II, L.P. (approximately 6.4%); Co-Investment

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Fixed Rate Notes and Floating Rate Notes.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Merger, AMCE became the obligor of $250,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Fixed Rate Notes due 2012 ("Fixed Rate Notes") and
$205,000,000 in aggregate principal amount of Floating Rate Notes due 2010 ("Floating Rate Notes" and together with the Fixed Rate Notes, the "Senior Notes") that were previously issued by
Marquee&nbsp;Inc. on August&nbsp;18, 2004. The Senior Notes (i)&nbsp;rank senior in right of payment to any of AMCE's existing and future subordinated indebtedness, rank equally in right of
payment with any of AMCE's existing and future senior indebtedness and are effectively subordinated in right of payment to any of AMCE's secured indebtedness and (ii)&nbsp;are fully and

Fixed Rate Notes bear interest at the rate of 8<SUP>5</SUP>/<SMALL>8</SMALL>% per annum, payable on February&nbsp;15 and August&nbsp;15 of each year, commencing February&nbsp;15, 2005.
The Fixed Rate Notes are redeemable at AMCE's option, in whole or in part, at any time on or after August&nbsp;15, 2008 at 104.313% of the principal amount thereof, declining ratably to 100% of the
principal amount thereof on or after August&nbsp;15, 2010. The Floating Rate Notes bear interest at a rate per annum, reset quarterly, equal to 4<SUP>1</SUP>/<SMALL>4</SMALL>% plus the three-month LIBOR
interest rate. Interest on the Floating Rate Notes is payable quarterly on February&nbsp;15, May&nbsp;15, August&nbsp;15 and November&nbsp;15 and interest payments commenced on
November&nbsp;15, 2004. The interest rate is currently 6.54% per annum for the quarterly period ending February&nbsp;14, 2004. The Floating Rate Notes are redeemable, in whole or in part, on or

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Amended Credit Facility.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Concurrently with the consummation of the Merger, AMCE has entered into an amendment to AMCE's credit facility. AMCE refers to this amended credit facility as
"amended credit facility". The amended credit facility is available to, among other things, finance up to $20,000,000 of fees and expenses on the closing date of the Merger. As of September&nbsp;30,
2004, after giving pro forma effect to the Merger and the related transactions, AMCE would have had no amounts outstanding under the amended credit facility and issued approximately
$12.8&nbsp;million in letters of credit, leaving borrowing capacity under the amended credit facility of approximately $162.2&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
amended credit facility permits borrowings at interest rates based on either the bank's base rate or LIBOR, plus applicable margins ranging from 1.0% to 2.0% on base rate loans and
from 2.0% to 3.0% on LIBOR loans, and requires an annual commitment fee of 0.5% on the unused portion of the commitment. The amended credit facility matures on April&nbsp;9, 2009. The total
commitment under the amended credit facility is $175,000,000, but the amended credit facility contains covenants that limit AMCE's ability to incur debt (whether under the amended credit facility or
from other sources). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
amended credit facility includes several financial covenants, including (i)&nbsp;a maximum net indebtedness to Annualized EBITDA ratio (as defined in the amended credit facility)
(generally, the ratio of the principal amount of outstanding indebtedness (less cash and equivalents) as of the last day of the most recent quarter to earnings for the most recent four quarters before
interest, taxes, depreciation, amortization, any call premium (or original issue discount) expenses and other noncash charges, theatre closing or disposition costs, theatre opening costs, and gains or
losses from asset sales, except that expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related transactions are excluded and including an adjustment for any permanently closed, disposed of or
acquired theatre on a pro forma basis as if such closure, disposition or acquisition occurred on the first day of the calculation period), of Holdings of 5.75 to 1 with certain step-downs
of such ratio as agreed, (ii)&nbsp;a minimum cash interest coverage ratio, as defined in the amended credit facility except that expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related
transactions are excluded (generally, the ratio of Annualized EBITDA for the most recent four quarters to consolidated interest expense for such period of AMCE) of 1.75 to 1, and (iii)&nbsp;a ratio
of maximum net senior indebtedness to Annualized EBITDA of AMCE, as defined in the amended credit facility except that expenses incurred in connection with the Merger and related transactions shall be
excluded, for the most recent four quarters, as defined in the amended credit facility, of 3.5 to 1. The amended credit facility also generally imposes limitations on investments, the incurrence of
additional indebtedness, creation of liens, changes of control, transactions with affiliates, restricted payments, dividends, repurchase of capital stock or subordinated debt, mergers, investments,
guarantees, asset sales and business activities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
amended credit facility defines Annualized EBITDA for AMCE and its consolidated Subsidiaries as the Annualized EBITDA adjusted such that Annualized EBITDA that is attributable to a
particular theatre or a particular screen which was permanently closed for business or disposed of during a fiscal quarter or any acquired business or particular theatre is determined on a pro forma
basis as if such closure, disposition or acquisition had occurred on the first day of the most recently completed period of four fiscal quarters. Annualized EBITDA is defined in the amended credit
agreement as consolidated net income increased by the sum of all income taxes paid or accrued in accordance with U.S. GAAP for such period (other than income taxes attributable to extraordinary,
unusual or non-recurring gains or losses), consolidated interest expense, depreciation expense, amortization expense, any call premium (or original issue discount) expenses (cash and
non-cash) associated with the call or open market repurchases of subordinated debt and any other non-cash charges. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
amended credit facility allows AMCE to incur debt that qualifies as subordinated debt thereunder, and permits $125,000,000 of new debt plus capital lease obligations, subject to
meeting AMCE's financial covenants. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally,
certain of AMCE's domestic wholly owned subsidiaries guarantee the amended credit facility. The amended credit facility is secured by a pledge of AMCE's capital stock by
Holdings and substantially all of the tangible and intangible personal property located in the United States that AMCE or such guarantors own, which includes, but is not limited to, all the
outstanding stock of American Multi-Cinema,&nbsp;Inc., AMC-GCT,&nbsp;Inc. and its subsidiaries, AMC Entertainment International,&nbsp;Inc., National Cinema Network,&nbsp;Inc., AMC
Realty,&nbsp;Inc. and Centertainment,&nbsp;Inc. as well as accounts, deposit accounts, general intangibles (including patents, trademarks and other intellectual property), commercial tort claims,
goods and instruments, among other types of personal property. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Amounts
outstanding under the amended credit facility may become payable prior to the maturity date in part upon the occurrence of certain asset sales, or in whole upon the occurrence of
specified events of default. In addition to the non-payment of amounts due to lenders or non-performance of covenants, among other matters, an event of default will occur upon
(i)&nbsp;the failure to pay other indebtedness, or the acceleration of the maturity or redemption of other indebtedness or preferred stock in either case exceeding $5.0&nbsp;million,
(ii)&nbsp;the occurrence of any default which enables holders of any preferred stock to appoint additional members to the board and the occurrence of a change in control, as defined in the amended
credit facility, and (iii)&nbsp;any default under the terms applicable to any of AMCE's leases with aggregate remaining lease payments exceeding $13.0&nbsp;million which results in the loss of use
of the property subject to such lease or any default (that is not cured or waived or if cured or waived involved the payment of an amount in excess of $13.0&nbsp;million) under the terms applicable
to any such leases with aggregate remaining lease payments exceeding $50.0&nbsp;million. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Triggering Events that Accelerate or Increase a Direct Financial Obligation.  </B></FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the Merger, AMCE's obligation to offer to repurchase notes from the holders of 9.5% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2011, in the aggregate principal
amount of $214.5&nbsp;million, (the "2011 Notes"), became immediately due and owing. Under the change in control provisions of that certain Indenture pursuant to which the 2011 Notes were issued,
dated as of January&nbsp;27, 1999, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture, dated as of March&nbsp;29, 2002, and a Second Supplemental Indenture, dated as of December&nbsp;23, 2004
(collectively, the "Indenture"), holders of the 2011 Notes may require AMCE to repurchase their notes at 101% of their aggregate principal amount plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of
purchase. AMCE is obligated to make a change of control offer by January&nbsp;22, 2005 and must purchase all 2011 Notes tendered for repurchase no later than 60&nbsp;days from the date of
commencement of the change of control offer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMCE
has obtained a financing commitment, subject to customary conditions, from JPMorgan Chase Bank or affiliates thereof and Citicorp North America,&nbsp;Inc. in the amount of
$220,000,000 to finance any such repurchase. The maturity of the financing would be eight years from the issuance date of the senior notes. The terms of a financing pursuant to the financing
commitment would contain customary restrictions, including limiting AMCE's ability to incur indebtedness or liens, pay dividends, redeem capital stock, make certain investments and sell substantially
all of AMCE's and AMCE's subsidiaries' assets. AMCE would be required to redeem the debt under the financing commitment from the net proceeds of the sale of any assets outside the ordinary course of
business, the incurrence of any debt (other than debt permitted under AMCE's amended credit facility), which may be secured, and the issuance of any equity, subject to customary exceptions and
thresholds. AMCE would be able, at AMCE's option, to repay any outstanding loans under the financing commitment at any time at the principal amount thereof plus accrued and unpaid interest. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMCE's

rates or other preferences. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMCE's
Bylaws were similarly amended to remove references to classes of securities other than AMCE's outstanding common stock. AMCE's amended Bylaws provide that the number of directors

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the Merger, the Sponsors and the co-investors of Holdings entered into a stockholders agreement that defines their rights with
respect to voting, ownership and transfer of their interests in Holdings. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
stockholders agreement provides that the Board of Directors of Holdings and AMCE will consist of up to ten directors, three of whom shall be designated by JPMP, three of whom shall
be designated by Apollo, one of whom shall be the CEO of AMCE, and up to three of whom shall be independent designees, as jointly selected by the Sponsors. To date, no such independent directors have
been appointed to the AMCE Board. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
stockholders agreement further provides that, until the earlier of five years from the date of the Merger and the date on which Holdings completes an initial public offering
("Blockout Period"), the stockholders of Holdings (other than the Sponsors) will vote their shares of capital stock of Holdings as directed by the Sponsors. Each of JPMP and Apollo have consent rights
with respect to certain Holdings and/or AMCE actions, including, without limitation, change in control transactions, acquisition or disposition transactions with a value in excess of
$25&nbsp;million, the settlement of claims in excess of $25&nbsp;million, an initial public offering of Holdings, hiring a chief executive officer, incurring indebtedness in excess of
$50&nbsp;million or engaging in new lines of business. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During
the Blockout Period, the stockholders agreement prohibits the Sponsors and the co-investors from transferring any of their interests in Holdings, other than certain
permitted transfers to affiliates or their respective limited partners or members or to persons approved of by the Sponsors. The stockholders agreement sets forth additional transfer provisions for
the Sponsors and the co-investors with respect to their interests in Holdings, including the following: </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right of first offer.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holdings and each of its stockholders have a right of first offer to purchase (on a pro rata basis in
the case of the stockholders) all or any portion of the shares of Holdings that a stockholder is proposing to sell to a third party at the price and on the terms and conditions offered by such third
party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drag-along rights.</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If during the Blockout Period, the Sponsors, and following the Blockout Period, the
stockholders owning in the aggregate 50% or more of the outstanding capital stock of Holdings, propose to transfer shares of Holdings to a person in a bona fide arm's-length transaction or series of

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>Agreements with Management.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;AMCE entered into employment agreements with Messrs.&nbsp;Peter C. Brown, Philip M. Singleton, Richard T. Walsh, John D. McDonald and Craig R. Ramsey, each
effective as of July&nbsp;1, 2001 other than Messrs.&nbsp;Brown and Singleton, whose agreements are effective as of the consummation of the Merger. Such persons currently receive the following
annual salaries pursuant to their employment contracts:
Mr.&nbsp;Brown-$728,300; Mr.&nbsp;Singleton-$468,200; Mr.&nbsp;Walsh-$338,200; Mr.&nbsp;Ramsey-$331,500; and Mr.&nbsp;McDonald-$312,200. The employment agreements also provide for
discretionary bonuses, an automobile allowance, reimbursement of reasonable travel and entertainment expenses and other benefits offered from time to time to other executive officers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
employment agreement of Mr.&nbsp;Brown has a term of five years, that of Mr.&nbsp;Singleton has a term of three years and those of Mr.&nbsp;Walsh, Mr.&nbsp;Ramsey and
Mr.&nbsp;McDonald have terms of two years. On the anniversary date of each employment agreement, one year is added to its term, so that each employment agreement always has a five-year,
three-year or two-year term, as the case may be, as of each anniversary date. Each employment agreement terminates generally without severance if such employee is terminated
for cause or upon such employee's retirement or resignation without good reason, each as defined in his employment agreement. AMCE will pay the employee a pro rata portion of the bonus he would
otherwise be eligible to receive upon termination by reason of the employee's retirement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If
any of Messrs.&nbsp;Walsh, McDonald or Ramsey dies or is terminated without cause or following his disability or terminates his agreement subsequent to specified changes in his
responsibilities, annual base salary or benefits following a change of control, each as defined in the agreement, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to two years annual base
salary. If either Mr.&nbsp;Brown or Mr.&nbsp;Singleton dies, is terminated without cause or following his disability, or terminates his agreement for good reason or following a change of control,
each as defined in the agreement, he will be entitled to receive a lump sum cash payment equal to three times the sum of such employee's then annual base salary and annual bonus such employee would be
entitled to receive as if the target level had been obtained. In addition, he will also receive five additional years of credit for purposes of option vesting and he will have the right to require
Holdings to purchase from him all or any portion of his vested options and shares of Holdings common stock, in exchange for payment for shares equal to the fair market value of Holdings stock and
payment for options equal to the excess of such fair market value over the option exercise price, in each case less applicable withholding taxes ("put right"). Each of Messrs.&nbsp;Brown and
Singleton will also have a put right in the event of his retirement at or after age 65. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
connection with the Merger, Holdings and the Sponsors entered into a management stockholders agreement with each of Messrs.&nbsp;Brown, Singleton, Ramsey, Walsh, John McDonald, Mark
McDonald, Rolando Rodriguez and Kevin Connor. The management stockholders agreement defines the rights of the management employees with respect to the ownership and transfer of their interests in
Holdings, including transfer restrictions on shares, tag-along rights, drag-along rights, and piggy-back registration rights substantially similar to those imposed
on the co-investors in the stockholders agreement. In addition, the management stockholders are subject to the right of Holdings to repurchase their shares (and cancel options) upon
termination of employment. In the event a management stockholder's employment is terminated as a result of death or disability, without cause or for good reason, such repurchase would be made at the
fair market value of the shares. In the event a management stockholder's employment is terminated for any other reason, such repurchase would be made at the lesser of fair market value and the
purchase price paid for the
shares. The payment for cancelled options would be the excess of the share repurchase price over the exercise price, and no payment would be made for unvested options. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>2004 Stock Option Plan.  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holdings adopted a 2004 Stock Option Plan which provides for the grant of incentive stock options (within the meaning of Section&nbsp;42 of the Internal Revenue
Code), and non-qualified stock options to eligible employees of Holdings and its subsidiaries, consultants and non-employee directors of Holdings. The aggregate number of
shares subject to the option plan is 49,107.44681. The exercise price of the options is the fair market value of the shares underlying the options on the date of grant of the option. Options become
exercisable by the holders of the options in installments of 20% on each of the first five anniversaries of the grant date. In addition, upon the occurrence of a change of control of Holdings as
defined in the option plan, all options held by Messrs.&nbsp;Brown and Singleton under the plan will automatically accelerate. Any shares acquired pursuant to the exercise of options underlying the
option plan will be subject to the management stockholders agreement. </FONT></P>
