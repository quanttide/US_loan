of the Board of Directors, provide indemnification to employees and/or agents with the same scope and effect as the foregoing indemnification of directors and officers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;If
a claim under this Article Seventh is not paid in full by the Corporation within thirty days after a written claim has been received by the Corporation, the claimant may at
any time thereafter bring suit against the Corporation to recover the unpaid amount of the claim and if successful, in whole or in part, the claimant shall be entitled to be paid also the expense of
prosecuting such claim. It shall be a defense to any such action (other than an action brought to enforce a claim for expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of its final disposition
where the undertaking, if any is required, has been tendered to the Corporation) that the claimant has not met the standards of conduct which make it permissible under the Delaware General Corporation
Law for the Corporation to indemnify the claimant for the amount claimed, but the burden of providing such defense shall be on the Corporation. Neither the failure of the Corporation (including its
board of directors, independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) to have made a determination prior to the commencement of such action that indemnification of the claimant is proper in the
circumstances because he has met the applicable standard of conduct set forth in the Delaware General Corporation Law, no an actual determination by the Corporation (including its board of directors,
independent legal counsel, or its stockholders) that
the claimant had not met such applicable standard of conduct, shall be a defense to the action or create a presumption that claimant had not met the applicable standard of conduct. </FONT></P>
