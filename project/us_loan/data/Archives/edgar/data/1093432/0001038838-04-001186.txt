Item 2.01. Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets

Galtech Semiconductor Materials Corporation (GSM), announces that effective
December 20, 2004, International Amateur Sports Championships, Inc. (IASC), a
wholly owned subsidiary, which was formed to purchase up to 51% of United States
Amateur Motocross Championships, Inc. (USAMXC), has agreed to purchase 25.5% of
USAMXC for a purchase price of $500,000. IASC also has the option to purchase an
additional 25.5% of USAMXC for the same price. Information regarding USAMXC can
be obtained by going to their web site: www.attackmx.com. IASC authorized the
issuance of 1,000 shares of its Preferred Stock at a price of $500.00 per share
in order to purchase the 25.5%. Additionally, GSM agreed to issue and give
2,500,000 of Restricted GSM Common Stock to the purchaser of the Preferred as an
added incentive to purchase the stock.

The Preferred Shares carry a cumulative dividend of 9% per annum and are
convertible into GSM Common Stock at the rate of 5,000 shares of GSM for each
share of IASC Preferred Stock, at the option of the holder. The Preferred shares
are redeemable on or before one year from the date of issue for the face amount
plus the accrued dividend. The 25.5% interest in USAMXC serves as collateral for
the redemption of the Preferred Stock. IASC has authorized, and is in the
process of offering up to 4,000,000 Shares of Restricted Common Stock at a price
of $0.50 per share. ISAC intends to use a portion of the proceeds from the
offering to redeem the Preferred Shares.

Both the IASC Preferred Stock and the GSM Restricted Common Stock are to be
issued to Enterprise Group, LLC or their designee.*

*Enterprise Group, LLC may be considered to be an affiliate of Garry Quintana,
President of IASC and GSM. The financial statements of IASC and GSM will not be
filed with this report. However, they will be filed on or before February 18,
2005.
