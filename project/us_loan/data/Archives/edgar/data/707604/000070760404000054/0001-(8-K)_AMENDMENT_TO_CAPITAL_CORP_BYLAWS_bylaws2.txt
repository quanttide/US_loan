                              NATCHEZ, MISSISSIPPI


                           AMENDED AND RESTATED BYLAWS



                               ARTICLE I. OFFICES

     .........SECTION  1.01.  Principal  Office.  The  principal  office  of the
Corporation shall be at Natchez, Adams County, Mississippi.  The Corporation may
have such other  offices as the Board of Directors may designate or the business
of the Corporation may require.

     .........SECTION  1.02.  Registered  Office.  The registered  office of the
Corporation   required  by  the  Mississippi  Business  Corporation  Act  to  be
maintained in the State of Mississippi  may be, but need not be,  identical with
the Corporation's principal office, and the address of the registered office may
be changed from time to time by the Board of Directors as provided by law.

                            ARTICLE II. STOCKHOLDERS

     .........SECTION   2.01.   Annual  Meeting.   The  annual  meeting  of  the
stockholders  for the purpose of electing  directors and for the  transaction of
such other  business as may come  before the meeting  shall be held on such date
and at such time as the Board of Directors shall  determine.  The annual meeting
of  stockholders  may be held conjointly with the annual meeting of the Board of
Directors.

     .........SECTION   2.02.   Special   Meetings.   Special  meetings  of  the
stockholders,  for any purpose,  may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the
President or by a majority of the Board of Directors, and shall be called by the
President  at the request of the holders of not less than  one-tenth  of all the
outstanding  shares of the  Corporation  entitled to vote at the  meeting.  Such
request shall state the purposes of the proposed meeting. Business transacted at
all special meetings shall be confined to the objects stated in the call.

     .........SECTION  2.03.  Place  of  Meeting.  The  Board of  Directors  may
designate any place as the place of meeting for any meeting of the stockholders.
If no designation  is made,  the place of meeting shall be at the  Corporation's
principal office.

     .........SECTION  2.04. Notice of Meeting.  Written notice stating the time
and place of the  meeting  and,  in case of a special  meeting,  the purpose for
which the meeting is called,  shall be delivered not less than ten nor more than
sixty days before the date of the meeting,  either  personally or by mail, by or
at the direction of the President or the Secretary, or the other persons calling
the meeting,  to each stockholder of record entitled to vote at such meeting. If
mailed such notice shall be deemed to be delivered  when deposited in the United
States mail  addressed to the  stockholder at such  stockholder's  address as it
appears on the stock transfer books of the Corporation.

     .........SECTION  2.05. Closing of Transfer Books or Fixing of Record Date.
For the purpose of determining  stockholders entitled to notice of or to vote at


<PAGE>

any meeting of stockholders or any adjournment  thereof,  or entitled to receive
payment of any dividend, or in order to make a determination of stockholders for
any other  purpose,  the Board of Directors may provide that the stock  transfer
books shall be closed for a stated period not to exceed sixty days. If the stock
transfer  books  shall be closed  for the  purpose of  determining  stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of stockholders,  such books shall
be closed for at least ten days immediately  preceding such meeting.  In lieu of
closing the stock  transfer  books,  the Board of Directors may fix in advance a
date as the record date for any such determination of stockholders, such date to
be not more than sixty days and, in case of a meeting of stockholders,  not less
than ten days prior to the date on which the particular  action,  requiring such
determination of  stockholders,  is to be taken. If the stock transfer books are
not closed and no record  date is fixed for the  determination  of  stockholders
entitled to notice of or to vote at a meeting of  stockholders,  or stockholders
entitled  to receive  payment  of a  dividend,  the date on which  notice of the
meeting is mailed or the date on which the  resolution of the Board of Directors
declaring such dividend is adopted, as the case may be, shall be the record date
for such  determination  of  stockholders.  When a determination of stockholders
entitled  to vote at any  meeting of  stockholders  has been made as provided in
this section, such determination shall apply to any adjournment thereof.

     .........SECTION  2.06. Presiding Officer and the Secretary.  The President
or, in the President's absence, an officer designated by the Board of Directors,
shall preside at all  stockholder  meetings,  and the  Secretary  shall serve as
secretary.  Otherwise,  a  Chairman  and/or  Secretary  shall be  elected by the
stockholders present to act in the absence of those officers.

     .........SECTION  2.07. Voting Lists. The officer or agent having charge of
the stock transfer books of the Corporation shall make, at least ten days before
each meeting of stockholders,  a complete list of the  stockholders  entitled to
vote at such meeting,  arranged in alphabetical  order,  with the address of and
the number of shares held by each, which list, for a period of ten days prior to
such meeting,  shall be kept on file at the registered office of the Corporation
and shall be subject to inspection  by any  stockholder  for any proper  purpose
during usual business  hours.  Such list shall also be produced and kept open at
the time and place of the  meeting  and shall be  subject to  inspection  by any
stockholder  for any proper  purpose  during the  meeting.  The  original  stock
transfer book shall be prima facie  evidence as to the identity of  stockholders
entitled  to examine  such list or  transfer  books or to vote at any meeting of
stockholders.

     .........SECTION  2.08. Quorum. A majority of the outstanding shares of the
Corporation  entitled  to  vote,  represented  in  person  or  by  proxy,  shall
constitute a quorum at a meeting of stockholders. If less than a majority of the
outstanding  shares are  represented  at a meeting,  a majority of the shares so
represented may adjourn the meeting from time to time without further notice. At
such adjourned  meeting at which a quorum shall be present or  represented,  any
business may be  transacted  which might have been  transacted at the meeting as
originally  called.  The  stockholders  present at a duly organized  meeting may
continue to transact business until adjournment,  notwithstanding the withdrawal
of enough  stockholders  to leave  less than a quorum,  as long as not less than
one-third of the shares  entitled to vote at the meeting are  represented.  If a
quorum is present, or the above conditions are fulfilled so that business may be
transacted,  the affirmative  vote of the majority of the shares  represented at
the meeting and  entitled to vote on the subject  matter shall be the act of the
stockholders,  unless  the vote of a greater  number is  required  by law or the
articles of incorporation or elsewhere in these Bylaws by specific provision.


<PAGE>

     .........SECTION  2.09.  Proxies.  At  all  meetings  of  stockholders,   a
stockholder  may vote by proxy executed in writing by the  stockholder or by the
stockholder's duly authorized  attorney-in-fact.  Such proxy shall be filed with
the  Secretary  of the  Corporation  before or at the time of meeting.  No proxy
shall be valid  after  eleven  months  from  the date of its  execution,  unless
otherwise provided in the proxy.

     .........SECTION  2.10.  Voting of  Shares.  Subject to the  provisions  of
Section 2.12, each  outstanding  share entitled to vote shall be entitled to one
vote upon each matter submitted to a vote at a meeting of stockholders.

     .........SECTION 2.11. Voting of Shares by Certain Holders. Shares standing
in the name of another corporation or entity may be voted by such officer, agent
or proxy as the bylaws of such  corporation  or entity may  prescribe or, in the
absence of such provision,  as the board of directors or other governing body of
such corporation or entity may designate.

     .........Shares held by an administrator, executor, guardian or conservator
may be voted by such administrator, executor, guardian or conservator, either in
person or by proxy, without a transfer of such shares into such administrator's,
executor's,  guardian's or conservator's  name. Shares standing in the name of a
trustee  may be voted by the  trustee,  either in  person  or by  proxy,  but no
trustee shall be entitled to vote shares held by a trustee without a transfer of
such shares into that trustee's name.

     .........Shares  standing  in the name of a  receiver  may be voted by such
receiver,  and shares held by or under the control of a receiver may be voted by
such receiver without the transfer thereof into the receiver's name if authority
to do so is  contained  in an  appropriate  order of the  court  by  which  such
receiver was appointed.

     .........A  stockholder  whose shares are pledged shall be entitled to vote
such shares until the shares have been transferred into the name of the pledgee,
and thereafter the pledgee shall be entitled to vote the shares so transferred.

     .........The  Corporation  may own shares of its own stock as  provided  by
Mississippi  law. If the  Corporation  owns shares of its own stock at any time,
those shares shall not be voted,  directly or  indirectly,  at any meeting,  and
shall not be counted in  determining  the total number of shares  outstanding at
any given time.

     .........SECTION  2.12.  Cumulative  Voting. At each election for directors
every  stockholder  entitled  to vote at such  election  shall have the right to
vote, in person or by proxy,  the number of shares owned by that stockholder for
as many persons as there are directors to be elected and for whose election that
stockholder  has a right to vote,  or to cumulate  that  stockholder's  votes by
giving one candidate as many votes as the number of such directors multiplied by
the number of that  stockholder's  shares shall equal, or by  distributing  such
votes on the same principle among any number of such candidates.

     .........SECTION   2.13.   Stockholder   Proposals.

     .........(a) If any stockholder  desires to submit a proposal for action at
any meeting of stockholders, including the nomination of one or more individuals
for election as a director,  such stockholder  (hereinafter the "proponent") and
proposal  must  satisfy  and comply  with all of the  following  conditions  and
requirements:

<PAGE>


     ......... (1) At the time of submitting the proposal, the proponent must be
the  record or  beneficial  owner of at least 1% or  $1,000  in market  value of
shares  having  voting  power on the  proposal at the meeting and have held such
shares  for at least one year,  and the  proponent  shall  continue  to own such
shares through the date on which the meeting is held.

     .........  (2) The proposal must be submitted in writing and be accompanied
by written disclosure of the proponent's name, address,  number of shares owned,
the dates upon which such shares were acquired,  and documentary  support of the
proponent's ownership of such shares.

     .........  (3) The proposal and other required material must be received by
the  Corporation a reasonable  period of time in advance of the meeting to which
the  proposal  relates  and in any  event  must  comply  with  the  notification
requirements  set forth in Rule 14a-8 of Regulation 14A adopted  pursuant to the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended from time to time.

     .........  (4) If  the  proposal  nominates  one or  more  individuals  for
election as a director, the proposal must include or be accompanied by a written
statement of each nominee's  signed consent to being named as such a nominee and
to serve if elected.

     ......... (5) The proposal must be presented at the meeting for which it is
submitted by the proponent or a duly authorized and qualified representative.

     .........(b) If the proponent or proposal fails, in any respect, to satisfy
and comply with all of the foregoing  conditions and requirements,  the proposal
shall be deemed as not properly  coming  before the meeting and no votes cast in
support  of the  proposal  shall be given  effect,  except  for the  purpose  of
determining the presence of a quorum.

     .........(c) Notwithstanding any provision of these Bylaws to the contrary,
the Corporation may exclude from consideration by stockholders at any meeting of
stockholders   any  proposal   permitted   or  required  to  be  excluded   from
consideration by applicable law, rule or regulation.

     .........(d)  This Section 2.13 shall not be applicable to proposals placed
before any meeting of stockholders by action of the Board of Directors.

                         ARTICLE III. BOARD OF DIRECTORS

     .........SECTION  3.01.  General  Powers.  The  business and affairs of the
Corporation shall be managed and administered by its Board of Directors.  Except
as limited by law, all corporate  powers shall be vested in and exercised by the
Board.

     .........SECTION 3.02.  Qualifications.  In addition to such qualifications
as may be required by law or the Articles of  Incorporation,  beginning with the
annual meeting in the year 2000, no individual  shall be eligible to serve or to
continue to serve as a director  upon that  director  attaining  his or her 72nd
birthday.  Thereafter,  any  incumbent  director  who  attains the age of 72 may
remain in office until the next succeeding  annual meeting of  stockholders,  at
which  time  such   director   shall   retire  from  the  Board  of   Directors.
Notwithstanding  the  foregoing   provisions  of  this  Section  3.02,  retiring
directors may, upon invitation of the Board of Directors,  continue for a period
of up to an  additional  five (5) years in the capacity of  non-voting  advisory
members of the Board of Directors.

     .........SECTION  3.03. Number, Tenure and Election.  The Corporation shall

<PAGE>

have three classes of  directors,  each class to be as nearly equal in number as
possible, with the term of office of one class expiring each year. The number of
directors  of the  Corporation  shall be not less  than  five (5) nor more  than
twenty-five  (25), and the Board of Directors  shall establish by resolution the
number of directors to serve and the number of directors to comprise each class.
At each annual meeting, the number of directors equal to the number of the class
whose term expires at the time of such  meeting  shall be elected to hold office
for a term of three (3) years.

     .........Except  as  otherwise  provided in Section  3.13 below,  directors
shall be elected only at annual meetings of stockholders, and any vacancy in the
Board of  Directors,  however  created,  shall be filled at the  annual  meeting
succeeding the creation of such vacancy.  If the number of directors is changed,
any  increase  or  decrease  shall be  apportioned  among the  classes  so as to
maintain the number of directors in each class as nearly equal as possible,  and
any additional director of any class elected to fill a vacancy resulting from an
increase in such class shall hold office for a term that shall coincide with the
remaining  term of that  class,  but in no case will a decrease in the number of
directors shorten the term of any incumbent director.

     .........No  member  of the  Board of  Directors  may be  removed,  with or
without  cause,  except  at a  meeting  called  in  accordance  with the  Bylaws
expressly  for that  purpose and except upon a vote in favor of such  removal of
the holders of eighty  percent  (80%) of the shares then  entitled to vote at an
election of directors; and in the event that less than the entire Board is to be
removed,  no one of the  directors may be removed if the votes cast against that
director's   removal  would  be  sufficient  to  elect  that  director  if  then
cumulatively  voted at an  election  of the  class of  directors  of which  that
director is a part.

     .........SECTION  3.04. Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held without other notice than this bylaw,  immediately after
or  conjointly   with,  and  at  the  same  place  as,  the  annual  meeting  of
stockholders.  The Board of Directors  shall provide by resolution  the time and
place for the holding of  additional  meetings  without  other  notice than such
resolution.

     .........SECTION  3.05. Special Meetings.  Special meetings of the Board of
Directors may be called by or at the request of the  President,  the Chairman of
the Board of Directors or by a majority of the Board of Directors. The person or
persons  authorized  to call special  meetings of the Board of Directors may fix
any place as the place for holding any special meeting of the Board of Directors
called by them.

     .........SECTION  3.06. Action by Directors  Without a Meeting.  Any action
required to be taken at a meeting of the Board of Directors, or any action which
may be taken at a meeting of the directors,  may be taken without a meeting if a
consent in writing, setting forth the action so taken, shall be signed by all of
the directors entitled to vote with respect to the subject matter thereof.

     .........SECTION 3.07. Notice. Notice of any special meeting shall be given

investigative, including appeals (other than an action by or in the right of the
Corporation),  by  reason of the fact  that  such  person is or was a  director,
officer,  employee  or agent of the  Corporation,  or is or was  serving  at the
request of the Corporation as a director, officer, partner, employee or agent of
another  corporation,  partnership,  joint venture,  trust or other  enterprise,
against expenses (including attorneys' fees), judgments,  fines and amounts paid
in settlement actually and reasonably incurred by such person in connection with
such  action,  suit or  proceeding  if such person  acted in good faith and in a
manner  such  person  reasonably  believed  to be in or not  opposed to the best
interests  of the  Corporation,  and,  with  respect to any  criminal  action or
proceeding,  had no  reasonable  cause to  believe  such  person's  conduct  was
unlawful. The termination of any action, suit or proceeding by judgment,  order,
settlement,  conviction,  or upon a plea of nolo  contendere or its  equivalent,
shall not, of itself,  create a presumption  that the person did not act in good
faith and in a manner  which such  person  reasonably  believed  to be in or not
opposed to the best  interests  of the  Corporation,  and,  with  respect to any
criminal  action  or  proceeding,  had  reasonable  cause to  believe  that such
person's conduct was unlawful.

     .........SECTION  6.02. Suits by Corporation.  Subject to the provisions of
Section 6.04, the Corporation  shall indemnify any person who was or is a party,
or is threatened  to be made a party,  to any  threatened,  pending or completed
claim,  action  or suit by or in the  right  of the  Corporation  to  procure  a
judgment  in its  favor by  reason  of the fact  that  such  person  is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the  Corporation  as a director,  officer,  partner,  employee or
agent  of  another  corporation,  partnership,  joint  venture,  trust  or other
enterprise, against expenses (including attorneys' fees) actually and reasonably
incurred by such person in  connection  with the defense or  settlement  of such
action or suit if such  person  acted in good faith and in a manner  such person
reasonably  believed  to be in or not  opposed  to  the  best  interests  of the
Corporation,  except  that no  indemnification  shall be made in  respect of any
claim,  issue or matter as to which such person  shall have been  adjudged to be
liable for negligence or misconduct in the  performance of such person's duty to
the  Corporation

<PAGE>

unless  and only to the extent  that the court in which such  action or suit was
brought shall  determine upon  application  that,  despite the  adjudication  of

fairly and  reasonably  entitled to indemnity for such expenses which such court
shall deem proper.

     .........SECTION  6.03.  Successful Defense. To the extent that a director,

person  shall  be  indemnified  against  expenses  (including  attorneys'  fees)
actually  and  reasonably  incurred  by such  person  in  connection  therewith,
notwithstanding  that such person has not been  successful  on any other  claim,
issue or matter in any such action, suit or proceeding.

     .........SECTION    6.04.    Authorization    of    Indemnification.    Any
indemnification under Sections 6.01 or 6.02 shall (unless ordered by a court) be
made  by the  Corporation  only  as  authorized  in  the  specific  case  upon a
determination that indemnification of the director,  officer,  employee or agent
is  proper in the  circumstances  because  such  person  has met the  applicable
standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.01 or 6.02,  as the case may be. Such
determination  shall be made (l) by the Board of Directors by a majority vote of
a quorum  consisting  of  directors  who were not  parties  to, or who have been
wholly  successful  on the merits or  otherwise  with  respect  to,  such claim,
action, suit or proceeding, or (2) if such a quorum is not obtainable,  or, even
if obtainable, if a quorum of disinterested directors so directs, by independent
legal counsel in a written opinion, or (3) by the stockholders.

     .........SECTION  6.05. Advance Payments.  Expenses  (including  attorneys'
fees)  incurred  in  defending  a  civil  or  criminal  claim,  action,  suit or
proceeding may be paid by the Corporation in advance of the final disposition of
such claim,  action,  suit or proceeding as authorized in the manner provided in
Section 6.04 upon  receipt of an  undertaking  by or on behalf of the  director,
officer,  employee  or agent to repay such  amount if and to the extent it shall
ultimately be determined  that such person is not entitled to be  indemnified by
the Corporation as authorized in this section.

     .........SECTION 6.06. Exclusivity. The indemnification provided by Article
VI shall not be deemed  exclusive  of,  and shall be in  addition  to, any other
rights to which those  indemnified  may be entitled  under any statute,  rule of
law,  provision  in the  Corporation's  certificate  of  incorporation,  bylaws,
agreement, vote of stockholders or disinterested directors or otherwise, both as
to action in their official  capacity and as to action in another capacity while
holding  such  office,  shall  continue  as to a person  who has  ceased to be a
director,  officer,  employee  or agent and shall  inure to the  benefit  of the
heirs, executors and administrators of such a person.

     .........SECTION  6.07. Insurance.  The Corporation shall have the power to
purchase  and  maintain  insurance  on  behalf  of  any  person  who is or was a
director, officer, employee or agent of the Corporation, or is or was serving at
the request of the  Corporation  as a director,  officer,  partner,  employee or
agent  of  another  corporation,  partnership,  joint  venture,  trust  or other
enterprise,  against any liability  asserted against such person and incurred by
such  person in any such  capacity,  or arising out of such  person's  status as
such,  whether or not the  Corporation  would have the power to  indemnify  such
person against such liability under the provisions of this Section.

     .........SECTION  8.01. Conflicts of Interest.  In the absence of fraud, no
contract  or  other   transaction  of  the  Corporation  shall  be  affected  or

stockholder  of the  Corporation;  provided,  however,  that any  failure of the
stockholders to approve or ratify such contract,  transaction,  or act, when and

with such contract, transaction or action.
