<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">PITTSBURGH, Pa., December&nbsp;23, 2004 &#151; Dick&#146;s Sporting Goods, Inc. (NYSE: DKS)
announced today the successful completion of its previously announced solicitation to
amend the indenture related to its 2.375% Senior Convertible Notes due 2024 (CUSIP
Nos. 253393AA0 and 253393 AB 8) (the &#147;Notes&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The amendment eliminates a provision in the indenture that prohibits the Company from
paying cash upon a conversion of the Notes if an event of default, as defined in the
indenture, has occurred and is continuing at that time.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Georgeson Shareholder acted as information agent for the consent solicitation.
Merrill Lynch &#038; Co. acted as the solicitation agent.
