<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U><B>FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE</B></U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS FIRST SUPPLEMENTAL INDENTURE (this &#147;<U>First Supplemental Indenture</U>&#148;) is made as of
the 22nd day of December, 2004, between Dick&#146;s Sporting Goods, Inc. (the &#147;<U>Company</U>&#148;), and
Wachovia Bank, National Association, as trustee (the &#147;<U>Trustee</U>&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company and the Trustee heretofore executed and delivered an Indenture dated as
of February&nbsp;18, 2004 (the &#147;<U>Indenture</U>&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to the Indenture the Company issued, and the Trustee authenticated and
delivered, the Company&#146;s $255,085,000 Aggregate Principal Amount at Maturity Senior Convertible
Notes due 2024 (the &#147;<U>Securities</U>&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, Section&nbsp;11.2 of the Indenture provides that the Company, with the consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding,
and the Trustee may enter into an amendment, waiver or supplemental indenture thereto for the
purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions
of the Indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of the Securities to the
extent set forth therein; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, pursuant to its Consent Solicitation Statement dated December&nbsp;9, 2004, the Company
solicited consents of the Holders to the amendment set forth in this First Supplemental Indenture
(the &#147;<U>Amendment</U>&#148;); and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities
then outstanding have duly consented to the Amendment in accordance with Section&nbsp;11.2 of the
Indenture; and


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, all conditions necessary to authorize the execution and delivery of this First
Supplemental Indenture and to make this First Supplemental Indenture valid and binding have been
complied with or have been done or performed;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing and notwithstanding any provision of the
Indenture which, absent this First Supplemental Indenture, might operate to limit such action, the
Company and the Trustee agree as follows for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the
Securities:

AMENDMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.01 Amendment to Section&nbsp;4.1 and Section&nbsp;4.2 of the Indenture &#151; Conversion Privilege and
Conversion Procedure.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sections&nbsp;4.1(c) of the Indenture has been stricken in its entirety, and Section&nbsp;4.1(b) and
Section&nbsp;4.2(b) of the Indenture are hereby amended and restated in its entirety as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>SECTION 4.1. CONVERSION PRIVILEGE.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Holders&#146; rights to convert Securities into shares of Common Stock is subject to
the Company&#146;s obligation to pay each such Holder the amount of cash set forth in this paragraph, in
lieu of delivering some or all of such shares of Common Stock. The Company will pay to a Holder
cash for each $1,000 Principal Amount at Maturity of a Security surrendered for conversion in an
amount equal to the lesser of (1)&nbsp;the Accreted Principal Amount of such Security surrendered by
such Holder on the Conversion Date and (2)&nbsp;the product of (i)&nbsp;the number of shares of Common Stock
into which such Security otherwise would have been converted if no cash payment were made by the
Company, multiplied by (ii)&nbsp;the Average Sale Price of a share of Common Stock. The Company shall
determine that number of shares (the &#147;Balance Shares&#148;) which equals the number of shares of Common
Stock into which such Security of such Holder otherwise would be converted if no cash payment were
made by the Company, reduced, but not below zero, by an amount equal to the Accreted Principal
Amount of such Security on the Conversion Date, divided by the Average Sale Price of a share of
Common Stock. If the number of Balance Shares is zero, a Holder will not be entitled to any further
payment of cash or shares upon conversion. If the number of Balance Shares is greater than zero,
the Company will have the option to deliver cash or a combination of cash and shares of Common
Stock for the Balance Shares by electing for each full Balance Share for which the Company has
chosen to deliver cash to pay cash in an amount equal to the Average Sale Price of a share of
Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>SECTION 4.2. CONVERSION PROCEDURE.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;The Company shall deliver to the Holder surrendering such Security the amount of cash
payable with respect to such Security no later than the second Business Day following the
determination of the applicable Average Sale Price, together with a certificate for the number of
full shares of Common Stock, if any, deliverable upon the conversion (to the extent certificated)
and cash in lieu of any fractional share determined pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.3 hereof. If shares of
Common Stock are delivered as consideration, then the Person in whose name the certificate
representing such shares is registered shall be treated as a stockholder of record of the Company
on and after the Conversion Date; provided, however, that no surrender of a Security on any date
when the stock transfer books of the Company shall be closed shall be effective to constitute the
Person or Persons entitled to receive the shares of Common Stock upon such conversion as the record
holder or holders of such shares of Common Stock on such date, but such surrender shall be
effective to constitute the Person or Persons entitled to receive such shares of Common Stock as
the record holder or holders thereof for all purposes at the close of business on the next
succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open; such conversion shall be at the
Conversion Rate in effect on the Conversion Date. Upon conversion of a Security, such Person shall
no longer be a Holder of such Security.

novation, reissuance or disposition of the indebtedness represented by the Securities or to create
new indebtedness in respect of the indebtedness represented by the Securities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.03 Indenture and First Supplemental Indenture Construed Together.</B>

is required under the Trust Indenture Act to be part of and govern any provision of this First
Supplemental Indenture, the provision of the Trust Indenture Act shall control. If any provision
of this First Supplemental Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act
that may be so modified or excluded, the provision of the Trust Indenture Act shall be deemed to
apply to the Indenture as so modified or to be excluded by this First Supplemental Indenture, as
the case may be.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.06 Severability.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In case any provision in this First Supplemental Indenture shall be invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
