Item 8.01     Other Events.
         See Item 7 - Management's Discussion and Analysis - "Future Earnings
Potential - FERC Matters - Southern Power PPA" of Savannah Electric and Power
Company ("Savannah Electric") and Note 3 to the financial statements of Savannah
Electric under "FERC Matters" in Item 8 of the Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the year ended December 31, 2003 and Note (J) to the Condensed Financial
Statements in the Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September
30, 2004, for information on the Plant McIntosh construction project, which is
jointly owned by Savannah Electric and Georgia Power Company. On December 21,
2004, the Georgia Public Service Commission ("Georgia PSC") voted to approve a
new three-year retail rate plan for Georgia Power ending December 31, 2007
("2004 Plan"). In the 2004 Plan, the Georgia PSC approved the transfer of the
Plant McIntosh construction project, which is scheduled for completion in June
2005, at a total fair market value of approximately $385 million. This value
reflects an approximate $16 million disallowance from the total original
transfer cost of approximately $401 million. This disallowance will reduce
Savannah Electric's 2004 net income by approximately $1.5 million. The Georgia
PSC also certified the total completion cost of the project; thus, if the actual
cost exceeds the certified amount, additional disallowances may occur upon
completion.

                                    SIGNATURE

         Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Act of 1934, the
