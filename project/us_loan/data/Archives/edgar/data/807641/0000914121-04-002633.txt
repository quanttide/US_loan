Structure of the Principal Certificates

Description of Principal and Interest Distributions

Principal will be paid as described under the definition of "Principal
Distributions on the Principal Certificates". Prior to the Step-Down Date all
principal collected or advanced on the Mortgage Loans will be paid to the
Principal Certificates as described herein. On or after the Step-Down Date, so
long as no Trigger Event is in effect, the Principal Certificates will be paid,
in order of seniority, principal only to the extent necessary to maintain their
credit enhancement target. Excess interest will be available to support the
overcollateralization target (which is one component of the credit support
available to the Certificateholders).

Interest will be paid monthly, on all of the Offered Certificates, at a rate of
one-month LIBOR plus a margin that will step up after the Optional Clean-up Call
date, subject to the lesser of the WAC Cap or the applicable loan group cap.
Interest will be paid monthly, on all of the Fixed Rate Certificates, at a
specified rate that will step up after the Optional Clean-up Call date, subject
to the WAC Cap. The interest paid to each class of Principal Certificates will
be reduced by their allocable share of prepayment interest shortfalls not
covered by compensating interest and shortfalls resulting from the application
of the Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, (or any similar state statute) allocated
to such class. Any reductions in the Pass-Through Rate on the Principal
Certificates attributable to the WAC Cap or the applicable loan group cap will
be carried forward with interest at the applicable Pass-Through Rate as
described below and will be payable after payment of all required principal
payments on such future Distribution Dates.

Definitions

Credit Enhancement. The Offered Certificates are credit enhanced by (1) the Net
Monthly Excess Cash Flow from the Mortgage Loans, (2) 1.95%
overcollateralization (funded upfront) (after the Step-down Date, so long as a
Trigger Event is not in effect, the required overcollateralization will equal
3.90% of the aggregate scheduled principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of
the last day of the related Due Period, subject to a floor equal to 0.50% of the
aggregate scheduled balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date), and
(3) subordination of distributions on the more subordinate classes of
certificates to the required distributions on the more senior classes of
certificates.

Credit Enhancement Percentage. For any Distribution Date, the percentage
obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate class certificate balance of the
subordinate certificates (including any overcollateralization and taking into
account the distributions of the Principal Distribution Amount for such
Distribution Date) by (y) the aggregate scheduled principal balance of the
Mortgage Loans as of the last day of the related Due Period.

Step-Down Date. The earlier of (A) the date on which the aggregate class
certificate balance of the Class A Certificates has been reduced to zero and (B)
the later to occur of:

(x) the Distribution Date occurring in February 2008; and

(y) the first Distribution Date on which the Credit Enhancement Percentage for
the Class A Certificates is greater than or equal to 41.70%.

      proviso) the class certificate balance of any class of Class A
      certificates is reduced to zero (considering the Class A-1A and Class A-1B
      certificates as one class for the purposes of this proviso only), then the

            Distribution Amount and the portion of the Class A Principal
            Distribution Amount allocable to the Class A-2 Certificates,
            determined in accordance with the Class A Principal Allocation
            Percentage for that class, until the class certificate balance
            thereof has been reduced to zero,

      provided, that if after making distributions pursuant to paragraphs (a)
      and (b) above on any Distribution Date (without giving effect to this

class certificate balances of the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3, Class B-1,
Class B-2, Class B-3 and Class B-4 Certificates and the principal balance of the
Class X Certificates have been reduced to zero, any principal distributions
allocated to the Class A Certificates are required to be allocated pro rata to

overcollateralization amount, third to the Class B-4 Certificates, fourth to the
Class B-3 Certificates, fifth to the Class B-2 Certificates, sixth to the Class
B-1 Certificates, seventh to the Class M-3 Certificates, eighth to the Class M-2

Available Funds Cap(1)(2). The information in the following table has been
prepared in accordance with the following assumptions (i) one-month LIBOR and
six-month LIBOR remain constant at 20.00%, and (ii) prepayments on the mortgage
loans occur at the Pricing Prepayment Assumption. It is highly unlikely,
however, that prepayments on the mortgage loans will occur at the Pricing
Prepayment Assumption or at any other constant percentage.

Structure of the Offered Certificates
- -------------------------------------

Description of Principal and Interest Distributions
- ---------------------------------------------------

Principal will be paid as described under the definition of "Principal
Distributions on the Offered Certificates". Prior to the Step-Down Date all
principal collected or advanced on the Mortgage Loans will be paid to the
Offered Certificates as described herein. On or after the Step-Down Date, so
long as no Trigger Event is in effect, the Offered Certificates will be paid, in
order of seniority, principal only to the extent necessary to maintain their
credit enhancement target. Excess interest will be available to support the
overcollateralization target (which is one component of the credit support
available to the Certificateholders).

Interest will be paid monthly, on all of the Offered Certificates, at a rate of
one-month LIBOR plus a margin that will step up after the Optional Clean-up Call
date, subject to the lesser of the WAC Cap or the applicable loan group cap.
Interest will be paid monthly, on all of the Fixed Rate Certificates, at a
specified rate that will step up after the Optional Clean-up Call date, subject
to the WAC Cap. The interest paid to each class of Offered Certificates will be
reduced by their allocable share of prepayment interest shortfalls not covered
by compensating interest and shortfalls resulting from the application of the
Servicemembers Civil Relief Act, (or any similar state statute) allocated to
such class. Any reductions in the Pass-Through Rate on the Offered Certificates
attributable to the WAC Cap or the applicable loan group cap will be carried
forward with interest at the applicable Pass-Through Rate as described below and
will be payable after payment of all required principal payments on such future
Distribution Dates.

Definitions
- -----------

Credit Enhancement. The Offered Certificates are credit enhanced by (1) the Net
Monthly Excess Cash Flow from the Mortgage Loans, (2) 1.95%
overcollateralization (funded upfront) (after the Step-down Date, so long as a
Trigger Event is not in effect, the required overcollateralization will equal
3.90% of the aggregate scheduled principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of
the last day of the related Due Period, subject to a floor equal to 0.50% of the
aggregate scheduled balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date), and
(3) subordination of distributions on the more subordinate classes of
certificates to the required distributions on the more senior classes of
certificates.

Credit Enhancement Percentage. For any Distribution Date, the percentage
obtained by dividing (x) the aggregate class certificate balance of the
subordinate certificates (including any overcollateralization and taking into
account the distributions of the Principal Distribution Amount for such
Distribution Date) by (y) the aggregate scheduled principal balance of the
Mortgage Loans as of the last day of the related Due Period.

Step-Down Date. The earlier of (A) the date on which the aggregate class
certificate balance of the Class A Certificates has been reduced to zero and (B)
the later to occur of:

(x) the Distribution Date occurring in February 2008; and

(y) the first Distribution Date on which the Credit Enhancement Percentage for
the Class A Certificates is greater than or equal to 41.70%.
