                             BRIDGE CAPITAL HOLDINGS
                ISSUES $12 MILLION OF TRUST PREFERRED SECURITIES


SAN JOSE,  CALIFORNIA - DECEMBER 21, 2004 -- Bridge  Capital  Holdings  (NASDAQ:
BBNK),  whose sole  subsidiary  is Bridge Bank,  National  Association,  Silicon
Valley's newest  business bank,  announced today the completion of a $12 million
offering of fixed rate trust preferred securities. The proceeds from the sale of
these securities will be used to support  continued  expansion of the operations
of the Bridge Bank and for general corporate purposes.

The trust  preferred  securities  mature in March 2035,  are  redeemable  at the
company's option beginning in March 2010, and anticipate quarterly distributions
at a fixed rate of 5.9%. The trust preferred securities,  which will be recorded
as a long-term liability for financial  reporting purposes,  are subordinated to
other  borrowings  that may be obtained by the company in the future and qualify
as capital for regulatory  purposes.  The Bank Investment Group, LLC facilitated
the issue as part of a pooled  offering  placed by Cohen  Bros.  &  Company.  JP
Morgan Chase will act as the trustee for the securities.

Bridge  Bank  obtained  charter  approval  in late  2000.  In its first  year of
operation  the bank  raised  over $33  million of  capital,  one of the  largest
capitalizations  within that time frame for any bank in California.  Bridge Bank
has been recognized as one of the fastest growing banks in California as well as
the United  States.  At  September  30,  2004,  just over three  years from it's
opening,  the Bank  reported  total  assets of $385  million  with  earnings  of
$817,000 for the quarter.

Bridge Bank maintains full service regional banking offices in downtown San Jose
and Palo Alto, a regional loan production  office in Santa Clara for asset-based
lending and  factoring,  and has regional  Small  Business  Administration  loan
