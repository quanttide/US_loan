ITEM 2.03         CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION
                  UNDER AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.

      On December 21, 2004, Bridge Capital Holdings (the "Company") completed a
private placement to an institutional investor of $12 million of fixed rate
trust preferred securities, through a newly formed Delaware trust affiliate,
Bridge Capital Holdings Trust I (the "Trust"). The trust preferred securities
mature in March 2035, are redeemable at the Company's option beginning after
five years, and require quarterly distributions by the Trust to the holder of
the trust preferred securities at a rate of 5.9% until March 2010, after which
the rate will adjust quarterly to equal LIBOR plus 1.98%.

      The proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities were used by
the Trust to purchase from the Company $12,372,000 in aggregate principal amount
of the Company's fixed rate junior subordinated notes (the "Notes"). The net
proceeds to the Company from the sale of the Notes to the Trust will be used by
the Company for general corporate purposes, primarily funding the growth of its'
bank subsidiary, Bridge Bank, National Association.

      The Notes were issued pursuant to a Junior Subordinated Indenture (the
"Indenture"), dated December 21, 2004, by and between the Company and JP Morgan
Chase Bank, as trustee. Like the trust preferred securities, the Notes bear
interest at a fixed rate of 5.9% until March 2010, after which the rate will
adjust quarterly to equal LIBOR plus 1.98%. The interest payments by the Company
will be used to pay the quarterly distributions payable by the Trust to the
holder of the trust preferred securities. However, so long as no event of
default, as described below, has occurred under the Notes, the Company may defer
interest payments on the Notes (in which case the Trust will be entitled to
defer distributions otherwise due on the trust preferred securities) for up to
20 consecutive quarters.

      The Notes are subordinated to the prior payment of any other indebtedness
of the Company that, by its terms is not similarly subordinated and although the
Notes will be recorded as a long term liability on the Company's balance sheet,
for regulatory purposes the Notes will be treated as Tier 1 or Tier 2 capital
under rulings of the Federal Reserve Board, the Company's primary federal
regulatory agency.

      The Notes mature on March 15, 2035, but may be redeemed at the Company's
option at any time on or after March 15, 2010 or at any time upon certain
events, such as a change in the regulatory capital treatment of the Notes, the
Trust being deemed an investment company or the occurrence of certain adverse
tax events. In each case, the Company may redeem the Notes for their aggregate
principal amount, plus accrued interest, if any.

      The Notes may be declared immediately due and payable at the election of
the trustee or holders of 25% of aggregate principal amount of outstanding Notes
upon the occurrence of an event of default. An event of default generally means
(1) default in the payment of any interest when due that continues unremedied
for a period of thirty (30) days, except in the case of an election by the
Company to defer payments of interest for up to 20 consecutive quarters (which
does not constitute an event of default); (2) a default in the payment of the
principal amount of the Notes at maturity; (3) a default in the payment of any
interest following the deferral of interest payments by the Company for 20

                                       2

consecutive quarters; (4) a default in the Company's performance, or breach, of
any covenant or warranty in the Indenture which is not cured within ninety (90)
days; (5) the institution of any bankruptcy or similar proceedings by or against
the Company; or (6) the liquidation or winding up of the Trust, other than as
contemplated in the Indenture.

      The Company also has entered into a Guarantee Agreement pursuant to which
it has agreed to guarantee the payment by the Trust of distributions on the
trust preferred securities, and the payment of principal of the trust preferred
securities when due, either at maturity or on redemption, but only if and to the
extent that the Trust fails to pay distributions on or principal of the trust
preferred securities after having received interest payments or principal
payments on the Notes from the Company for the purpose of paying those
distributions or the principal amount of the trust preferred securities.

      A copy of the press release announcing the issuance of the trust preferred
securities is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by
reference.

      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
