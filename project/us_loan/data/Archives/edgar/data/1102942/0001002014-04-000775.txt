<B><P>VISUALMED CLINICAL SOLUTIONS CORP sees faster growth in market for hospital informatics</P>

<P>Shareholders Approve of Name Change</P>

<P>MONTREAL, DECEMBER 14, 2004 </B> -  VisualMED Clinical Solutions Corporation (<B>OTC BB VMCS</B>), is pleased to report that its shareholders have recently agreed to change the name of the company following the acquisition on October 13, 2004 of the VisualMED suite of clinical software modules that provide clinical information solutions for hospitals and other healthcare agencies. As a result, the company will now be trading under the symbol <B>VMCS</B> on the <B>OTC BB</B> in the United States.</P>

<P>Gerard Dab, Chairman &amp; CEO, says: "I'm very pleased that shareholders have agreed to change our name to VisualMED Clinical Solutions Corporation, a name that certainly reflects the real nature of our business activity and its growth potential."

<P>For those not familiar with the company, VisualMED Clinical Solutions Corp. now markets and distributes one of the top rated clinical management solutions that help hospitals and healthcare authorities reduce medication errors, increase personnel efficiency and bring down operating costs.</P>

<P>One of its key components, Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), is a core solution in the new agenda to promote greater patient safety and reduce the growing death rate from medication errors.</P>

<P>This agenda implies the emergence of a new multi-billion dollar market for Clinical Information Systems like VisualMED's, a market in which the VisualMED system is favourably positioned to play a major role.</P>

<B><P>Independent Evaluation</P>
</B>
<P>The VisualMED technology has been repeatedly evaluated by independent agencies including the Leapfrog Group (<u>www.leapfroggroup.org</U>) and Five Rights Consulting. It has consistently been ranked as one of the more complete and efficacious solutions in its field. It is one of the few commercial applications that is consistently being used on a daily basis by the entire medical and nursing staff of a hospital. </P>

<P>The VisualMED technology was also positively evaluated after an in-depth audit for the benefit of a Canadian governmental agency by Dr. Antoine Geisbuhler, formerly of Vanderbilt University Medical School, Tennessee and holder of the Chair of Medical Informatics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Geneva, Switzerland.</P>

<B><P>The Market</P>
</B>
<P>American and European hospitals are under increasing pressure to address mounting evidence of major increase in hospital deaths due to medical errors and adverse drug reactions (ADE's). The March, 2000 report "<I>To Err is Human</I>" released by the Washington-based Institute of Medicine alerted the public and the authorities to this problem, disclosing that up to 100,000 Americans die each year from adverse drug reactions, half of which it considered preventable. Since then, evaluations of deaths from adverse drug reactions have been as high as 200,000 in the U.S., 85,000 in the U.K., and 23,000 in Canada.</P>

<P>A coalition of some of America's largest employers and healthcare purchasers helped to create the Leapfrog Group, a non-profit organization dedicated to promoting information solutions for hospitals, and to help guide them in the acquisition of such solutions. In particular, Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE) systems, with decision support, are deemed to be the core component of an effective clinical information system to replace paper-based records. To date, more than 500 hospitals in America have registered with the Leapfrog Group, pledging to move towards the new standards it has set. As well, government authorities on all levels have begun to legislate mandatory reduction of accidental hospital deaths and adverse drug events.</P>

<P>In Europe, Italy, France and the U.K. have passed laws providing for nationwide, publicly funded Electronic Medical Records. Similar initiatives are underway in Australia, Canada, Sweden and Denmark.</P>

<B><P>Market Size</P>
</B>
<P>There are over 5,500 hospitals in the United States and Canada, and three times as many in Europe, making up most of the potential market for the VisualMED technology. According to the Leapfrog Group, relatively few American sites have experimented with physician-based clinical support order entry, and most of these have been limited to large centers whose mainframe technology is not easily transferable. According to the Healthcare Information and Management Systems Society (HIMSS), less than 10% of hospitals say that they have some form of CPOE or decision support. </P>

<P>Cost of implementation of a Clinical Information System can vary between 2 and 20 million dollars depending on the size of the hospital and the nature of the selected technology. A leading U.S. consulting organization believes that 50% of hospitals in America will be moving to CPOE in the next 4 years. </P>

<P>VisualMED management believes in a more cautious scenario, one that would see between 10 and 15% of hospitals adopting CPOE in this time frame. However this would still represent a multi-billion dollar market opportunity for our industry.</P>

<B><P>The Product</P>
</B>
<P>The VisualMED technology was developed, tested, and has been in continuous use since 1994 at Montreal's Royal Victoria Hospital, one of McGill University's main teaching hospitals. Since 1999, more than US$30,000,000 has been spent to expand functionality and turn the technology into an effective commercial platform.</P>

<P>VisualMED is the <B>Electronic Medical Record</B>. VisualMED obviates the need for redundant, paper-based activities by doctors and nurses. All patient care is prescribed and documented in an electronic media that may include wireless devices with remote access via an Internet portal. The CPOE (computerized physician order entry) module uses an expert system with a knowledge base and an inference engine that validates information provided by the user according to thousands of expert-based algorithms.  </P>

<P>The VisualMED Clinical System is a tool through which the healthcare team provides the patient with an improved quality of care. The risk of adverse drug events (ADE's) with their attendant morbidity and mortality, as well as the resulting prolonged length of hospitalization, is greatly reduced. Medication side-effects are reduced, prescriptions, lab tests and radiology exams are not needlessly duplicated, and important clinical information is brought to the attention of the prescriber proactively, so that complications of therapy may be avoided. Availability of charts is immediate, and can be transmitted worldwide via the internet (EMR).</P>

<B><P>About the Company</P>
</B>
<P>The VisualMED Clinical Information System (CIS) is a unique software application built to conform to the way doctors and nurses provide and document patient care. The VisualMED CIS is the only solution of its kind to have been wholly designed by practicing medical staff in terms of both workflow and user interface. </P>

<P>State-of-the art design is at the basis of product scalability - the only CIS that can be implemented across a single care unit, hospital, or region. Object-oriented design and table-driven programming allows for cost-effective development that can rapidly respond to advances in medicine and surgery and informatics itself.    </P>

<P>VisualMED Clinical Solutions Corp. markets and distributes clinical management solutions that help hospitals and healthcare authorities reduce medication errors, increase personnel efficiency and bring down operating costs. One of its key components, Computerized Physician Order Entry (CPOE), is a core solution in the new agenda to promote greater patient safety and reduce the growing death rate from medication errors.</P>
