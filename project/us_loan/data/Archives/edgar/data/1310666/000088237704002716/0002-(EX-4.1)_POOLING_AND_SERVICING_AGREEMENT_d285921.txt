(collectively, the "Certificates"), to be issued hereunder in multiple classes,
which in the aggregate shall evidence the entire beneficial ownership interest
in each REMIC (as defined herein) created hereunder. The Trust Fund shall
consist of a segregated pool of assets consisting of the Mortgage Loans and
certain other related assets subject to this Agreement.

                  As provided herein, the Trustee shall elect to treat the

related assets (other than any Master Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment
Amounts, the Pre-Funding Accounts, the Interest Coverage Accounts, any
Subsequent Mortgage Loan Interest, the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account
and the Cap Contracts) subject to this Agreement as a REMIC for federal income
tax purposes, and such segregated pool of assets shall be designated as "REMIC

(1)  Solely for purposes of Section 1.860G-1(a)(4)(iii) of the Treasury
     regulations, the Distribution Date immediately following the maturity date
     for the Mortgage Loan with the latest maturity date has been designated as

     II-LTP. The Class CE Certificates shall not accrue interest on their
     Certificate Principal Balance.
(4)  The Class P Certificates shall not accrue interest.

Distribution Date shall be allocated first, (a) with respect to the Group I
Mortgage Loans, to REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT1 and REMIC I Regular Interest
I-LT1PF, in each case to the extent of one month's interest at the then
applicable respective REMIC I Remittance Rate on the respective Uncertificated

Group I Mortgage Loans shall be allocated to REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT1 and
such amounts relating to the Subsequent Group I Mortgage Loans shall be

to the first three Distribution Dates, such amounts relating to the Initial
Group I Mortgage Loans shall be allocated to REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT2 and
such amounts relating to the Subsequent Group II Mortgage Loans shall be
allocated to REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT2PF.

Interest for the REMIC II Regular Interests for any Distribution Date:

                  (A) The REMIC II Marker Allocation Percentage of the aggregate
         amount of any Prepayment Interest Shortfalls (to the extent not covered
         by payments by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.03(e)) and the
         REMIC II Marker Allocation Percentage of any Relief Act Interest
         Shortfalls incurred in respect of the Mortgage Loans for any

                  SECTION 1.03 Rights of the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer.

                  (a) Each of the rights of the NIMS Insurer set forth in this
Agreement shall exist so long as (i) the NIMS Insurer has undertaken to

(i) the NIMS Insurer has not undertaken to guarantee certain payments of Insured
Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture or (ii) any default has occurred and is
continuing under the insurance policy issued by the NIMS Insurer with respect to
such Insured Notes. If and when (i) no Insured Notes remain outstanding, (ii)
any Guaranteed Certificates remain outstanding and (iii) no default under the
Guaranty shall have occurred and be continuing, the Guarantor shall be entitled
to exercise the rights of the NIMS Insurer set forth in this Agreement.

                  (b) In addition to the specific rights of the NIMS Insurer and
the Guarantor identified in this Agreement but subject to the provisions of
Section 8.01(iii) and Section 8.02(a)(v), the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as
provided in Section 1.03(c)) shall have the right to direct the Trustee relating
to the exercise of any remedy available to the Trustee or the exercise of any
power conferred on the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary anywhere in this Agreement, all rights of the Guarantor
hereunder, except any rights to indemnification, shall permanently terminate
upon the later to occur of (A) such time as the Guaranteed Certificates shall no
longer be outstanding and (B) the payment in full to the Guarantor of any
amounts owed to the Guarantor in respect of its guarantee of payment on the
Guaranteed Certificates; provided that the Guarantor shall not have any rights
hereunder, except indemnification rights, so long as any default has occurred
and is continuing under the Guaranty.

                  (c) The rights of the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor referenced
in Sections 1.03(b), 3.02, 6.04, 6.06(a), 6.07, 7.01, 7.02(a), 7.04, 8.07 and
8.10 of this Agreement shall be applied as follows:

                  (i) In the event that the Class M-8 Certificates are rated at
         least "BBB" (in the case of Fitch and/or S&P) or "Baa2" (in the case of
         Moody's) by at least two of the three Rating Agencies, the NIMS Insurer
         shall have the right to act, after consultation with the Guarantor;

                  (ii) In the event that (x) the rating of the Class M-8
         Certificates is reduced by two of the three Rating Agencies to less
         than "BBB" or "Baa2" and (y) the Certificate



                                       62
<PAGE>



         Principal Balance of the Class M-9 Certificates is greater than zero or
         the Overcollateralized Amount is greater than zero, the NIMS Insurer
         and the Guarantor each shall have the right to act, upon the receipt of
         the reasonable consent of the other;

                  (iii) In the event that (x) the rating of the Class M-8
         Certificates is reduced by two of the three Rating Agencies to less
         than "BBB" or "Baa2" and (y) each of the Certificate Principal Balance
         of the Class M-9 Certificates and the Overcollateralized Amount is
         equal to zero, the Guarantor shall have the sole right to act; and

                  (iv) In the event that (x) no Guaranteed Certificates remain
         outstanding, (y) all amounts owed to the Guarantor have been paid in
         full and (z) any Insured Notes remain outstanding, then notwithstanding
         clauses (i) through (iii) hereof, the NIMS Insurer will have the sole
         right to act.

                  (d) The Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer shall promptly consult
each other with regard to the rights referred to in this Section. If this
consultation would create a delay that would have a material adverse effect on
this transaction, each party may act individually with respect to their rights
and consult with the other party after such action has been taken. Any consents
required between the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor shall not be unreasonably
withheld or delayed.

                                   ARTICLE II

                          CONVEYANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS;
                        ORIGINAL ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES

                  SECTION 2.01 Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.

                  The Depositor, concurrently with the execution and delivery
hereof, does hereby transfer, assign, set over and otherwise convey to the
Trustee without recourse for the benefit of the Certificateholders all the
right, title and interest of the Depositor, including any security interest
therein for the benefit of the Depositor, in and to the Mortgage Loans
identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, the rights of the Depositor under the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, all other assets included or to be included in
REMIC I (including any payments made under the Cap Contracts). Such assignment
includes all interest and principal received by the Depositor or the Master
Servicer on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans (other than payments of
principal and interest due on such Mortgage Loans on or before the Cut-off
Date). The Depositor herewith delivers to the Trustee an executed copy of the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, the Original Pre-Funded Amounts, the PMI
Policies and the required deposit, if any, to the Interest Coverage Accounts,
and the Trustee, on behalf of the Certificateholders, acknowledges receipt of
the same.

                  In connection with such transfer and assignment, the Depositor
does hereby deliver to, and deposit with, the Trustee the following documents or
instruments with respect to each Initial Mortgage Loan so transferred and
assigned, and the Depositor shall, in accordance with Section 2.09, deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Trustee, with respect to each Subsequent Mortgage
Loan, the following documents or instruments (a "Mortgage File"):

                  (i) the original Mortgage Note, endorsed in blank, without
         recourse, or in the following form: "Pay to the order of Deutsche Bank
         National Trust Company, as Trustee under the applicable agreement,
         without recourse," with all prior and intervening endorsements showing
         a complete chain of endorsement from the originator to the Person so
         endorsing to the Trustee, or with respect to any lost Mortgage Note, an
         original Lost Note Affidavit; provided however, that such substitutions
         of Lost Note Affidavits for original Mortgage Notes may occur only with
         respect to Mortgage Loans, the aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balance
         of which is less than or equal to 2.00% of the Pool Balance as of the
         Cut-off Date;

                  (ii) the original Mortgage, with evidence of recording
         thereon, and a copy, certified by the appropriate recording office, of
         the recorded power of attorney, if the Mortgage was executed pursuant
         to a power of attorney, with evidence of recording thereon;

                  (iii) an original Assignment assigned in blank, without
         recourse;

                  (iv) the original recorded intervening Assignment or
         Assignments showing a complete chain of assignment from the originator
         to the Person assigning the Mortgage to



                                       64
<PAGE>



         the Trustee as contemplated by the immediately preceding clause (iii)
         or the original unrecorded intervening Assignments;

                  (v) the original or copies of each assumption, modification,
         written assurance or substitution agreement, if any; and

                  (vi) the original lender's title insurance policy or an
         attorney's opinion of title or similar guarantee of title acceptable to
         mortgage lenders generally in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged
         Property is located, together with all endorsements or riders which
         were issued with or subsequent to the issuance of such policy, or in
         the event such original title policy is unavailable, a written
         commitment or uniform binder or preliminary report of title issued by
         the title insurance or escrow company.

                  If any of the documents referred to in Sections 2.01(ii),
(iii) or (iv) above has as of the Closing Date (or the related Subsequent
Transfer Date, with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans) been submitted for
recording but either (x) has not been returned from the applicable public
recording office or (y) has been lost or such public recording office has
retained the original of such document, the obligations of the Depositor to
deliver such documents shall be deemed to be satisfied upon (1) delivery to the
Trustee, or to the appropriate Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, of a copy of
each such document certified by the applicable Originator in the case of (x)
above or the applicable public recording office in the case of (y) above to be a
true and complete copy of the original that was submitted for recording and (2)
if such copy is certified by the applicable Originator, delivery to the Trustee,
or to the appropriate Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, promptly upon receipt
thereof of either the original or a copy of such document certified by the
applicable public recording office to be a true and complete copy of the
original. If the original lender's title insurance policy was not delivered
pursuant to Section 2.01(vi) above, the Depositor shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Trustee, or to the appropriate Custodian on behalf of the
Trustee, promptly after receipt thereof, the original lender's title insurance
policy. The Depositor shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee, or
to the appropriate Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, promptly upon receipt
thereof any other original documents constituting a part of a Mortgage File
received with respect to any Mortgage Loan, including, but not limited to, any
original documents evidencing an assumption or modification of any Mortgage
Loan.

                  The Master Servicer (in its capacity as Seller) shall promptly
(and in no event later than thirty (30) Business Days, subject to extension upon
a mutual agreement between the Master Servicer and the Trustee, following the
later of (i) the Closing Date (or the related Subsequent Transfer Date, with
respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans), (ii) the date on which the Seller
receives the Assignment from the Custodian and (iii) the date of receipt by the
Master Servicer of the recording information for a Mortgage) submit or cause to
be submitted for recording, at no expense to the Trust Fund or the Trustee, in
the appropriate public office for real property records, each Assignment
referred to in Sections 2.01(iii) and (iv) above and shall execute each original
Assignment referred to in section 2.01(iii) above in the following form:
"Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee under the applicable
agreement." In the event that any such Assignment is lost or returned unrecorded
because of a defect therein, the Master Servicer (in its capacity as Seller)
shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared a



                                       65
<PAGE>



substitute Assignment or cure or cause to be cured such defect, as the case may
be, and thereafter cause each such Assignment to be duly recorded.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, for administrative
convenience and facilitation of servicing and to reduce closing costs, so long
as recordation of an Assignment is not necessary to protect the Trustee's and
the Certificateholders' interests in the related Mortgage Loan under the laws of
the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged Property is located, as
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Guarantor
delivered by the Master Servicer to the Trustee and the Guarantor, the
Assignments shall not be required to be submitted for recording (except with
respect to any Mortgage Loan located in Maryland) unless such failure to record
would result in a withdrawal or a downgrading by any Rating Agency of the rating
on any Class of Certificates; provided further, however, each Assignment shall
be submitted for recording by the Seller in the manner described above, at no
expense to the Trust Fund or the Trustee, upon the earliest to occur of: (i)
reasonable direction by Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the
Voting Rights, the Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer, (ii) failure of the Master
Servicer Termination Test, (iii) the occurrence of a bankruptcy or insolvency
relating to the Seller, (iv) the occurrence of a servicing transfer as described
in Section 7.02 hereof and (v) if the Seller is not the Master Servicer and with
respect to any one Assignment or Mortgage, the occurrence of a bankruptcy,
insolvency or foreclosure relating to the Mortgagor under the related Mortgage.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Master Servicer is unable to pay the cost
of recording the Assignments, such expense shall be paid by the Trustee and
shall be reimbursable to the Trustee as an Extraordinary Trust Fund Expense.

                  All original documents relating to the Mortgage Loans that are
not delivered to the Trustee, or to the appropriate Custodian on behalf of the
Trustee, are and shall be held by or on behalf of the Seller, the Depositor or
the Master Servicer, as the case may be, in trust for the benefit of the Trustee
on behalf of the Certificateholders. In the event that any such original
document is required pursuant to the terms of this Section to be a part of a
Mortgage File, such document shall be delivered promptly to the Trustee, or to
the appropriate Custodian on behalf of the Trustee. Any such original document
delivered to or held by the Depositor that is not required pursuant to the terms
of this Section to be a part of a Mortgage File, shall be delivered promptly to
the Master Servicer.

                  The parties hereto understand and agree that it is not
intended that any mortgage loan be included in the Trust that is a "High-Cost
Home Loan" as defined by HOEPA or any other applicable predatory or abusive
lending laws.

                  SECTION 2.02 Acceptance of REMIC I by the Trustee.

                  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.01 and subject to any
exceptions noted on the exception report described in the next paragraph below,
the Trustee acknowledges receipt (or, with respect to Mortgage Loans subject to
a Custodial Agreement, receipt by the respective Custodian as the duly appointed
agent of the Trustee) of the documents referred to in Section 2.01 (other than
such documents described in Section 2.01(v)) above and all interests and all
other assets included in the definition of "REMIC I" under clauses (i), (iii),
(iv) and (v) (to the extent of amounts deposited into the Distribution Account)
and declares that it, or such



                                       66
<PAGE>



Custodian as its agent, holds and shall hold such documents and the other
documents delivered to it constituting a Mortgage File, and that it holds or
shall hold all such assets and such other assets included in the definition of
"REMIC I" in trust for the exclusive use and benefit of all present and future
Certificateholders.

                  On or prior to the Closing Date, the Trustee agrees, for the
benefit of the Certificateholders, to execute and deliver (or cause the
Custodian to execute and deliver) to the Depositor, the Guarantor and the NIMS
Insurer an acknowledgment of receipt of the Mortgage Note (with any exceptions
noted), substantially in the form attached as Exhibit C-3 hereto.

                  The Trustee agrees, for the benefit of the Certificateholders,
to review (or cause a Custodian on its behalf to review) each Mortgage Note
within 45 days of the Closing Date (or the related Subsequent Transfer Date,
with respect to the Subsequent Mortgage Loans) and to certify in substantially
the form attached hereto as Exhibit C-1 (or cause the Custodian to certify in
the form of the Initial Certification attached to the Custodial Agreement) to
the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer, if any,
that, as to each Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (other than
any Mortgage Loan paid in full or any Mortgage Loan specifically identified in
the exception report annexed thereto as not being covered by such
certification), (i) all documents constituting part of such Mortgage File (other
than such documents described in Section 2.01(v)) required to be delivered to it
pursuant to this Agreement are in its possession, (ii) such documents have been
reviewed by it or such Custodian and are not mutilated, torn or defaced unless
initialed by the related borrower and relate to such Mortgage Loan, (iii) based
on its or the Custodian's examination and only as to the foregoing, the
information set forth in the Mortgage Loan Schedule that corresponds to items
(1) through (3), (6), (9), (10), (13), (15) and (19) of the definition of
"Mortgage Loan Schedule" accurately reflects information set forth in the
Mortgage File. It is herein acknowledged that, in conducting such review, the
Trustee or such Custodian was under no duty or obligation (i) to inspect, review
or examine any such documents, instruments, certificates or other papers to
determine whether they are genuine, enforceable, or appropriate for the
represented purpose or whether they have actually been recorded or that they are
other than what they purport to be on their face or (ii) to determine whether
any Mortgage File should include any of the documents specified in clause (v) of
Section 2.01.

                  Prior to the first anniversary date of this Agreement the
Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Guarantor and
the NIMS Insurer a final certification in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit C-2
(or shall cause the Custodian to deliver to the Trustee, the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer a final certification in the
form attached to the Custodial Agreement) evidencing the completeness of the
Mortgage Files, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon, with respect to
all of the Initial Mortgage Loans and Subsequent Mortgage Loans. Upon the
request of the Master Servicer or the Guarantor, any exception report related to
the final certification shall be provided in an electronic computer readable
format as mutually agreed upon by the Master Servicer and the Trustee.

                  If in the process of reviewing the Mortgage Files and making
or preparing, as the case may be, the certifications referred to above, the
Trustee or any Custodian finds any document or documents constituting a part of
a Mortgage File to be missing, mutilated, torn or



                                       67
<PAGE>



defaced or does not conform to the requirements identified above, at the
conclusion of its review the Trustee (or a Custodian on behalf of the Trustee)
shall so notify the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Master
Servicer. In addition, upon the discovery by the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer,
the Master Servicer, the Guarantor or the Trustee of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties made by the Seller in the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement in respect of any Mortgage Loan which materially adversely affects
such Mortgage Loan or the interests of the related Certificateholders in such
Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written
notice to the other parties.

                  The Trustee (or a Custodian on behalf of the Trustee) shall,
at the written request and expense of any Certificateholder, Certificate Owner
or the Guarantor, provide a written report to such Certificateholder,
Certificate Owner or the Guarantor, of all Mortgage Files released to the Master
Servicer for servicing purposes.

                 SECTION 2.03 Repurchase or Substitution of Mortgage Loans by
                              the Seller or the Depositor; Payment of Prepayment
                              Charge Payment Amounts.

                 (a) Upon discovery or receipt of notice (including notice
under Section 2.02) of any materially defective document in, or that a document
is missing from, the Mortgage File or of the breach by the Seller of any
representation, warranty or covenant under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement
in respect of any Mortgage Loan which materially adversely affects the value of
such Mortgage Loan or the interest therein of the Certificateholders, the
Trustee shall promptly notify the Seller, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and
the Master Servicer of such defect, missing document or breach and request that
the Seller deliver such missing document or cure such defect or breach within 90
days from the date the Seller had knowledge or was notified of such missing
document, defect or breach, and if the Seller does not deliver such missing
document or cure such defect or breach in all material respects during such
period, the Master Servicer (or, in accordance with Section 6.06(b), the
Trustee) shall enforce the obligations of the Seller under the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement to repurchase such Mortgage Loan from REMIC I at the Purchase
Price within 90 days after the date on which the Seller was notified (subject to
Section 2.03(d)) of such missing document, defect or breach, if and to the
extent that the Seller is obligated to do so under the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement. The Purchase Price for the repurchased Mortgage Loan shall be
deposited in the Collection Account, and the Trustee, upon receipt of written
certification from the Master Servicer of such deposit, shall release to the
Seller the related Mortgage File and shall execute and deliver such instruments
of transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as the Seller shall
furnish to it and as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller any Mortgage Loan
released pursuant hereto, and the Trustee shall not have any further
responsibility with regard to such Mortgage File. In lieu of repurchasing any
such Mortgage Loan as provided above, if so provided in the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement, the Seller may cause such Mortgage Loan to be removed from
REMIC I (in which case it shall become a Deleted Mortgage Loan) and substitute
one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in the manner and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 2.03(c). It is understood and agreed that the
obligation of the Seller to cure or to repurchase (or to substitute for) any
Mortgage Loan as to which a document is missing, a material defect in a document
exists or as to which such a breach has occurred and



                                       68
<PAGE>



is continuing shall constitute the sole remedy respecting such omission, defect
or breach available to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, either the Seller or the Depositor liable for a
breach under this Section 2.03 shall promptly reimburse the Guarantor for all
expenses incurred by the Guarantor in respect of enforcing the remedies for such
breach.

                  (b) (i) Promptly upon the earlier of discovery by the Master
Servicer or receipt of notice by the Master Servicer of the breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Master Servicer set forth in Section
2.05, which materially and adversely affects the interests of the
Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall cure such
breach in all material respects.

                  (ii) Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 2.03(b)(i)
         above,

                  (A) on the later of (x) the Master Servicer Remittance Date
         next following the earlier of discovery by the Master Servicer or
         receipt of notice by the Master Servicer of the breach of the
         representation made by the Master Servicer in Section 2.05(vii), which
         breach materially and adversely affects the interests of the Holders of
         the Class P Certificates to any Prepayment Charge and (y) the Master
         Servicer Remittance Date next following the Prepayment Period relating
         to such a breach, the Master Servicer shall deposit into the Collection
         Account the amount of the scheduled Prepayment Charge, less any amount
         collected and deposited by the Master Servicer into the Collection
         Account in respect of such Prepayment Charge; and

                  (B) on the later of (x) the Master Servicer Remittance Date
         next following the earlier of discovery by the Master Servicer or
         receipt of notice by the Master Servicer of the breach of the covenant
         made by the Master Servicer in Section 2.05(viii), which breach
         materially and adversely affects the interests of the Holders of the
         Class P Certificates to any Prepayment Charge and (y) the Master
         Servicer Remittance Date next following the Prepayment Period relating
         to such a breach, the Master Servicer shall deposit into the Collection
         Account, as a Master Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment Amount, the
         amount of the waived Prepayment Charge, but only to the extent required
         under Section 2.03(b)(iii) below.

                  (iii) If with respect to any Prepayment Period,

                  (A) the dollar amount of Prepayment Charges that are the
         subject of breaches by the Master Servicer of the covenant made by the
         Master Servicer in Section 2.05(viii), which breaches materially and
         adversely affect the interests of the Holders of the Class P
         Certificates to such Prepayment Charges, exceeds

                  (B) 5% of the total dollar amount of Prepayment Charges
         payable by Mortgagors in connection with Principal Prepayments on the
         related Mortgage Loans that occurred during such Prepayment Period,




                                       69
<PAGE>



then the amount required to be paid by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section
2.03(b)(ii)(B) above shall be limited to an amount, that when added to the
amount of Prepayment Charges actually collected by the Master Servicer in
respect of Prepayment Charges relating to Principal Prepayments on the related
Mortgage Loans that occurred during such Prepayment Period, shall yield a sum
equal to 95% of the total dollar amount of Prepayment Charges (exclusive of (A)
Prepayment Charges not enforced or collected upon because (i) the enforceability
thereof shall have been limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium,
receivership and other similar laws relating to creditors' rights generally or
(ii) the collectability thereof shall have been limited due to acceleration in
connection with a foreclosure or other involuntary payment and (B) Prepayment
Charges waived by the Master Servicer when such waiver does not breach the
covenant set forth in Section 2.05(viii)) payable by Mortgagors in connection
with Principal Prepayments on the related Mortgage Loans that occurred during
such Prepayment Period.

                  (c) Any substitution of Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans
for Deleted Mortgage Loans made pursuant to Section 2.03(a), in the case of the
Seller, or Section 2.03(b), in the case of the Depositor, must be effected prior
to the date which is two years after the Startup Day for REMIC I.

                  As to any Deleted Mortgage Loan for which the Seller or the
Depositor substitutes a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, such
substitution shall be effected by the Seller or the Depositor, as the case may
be, delivering to the Trustee (or a Custodian on behalf of the Trustee), for
such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the Mortgage Note, the
Mortgage, the Assignment to the Trustee, and such other documents and
agreements, with all necessary endorsements thereon, as are required by Section
2.01, together with an Officers' Certificate providing that each such Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan satisfies the definition thereof and specifying the
Substitution Shortfall Amount (as described below), if any, in connection with
such substitution. The Trustee (or a Custodian on behalf of the Trustee) shall
acknowledge receipt for such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and,
within ten Business Days thereafter, review such documents as specified in
Section 2.02 and deliver to the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor, the
Trustee and the Master Servicer, with respect to such Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loan or Loans, a certification substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit C-1, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon. Within one
year of the date of substitution, the Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor,
the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Master Servicer a certification
substantially in the form of Exhibit C-2 hereto with respect to such Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon.
Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in the
month of substitution are not part of REMIC I and shall be retained by the
Depositor or the Seller, as the case may be. For the month of substitution,
distributions to Certificateholders shall reflect the Monthly Payment due on
such Deleted Mortgage Loan on or before the Due Date in the month of
substitution, and the Depositor or the Seller, as the case may be, shall
thereafter be entitled to retain all amounts subsequently received in respect of
such Deleted Mortgage Loan. The Depositor shall give or cause to be given
written notice to the Certificateholders, the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor
that such substitution has taken place, shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule
and, if applicable, the Prepayment Charge Schedule, to reflect the removal of
such Deleted Mortgage Loan from the terms of this Agreement and the substitution
of the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and shall deliver a copy of
such



                                       70
<PAGE>



amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS
Insurer. Upon such substitution, such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or
Loans shall constitute part of the Mortgage Pool and shall be subject in all
respects to the terms of this Agreement and, in the case of a substitution
effected by the Seller, the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, including all
applicable representations and warranties thereof.

                  For any month in which the Depositor or the Seller substitutes
one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage
Loans, the Master Servicer shall determine the amount (the "Substitution
Shortfall Amount"), if any, by which the aggregate Purchase Price of all such
Deleted Mortgage Loans exceeds the aggregate of, as to each such Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan, the Scheduled Principal Balance thereof as of the date
of substitution, together with one month's interest on such Scheduled Principal
Balance at the applicable Net Mortgage Rate. On the date of such substitution,
the Depositor or the Seller, as the case may be, shall deliver or cause to be
delivered to the Master Servicer for deposit in the Collection Account an amount
equal to the Substitution Shortfall Amount, if any, and the Trustee, upon
receipt of the related Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and
certification by the Master Servicer of such deposit, shall release to the
Depositor or the Seller, as the case may be, the related Mortgage File or Files
and shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in
each case without recourse, as the Depositor or the Seller, as the case may be,
shall deliver to it and as shall be necessary to vest therein any Deleted
Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto.

                  In addition, the Depositor or the Seller, as the case may be,
shall obtain at its own expense and deliver to the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer and
the Guarantor an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such substitution shall
not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on any Trust REMIC, including
without limitation, any federal tax imposed on "prohibited transactions" under
Section 860F(a)(1) of the Code or on "contributions after the startup date"
under Section 860G(d)(1) of the Code, or (b) any Trust REMIC to fail to qualify
as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding.

                  (d) Upon discovery by the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the
Guarantor, the Seller, the Master Servicer or the Trustee that any Mortgage Loan
does not constitute a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code, the party discovering such fact shall within two
Business Days give written notice thereof to the other parties. In connection
therewith, the Seller or the Depositor shall repurchase or, subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 2.03(c), substitute one or more Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loans for the affected Mortgage Loan within 90 days of the
earlier of discovery or receipt of such notice with respect to such affected
Mortgage Loan. Such repurchase or substitution shall be made by the Seller. Any
such repurchase or substitution shall be made in the same manner as set forth in
Section 2.03(a). The Trustee shall reconvey to the Depositor or the Seller, as
the case may be, the Mortgage Loan to be released pursuant hereto in the same
manner, and on the same terms and conditions, as it would a Mortgage Loan
repurchased for breach of a representation or warranty.

         Schedule attached hereto as Schedule 2 (including the prepayment charge

         material respects;

                  (x) With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Assignment is in
         recordable form; (except that the name of the assignee and the
         recording information with respect to such Mortgage Loan is blank) and
         each Mortgage Loan was originated in the name of the Master Servicer or
         an affiliate thereof;

                  (xi) The Master Servicer has fully furnished and shall
         continue to fully furnish, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting
         Act and its implementing regulations, accurate and complete information
         (e.g., favorable and unfavorable) on its borrower credit files to
         Equifax, Experian and Trans Union Credit Information Company or their
         successors on a monthly basis; and

                  (xii) The Master Servicer shall transmit full-file credit
         reporting data for each Mortgage Loan pursuant to Fannie Mae Guide
         Announcement 95-19 and for each Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer
         shall report one of the following statuses each month as follows: new
         origination, current, delinquent (30-, 60-, 90-days, etc.), foreclosed,
         or charged-off.

                  It is understood and agreed that the representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Section 2.05 shall survive delivery
of the Mortgage Files to the Trustee or to a Custodian, as the case may be, and
shall inure to the benefit of the Trustee, the Depositor and the
Certificateholders. Upon discovery by any of the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer,
the Guarantor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee of a breach of any of the
foregoing representations, warranties and covenants which materially and
adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan, Prepayment Charge or the
interests therein of the Certificateholders, the party discovering such breach
shall give prompt written notice (but in no event later than two Business Days
following such discovery) to the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer and the Trustee.
Subject to Section 7.01, the obligation of the Master Servicer set forth in
Section 2.03(b) to cure breaches (or in the case of the representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in Section 2.05(vii) and Section 2.05(viii)
above, to otherwise remedy such breaches pursuant to Section 2.03(b)) shall
constitute the sole remedies against the Master Servicer available to the
Certificateholders, the Depositor, the Guarantor or the Trustee on behalf of the
Certificateholders respecting a breach of the representations, warranties and
covenants contained in this Section 2.05. The preceding sentence shall not,
however, limit any remedies available to the Certificateholders, the Depositor,
the Guarantor or the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders (other than in
the case of the representations, warranties and covenants set forth in Section
2.05(vii) and Section 2.05(viii) above) pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement signed by the Master Servicer in its capacity as Seller, respecting a
breach of the representations, warranties and covenants of the Master Servicer
in its capacity as Seller contained in the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.

below, in consideration of the Trustee's delivery on the Subsequent Transfer
Dates to or upon the order of the Depositor of all or a portion of the balance
of funds in the Pre-Funding Accounts, the Depositor shall on any Subsequent

Subsequent Mortgage Loans on or prior to the related Subsequent Cut-off Date.
The transfer and delivery to the Trustee for deposit in the Mortgage Pool by the
Depositor of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan
Schedule attached to the related Subsequent Transfer Agreement shall be absolute

                  The purchase price paid by the Trustee from amounts released

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING
                              OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS

                  SECTION 3.01 Master Servicer to Act as Master Servicer.

                  The Master Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage
Loans on behalf of the Trustee and in the best interests of and for the benefit
of the Certificateholders (as determined by the Master Servicer in its
reasonable judgment) in accordance with (i) the terms of the respective Mortgage
Loans and any insurance policies related thereto, (ii) all Applicable
Regulations, (iii) the terms of this Agreement, (iv) the Loss Mitigation Action
Plan, if applicable, and (v) to the extent consistent with the preceding
requirements, in the same manner in which it services and administers similar
mortgage loans for its own portfolio, giving due consideration to customary and
usual standards of practice of prudent mortgage lenders and loan servicers
administering similar mortgage loans but without regard to:

                  (i) any relationship that the Master Servicer, any
         Sub-Servicer or any Affiliate of the Master Servicer or any
         Sub-Servicer may have with the related Mortgagor;

                  (ii) the ownership of any Certificate by the Master Servicer
         or any Affiliate of the Master Servicer;

                  (iii) the Master Servicer's obligation to make Advances or
         Servicing Advances; or

                  (iv) the Master Servicer's or any Sub-Servicer's right to
         receive compensation for its services hereunder or with respect to any
         particular transaction (the "Servicing Standard").

                  Subject only to the above-described servicing standards and
the terms of this Agreement and of the respective Mortgage Loans, the Master
Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone or through
Sub-Servicers as provided in Section 6.06, to do or cause to be done any and all
things in connection with such servicing and administration which it may deem
necessary or desirable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Master Servicer in its own name or in the name of a Sub-Servicer is hereby
authorized and empowered by the Trustee, in accordance with the servicing
standards set forth above, (i) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Certificateholders and the Trustee, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, or of forbearance, or
of modification and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged Properties, (ii) to institute foreclosure
proceedings or obtain a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure to convert the ownership of
such properties, and to hold or cause to be held title to such properties, in
the name of the Trust Fund, on behalf of the Trustee and the Certificateholders,
(iii) to market, sell and transfer title of REO Properties held in the name of
the Trust Fund to third party purchasers upon terms and conditions the Master
Servicer deems reasonable under the Servicing



                                       80
<PAGE>



Standard, (iv) to bring or respond to civil actions or complaints (in its own
name or that of the Trust Fund or the Trustee on behalf of the Trust Fund)
related to any Mortgage Loan, Mortgaged Property or REO Property held by the
Trust Fund and (v) to execute any other document necessary or appropriate to
enable the Master Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties
hereunder consistent with the Servicing Standard.

                  At the written request of the Master Servicer, the Trustee
shall execute and furnish to the Master Servicer such documents as are necessary
or appropriate to enable the Master Servicer to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties hereunder. By execution of this Agreement, the Trustee, on
behalf of the Trust Fund, hereby grants to the Master Servicer a power of
attorney to execute any and all documents necessary to carry out any and all
servicing duties described in this Agreement (including the taking of and
transferring title of REO Properties to third parties held in the name of the
Trustee for the benefit of the Trust) and expressly confirms that this paragraph
along with the face page and a copy of the signature page (duly executed) to
this Agreement shall constitute the power of attorney for evidentiary and/or
recording purposes. The Trustee shall not be liable for the actions of the
Master Servicer or any Sub-Servicers under such powers of attorney.

                  Subject to Section 3.04(d) hereof, in accordance with the
Servicing Standard, the Master Servicer shall advance or cause to be advanced
funds as necessary for the purpose of effecting the timely payment of taxes and
assessments on the Mortgaged Properties, which advances shall be Servicing
Advances reimbursable in the first instance from related collections from the
Mortgagors pursuant to Section 3.04(d), and further as provided in Section
3.05(a). Any cost incurred by the Master Servicer or by Sub-Servicers in
effecting the timely payment of taxes and assessments on a Mortgaged Property
shall not, for the purpose of calculating distributions to Certificateholders,
be added to the unpaid Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan,
notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so permit.

                  Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Master
Servicer may waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to
the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant
indulgence to any Mortgagor if such waiver, modification, postponement or
indulgence is in conformity with the Servicing Standard; provided, however,
that:

                  (A) the Master Servicer shall not make future advances (except
         as provided in Section 4.03);

                  (B) the Master Servicer shall not permit any modification with
         respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage Rate, defer
         or forgive the payment of any principal or interest payments, reduce
         the outstanding Stated Principal Balance (except for reductions
         resulting from actual payments of principal) or extend the final
         maturity date on such Mortgage Loan (unless as provided in Section
         3.02, (i) the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Mortgage Loan
         or (ii) such default is, in the judgment of the Master Servicer,
         reasonably foreseeable); and





                                       81
<PAGE>



                  (C) the Master Servicer shall not consent to (i) partial
         releases of Mortgages, (ii) alterations, (iii) removal, demolition or
         division of properties subject to Mortgages, (iv) modification or (v)
         second mortgage subordination agreements with respect to any Mortgage
         Loan that would: (i) affect adversely the status of any Trust REMIC as
         a REMIC, (ii) cause any Trust REMIC to be subject to a tax on
         "prohibited transactions" or "contributions" pursuant to the REMIC
         Provisions, or (iii) both (x) effect an exchange or reissuance of such
         Mortgage Loan under Section 1001 of the Code (or Treasury regulations
         promulgated thereunder) and (y) cause any Trust REMIC constituting part
         of the Trust Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code or the
         imposition of any tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions"
         after the Startup Day under the REMIC Provisions.

                  To the extent consistent with the terms of this Agreement,
including Section 2.03 and Section 2.05, the Master Servicer may waive (or
permit a Sub-Servicer to waive) a Prepayment Charge only under the following
circumstances: (i) such waiver is standard and customary in servicing similar
Mortgage Loans and (ii) such waiver relates to a default or a reasonably
foreseeable default and would, in the reasonable judgment of the Master
Servicer, maximize recovery of total proceeds taking into account the value of
such Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage Loan.

                  The Master Servicer may delegate its responsibilities under
this Agreement; provided, however, that no such delegation shall release the
Master Servicer from the responsibilities or liabilities arising under this
Agreement. All references to Master Servicer in this Agreement shall be deemed
to include any Sub-Servicer duly appointed by the Master Servicer pursuant to
this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.02 Collection of Certain Mortgage Loan Payments.

                  The Master Servicer shall make reasonable efforts to collect
all payments called for under the terms and provisions of the Mortgage Loans,
and shall, to the extent such procedures shall be consistent with this Agreement
and the terms and provisions of any applicable insurance policies, follow such
collection procedures as it would follow with respect to mortgage loans
comparable to the Mortgage Loans and held for its own account. Consistent with
the foregoing, the Master Servicer may in its discretion (i) waive any late
payment charge or, if applicable, penalty interest, (ii) waive any provision of
any Mortgage Loan requiring the related Mortgagor to submit to mandatory
arbitration with respect to disputes arising thereunder or (iii) extend the due
dates for the Monthly Payments due on a Mortgage Note for a period of not
greater than 180 days; provided that any extension pursuant to clause (iii)
above shall not affect the amortization schedule of any Mortgage Loan for
purposes of any computation hereunder. The Guarantor's or the NIMS Insurer's
prior written consent (as provided in Section 1.03) shall be required for any
modification, waiver or amendment if the aggregate number of outstanding
Mortgage Loans which have been modified, waived or amended exceeds 5% of the
number of Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date. In the event of any such
arrangement pursuant to clause (iii) above, the Master Servicer shall make
timely advances on such Mortgage Loan during such extension pursuant to Section
4.03 and in accordance with the amortization schedule of such Mortgage Loan
without modification thereof by reason of such arrangements.




                                       82
<PAGE>



                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Mortgage
Loan is in default or, in the judgment of the Master Servicer, such default is
reasonably foreseeable, the Master Servicer, consistent with the Servicing
Standard, may also waive, modify or vary any term of such Mortgage Loan
(including modifications that would change the Mortgage Rate, forgive the
payment of principal or interest or extend the final maturity date of such
Mortgage Loan), accept payment from the related Mortgagor of an amount less than
the Stated Principal Balance in final satisfaction of such Mortgage Loan, or
consent to the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or otherwise
grant indulgence to any Mortgagor (any and all such waivers, modifications,
variances, forgiveness of principal or interest, postponements, or indulgences
collectively referred to herein as "forbearance"), provided, however, that in
determining which course of action permitted by this sentence it shall pursue,
the Master Servicer shall adhere to the Loss Mitigation Action Plan. The Master
Servicer's analysis supporting any forbearance and the conclusion that any
forbearance meets the standards of Section 3.01 and the Loss Mitigation Action
Plan shall be reflected in writing in the Mortgage File.

                  If the Class CE Certificates are no longer outstanding, the
Master Servicer shall not take any action pursuant to the preceding two
paragraphs with respect to a Group I Mortgage Loan without obtaining the prior
written consent of the Guarantor to such modification. The Master Servicer shall
submit to the Guarantor with its request for consent, such information related
to the proposed modification as can be expected to be needed by the Guarantor to
evaluate the Master Servicer's request, including the terms of the proposed
modification and the reasons for the Master Servicer's decision that such Group
I Mortgage Loan should be modified. The Guarantor shall be deemed to have
consented to the Master Servicer's request in the event that the Guarantor does
not provide the Master Servicer with either its written consent to such
requested modification or written notice of its objection to such modification
within five Business Days of its receipt of the Master Servicer's request.
Requests for modification shall be sent to the Guarantor at: Fannie Mae, Special
Products Group, Mail Stop 5H-5W-03, 13150 Worldgate Drive, Herndon, Virginia
20170, Attention: Director. With respect to each Group I Mortgage Loan which is
modified with the consent of the Guarantor, the Master Servicer shall give
written notice to the NIMS Insurer at the address set forth in Section 11.05 and
to the Guarantor to the following address: Fannie Mae, Special Products Group,
Mail Stop 5H-5W-03, 13150 Worldgate Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20170, Attention:
Director. Such notice shall be delivered within thirty Business Days following
such modification and shall include information with respect to the
modification, including, without limitation, the interest rate, the principal
balance and the maturity date of such Group I Mortgage Loan before and after
such modification.

                  In the event that a shortfall in any collection on or
liability with respect to any Mortgage Loan results from or is attributable to
adjustments to Mortgage Rates, Monthly Payments or Stated Principal Balances
that were made by the Master Servicer in a manner not consistent with the terms
of the related Mortgage Note and this Agreement, the Master Servicer, upon
discovery or receipt of notice thereof, immediately shall deliver to the Trustee
for deposit in the Distribution Account from its own funds the amount of any
such shortfall and shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Fund, the
Trustee, the Depositor, the Guarantor and any successor master servicer in
respect of any such liability. Such indemnities shall survive the termination or
discharge of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 3.03 [Reserved].

                  SECTION 3.04 Collection Account, Escrow Account and

                  (a) COLLECTION ACCOUNT. On behalf of the Trust Fund, the

charges, assumption fees, insufficient funds charges, modification fees and
other ancillary fees (but not Prepayment Charges) need not be deposited by the
Master Servicer in the Collection Account and shall upon collection, belong to

                  (a) COLLECTION ACCOUNT. The Master Servicer may, from time to
time, withdraw from the Collection Account for the following purposes or as
described in Section 4.03:

         of Section 3.04(g);

                  (ii) subject to Section 3.12(c), to reimburse itself for (a)
         any unpaid Servicing Fees, (b) any unreimbursed Servicing Advances and

         Proceeds received on the related Mortgage Loan and any amounts received
         in respect of the rental of the related REO Property prior to an REO
         Disposition that represent payments of principal and/or interest
         respecting which any such advance was made;

                  (iii) to reimburse itself for (a) any unpaid Servicing Fees to
         the extent not recoverable under Section 3.05(a)(ii) and (b) any unpaid
         Advances or Servicing Advances that have been deemed Nonrecoverable
         Advances or Nonrecoverable Servicing Advances;

                  (iv) to pay to itself any Prepayment Interest Excess;

                  (v) to reimburse itself for any amounts paid pursuant to

         Servicer in respect of any unreimbursed Advances to the extent of funds

                                       88
<PAGE>



                  (viii) to reimburse the Master Servicer or the Depositor for
         expenses incurred by or reimbursable to the Master Servicer or the
         Depositor, as the case may be, pursuant to Section 6.03;

                  (ix) to remit to the Trustee any amounts that the Trustee is
         permitted to be paid or reimbursed from the assets of the Trust Fund
         pursuant to the terms of this Agreement, including the terms of Section
         7.02(a) and Section 8.05 of this Agreement;

                  (x) to reimburse the NIMS Insurer, the Master Servicer (if the
         Master Servicer is not an Affiliate of the Seller) or the Trustee, as
         the case may be, for enforcement expenses reasonably incurred in
         respect of the breach or defect giving rise to the purchase obligation
         under Section 2.03 of this Agreement that were included in the Purchase
         Price of the Mortgage Loan, including any expenses arising out of the
         enforcement of the purchase obligation;

                  (xi) to pay to the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Seller
         or the Guarantor (with respect to the Group I Mortgage Loans), as the
         case may be, with respect to each Mortgage Loan that has previously
         been purchased or replaced pursuant to Section 2.03 or Section 3.16(a)
         all amounts received thereon subsequent to the date of purchase or
         substitution, as the case may be;

                  (xii) to transfer funds in the Collection Account maintained
         at a particular depository to the Collection Account maintained at a

                  (xiii) to clear and terminate the Collection Account upon the
         termination of this Agreement.

                  On each Business Day as of the commencement of which the
balance on deposit in the Collection Account exceeds $75,000 following any
withdrawals pursuant to the next succeeding sentence, the amount of such excess
shall be remitted to the Trustee, but only if the Collection Account constitutes
an Eligible Account solely pursuant to clause (ii) of the definition of
"Eligible Account." If the balance on deposit in the Collection Account exceeds
$75,000 as of the commencement of business on any Business Day and the
Collection Account constitutes an Eligible Account solely pursuant to clause
(ii) of the definition of "Eligible Account," the Master Servicer shall, on or
before 3:00 p.m. New York time on such Business Day, withdraw from the
Collection Account any and all amounts payable or reimbursable to the Depositor,
the Master Servicer, the Trustee or any Sub-Servicer pursuant to Section 3.05
and shall pay such amounts to the Persons entitled thereto.

                  The foregoing requirements for withdrawal from the Collection
Account shall be exclusive. In the event the Master Servicer shall deposit in
the Collection Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may
at any time withdraw such amount from the Collection Account, any provision
herein to the contrary notwithstanding.




                                       89
<PAGE>



                  The Master Servicer shall keep and maintain separate
accounting, on a Mortgage Loan by Mortgage Loan basis, for the purpose of
justifying any withdrawal from the Collection Account, to the extent held by or
on behalf of it, pursuant to subclauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (vii),
(viii) and (xi) above. The Master Servicer shall provide written notification to
the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor on or prior to the next
succeeding Master Servicer Reporting Date, upon making any withdrawals from the
Collection Account pursuant to subclause (viii) above.

                  (b) ESCROW ACCOUNT. The Master Servicer may, from time to
time, withdraw from the Escrow Account for the following purposes:

                  (i) to effect payments of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
         water rates, hazard insurance premiums and comparable items;

                  (ii) to reimburse the Master Servicer for any Servicing
         Advance made by the Master Servicer with respect to a related Mortgage
         Loan but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which
         represent late payments or Late Collections of Escrow Payments
         thereunder;

                  (iii) to refund to the Mortgagor any funds as may be
         determined to be overages;

                  (iv) for transfer to the Collection Account in accordance with
         the terms of this Agreement;

                  (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
         Property;

                  (vi) to pay to the Master Servicer, or to the Mortgagor to the
         extent required by the related Mortgage Loan or Applicable Regulations,
         any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account;

                  (vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the
         termination of this Agreement; and

                  (viii) to transfer to the Collection Account any Insurance
         Proceeds.

                  In the event the Master Servicer shall deposit in an Escrow
Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time
withdraw such amount from such Escrow Account, any provision herein to the
contrary notwithstanding. As part of its servicing duties, the Master Servicer
shall pay to the Mortgagor interest on funds in the Escrow Account, to the
extent required by the related Mortgage Loan or Applicable Regulations, and to
the extent that interest earned on funds in the Escrow Account is insufficient,
shall pay such interest from its own funds, without any reimbursement therefor.
The Master Servicer may pay to itself any excess interest on funds in the Escrow
Account, to the extent such action is in conformity with the Servicing Standard,
is permitted by law and such amounts are not required to be paid to Mortgagors
or used for any of the other purposes set forth above.

                  (c) DISTRIBUTION ACCOUNT. The Trustee shall, from time to
time, make withdrawals from the Distribution Account, for any of the following
purposes:

                  (i) to make distributions to Certificateholders and the
         Guarantor in accordance with Section 4.01;

                  (ii) to pay to itself amounts to which it is entitled pursuant
         to Section 8.05;

                  (iii) to pay itself any interest income earned on funds
         deposited in the Distribution Account pursuant to Section 3.06;

                  (iv) to reimburse itself pursuant to Section 7.01 and Section
         7.02(b);

                  (v) to pay any amounts in respect of taxes pursuant to Section
         10.01(g)(iii);

                  (vii) to clear and terminate the Distribution Account pursuant
         to Section 9.01.

                  SECTION 3.06 Investment of Funds in the Collection Account,
                               the Escrow Account, the REO Account and the
                               Distribution Account.

                  (a) The Master Servicer may direct any depository institution
maintaining the Collection Account, the Escrow Account (subject to Section
3.05(b)), and the REO Account and the Trustee may direct any depository
institution maintaining the Distribution Account (for purposes of this Section
3.06, each an "Investment Account"), to invest the funds in such Investment
Account in one or more Permitted Investments bearing interest or sold at a
discount, and maturing, unless payable on demand, (i) no later than the Business
Day immediately preceding the date on which such funds are required to be
withdrawn from such account pursuant to this Agreement, if a Person other than
the Trustee is the obligor thereon, and (ii) no later than the date on which
such funds are required to be withdrawn from such Investment Account pursuant to
this Agreement, if the Trustee is the obligor thereon. All such Permitted
Investments shall be held to maturity, unless payable on demand. Any investment
of funds in an Investment Account shall be made in the name of the Trustee (in
its capacity as such) or in the name of a nominee of the Trustee. The Trustee
shall be entitled to sole possession (except with respect to investment
direction of funds held in the Collection Account, the Escrow Account, and the
REO Account) over each such investment and (except with respect to the income on
funds held in the Collection Account, the Escrow Account and the REO Account)
the income thereon, and any certificate or other instrument evidencing any such
investment shall be delivered directly to the Trustee or its agent, together
with any document of transfer necessary to transfer title to such investment to
the Trustee or its nominee. In the event amounts on deposit in an Investment
Account are at any time invested in a Permitted Investment payable on demand,
the Trustee shall:

                  (i) consistent with any notice required to be given
         thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the last day such
         Permitted Investment may otherwise



                                       91
<PAGE>



         mature hereunder in an amount equal to the lesser of (1) all amounts
         then payable thereunder and (2) the amount required to be withdrawn on
         such date; and

                  (ii) demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly
         upon determination by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee that such
         Permitted Investment would not constitute a Permitted Investment in
         respect of funds thereafter on deposit in the Investment Account.

                  (b) All income in the nature of interest from the investment
of funds in the Collection Account, the Escrow Account (subject to Section
3.05(b)) and the REO Account shall be for the benefit of the Master Servicer as
compensation for the Master Servicer's services pursuant to this Agreement. The
Master Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account, the Escrow Account, and
the REO Account , as applicable, from its own funds the amount of any loss
incurred in respect of any such Permitted Investment made with funds in such
account immediately upon realization of such loss.

                  (c) All income in the nature of interest or earnings from the
investment of funds in the Distribution Account shall be for the benefit of the
Trustee as compensation for the Trustee's services pursuant to this Agreement.
The Trustee shall deposit in the Distribution Account from its own funds the
amount of any loss incurred on Permitted Investments in the Distribution
Account.

                  (d) Funds on deposit in the Pre-Funding Accounts, the Interest
Coverage Accounts and the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account may be invested
in Permitted Investments in accordance with this Section 3.06 subject to any
limitations set forth in Section 4.07 (with respect to the Pre-Funding
Accounts), Section 4.08 (with respect to the Interest Coverage Accounts) and
Section 4.10 (with respect to the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account) and
any investment earnings or interest paid shall accrue to the benefit of the
party designated in such section and the party so designated shall deposit in
the related account from its own funds the amount of any loss incurred on
Permitted Investments in such account.

                  (e) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
if any default occurs in the making of a payment due under any Permitted
Investment, or if a default occurs in any other performance required under any
Permitted Investment, the Trustee may and, subject to Section 8.01 and Section
8.02(a)(v), upon the request of the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor or the Holders
of Certificates representing more than 50% of the Voting Rights allocated to any
Class of Certificates, shall take such action as may be appropriate to enforce
such payment or performance, including the institution and prosecution of
appropriate proceedings.

                  (f) The Trustee or its Affiliates are permitted to receive
compensation that could be deemed to be in the Trustee's economic self-interest
for (i) serving as investment adviser, administrator, shareholder, servicing
agent, custodian or sub-custodian with respect to certain of the Permitted
Investments, (ii) using Affiliates to effect transactions in certain Permitted
Investments and (iii) effecting transactions in certain Permitted Investments.
Such compensation shall not be considered an amount that is reimbursable or
payable pursuant to Section 3.05.

                  SECTION 3.07 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer shall
maintain accurate records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes,
assessments, water rates and other charges which are or may become a lien upon
the Mortgaged Property and the status of fire and hazard insurance coverage and,
as to those Mortgage Loans subject to a voluntary escrow agreement, shall
obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including
renewal premiums) and shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable
penalty or termination date and at a time appropriate for securing maximum
discounts allowable, employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the
Escrow Account which shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Master
Servicer in amounts sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the terms of
the Mortgage or Applicable Regulations. The Master Servicer assumes full
responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills and shall effect timely
payments of all such bills irrespective of the Mortgagor's faithful performance
in the payment of same or the making of the Escrow Payments and shall make
Servicing Advances from its own funds to effect such payments. To the extent
that the Mortgage does not provide for Escrow Payments, the Master Servicer
shall use reasonable efforts consistent with the Servicing Standard to determine
that any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they first become
due and shall ensure that the Mortgaged Property is not lost to a tax lien as a
result of nonpayment and that such Mortgaged Property is not left uninsured.

                  SECTION 3.08 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

                  The Master Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each
Mortgage Loan fire insurance with extended coverage on the related Mortgaged
Property in an amount which is at least equal to the least of (i) the current
Stated Principal Balance of such Mortgage Loan, (ii) the amount necessary to
fully compensate for any damage or loss to the improvements that are a part of
such property on a replacement cost basis and (iii) the maximum insurable value
of the improvements which are a part of such Mortgaged Property, in each case in
an amount not less than such amount as is necessary to avoid the application of
any coinsurance clause contained in the related hazard insurance policy. The
Master Servicer shall also cause to be maintained fire insurance with extended
coverage on each REO Property in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser
of (i) the maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such
property and (ii) the outstanding Stated Principal Balance of the related
Mortgage Loan, plus accrued interest at the Mortgage Rate and related Servicing
Advances (each measured at the time it became an REO Property). The Master
Servicer shall comply in the performance of this Agreement with all reasonable
rules and requirements of each insurer under any such hazard policies. Any
amounts to be collected by the Master Servicer under any such policies (other
than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the property subject
to the related Mortgage or amounts to be released to the Mortgagor in accordance
with the procedures that the Master Servicer would follow in servicing loans
held for its own account, subject to the terms and conditions of the related
Mortgage and Mortgage Note) shall be deposited in the Collection Account,
subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05, if received in respect of a
Mortgage Loan, or in the REO Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section
3.13, if received in respect of an REO Property. Any cost incurred by the Master
Servicer in maintaining any such insurance shall not, for the purpose of
calculating distributions to Certificateholders, be added to



                                       93
<PAGE>



the unpaid Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan,
notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so permit. It is understood
and agreed that no earthquake or other additional insurance is to be required of
any Mortgagor other than pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as
shall at any time be in force and as shall require such additional insurance. If
the Mortgaged Property or REO Property is at any time in an area identified in
the Federal Register by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having
special flood hazards, the Master Servicer shall cause to be maintained a flood
insurance policy in respect thereof. Such flood insurance shall be in an amount
equal to the lesser of (i) the unpaid Stated Principal Balance of the related
Mortgage Loan; (ii) the maximum amount of such insurance available for the
related Mortgaged Property under the national flood insurance program (assuming
that the area in which such Mortgaged Property is located is participating in
such program); and (iii) the maximum insurable value of the improvements which
are part of the related Mortgaged Property.

                  SECTION 3.09 Maintenance of Mortgage Blanket Insurance.

                  In the event that the Master Servicer shall obtain and
maintain a blanket policy with an insurer having a General Policy Rating of
"A:V" or better in Best's Key Rating Guide (or such other rating that is
comparable to such rating) insuring against hazard losses on all of the Mortgage
Loans, it shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set
forth in the first two sentences of Section 3.08, it being understood and agreed
that such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case the Master
Servicer shall, in the event that there shall not have been maintained on the
related Mortgaged Property or REO Property a policy complying with the first two
sentences of Section 3.08, and there shall have been one or more losses which
would have been covered by such policy, deposit to the Collection Account from
its own funds the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy because
of such deductible clause. In connection with its activities as administrator
and servicer of the Mortgage Loans, the Master Servicer agrees to prepare and
present, on behalf of itself, the Trustee and the Certificateholders, claims
under any such blanket policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms
of such policy.

                  SECTION 3.10 Fidelity Bond; Errors and Omissions Insurance.

                  The Master Servicer shall keep in force during the term of
this Agreement a policy or policies of insurance covering errors and omissions
for failure in the performance of the Master Servicer's obligations under this
Agreement, which policy or policies shall be in such form and amount that would
meet the requirements of Fannie Mae if it were the purchaser of the Mortgage
Loans, unless the Master Servicer has obtained a waiver of such requirements
from Fannie Mae. The Master Servicer shall also maintain a fidelity bond in the
form and amount that would meet the requirements of Fannie Mae, unless the
Master Servicer has obtained a waiver of such requirements from Fannie Mae. The
Master Servicer shall provide the Trustee, the Guarantor (upon reasonable
request) and the NIMS Insurer (upon reasonable request) with copies of any such
insurance policies and fidelity bond. The Master Servicer shall be deemed to
have complied with this provision if an Affiliate of the Master Servicer has
such errors and omissions and fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such
insurance policy or fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to
the Master Servicer. Any such errors and omissions



                                       94
<PAGE>



policy and fidelity bond shall by its terms not be cancelable without thirty
days' prior written notice to the Trustee. The Master Servicer shall also cause
each Sub-Servicer to maintain a policy of insurance covering errors and
omissions and a fidelity bond which would meet such requirements.

                  SECTION 3.11 Enforcement of Due-On-Sale Clauses; Assumption
                               Agreements.

                  The Master Servicer shall, to the extent it has knowledge of
any conveyance or prospective conveyance of any Mortgaged Property by any
Mortgagor (whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or
not the Mortgagor remains or is to remain liable under the Mortgage Note and/or
the Mortgage), exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage
Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause, if any, applicable thereto; provided,
however, that the Master Servicer shall not exercise any such rights if
prohibited by law from doing so. If the Master Servicer reasonably believes it
is unable under applicable law to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, or if any
of the other conditions set forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence
apply, the Master Servicer is authorized to enter into an assumption and
modification agreement from or with the person to whom such property has been
conveyed or is proposed to be conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes
liable under the Mortgage Note and, to the extent permitted by applicable state
law, the Mortgagor remains liable thereon. The Master Servicer is also
authorized to enter into a substitution of liability agreement with such person,
pursuant to which the original Mortgagor is released from liability and such
person is substituted as the Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage
Note, provided that no such substitution shall be effective unless such person
satisfies the underwriting criteria of the Master Servicer. In connection with
any assumption or substitution, the Master Servicer shall apply such
underwriting standards and follow such practices and procedures as shall be
normal and usual in its general mortgage servicing activities and as it applies
to other mortgage loans owned solely by it. The Master Servicer shall not take
or enter into any assumption and modification agreement, however, unless (to the
extent practicable in the circumstances) it shall have received confirmation, in
writing, of the continued effectiveness of any applicable hazard insurance
policy, or a new policy meeting the requirements of this Section is obtained.
Any fee collected by the Master Servicer in respect of an assumption or
substitution of liability agreement shall be retained by the Master Servicer as
additional servicing compensation. In connection with any such assumption, no
material term of the Mortgage Note (including but not limited to the related
Mortgage Rate and the amount of the Monthly Payment) may be amended or modified,
except as otherwise required pursuant to the terms thereof or otherwise
permitted under Section 3.01. The Master Servicer shall notify the Trustee, the
Guarantor and any respective Custodian that any such substitution, assumption
and modification agreement has been completed by forwarding to the Trustee (with
a copy to the Guarantor) or to such Custodian, as the case may be, the executed
original of such substitution or assumption agreement, which document shall be
added to the related Mortgage File and shall, for all purposes, be considered a
part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as all other documents and
instruments constituting a part thereof. If the Class CE Certificates are no
longer outstanding, the Master Servicer shall not take or enter into any
substitution, assumption or modification agreement with respect to a Group I
Mortgage Loan without obtaining the prior written consent of the Guarantor to
such substitution, assumption or modification agreement.



                                       95
<PAGE>



The Master Servicer shall submit to the Guarantor with its request for consent,
such information related to the proposed substitution, assumption or
modification agreement as can be expected to be needed by the Guarantor to
evaluate the Master Servicer's request, including the terms of the proposed
substitution, assumption or modification and the reasons for the Master
Servicer's decision that such substitution, assumption or modification agreement
should be taken or entered into with respect to such Group I Mortgage Loan. The
Guarantor shall be deemed to have consented to the Master Servicer's request in
the event that the Guarantor does not provide the Master Servicer with either
its written consent to such requested substitution, assumption or modification
agreement or written notice of its objection to such substitution, assumption or
modification agreement within five Business Days of its receipt of the the
Master Servicer's request. Such requests shall be sent to the Guarantor at:
Fannie Mae, Special Products Group, Mail Stop 5H-5W-03, 13150 Worldgate Drive,
Herndon, Virginia 20170, Attention: Director. With respect to each substitution,
assumption or modification agreement which is entered into with the consent of
the Guarantor, the Master Servicer shall give written notice to the NIMS Insurer
to the addresses set forth in Section 11.05, to the Guarantor to the following
address: Fannie Mae, Special Products Group, Mail Stop 5H-5W-03, 13150 Worldgate
Drive, Herndon, Virginia 20170, Attention: Director. Such notice shall be
delivered within thirty Business Days following the date of such substitution,
assumption or modification agreement.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph or any other provision
of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not be deemed to be in default,
breach or any other violation of its obligations hereunder by reason of any
assumption of a Mortgage Loan by operation of law or by the terms of the
Mortgage Note or any assumption which the Master Servicer may be restricted by
law from preventing, for any reason whatever. For purposes of this Section 3.11,
the term "assumption" is deemed to also include a sale (of the Mortgaged
Property) subject to the Mortgage that is not accompanied by an assumption or
substitution of liability agreement.

                  SECTION 3.12 Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

                  (a) The Master Servicer shall, consistent with the Servicing
Standard and the Loss Mitigation Action Plan, foreclose upon or otherwise
comparably convert the ownership of properties securing such of the Mortgage
Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which no satisfactory
arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments pursuant to
Section 3.02. The Master Servicer shall be responsible for all costs and
expenses incurred by it in any such proceedings; provided, however, that such
costs and expenses shall be recoverable as Servicing Advances by the Master
Servicer as contemplated in Section 3.05 and Section 3.13. The foregoing is
subject to the provision that, in any case in which Mortgaged Property shall
have suffered damage from an Uninsured Cause, the Master Servicer shall not be
required to expend its own funds toward the restoration of such property unless
it shall determine in its discretion that such restoration shall increase the
proceeds of liquidation of the related Mortgage Loan after reimbursement to
itself for such expenses.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.12 or any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any Mortgage Loan
as to which the Master Servicer has received actual notice of, or has actual
knowledge of, the presence of any toxic or hazardous



                                       96
<PAGE>



substance on the related Mortgaged Property, the Master Servicer shall not, on
behalf of the Trustee, either (i) obtain title to such Mortgaged Property as a
result of or in lieu of foreclosure or otherwise or (ii) otherwise acquire
possession of, or take any other action with respect to, such Mortgaged
Property, if, as a result of any such action, the Trustee, the Trust Fund or the
Certificateholders would be considered to hold title to, to be a
"mortgagee-in-possession" of, or to be an "owner" or "operator" of such
Mortgaged Property within the meaning of the Comprehensive Environmental
Response, Compensation and Liability Act of 1980, as amended from time to time,
or any comparable law, unless the Master Servicer has also previously
determined, based on its reasonable judgment and a report prepared by a Person
who regularly conducts environmental audits using customary industry standards,
that:

                  (i) such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable
         environmental laws or, if not, that it would be in the best economic
         interest of the Trust Fund to take such actions as are necessary to
         bring the Mortgaged Property into compliance therewith; and

                  (ii) there are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged
         Property relating to the use, management or disposal of any hazardous
         substances, hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, or petroleum-based
         materials for which investigation, testing, monitoring, containment,
         clean-up or remediation could be required under any federal, state or
         local law or regulation, or that if any such materials are present for
         which such action could be required, that it would be in the best
         economic interest of the Trust Fund to take such actions with respect
         to the affected Mortgaged Property.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, if such environmental audit
reveals, or if the Master Servicer has actual knowledge or notice, that such
Mortgaged Property contains such toxic or hazardous wastes or substances, the
Master Servicer shall not foreclose or accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure
without the prior written consent of the Guarantor with respect to the Group I
Mortgage Loans (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld) and the NIMS
Insurer.

                  The cost of the environmental audit report contemplated by
this Section 3.12 shall be advanced by the Master Servicer, subject to the
Master Servicer's right to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as
provided in Section 3.05(a)(v), such right of reimbursement being prior to the
rights of Certificateholders to receive any amount in the Collection Account
received in respect of the affected Mortgage Loan or other Mortgage Loans.

                  If the Master Servicer determines, as described above, that it
is in the best economic interest of the Trust Fund to take such actions as are
necessary to bring any such Mortgaged Property into compliance with applicable
environmental laws, or to take such action with respect to the containment,
clean-up or remediation of hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous
wastes or petroleum-based materials affecting any such Mortgaged Property, then
the Master Servicer shall take such action as it deems to be in the best
economic interest of the Trust Fund; provided, however, that the Master Servicer
shall not proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a



                                       97
<PAGE>



deed in lieu of foreclosure if the estimated costs of the environmental clean
up, as estimated in the environmental audit report, together with the Advances
made by the Master Servicer and the estimated costs of foreclosure or acceptance
of a deed in lieu of foreclosure exceeds the estimated value of the Mortgaged
Property. The cost of any such compliance, containment, cleanup or remediation
shall be advanced by the Master Servicer, subject to the Master Servicer's right
to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as provided in Section
3.05(a)(v), such right of reimbursement being prior to the rights of
Certificateholders to receive any amount in the Collection Account received in
respect of the affected Mortgage Loan or other Mortgage Loans.

                  (c) Proceeds received in connection with any Final Recovery
Determination, as well as any recovery resulting from a partial collection of
Insurance Proceeds, Subsequent Recoveries or Liquidation Proceeds, in respect of
any Mortgage Loan, shall be applied in the following order of priority: FIRST,
to reimburse the Master Servicer or any Sub-Servicer for any related
unreimbursed Servicing Advances and Advances, pursuant to Section 3.05(a)(ii);
SECOND, to accrued and unpaid interest on the Mortgage Loan, to the date of the
Final Recovery Determination, or to the Due Date prior to the Distribution Date
on which such amounts are to be distributed if not in connection with a Final
Recovery Determination; and THIRD, as a recovery of principal of the Mortgage
Loan. If the amount of the recovery so allocated to interest is less than the
full amount of accrued and unpaid interest due on such Mortgage Loan, the amount
of such recovery shall be allocated by the Master Servicer as follows: FIRST, to
unpaid Servicing Fees; and SECOND, to the balance of the interest then due and
owing. The portion of the recovery so allocated to unpaid Servicing Fees shall
be reimbursed to the Master Servicer or any Sub-Servicer pursuant to Section
3.05(a)(ii).

                  SECTION 3.13 Title, Management and Disposition of REO
                               Property.

                  (a) The deed or certificate of sale of any REO Property shall
be taken in the name of the Trustee, or its nominee, in trust for the benefit of
the Certificateholders. Pursuant to the power of attorney granted in Section
3.01, the Master Servicer is hereby authorized to transfer the title of any REO
Property taken in the name of the Trustee to a third party purchaser pursuant to
this Section 3.13 without further documentation of its authority as
attorney-in-fact for the Trustee on behalf of the Trust. The Master Servicer, on
behalf of the Trust Fund (and on behalf of the Trustee for the benefit of the
Certificateholders), shall either sell any REO Property before the close of the
third taxable year after the year the Trust Fund acquires ownership of such REO
Property for purposes of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or request from the
Internal Revenue Service, no later than 60 days before the day on which the
three-year grace period would otherwise expire, an extension of the three-year
grace period, unless the Master Servicer shall have delivered to the Trustee,
the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Depositor an Opinion of Counsel,
addressed to the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Depositor, to
the effect that the holding by the Trust Fund of such REO Property subsequent to
three years after its acquisition shall not result in the imposition on any
Trust REMIC of taxes on "prohibited transactions" thereof, as defined in Section
860F of the Code, or cause any Trust REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC under
Federal law at any time that any Certificates are outstanding. The Master
Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO Property for the
benefit of the Certificateholders and solely for the purpose of its prompt
disposition and sale in a manner which does not cause such REO Property to fail
to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of
the Code or result in the receipt by any Trust REMIC of any "income from
non-permitted assets" within the meaning of



                                       98
<PAGE>



Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code, or any "net income from foreclosure property"
which is subject to taxation under the REMIC Provisions.

                  (b) The Master Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds
collected and received in connection with the operation of any REO Property
separate and apart from its own funds and general assets and shall establish and
maintain with respect to REO Properties an account held in trust for the Trustee
for the benefit of the Certificateholders (the "REO Account"), which shall be an
Eligible Account. The Master Servicer shall be permitted to allow the Collection
Account to serve as the REO Account, subject to separate ledgers for each REO
Property. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to retain or withdraw any
interest income paid on funds deposited in the REO Account.

                  (c) The Master Servicer shall have full power and authority,
subject only to the specific requirements and prohibitions of this Agreement
(including the Loss Mitigation Action Plan), to do any and all things in
connection with any REO Property as are consistent with the manner in which the
Master Servicer manages and operates similar property owned by the Master
Servicer or any of its Affiliates, all on such terms and for such period as the
Master Servicer deems to be in the best interests of Certificateholders and
appropriate to effect the prompt disposition and sale of the REO Property. In
connection therewith, the Master Servicer shall deposit, or cause to be
deposited in the clearing account (which account must be an Eligible Account) in
which it customarily deposits payments and collections on mortgage loans in
connection with its mortgage loan servicing activities on a daily basis, and in
no event more than one Business Day after the Master Servicer's receipt thereof,
and shall thereafter deposit in the REO Account, in no event more than two
Business Days after the deposit of such funds into the clearing account, all
revenues received by it with respect to an REO Property and shall withdraw
therefrom funds necessary for the proper operation, management and maintenance
of such REO Property including, without limitation:

                  (i) all insurance premiums due and payable in respect of such
         REO Property;

                  (ii) all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of such
         REO Property that may result in the imposition of a lien thereon; and

                  (iii) all costs and expenses necessary to maintain such REO
         Property.

                  To the extent that amounts on deposit in the REO Account with
respect to an REO Property are insufficient for the purposes set forth in
clauses (i) through (iii) above with respect to such REO Property, the Master
Servicer shall advance from its own funds such amount as is necessary for such
purposes if, but only if, the Master Servicer would make such advances if the
Master Servicer owned the REO Property and if in the Master Servicer's judgment,
the payment of such amounts shall be recoverable from the rental or sale of the
REO Property.

                  Notwithstanding the Master Servicer's obligation to the
Certificateholders to manage and operate (including the collection of rents from
existing tenants and management of any leases acquired with the REO property to
the extent applicable) the REO Property from the



                                       99
<PAGE>



date of acquisition until the date of sale, neither the Master Servicer nor the
Trustee shall knowingly:

                  (i) authorize the Trust Fund to enter into, renew or extend
         any New Lease with respect to any REO Property, if the New Lease by its
         terms shall give rise to any income that does not constitute Rents from
         Real Property;

                  (ii) authorize any amount to be received or accrued under any
         New Lease other than amounts that shall constitute Rents from Real
         Property;
                  (iii) authorize any construction on any REO Property, other
         than the completion of a building or other improvement thereon, and
         then only if more than ten percent of the construction of such building
         or other improvement was completed before default on the related
         Mortgage Loan became imminent, all within the meaning of Section
         856(e)(4)(B) of the Code; or

                  (iv) authorize any Person to Directly Operate any REO Property
         on any date more than 90 days after its date of acquisition by the
         Trust Fund;

unless, in any such case, the Master Servicer has obtained an Opinion of
Counsel, provided to the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor, to the
effect that such action shall not cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as
"foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code at
any time that it is held by the Trust Fund, and (B) the Master Servicer has
received written notice from the Trustee that it has received written consent
from the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld) that the specific action may be taken.

                  The Master Servicer may contract with any Independent
Contractor for the operation and management of any REO Property, provided that:

                  (i) the terms and conditions of any such contract shall not be
         inconsistent herewith;

                  (ii) any such contract shall require, or shall be administered
         to require, that the Independent Contractor pay all costs and expenses
         incurred in connection with the operation and management of such REO
         Property, including those listed above and remit all related revenues
         (net of such costs and expenses) to the Master Servicer as soon as
         practicable, but in no event later than thirty days following the
         receipt thereof by such Independent Contractor;

                  (iii) none of the provisions of this Section 3.13(c) relating
         to any such contract or to actions taken through any such Independent
         Contractor shall be deemed to relieve the Master Servicer of any of its
         duties and obligations to the Trustee on behalf of the
         Certificateholders with respect to the operation and management of any
         such REO Property; and




                                      100
<PAGE>



                  (iv) the Master Servicer shall be obligated with respect
         thereto to the same extent as if it alone were performing all duties
         and obligations in connection with the operation and management of such
         REO Property.

                  The Master Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any
agreement with any Independent Contractor performing services for it related to
its duties and obligations hereunder for indemnification of the Master Servicer
by such Independent Contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to
limit or modify such indemnification. The Master Servicer shall be solely liable
for all fees owed by it to any such Independent Contractor, irrespective of
whether the Master Servicer's compensation pursuant to Section 3.18 is
sufficient to pay such fees. The Master Servicer shall not engage an Independent
Contractor to engage in any activities that the Master Servicer would not be
permitted to engage in itself in accordance with the other provisions of this
Agreement (including the Loss Mitigation Action Plan).

                  (d) In addition to the withdrawals permitted under Section
3.13(c), the Master Servicer may from time to time make withdrawals from the REO
Account for any REO Property: (i) to pay itself or any Sub-Servicer unpaid
Servicing Fees in respect of the related Mortgage Loan; and (ii) to reimburse
itself or any Sub-Servicer for unreimbursed Servicing Advances and Advances made
in respect of such REO Property or the related Mortgage Loan. On the Master
Servicer Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall withdraw from each REO
Account maintained by it and deposit into the Distribution Account in accordance
with Section 3.04(g)(ii), for distribution on the related Distribution Date in
accordance with Section 4.01, the income from the related REO Property received
during the prior calendar month, net of any withdrawals made pursuant to Section
3.13(c) or this Section 3.13(d).

                  (e) Subject to the time constraints set forth in Section
3.13(a) (including the constraint that the Master Servicer hold and manage each
REO Property "solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition") each REO
disposition shall be carried out by the Master Servicer at such price and upon
such terms and conditions as shall be in conformity with the requirements of the
Loss Mitigation Action Plan and as shall be normal and usual in its general
servicing activities for similar properties.

                  (f) The proceeds from the REO Disposition, net of any amount
required by law to be remitted to the Mortgagor under the related Mortgage Loan
and net of any payment or reimbursement to the Master Servicer or any
Sub-Servicer as provided above, shall be deposited in the Distribution Account
in accordance with Section 3.04(g)(ii) on the Master Servicer Remittance Date in
the month following the receipt thereof for distribution on the related
Distribution Date in accordance with Section 4.01. Any REO Disposition shall be
for cash only (unless changes in the REMIC Provisions made subsequent to the
Startup Day allow a sale for other consideration).

                  SECTION 3.14 Agreement to Appoint a Special Servicer.

                  (a) The Guarantor may require the Master Servicer to enter
into a special subservicing agreement with a servicer with expertise in
servicing delinquent mortgage loans as designated by the Guarantor (the "Special
Servicer") on or after the earliest Distribution Date



                                      101
<PAGE>



with respect to which the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class CE
Certificates has been reduced to zero. Such special subservicing agreement shall
relate to the servicing of only Group I Mortgage Loans that (x) have been
delinquent in payment with respect to three or more Monthly Payments (provided,
however, that the third such Monthly Payment shall not be deemed to be
delinquent for purposes of this clause (x) until the close of business on the
last day of the month in which such Monthly Payment first became due) and (y)
have been transferred to the Special Servicer in accordance with this Section
3.14 and the related special subservicing agreement (a "Specially Serviced
Mortgage Loan").

                  (b) The special subservicing agreement shall be consistent
with the provisions of this Agreement, including but not limited to this Section
3.14, Section 6.06(a), Section 6.06(b) and Section 6.11, except as provided
otherwise in this Section 3.14. In addition, the special subservicing agreement
shall be on terms which shall be reasonably acceptable to the Guarantor and the
Master Servicer and shall provide, at a minimum that:

                  (1) the Special Servicer shall at all times meet the
         eligibility criteria described in Section 6.06(a);

                  (2) the Special Servicer shall service only the Specially
         Serviced Mortgage Loans in a manner consistent with the provisions with
         this Agreement except as provided otherwise in the special subservicing
         agreement;

                  (3) the Special Servicer shall use the Fannie Mae foreclosure
         network (and pay the customary fees therefor) for foreclosures and
         bankruptcies relating to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;

                  (4) the Special Servicer shall use the Fannie Mae disposition
         service (and pay the customary fees therefor) for the disposition of
         REO Property related to Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;

                  (5) the Special Servicer shall make Advances and Servicing
         Advances on the Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans to the same extent
         and in the same manner as the Master Servicer with respect to the Group
         I Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (6) the Special Servicer shall be entitled to receive the
         Servicing Fee with respect to all Specially Serviced Mortgage Loans;

                  (7) prior to the transfer of servicing to the Special
         Servicer, the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer shall have
         provided all notices relating to such transfer of servicing as required
         to be delivered to the borrowers by applicable state and federal law;

                  (8) the Special Servicer shall indemnify the Master Servicer
         and the Trustee for any liabilities to them arising from failures of
         the Special Servicer to perform its obligations according to the terms
         of the subservicing agreement;

                  (9) the Master Servicer shall promptly give notice thereof to
         the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor of the transfer of
         servicing to the Special Servicer, including the loan number together
         with the borrower's name and the unpaid Stated Principal Balance of the
         transferred Mortgage Loan at the time of transfer;

                  (10) each of the respective obligations, duties, and
         liabilities of the Master Servicer and the Special Servicer (or either
         of them) with respect to the servicing of the Specially Serviced
         Mortgage Loans that have arisen prior to the date on which the
         servicing of such Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan was transferred to
         the Special Servicer (the "Effective Date"), or that arise on and after
         the Effective Date, under this Agreement and the subservicing agreement
         and that remain unperformed or unsatisfied shall survive any transfer
         of servicing;

                  (11) once a Group I Mortgage Loan becomes a Specially Serviced
         Mortgage Loan, such Mortgage Loan shall remain a Specially Serviced
         Mortgage Loan, and shall continue to be serviced by the Special
         Servicer, until the earlier of the liquidation or other disposition of
         such Mortgage Loan or the termination of the subservicing agreement,
         regardless of delinquency status or otherwise;

                  (12) the Guarantor may remove the Special Servicer if the
         Special Servicer at any time fails to meet any of the above criteria or
         otherwise, in the judgment of the Guarantor, fails to perform according
         to the terms of the subservicing agreement and the provisions of this
         Section 3.14; provided that prior to any such removal the Guarantor
         shall designate a successor Special Servicer meeting the requirements
         of this Section 3.14, and no removal of a Special Servicer shall be
         effective until a successor Special Servicer has entered into a special
         subservicing agreement meeting the requirements of this Section 3.14
         and agreed to assume the duties of the Special Servicer or the Master
         Servicer has undertaken such duties; and

                  (13) in connection with any transfer of a Group I Mortgage
         Loan to the Special Servicer as a Specially Serviced Mortgage Loan, the
         Master Servicer shall execute any appropriate assignments or other
         documents reasonable and necessary to further the prosecution of the
         Special Servicer obligations under the special subservicing agreement.

                  SECTION 3.15 Reports of Foreclosure and Abandonment of
                               Mortgaged Properties.

                  The Master Servicer shall file information returns with
respect to the receipt of mortgage interest received in a trade or business,
reports of foreclosures and abandonments of any Mortgaged Property and
cancellation of indebtedness income with respect to any Mortgaged Property as
required by Sections 6050H, 6050J and 6050P of the Code, respectively. Such
reports shall be in form and substance sufficient to meet the reporting
requirements imposed by such Sections 6050H, 6050J and 6050P of the Code.

                  SECTION 3.16 Optional Purchase of Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

                  (a) (i) The NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (only with respect
to the Group I Mortgage Loans) may, at its option, purchase a Mortgage Loan
which has become 90 or more days delinquent or for which the Master Servicer has
accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Prior to purchase pursuant to this
Section 3.16(a)(i), the Master Servicer shall be required to continue to make
Advances pursuant to Section 4.03. The NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor, as
applicable, shall not use any procedure in selecting Mortgage Loans to be
repurchased which is materially adverse to the interests of the
Certificateholders. The NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor, as applicable, shall
purchase such delinquent Mortgage Loan at a price equal to the Purchase Price of
such Mortgage Loan. Any such purchase of a Mortgage Loan pursuant to this
Section 3.16(a)(i) shall be accomplished by remittance to the Master Servicer
for deposit in the Collection Account of the amount of the Purchase Price. The
Trustee shall effectuate the conveyance of such delinquent Mortgage Loan to the
NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor, as applicable, to the extent necessary, as
requested, and the Trustee shall promptly deliver all documentation to the NIMS
Insurer or the Guarantor, as applicable.

                  (ii)     During the first full calendar month (but excluding
the last Business Day thereof) following a Mortgage Loan or related REO Property
becoming 90 days or more delinquent, the Master Servicer shall have the option,
but not the obligation to purchase from the Trust Fund any such Mortgage Loan or
related REO Property that is then still 90 days or more delinquent, which the
Master Servicer determines in good faith shall otherwise become subject to
foreclosure proceedings (evidence of such determination to be delivered in
writing to the Trustee prior to purchase), at a price equal to the Purchase
Price. The Purchase Price for any Mortgage Loan or related REO Property
purchased hereunder shall be deposited in the Collection Account, and the
Trustee, upon written certification of such deposit, shall release or cause to
be released to the Master Servicer the related Mortgage File and the Trustee
shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or assignment, in each
case without recourse, as the Master Servicer shall furnish and as shall be
necessary to vest in the Master Servicer title to any Mortgage Loan or related
REO Property released pursuant hereto.

                  (b) If with respect to any delinquent Mortgage Loan or related
REO Property, the option of the Master Servicer set forth in the preceding
paragraph shall have arisen but the Master Servicer shall have failed to
exercise such option on or before the Business Day preceding the last Business
Day of the calendar month following the calendar month during which such
Mortgage Loan or related REO Property first became 90 days or more delinquent,
then such option shall automatically expire; provided, however, that if any such
Mortgage Loan or related REO Property shall cease to be 90 days or more
delinquent but then subsequently shall again become 90 days or more delinquent,
then the Master Servicer shall be entitled to another repurchase option with
respect to such Mortgage Loan or REO Property as provided in the preceding
paragraph.

                  SECTION 3.17 Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.

                  (a) Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the
receipt by the Master Servicer of a notification that payment in full shall be
escrowed in a manner customary



                                      104
<PAGE>



for such purposes, the Master Servicer shall promptly notify the Trustee and any
related Custodian by a certification in the form of Exhibit E or such other form
supplied by the Master Servicer provided that it does not differ from the
substantive content of Exhibit E (which certification shall include a statement
to the effect that all amounts received or to be received in connection with
such payment which are required to be deposited in the Collection Account
pursuant to Section 3.04(b) have been or shall be so deposited) of a Servicing
Officer and shall request delivery to it of the Mortgage File. Upon receipt of
such certification and request, the Trustee or such Custodian, as the case may
be, shall promptly release (and in no event more than three (3) Business Days
thereafter) the related Mortgage File to the Master Servicer. No expenses
incurred in connection with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of
reconveyance shall be chargeable to the Collection Account or the Distribution
Account. (b) From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or
foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan, including, for this purpose, collection under
any insurance policy relating to the Mortgage Loans, the Trustee and any related
Custodian shall, upon request of the Master Servicer and delivery to the Trustee
or such Custodian, as the case may be, of a Request for Release in the form of
Exhibit E or such other form supplied by the Master Servicer provided that it
does not differ from the substantive content of Exhibit E, release the related
Mortgage File to the Master Servicer, and the Trustee shall, at the direction of
the Master Servicer, execute such documents as shall be necessary to the
prosecution of any such proceedings and the Master Servicer shall retain such
Mortgage File in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders. Such Request
for Release shall obligate the Master Servicer to return each and every document
previously requested from the Mortgage File to the Trustee or to such Custodian
when the need therefor by the Master Servicer no longer exists, unless the
Mortgage Loan has been liquidated and the Liquidation Proceeds relating to the
Mortgage Loan have been deposited in the Collection Account or the Mortgage File
or such document has been delivered to an attorney, or to a public trustee or
other public official as required by law, for purposes of initiating or pursuing
legal action or other proceedings for the foreclosure of the Mortgaged Property
either judicially or non-judicially, and the Master Servicer has delivered to
the Trustee a certificate of a Servicing Officer certifying as to the name and
address of the Person to which such Mortgage File or such document was delivered
and the purpose or purposes of such delivery. Upon receipt of a certificate of a
Servicing Officer stating that such Mortgage Loan was liquidated and that all
amounts received or to be received in connection with such liquidation that are
required to be deposited into the Collection Account have been so deposited, or
that such Mortgage Loan has become an REO Property, upon request, a copy of the
Request for Release shall be released by the Trustee or such Custodian to the
Master Servicer.

                  (c) Upon written certification of a Servicing Officer, the
Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Master Servicer any court pleadings,
requests for trustee's sale or other documents reasonably necessary to the
foreclosure or trustee's sale in respect of a Mortgaged Property or to any legal
action brought to obtain judgment against any Mortgagor on the Mortgage Note or
Mortgage or to obtain a deficiency judgment, or to enforce any other remedies or
rights provided by the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or otherwise available at law
or in equity. Each such certification shall include a request that such
pleadings or documents be executed by the Trustee and a statement as to the
reason such documents or pleadings are required and that the execution and
delivery thereof by the Trustee shall not invalidate or otherwise affect the
lien



                                      105
<PAGE>



of the Mortgage, except for the termination of such a lien upon completion of
the foreclosure or trustee's sale.

                  (d) The Trustee and the Master Servicer may mutually agree on
policies and procedures (commercially reasonable in nature) to allow the
submission of any and all requests for the release of a Mortgage File
electronically with a digital signature or other identifier to designate the
Servicing Officer of the Master Servicer requesting such collateral.

                  SECTION 3.18 Servicing Compensation.

                  As compensation for the activities of the Master Servicer
hereunder, the Master Servicer shall be entitled to the Servicing Fee with
respect to each Mortgage Loan payable solely from payments of interest in
respect of such Mortgage Loan, subject to Section 4.03(e). In addition, the
Master Servicer shall be entitled to recover unpaid Servicing Fees out of
Insurance Proceeds, Subsequent Recoveries or Liquidation Proceeds to the extent
permitted by Section 3.05(a)(ii), out of general funds in the Collection Account
to the extent permitted by Section 3.05(a) and out of amounts derived from the
operation and sale of an REO Property to the extent permitted by Section 3.13.
The right to receive the Servicing Fee may not be transferred in whole or in
part except in connection with the transfer of all of the Master Servicer's
responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement.

                  Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption
fees, late payment charges, insufficient funds fees, reconveyance fees and other
similar fees and charges (other than Prepayment Charges) shall be retained by
the Master Servicer only to the extent such amounts, fees or charges are
received by the Master Servicer. The Master Servicer shall also be entitled
pursuant to Section 3.05(a)(vi) to withdraw from the Collection Account,
pursuant to Section 3.04(h) to withdraw from any Escrow Account and pursuant to
Section 3.13(b) to withdraw from any REO Account, as additional servicing
compensation, interest or other income earned on deposits therein, subject to
Section 3.06. The Master Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred
by it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder (including premiums
for the insurance required by Section 3.08, Section 3.09 and Section 3.10, to
the extent such premiums are not paid by the related Mortgagors or by a
Sub-Servicer, servicing compensation of each Sub-Servicer, and to the extent
provided in Section 8.05, the fees and expenses of the Trustee) and shall not be
entitled to reimbursement therefor except as specifically provided herein.

                  SECTION 3.19 Statement as to Compliance.

                  The Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor, the Depositor and each Rating Agency on or before March
15th of each calendar year commencing in 2005, an Officers' Certificate in a
form similar to Exhibit M attached hereto agreeable to the parties hereto,
stating, as to each signatory thereof, that (i) a review of the activities of
the Master Servicer during the preceding calendar year and of performance under
this Agreement has been made under such officers' supervision and (ii) to the
best of such officers' knowledge, based on such review, the Master Servicer has
fulfilled all of its obligations under this Agreement throughout such year, or,
if there has been a default in the fulfillment of



                                      106
<PAGE>



any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such officer and the
nature and status thereof. Copies of any such statement shall be provided by the
Trustee to any Certificateholder and to any Person identified to the Trustee as
a prospective transferee of a Certificate, upon the request and at the expense
of the requesting party, provided that such statement is delivered by the Master
Servicer to the Trustee.

                  SECTION 3.20 Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report.

                  Not later than March 15th of each calendar year commencing in
2005, the Master Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a nationally recognized
firm of independent certified public accountants to furnish to the Master
Servicer a report stating that (i) it has obtained a letter of representation
regarding certain matters from the management of the Master Servicer which
includes an assertion that the Master Servicer has complied with certain minimum
residential mortgage loan servicing standards, identified in the Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers established by the Mortgage Bankers
Association of America, with respect to the servicing of residential mortgage
loans during the most recently completed calendar year and (ii) on the basis of
an examination conducted by such firm in accordance with standards established
by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, such representation
is fairly stated in all material respects, subject to such exceptions and other
qualifications that may be appropriate. In rendering its report such firm may
rely, as to matters relating to the direct servicing of residential mortgage
loans by Sub-Servicers, upon comparable reports of firms of independent
certified public accountants rendered on the basis of examinations conducted in
accordance with the same standards (rendered within one year of such report)
with respect to those Sub-Servicers. Immediately upon receipt of such report,
the Master Servicer shall furnish a copy of such report to the Trustee, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor and each Rating Agency. Copies of such statement shall be
provided by the Trustee to any Certificateholder upon request at the Master
Servicer's expense, provided that such statement is delivered by the Master
Servicer to the Trustee. In the event such firm of independent certified public
accountants requires the Trustee to agree to the procedures performed by such
firm, the Master Servicer shall direct the Trustee in writing to so agree; it
being understood and agreed that the Trustee shall deliver such letter of
agreement in conclusive reliance upon the direction of the Master Servicer, and
the Trustee has not made any independent inquiry or investigation as to, and
shall have no obligation or liability in respect of, the sufficiency, validity
or correctness of such procedures.

                  SECTION 3.21 Access to Certain Documentation.

                  (a) The Master Servicer shall provide to the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the FDIC, and any other federal or state banking or insurance
regulatory authority that may exercise authority over any Certificateholder or
Certificate Owner, access to the documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans
required by applicable laws and regulations. Such access shall be afforded
without charge, but only upon reasonable request and during normal business
hours at the offices of the Master Servicer designated by it. In addition,
access to the documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans shall be provided to
the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor, upon reasonable request during
normal business hours at the offices of the Master Servicer designated by it at
the expense of the Person requesting such access. In each case, access to any
documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans may be conditioned upon the
requesting party's




                                      107
<PAGE>



acknowledgment in writing of a confidentiality agreement regarding any
information that is not public or is required to remain confidential under the
Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act of 1999.

                  (b) For a period of two years from the Closing Date, the
Guarantor may contact the Depositor or the Seller to confirm that the Seller
continues to actively engage in a program to originate mortgage loans to
low-income families and to obtain other non-proprietary information about the
Seller's activities that may assist the Guarantor in completing its own
regulatory requirements during normal business hours and subject to
reimbursement for expenses. The Depositor shall use reasonable efforts to
provide such information to the Guarantor.

                  SECTION 3.22 PMI Policies; Claims Under the PMI Policies.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary elsewhere in this
Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not agree to any modification or assumption
of a PMI Mortgage Loan or take any other action with respect to a PMI Mortgage
Loan that could result in denial of coverage under the related PMI Policy. The
Master Servicer shall notify the related PMI Insurer that the Trustee, on behalf
of the Certificateholders, is the Insured, as that term is defined in the
related PMI Policy, of each PMI Mortgage Loan. The Master Servicer shall, on
behalf of the Trustee, prepare and file on a timely basis with the related PMI
Insurer, with a copy to the Trustee, all claims which may be made under the
related PMI Policy with respect to the PMI Mortgage Loans. Consistent with all
rights and obligations hereunder, the Master Servicer shall take all actions
required under each of the PMI Policies as a condition to the payment of any
such claim. Any amount received from either PMI Insurer with respect to any such
PMI Mortgage Loan shall be deposited by the Master Servicer into the Collection
Account in accordance with Section 3.04(b). The Trustee shall withdraw from the
Distribution Account on each Distribution Date and pay to the related PMI
Insurer the related PMI Insurer Fee in accordance with the terms of the related
PMI Policy.

                  SECTION 3.23 Advance Facility.

                  (a) The Master Servicer and/or the Trustee on behalf of the
Trust Fund, in either case, with the consent of the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer
and the Master Servicer in the case of the Trustee, is hereby authorized to
enter into a facility (an "Advance Facility") with any Person (an "Advancing
Person") (1) under which the Master Servicer sells, assigns or pledges to the
Advancing person the Master Servicer's rights under this Agreement to be
reimbursed for any Advances and/or Servicing Advances or (2) which provides that
the Advancing Person may fund Advances and/or Servicing Advances to the Trust
Fund under this Agreement, although no such facility shall reduce or otherwise
affect the Master Servicer's obligation to fund such Advances and/or Servicing
Advances. If the Master Servicer enters into such an Advance Facility pursuant
to this Section 3.23, upon reasonable request of the Advancing Person, the
Trustee shall execute a letter of acknowledgment, confirming its receipt of
notice of the existence of such Advance Facility. To the extent that an
Advancing Person funds any Advance or any Servicing Advance or is assigned the
right to be reimbursed for any Advance or Servicing Advance and provides the
Trustee with notice acknowledged by the Master Servicer that such Advancing
Person is entitled to reimbursement directly from the Trustee pursuant to the
terms of



                                      108
<PAGE>



the Advance Facility, such Advancing Person shall be entitled to receive
reimbursement pursuant to this Agreement for such amount to the extent provided
in Section 3.23(b). Such notice from the Advancing Person must specify the
amount of the reimbursement, the Section of this Agreement that permits the
applicable Advance or Servicing Advance to be reimbursed and the section(s) of
the Advance Facility that entitle the Advancing Person to request reimbursement
from the Trustee, rather than the Master Servicer, and include the Master
Servicer's acknowledgment thereto or proof of an Event of Default under the
Advance Facility. The Trustee shall have no duty or liability with respect to
any calculation of any reimbursement to be paid to an Advancing Person and shall
be entitled to rely without independent investigation on the Advancing Person's
notice provided pursuant to this Section 3.23. An Advancing Person whose
obligations hereunder are limited to the funding of Advances and/or Servicing
Advances shall not be required to meet the qualifications of a Master Servicer
or a Sub-Servicer pursuant to Section 6.06 hereof and shall not be deemed to be
a Sub-Servicer under this Agreement. If the terms of a facility proposed to be
entered into with an Advancing Person by the Trust Fund would not materially and
adversely affect the interests of any Certificateholder, then the NIMS Insurer
shall not withhold its consent to the Trust Fund's entering such facility.

                  (b) If, pursuant to the terms of the Advance Facility, an
Advancing Person is entitled to reimbursement directly from the Trustee, then
the Master Servicer shall not reimburse itself therefor under Section
3.05(a)(ii), Section 3.05(a)(iii) or Section 3.05(a)(v) prior to the remittance
to the Trust Fund, but instead the Master Servicer shall include such amounts in
the applicable remittance to the Trustee made pursuant to Section 3.04(g) to the
extent of amounts on deposit in the Collection Account on the related Master
Servicer Remittance Date. The Trustee is hereby authorized to pay to the
Advancing Person reimbursements for Advances and Servicing Advances from the
Distribution Account, to the extent permitted under the terms of the Advance
Facility, to the same extent the Master Servicer would have been permitted to
reimburse itself for such Advances and/or Servicing Advances in accordance with
Section 3.05(a)(ii), Section 3.05(a)(iii) or Section 3.05(a)(v), as the case may
be, had the Master Servicer itself funded such Advance or Servicing Advance. The
Trustee is hereby authorized to pay directly to the Advancing Person such
portion of the Servicing Fee as the parties to any Advance Facility agree to in
writing delivered to the Trustee. An Advance Facility may provide that the
Master Servicer will otherwise cause the remittance of Advance and/or Servicing
Advance reimbursement amounts to the Advancing Person, in which case the
foregoing sentences in this Section 3.23(b) shall not apply.

                  (c) All Advances and Servicing Advances made pursuant to the
terms of this Agreement shall be deemed made and shall be reimbursed on a "first
in first out" (FIFO) basis.

                  (d) In the event the Master Servicer is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.01, the Advancing Person shall succeed to the terminated Master
Servicer's right of reimbursement set forth in Section 7.02(c) to the extent of
such Advancing Person's financing of or receipt of assignment or pledge of the
right to be reimbursed for Advances or Servicing Advances hereunder then
remaining unreimbursed.

                  (e) None of the Trust Fund, any party to this Agreement or any
other Person shall have any right or claim (including without limitation any
right of offset or recoupment) to



                                      109
<PAGE>



any amounts allocable under this Agreement to the reimbursement of Advances or
Servicing Advances that have been assigned, conveyed or pledged to an Advancing
Person, or that relate to Advances or Servicing Advances that were funded by an
Advancing Person.

                  (f) Any amendment to this Section 3.23 or to any other
provision of this Agreement that may be necessary or appropriate to effect the
terms of an Advance Facility as described generally in this Section 3.23,
including amendments to add provisions relating to a successor master servicer,
may be entered into by the Trustee and the Master Servicer without the consent
of any Certificateholder but with the consent of the Guarantor and the NIMS
Insurer and written confirmation from each Rating Agency that the amendment
shall not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the then-current ratings of
any outstanding Class of Certificates or any other notes secured by collateral
which includes all or a portion of the Class CE Certificates, the Class P
Certificates and/or the Residual Certificates, notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement.

                  SECTION 4.01 Distributions.

                  (a) (1) On each Distribution Date, the following amounts, in
the following order of priority, shall be distributed by REMIC I to REMIC II on

Account and distributed to the Holders of the Class R Certificates (in respect
of the Class R-I Interest), as the case may be:

          amount equal to (A) the Uncertificated Interest for each REMIC I
          Regular Interest for such Distribution Date, plus (B) any amounts in
          respect thereof remaining unpaid from previous Distribution Dates; and

                  (ii) to the Holders of REMIC I Regular Interest I-LTP, on the
          Distribution Date immediately following the expiration of the latest

          any Distribution Date thereafter until $100 has been distributed
          pursuant to this clause;

         Interest Carry Forward Amount for each such Class of Mezzanine

                  (iii) sequentially, to the Holders of the Class M-1, Class
         M-2, Class M-3, Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6, Class M-7, Class M-8,
         Class M-9 and Class M-10 Certificates, in that order, in each case up
         to the Allocated Realized Loss Amount for each such Class of Mezzanine
         Certificates for such Distribution Date;

                  (iv) to the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account, the amount
         required by Section 4.10(b), after taking into account amounts, if any,
         received under the Cap Contracts;

                  (v) to the Holders of the Class CE Certificates, (a) the
         Interest Distribution Amount and any Overcollateralization Reduction

                                      118
<PAGE>



         distributed first, to the Holders of the Class P Certificates, until
         the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; and
         second, to the Holders of the Class R Certificates.

                  (5)      With respect to the Group II Certificates, all
principal distributions will be distributed sequentially, to the Class A-2,
Class A-3 and Class A-4 Certificates, in that order, until their respective
Certificate Principal Balances have been reduced to zero; provided, however, on
any Distribution Date on which the aggregate Certificate Principal Balance of
the Mezzanine Certificates and the Class CE Certificates has been reduced to
zero, all distributions of principal to the Group II Certificates will be
distributed concurrently, on a PRO RATA basis based on the Certificate Principal
Balance of each such Class.

                  On each Distribution Date, following the foregoing
distributions, an amount equal to the amount of Subsequent Recoveries deposited
into the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.05 and included in the
Available Funds for such Distribution Date shall be applied to increase the
Certificate Principal Balance of the Class of Certificates with the Highest
Priority up to the extent of such Realized Losses previously allocated to that
Class of Certificates pursuant to Section 4.04. An amount equal to the amount of
any remaining Subsequent Recoveries shall be applied to increase the Certificate
Principal Balance of the Class of Certificates with the next Highest Priority,
up to the amount of such Realized Losses previously allocated to that Class of
Certificates pursuant to Section 4.04, and so on. Holders of such Certificates
shall not be entitled to any distribution in respect of interest on the amount
of such increases for any Interest Accrual Period preceding the Distribution
Date on which such increase occurs. Any such increases shall be applied to the
Certificate Principal Balance of each Certificate of such Class in accordance
with its respective Percentage Interest.

                  (c) On each Distribution Date, after making the distributions
of the Available Funds as set forth above, the Trustee shall FIRST, withdraw
from the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account all income from the investment
of funds in the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account and distribute such
amount to the Holders of the Class CE Certificates and SECOND, withdraw from the
Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account, to the extent of amounts remaining on
deposit therein, the amount of any Net WAC Rate Carryover Amount for such
Distribution Date and distribute such amount as follows:

                  FIRST, concurrently, to each Class of Class A Certificates,
the related Cap Amount, in each case up to a maximum amount equal to the related
Net WAC Rate Carryover Amount for such Distribution Date;

                  SECOND, sequentially, to the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3,
Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6, Class M-7, Class M-8, Class M-9 and Class M-10
Certificates, in that order, the related Cap Amount for such Distribution Date,
in each case up to a maximum amount equal to the related Net WAC Rate Carryover
Amount for such Distribution Date;

                  THIRD, concurrently, to each Class of Class A Certificates,
the related Net WAC Rate Carryover Amount remaining unpaid pursuant to clause
first above, on a PRO RATA basis based on such respective remaining Net WAC Rate
Carryover Amounts; and





                                      119
<PAGE>



                  FOURTH, sequentially to the Class M-1, Class M-2, Class M-3,
Class M-4, Class M-5, Class M-6, Class M-7, Class M-8, Class M-9 and Class M-10
Certificates, in that order, the related Net WAC Rate Carryover Amount remaining
undistributed pursuant to clause second above.

                  On each Distribution Date, after the payment of any Net WAC
Rate Carryover Amounts on the Adjustable-Rate Certificates, any amounts
remaining in the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account (representing payments
received by the Trustee under the Cap Contracts), shall be payable to the
Trustee. For so long as any Adjustable-Rate Certificates are beneficially owned
by the Seller or any of its Affiliates, the Trustee shall not distribute any Cap
Amounts for such Certificates to the Seller or any of its Affiliates and shall
distribute 100% of the related Cap Amount to the other Certificateholders of
such Class.

                  On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall withdraw any
amounts then on deposit in the Distribution Account that represent Prepayment
Charges collected by the Master Servicer, Prepayment Charges payable by the
Master Servicer pursuant to Section 2.03(b)(ii)(A) and Master Servicer
Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts payable by the Master Servicer pursuant to
Section 2.03(b)(ii)(B), subject to Section 2.03(b)(iii), in each case to the
extent not related to Principal Prepayments occurring after the related
Prepayment Period, and the Trustee shall distribute such amounts to the Holders
of the Class P Certificates. Such distributions shall not be applied to reduce
the Certificate Principal Balance of the Class P Certificates.

                  (d) All distributions made with respect to each Class of
Certificates on each Distribution Date shall be allocated PRO RATA among the
outstanding Certificates in such Class based on their respective Percentage
Interests. Payments in respect of each Class of Certificates on each
Distribution Date shall be made to the Holders of the respective Class of record
on the related Record Date (except as otherwise provided in Section 4.01(e) or
Section 9.01 respecting the final distribution on such Class), based on the
aggregate Percentage Interest represented by their respective Certificates, and
shall be made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the account of
any such Holder at a bank or other entity having appropriate facilities
therefor, if such Holder shall have so notified the Trustee in writing at least
five Business Days prior to the Record Date immediately prior to such
Distribution Date, or otherwise by check mailed by first class mail to the
address of such Holder appearing in the Certificate Register. The final
distribution on each Certificate shall be made in like manner, but only upon
presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the Trustee
maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 8.12 or such other location
specified in the notice to Certificateholders of such final distribution.

                  Payments to the Guarantor on each Distribution Date will be
made by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the following Federal
Reserve Account:

                  Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate
shall be paid to the Depository, as Holder thereof, and the Depository shall be
responsible for crediting the amount of such distribution to the accounts of its
Depository Participants in accordance with its normal procedures. Each
Depository Participant shall be responsible for disbursing such distribution to
the Certificate Owners that it represents and to each indirect participating
brokerage firm (a "brokerage firm" or "indirect participating firm") for which
it acts as agent. Each brokerage firm shall be responsible for disbursing funds
to the Certificate Owners that it represents. None of the Trustee, the
Certificate Registrar, the Depositor or the Master Servicer shall have any
responsibility therefor except as otherwise provided by this Agreement or
applicable law.

                  (e) The rights of the Certificateholders to receive
distributions in respect of the Certificates, and all interests of the
Certificateholders in such distributions, shall be as set forth in this
Agreement. Neither the Holders of any Class of Certificates nor the Trustee nor
the Master Servicer shall in any way be responsible or liable to the Holders of
any other Class of Certificates in respect of amounts properly previously
distributed on the Certificates.

                  (f) Except as otherwise provided in Section 9.01, whenever the
Trustee expects that the final distribution with respect to any Class of
Certificates shall be made on the next Distribution Date, the Trustee shall, no
later than five (5) days after the related Determination Date, mail to the
Guarantor and each Holder on such date of such Class of Certificates a notice to
the effect that:

                  (i) the Trustee expects that the final distribution with
         respect to such Class of Certificates shall be made on such
         Distribution Date, but only upon presentation and surrender of such
         Certificates at the office of the Trustee therein specified or its
         agent; and

                  (ii) no interest shall accrue on such Certificates from and
         after the end of the related Interest Accrual Period.

                  Any funds not distributed to any Holder or Holders of
Certificates of such Class on such Distribution Date because of the failure of
such Holder or Holders to tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set
aside and held in trust by the Trustee and credited to the account of the
appropriate non-tendering Holder or Holders. If any Certificates as to which
notice has been given pursuant to this Section 4.01(e) shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation within six months after the time specified in such
notice, the Trustee shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering
Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to
receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within one year after
the second notice all such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, the Trustee shall, directly or through an agent, mail a final
notice to remaining non-tendering Certificateholders concerning surrender of
their Certificates but shall continue to hold any remaining funds for the
benefit of non-tendering Certificateholders. The costs and expenses of
maintaining the funds in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall
be paid out of the assets remaining in such trust fund. If within one year after
the final notice any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, the Trustee shall pay to the Representative all remaining amounts,
and all rights of non-tendering Certificateholders in or to such amounts shall




                                      121

thereupon cease. No interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder
on any amount held in trust by the Trustee as a result of such
Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment
thereof in accordance with this Section 4.01(e).

                  (g) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, (i) in no
event shall the Certificate Principal Balance of a Class A Certificate or a
Mezzanine Certificate be reduced more than once in respect of any particular
amount both (a) allocated to such Certificate in respect of Realized Losses
pursuant to Section 4.04 and (b) distributed to the Holder of such Certificate
in reduction of the Certificate Principal Balance thereof pursuant to this
Section 4.01 from Net Monthly Excess Cashflow and (ii) in no event shall the
Uncertificated Balance of a REMIC Regular Interest be reduced more than once in
respect of any particular amount both (a) allocated to such REMIC Regular
Interest in respect of Realized Losses pursuant to Section 4.04 and (b)
distributed on such REMIC Regular Interest in reduction of the Uncertificated
Balance thereof pursuant to this Section 4.01.

                  On the third Business Day preceding each Distribution Date,
the Trustee shall deliver to the Guarantor (by electronic medium as specified in
the next sentence) a statement identifying the Certificate Factor for each Class
of Certificates. The Trustee shall deliver such statement on or before 12:00
noon (New York time) on such day via the internet using the following domain
name: bond_admin@fanniemae.com. If a Guarantor Payment will be payable on a
Distribution Date, all information required under Section 4.02 must also be
similarly delivered to Guarantor on the third Business Day preceding such
Distribution Date. The second consecutive failure by the Trustee to deliver the
Certificate Factor (or to deliver an accurate Certificate Factor) to the
Guarantor shall constitute an event of default and permit the Guarantor to
remove the Trustee for cause; provided that the Master Servicer had delivered an
accurate and timely Remittance Report for the related Distribution Date to the
Trustee pursuant to Section 4.03.

                  SECTION 4.03 Remittance Reports and Other Reports to the
                               Trustee; Advances; Payments in Respect of
                               Prepayment Interest Shortfalls.

                  (a) On the Master Servicer Reporting Date, the Master Servicer
shall deliver to the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer by telecopy (or
by such other means as the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Guarantor and the
NIMS Insurer may agree from time to time) a Remittance Report with respect to
the related Distribution Date. All such reports shall be delivered to the
Guarantor as specified in the Guarantor's Lender Guide, as amended from time to
time. Such Remittance Report shall include (i) the amount of Advances to be made
by the Master Servicer in respect of the related Distribution Date, the
aggregate amount of Advances outstanding after giving effect to such Advances,
and the aggregate amount of Nonrecoverable Advances in respect of such
Distribution Date and (ii) such other information with respect to the Mortgage
Loans as the Trustee may reasonably require to perform the calculations
necessary to make the distributions contemplated by Section 4.01 and to prepare
the statements to Certificateholders contemplated by Section 4.02. The Trustee
shall not be responsible to recompute, recalculate or verify any information
provided to it by the Master Servicer.

                  On or before 5:00 p.m. New York time on the fourth Business
Day preceding each Distribution Date, the Master Servicer shall deliver a report
to the Guarantor (using the internet and the following domain name:
CREDIT_ADMINISTRATION@FANNIEMAE.COM or by such other means as the Master
Servicer and the Guarantor may agree from time to time) containing such data and
information regarding the Mortgage Loans as is specified in the Guarantor's
"Private Label Wrap Deals - Quick Start Guide for Lenders" or such other data
and information as the Master Servicer and the Guarantor may agree from time to
time.

                  Not later than fifteen days after each Distribution Date, the
Master Servicer shall forward to the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor
and the Depositor a statement prepared by the Master Servicer setting forth the
status of the Collection Account as of the close of business on such
Distribution Date and showing, for the period covered by such statement, the
aggregate amount of deposits into and withdrawals from the Collection Account of
each category of deposit specified in Section 3.04(b) and each category of
withdrawal specified in Section 3.05. Such statement may be in the form of the
then current Fannie Mae Monthly Accounting Report for its Guaranteed Mortgage
Pass-Through Program with appropriate additions and changes, and shall also
include information as to the aggregate of the outstanding Stated Principal
Balances of all of the Mortgage Loans as of the last day of the calendar month
immediately preceding such Distribution Date. Copies of such statement shall be
provided by the Trustee to any Certificateholder and to any Person identified to
the Trustee as a prospective transferee of a Certificate, upon request at the
expense of the requesting party, provided such statement is delivered by the
Master Servicer to the Trustee.

                  (b) The amount of Advances to be made by the Master Servicer
for any Distribution Date shall equal, subject to Section 4.03(d), the sum of
(i) the aggregate amount of Monthly Payments (with each interest portion thereof
net of the related Servicing Fee), due on the related Due Date in respect of the
Mortgage Loans, which Monthly Payments were delinquent as of the close of
business on the related Determination Date and (ii) with respect to



                                      127
<PAGE>



each REO Property, which REO Property was acquired during or prior to the
related Prepayment Period and as to which such REO Property an REO Disposition
did not occur during the related Prepayment Period, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the Monthly Payments (with each interest portion thereof net
of the related Servicing Fee) that would have been due on the related Due Date
in respect of the related Mortgage Loans, over the net income from such REO
Property transferred to the Distribution Account pursuant to Section 3.13 for
distribution on such Distribution Date.

                  On or before 3:00 p.m. New York time on the Master Servicer
Remittance Date, the Master Servicer shall remit in immediately available funds
to the Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account an amount equal to the
aggregate amount of Advances, if any, to be made in respect of the Mortgage
Loans and REO Properties for the related Distribution Date either (i) from its
own funds or (ii) from the Collection Account, to the extent of funds held
therein for future distribution (in which case, it shall cause to be made an
appropriate entry in the records of the Collection Account that amounts held for
future distribution have been, as permitted by this Section 4.03, used by the
Master Servicer in discharge of any such Advance) or (iii) in the form of any
combination of (i) and (ii) aggregating the total amount of Advances to be made
by the Master Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties.
Any amounts held for future distribution used by the Master Servicer to make an
Advance as permitted in the preceding sentence or withdrawn by the Master
Servicer as permitted in Section 3.05(a)(vii) in reimbursement of Advances
previously made shall be appropriately reflected in the Master Servicer's
records and replaced by the Master Servicer by deposit in the Collection Account
on or before any future Master Servicer Remittance Date to the extent that the
Available Funds for the related Distribution Date (determined without regard to
Advances to be made on the Master Servicer Remittance Date) shall be less than
the total amount that would be distributed to the Classes of Certificateholders
pursuant to Section 4.01 on such Distribution Date if such amounts held for
future distributions had not been so used to make Advances. The Trustee shall
provide notice to the Master Servicer, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer by
telecopy by the close of business on any Master Servicer Remittance Date in the
event that the amount remitted by the Master Servicer to the Trustee on such
date is less than the Advances required to be made by the Master Servicer for
the related Distribution Date.

                  (c) The obligation of the Master Servicer to make such
Advances is mandatory, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but
subject to (d) below, and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan or REO Property,
shall continue until a Final Recovery Determination in connection therewith or
the removal thereof from REMIC I pursuant to any applicable provision of this
Agreement, except as otherwise provided in this Section.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Advance or Servicing Advance shall be required to be made hereunder by the
Master Servicer if such Advance or Servicing Advance would, if made, constitute
a Nonrecoverable Advance or Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance. The determination
by the Master Servicer that it has made a Nonrecoverable Advance or a
Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance or that any proposed Advance or Servicing
Advance, if made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance or Nonrecoverable
Servicing Advance, respectively, shall be evidenced by an Officers' Certificate
of the Master Servicer delivered to the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS
Insurer.

                  (e) The Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee for
deposit into the Distribution Account on or before 3:00 p.m. New York time on
the Master Servicer Remittance Date from its own funds an amount ("Compensating
Interest") equal to the lesser of (i) the aggregate of the Prepayment Interest
Shortfalls for the related Distribution Date resulting solely from Principal
Prepayments during the related Prepayment Period and (ii) the amount of its
aggregate Servicing Fee for the most recently ended calendar month. The Master
Servicer shall not have the right to reimbursement for any amounts remitted to
the Trustee in respect of Prepayment Interest Shortfalls. Such amounts so
remitted shall be included in the Available Funds and distributed therewith on
the next Distribution Date. The Master Servicer shall not be obligated to pay
any amounts with respect to Relief Act Interest Shortfalls.

                  (f) On the fifth Business Day prior to each Distribution Date,
the Depositor shall cause notice to be given to the Trustee regarding whether
the Depositor or any of its Affiliates are the Certificate Owners of any Class
of Certificates which benefits from a Cap Contract.

                  SECTION 4.04 Allocation of Realized Losses.

                  (a) On or before each Determination Date, the Master Servicer
shall determine as to each Mortgage Loan and REO Property: (i) the total amount
of Realized Losses, if any, incurred in connection with any Final Recovery
Determinations made during the related Prepayment Period; (ii) whether and the
extent to which such Realized Losses constituted Bankruptcy Losses; and (iii)
the respective portions of such Realized Losses allocable to interest and
allocable to principal. On or before each Determination Date, the Master
Servicer shall also determine as to each Mortgage Loan: (A) the total amount of
Realized Losses, if any, incurred in connection with any Deficient Valuations
made during the related Prepayment Period; and (B) the total amount of Realized
Losses, if any, incurred in connection with Debt Service Reductions in respect
of Monthly Payments due during the related Due Period. The information described
in the two preceding sentences that is to be supplied by the Master Servicer
shall be evidenced by an Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee and the
Guarantor by the Master Servicer on the Master Servicer Reporting Date
immediately following the end of (x) in the case of Bankruptcy Losses allocable
to interest, the Due Period during which any such Realized Loss was incurred,
and (y) in the case of all other Realized Losses, the Prepayment Period during
which any such Realized Loss was incurred.

                  (b) All Realized Losses on the Mortgage Loans shall be
allocated by the Trustee on each Distribution Date as follows: FIRST, in
reduction of interest accrued on and otherwise distributable to the Class CE
Certificates to the extent of Net Monthly Excess Cashflow used to pay principal
on the Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates under clause (i) of
Section 4.01 hereof; SECOND, in reduction of interest accrued on and otherwise
distributable to the Class CE Certificates to the extent of Net Monthly Excess
Cashflow available for distribution pursuant to clauses (ii) through (vi) of
Section 4.01(a)(4) hereof; and THIRD, in reduction of the Certificate Principal
Balance of the Class CE Certificates (determined after taking into account all
distributions made on the Certificates on such Distribution Date), until the
Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero. If on any
Distribution Date, after all distributions are made by the Trustee pursuant to
Section 4.01 hereof, the aggregate



                                      129
<PAGE>



Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine
Certificates and the Class P Certificates exceeds the sum of the Stated
Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the last day of the related Due
Period (after taking into account prepayments during the related Prepayment
Period), the amount of such excess shall be allocated: FIRST, to the Class M-10
Certificates, until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced
to zero; SECOND, to the Class M-9 Certificates, until the Certificate Principal
Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; THIRD, to the Class M-8 Certificates,
until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero;
FOURTH, to the Class M-7 Certificates, until the Certificate Principal Balance
thereof has been reduced to zero; FIFTH, to the Class M-6 Certificates, until
the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; SIXTH, to
the Class M-5 Certificates, until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has
been reduced to zero; SEVENTH, to the Class M-4 Certificates, until the
Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero; EIGHTH, to the
Class M-3 Certificates, until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been
reduced to zero, NINTH, to the Class M-2 Certificates, until the Certificate
Principal Balance thereof has been reduced to zero and TENTH, to the Class M-1
Certificates, until the Certificate Principal Balance thereof has been reduced
to zero. All Realized Losses to be allocated to the Certificate Principal
Balances of all Classes on any Distribution Date shall be so allocated after the
actual distributions to be made on such date as provided above.

                  Any such allocation to a Class of Mezzanine Certificates on
any Distribution Date shall be made by reducing the Certificate Principal
Balance thereof (after the actual distributions to be made on such Distribution
Date pursuant to Section 4.01 hereof) by the amount so allocated; any allocation
of Realized Losses to a Class CE Certificate shall be made by reducing the
amount otherwise payable in respect thereof pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(4)(v).
No allocations of any Realized Losses shall be made to the Certificate Principal
Balances of the Class A Certificates or the Class P Certificates.

                  As used herein, an allocation of a Realized Loss on a "PRO
RATA basis" among two or more specified Classes of Certificates means an
allocation on a PRO RATA basis, among the various Classes so specified, to each
such Class of Certificates on the basis of their then outstanding Certificate
Principal Balances prior to giving effect to distributions to be made on such
Distribution Date. All Realized Losses and all other losses allocated to a Class
of Certificates hereunder shall be allocated among the Certificates of such
Class in proportion to the Percentage Interests evidenced thereby.

                  (c) All Realized Losses on the Group I Mortgage Loans shall be
allocated by the Trustee on each Distribution Date, first to REMIC I Regular
Interest I-LT1 and REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT1PF, until the Uncertificated
Balance of each such REMIC I Regular Interest has been reduced to zero; provided
however, with respect to the first three Distribution Dates, all Realized Losses
on the Initial Group I Mortgage Loans shall be allocated to REMIC 1 Regular
Interest I-LT1, until the Uncertificated Balance thereof has been reduced to
zero, and all Realized Losses on the Subsequent Group I Mortgage Loans shall be
allocated to REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT1PF until the Uncertificated Balance
thereof has been reduced to zero. All Realized Losses on the Group II Mortgage
Loans shall be allocated by the Trustee on each Distribution Date, first to
REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT2 and REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT2PF, until the
Uncertificated Balance of each such REMIC I Regular Interest has been



                                      130
<PAGE>



reduced to zero; provided however, with respect to the first three Distribution
Dates, all Realized Losses on the Initial Group II Mortgage Loans shall be
allocated to REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT2, until the Uncertificated Balance
thereof has been reduced to zero, and all Realized Losses on the Subsequent
Group II Mortgage Loans shall be allocated to REMIC I Regular Interest I-LT2PF
until the Uncertificated Balance thereof has been reduced to zero.

                  (d) (i) The REMIC II Marker Allocation Percentage of all
Realized Losses on the Mortgage Loans shall be allocated by the Trustee on each
Distribution Date to the following REMIC II Regular Interests in the specified
percentages, as follows: first, to Uncertificated Interest payable to the REMIC
II Regular Interest II-LTAA and REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTZZ up to an
aggregate amount equal to the REMIC II Interest Loss Allocation Amount, 98% and
2%, respectively; second, to the Uncertificated Balances of the REMIC II Regular
Interest II-LTAA and REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTZZ up to an aggregate amount
equal to the REMIC II Principal Loss Allocation Amount, 98% and 2%,
respectively; third, to the Uncertificated Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM10 and REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%, respectively, until the Uncertificated Balance of REMIC
II Regular Interest II-LTM10 has been reduced to zero; fourth, to the
Uncertificated Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular
Interest II-LTM9 and REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%,
respectively, until the Uncertificated Balance of REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTM9 has been reduced to zero; fifth, to the Uncertificated Balances of REMIC
II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM8 and REMIC II
Regular Interest II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%, respectively, until the Uncertificated
Balance of REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM8 has been reduced to zero; sixth, to
the Uncertificated Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II
Regular Interest II-LTM7 and REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%,
respectively, until the Uncertificated Balance of REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTM7 has been reduced to zero; seventh, to the Uncertificated Balances of
REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM6 and REMIC
II Regular Interest II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%, respectively, until the
Uncertificated Balance of REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM6 has been reduced to
zero; eighth, to the Uncertificated Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM5 and REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%, respectively, until the Uncertificated Balance of REMIC
II Regular Interest II-LTM5 has been reduced to zero; ninth, to the
Uncertificated Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular
Interest II-LTM4 and REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%,
respectively, until the Uncertificated Balance of REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTM4 has been reduced to zero; tenth, to the Uncertificated Balances of REMIC
II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM3 and REMIC II
Regular Interest II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%, respectively, until the Uncertificated
Balance of REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM3 has been reduced to zero; eleventh,
to the Uncertificated Balances of REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II
Regular Interest II-LTM2 and REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTZZ, 98%, 1% and 1%,
respectively, until the Uncertificated Balance of REMIC II Regular Interest
II-LTM2 has been reduced to zero, and twelfth, to the Uncertificated Balances of
REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTAA, REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTM1 and REMIC

<PAGE>



                  (ii)     The REMIC II Sub WAC Allocation Percentage of all
Realized Losses shall be applied after all distributions have been made on each
Distribution Date first, so as to keep the Uncertificated Balance of each REMIC
II Regular Interest ending with the designation "GRP" equal to 0.01% of the
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan
Group; second, to each REMIC II Regular Interest ending with the designation
"SUB," so that the Uncertificated Balance of each such REMIC II Regular Interest
is equal to 0.01% of the excess of (x) the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of
the Mortgage Loans in the related Loan Group over (y) the current Certificate
Principal Balance of the Class A Certificate in the related Loan Group (except
that if any such excess is a larger number than in the preceding distribution
period, the least amount of Realized Losses shall be applied to such REMIC II
Regular Interests such that the REMIC II Subordinated Balance Ratio is
maintained); and third, any remaining Realized Losses shall be allocated to
REMIC II Regular Interest II-LTXX.

                  SECTION 4.05 Compliance with Withholding Requirements.

                  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the
Trustee shall comply with all federal withholding requirements respecting
payments to Certificateholders of interest or original issue discount that the
Trustee reasonably believes are applicable under the Code. The consent of
Certificateholders shall not be required for such withholding. In the event the
Trustee does withhold any amount from interest or original issue discount
payments or advances thereof to any Certificateholder pursuant to federal
withholding requirements, the Trustee shall indicate the amount withheld to such
Certificateholders.

                  SECTION 4.06 Commission Reporting.

                  (a) The Trustee shall reasonably cooperate with the Depositor
in connection with the Trust's satisfying the reporting requirements under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"). The Trustee
shall prepare on behalf of the Trust any Forms 8-K and 10-K customary for
similar securities as required by the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations
of the Commission thereunder, and the Depositor shall sign (or shall cause
another entity acceptable to the Commission to sign) and the Trustee shall file
(via the Commission's Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval System) such forms
on behalf of the Depositor (or such other entity). The Depositor hereby grants
to the Trustee a limited power of attorney to execute any Form 8-K and file each
such document on behalf of the Depositor. Such power of attorney shall continue
until the earlier of (i) receipt by the Trustee from the Depositor of written
termination of such power of attorney and (ii) the termination of the Trust.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Depositor, and not the
Trustee, shall be responsible for executing each Form 10-K filed on behalf of
the Trust.

                  (b) Each Form 8-K shall be filed by the Trustee within 15 days
after each Distribution Date, with a copy of the statement to the
Certificateholders for such Distribution Date as an exhibit thereto. Prior to
March 30th of each year (or such earlier date as may be required by the Exchange
Act and the Rules and Regulations of the Commission), the Trustee shall file a
Form 10-K, in substance as required by applicable law or applicable Commission
staff's interpretations. Such Form 10-K shall include as exhibits the Master
Servicer's annual statement of compliance described under Section 3.19 and the
accountant's report described



                                      132
<PAGE>



under Section 3.20, in each case to the extent they have been timely delivered
to the Trustee. If they are not so timely delivered, the Trustee shall file an
amended Form 10-K including such documents as exhibits reasonably promptly after
they are delivered to the Trustee. The Trustee shall have no liability with
respect to any failure to properly prepare or file such periodic reports
resulting from or relating to the Trustee's inability or failure to obtain any
information not resulting from its own negligence or willful misconduct. The
Form 10-K shall also include a certification in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit J-1 (the "Certification"), which shall be signed by the senior officer
of the Depositor in charge of securitization.

                  (c) In addition, the Trustee shall sign a certification (in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit J-2) for the benefit of the Depositor and
its officers, directors and Affiliates regarding certain aspects of items 1
through 3 of the Certification (provided, however, that the Trustee shall not
undertake an analysis of the accountant's report attached as an exhibit to the
Form 10-K). The Trustee's certification shall be delivered to the Depositor by
no later than March 18th of each year (or if such day is not a Business Day, the
immediately preceding Business Day) and the Depositor shall deliver the
Certification to the Trustee for filing no later than March 20th of each year
(or if such day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day).

                  In addition, the Trustee shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Depositor and its officers, directors and Affiliates from and against any
losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal
fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses arising out of or
based upon a breach of the Trustee's obligations under this Section 4.06 or the
Trustee's negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith.
The Depositor shall indemnify and hold harmless the Trustee and its officers,
directors and Affiliates from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments
and other costs and expenses arising out of or based upon a breach of the
Depositor's obligations under this Section 4.06 or the Depositor's negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith. If the indemnification
provided for herein is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the
Depositor or the Trustee, as applicable, then the other party, in connection
with a breach of its respective obligations under this Section 4.06 or its
respective negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith,
agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the other party
as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the other party in
such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Depositor
on the one hand and the Trustee on the other.

                  (d) Upon any filing with the Commission, the Trustee shall
promptly deliver to the Depositor a copy of any executed report, statement or
information.

                  (e) Prior to January 30th of the first year in which the
Trustee is able to do so under applicable law, the Trustee shall file a Form 15
Suspension Notification with respect to the Trust.

                  (f) To the extent that, following the Closing Date, the
Depositor certifies that reports and certifications differing from those
required under this Section 4.06 comply with the reporting requirements under
the Exchange Act, the parties hereto hereby agree that they shall



                                      133
<PAGE>



reasonably cooperate to amend the provisions of this Section 4.06 (in accordance
with Section 11.01) in order to comply with such amended reporting requirements
and such amendment of this Section 4.06. Any such amendment may result in the
reduction of the reports filed by the Depositor under the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall not be obligated to enter into
any amendment pursuant to this Section that adversely affects its obligations
and immunities under this Agreement.

                  SECTION 4.07 Pre-Funding Accounts.

                  (a) No later than the Closing Date, the Trustee shall
establish and maintain two segregated non-interest bearing trust accounts that
are each Eligible Accounts, which shall be titled (i) "Group I Pre-Funding
Account, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for the registered
holders of Ameriquest Mortgage Securities Inc., Asset-Backed Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2004-R12" (the "Group I Pre-Funding Account") and (ii)
"Group II Pre-Funding Account, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee
for the registered holders of Ameriquest Mortgage Securities Inc., Asset-Backed
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-R12" (the "Group II Pre-Funding
Account"). The Trustee shall, promptly upon receipt, deposit in the applicable
Pre-Funding Account and retain therein the Original Group I Pre-Funded Amount or
the Original Group II Pre-Funding Account, as applicable, remitted on the
Closing Date to the Trustee by the Depositor. Funds deposited in the Pre-Funding
Accounts shall be held in trust by the Trustee for the Certificateholders for
the uses and purposes set forth herein.

                  (b) The Trustee shall invest funds deposited in the
Pre-Funding Accounts in Permitted Investments of the kind described in clauses
(i), (v) or (vi) of the definition of Permitted Investments, as specified in a
written direction from the Master Servicer, with a maturity date no later than
the second Business Day preceding each Distribution Date. For federal income tax
purposes, the holder of the largest Percentage Interest of the Residual
Certificates shall be the owner of the Pre-Funding Accounts and shall report all
items of income, deduction, gain or loss arising therefrom. The Master Servicer
shall deposit in the applicable Pre-Funding Account the amount of any net loss
incurred in respect of any such Permitted Investment immediately upon
realization of such loss without any right of reimbursement therefor. The
Pre-Funding Accounts shall not be assets of any Trust REMIC.

                  (c) Amounts on deposit in the Pre-Funding Accounts shall be
withdrawn by the Trustee as follows:

                  (i) on any Subsequent Transfer Date, the Trustee shall
         withdraw from the related Pre-Funding Account an amount equal to 100%
         of the Stated Principal Balances of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans
         transferred and assigned to the Trustee for deposit in the Mortgage
         Pool on such Subsequent Transfer Date and pay such amount to or upon
         the order of the Depositor upon satisfaction of the conditions set
         forth in Section 2.09 with respect to such transfer and assignment;

                  (ii) if the amount on deposit in the related Pre-Funding
         Account has not been reduced to zero during the Funding Period, on the
         day of the termination of the Funding



                                      134

         Period, the Trustee shall deposit into the Distribution Account any
         amounts remaining in the Pre-Funding Account to be held uninvested;

                  (iii) to withdraw any amount not required to be deposited in
         the Pre-Funding Accounts or deposited therein in error;

                  (iv) to distribute to the Interest Coverage Account any income
         and gain realized from the investment of funds in the Pre-Funding
         Accounts; and

                  (v) to clear and terminate the Pre-Funding Accounts upon the
         earlier to occur of (A) the day immediately following the end of the
         Funding Period and (B) the termination of this Agreement, with any
         amounts remaining on deposit therein being paid to the Holders of the
         Certificates then entitled to distributions in respect of principal.

                  SECTION 4.08 Interest Coverage Accounts.

                  (a) If amounts are required to be deposited in the Interest
Coverage Accounts, no later than the Closing Date, the Trustee shall establish
and maintain a segregated non-interest bearing trust account that is an Eligible
Account, which shall be titled (i) "Group I Interest Coverage Account, Deutsche
Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for the registered holders of Ameriquest
Securities Inc., Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-R12" (the
"Group I Interest Coverage Account") and (ii) "Group II Interest Coverage
Account, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee for the registered
holders of Ameriquest Mortgage Securities Inc., Asset-Backed Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2004-R12" (the "Group II Interest Coverage Account"). The
Trustee shall, promptly upon receipt, deposit in each Interest Coverage Account
and retain therein the related Interest Coverage Amount, remitted on the Closing
Date to the Trustee by the Depositor. Funds deposited in the Interest Coverage
Accounts shall be held in trust by the Trustee for the Certificateholders for
the uses and purposes set forth herein

                  (b) The Trustee shall invest funds deposited in the Interest
Coverage Accounts in Permitted Investments of the kind described in clauses (i),
(v) or (vi) of the definition of Permitted Investments, as specified in a
written direction from the Master Servicer, with a maturity date no later than
the second Business Day preceding each Distribution Date. For federal income tax
purposes, the holder of the largest Percentage Interest of the Residual
Certificates shall be the owner of the Interest Coverage Accounts and shall
report all items of income, deduction, gain or loss arising therefrom. At no
time shall either Interest Coverage Account be an asset of any Trust REMIC. All
income and gain realized from investment of funds deposited in the Interest
Coverage Accounts shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Master
Servicer and shall be remitted by the Trustee to the Master Servicer on the
first Business Day following each Distribution Date. The Master Servicer shall
deposit in the Interest Coverage Accounts the amount of any net loss incurred in
respect of any such Permitted Investment immediately upon realization of such
loss.

                  (c) On each Distribution Date during the Funding Period and on
the last day of the Funding Period, the Trustee shall withdraw from the related
Interest Coverage Account



                                      135
<PAGE>



and deposit in the Distribution Account an amount equal to 30 days' interest on
the excess, if any, of the related Original Pre-Funded Amount, over the
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of related Subsequent Mortgage Loans that
both (i) had a Due Date during the Due Period relating to such Distribution Date
and (ii) had a Subsequent Cut-off Date prior to the first day of the month in
which such Distribution Date occurs, at a per annum rate equal to the weighted
average Pass-Through Rate of the related Offered Certificates for such
Distribution Date, with the Pass-Through Rate on the related Offered
Certificates, solely for the purposes of the foregoing calculation, multiplied
by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual number of days in the
Accrual Period for such Class for such Distribution Date, and the denominator of
which is 30. Such withdrawal and deposit shall be treated as a contribution of
cash by the Master Servicer to REMIC I. Immediately following any such
withdrawal and deposit, and immediately following the conveyance of any
Subsequent Mortgage Loans to the Trust on any Subsequent Transfer Date, the
Trustee shall withdraw from the Interest Coverage Accounts and remit to the
Master Servicer or its designee an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the
amount remaining in such Interest Coverage Account over the amount that would be
required to be withdrawn therefrom (assuming sufficient funds therein) pursuant
to the second preceding sentence on each subsequent Distribution Date, if any,
that shall occur during the Funding Period or that shall be the last day of the
Funding Period, if no Subsequent Mortgage Loans were acquired by the Trust Fund
after the end of the Prepayment Period relating to the current Distribution Date
(assuming that LIBOR remains constant at the level of LIBOR applicable to the
calculation of the Pass-Through Rate for the Class A Certificates and Mezzanine
Certificates for the current Distribution Date).

                  (d) Upon the earlier of (i) the Distribution Date immediately
following the end of the Funding Period, (ii) the reduction of the aggregate
Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine
Certificates to zero or (iii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 9.01, any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Coverage
Accounts after distributions pursuant to paragraph (c) above shall be withdrawn
by the Trustee and paid to the Depositor or its designee.

                  SECTION 4.09 The Guaranty.

                  On each Distribution Date following receipt (i) of a statement
(as set forth in Section 4.02) that indicates a Guarantor Deficiency Amount for
such Distribution Date and (ii) the Notice of Claim, the Guarantor shall
distribute a Guarantor Payment, in an aggregate amount equal to the Guarantor
Deficiency Amount for such Distribution Date directly to the Holders of the
Guaranteed Certificates, without first depositing such amount in the
Distribution Account, as follows: (i) the Guaranteed Interest Distribution
Amount shall be distributed as interest with respect to the Guaranteed
Certificates as provided in Section 4.01; and (ii) the Guaranteed Principal
Distribution Amount shall be distributed as principal with respect to the
Guaranteed Certificates as provided in Section 4.01.

                  SECTION 4.10 [Reserved].

                  SECTION 4.11 Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account.

                  (a) No later than the Closing Date, the Trustee shall
establish and maintain with itself, as agent for the Trustee, a separate,
segregated trust account titled, "Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account,
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee, in trust for the registered
Holders of Ameriquest Mortgage Securities Inc., Asset-Backed Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2004-R12." The Trustee shall deposit into the Net WAC Rate
Carryover Reserve Account any payments received by it (i) under the Cap
Contracts for the benefit of the Holders of the Adjustable-Rate Certificates and
(ii) pursuant to Section 4.01(a)(4)(iv).

                  (b) On each Distribution Date as to which there is a Net WAC
Rate Carryover Amount payable to the Class A Certificates or the Mezzanine
Certificates, the Trustee has been directed by the Class CE Certificateholders
to, and therefore shall, deposit into the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account
the amount of such Net WAC Rate Carryover Amount, after taking into account
amounts received under the Cap Contracts, rather than distributing such amounts
to the Class CE Certificateholders. On each such Distribution Date, the Trustee
shall hold all such amounts for the benefit of the Holders of the Class A
Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates, and shall distribute such amounts
to the Holders of the Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates in the
amounts and priorities set forth in Section 4.01(a).

                  (c) For federal and state income tax purposes, the Class CE
Certificateholders shall be deemed to be the owners of the Net WAC Rate
Carryover Reserve Account and all amounts deposited into the Net WAC Rate
Carryover Reserve Account shall be treated as amounts distributed by REMIC III
to the Holders of the Class CE Certificates (other than amounts paid under the
Cap Contracts). Upon the termination of the Trust, or the payment in full of the
Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates, all amounts remaining on
deposit in the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account shall be released by the
Trust and distributed to the Class CE Certificateholders or their designees. The
Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account shall be part of the Trust but not part
of any REMIC and any payments to the Holders of the Class A Certificates or the
Mezzanine Certificates of Net WAC Rate Carryover Amounts shall not be payments
with respect to a "regular interest" in a REMIC within the meaning of Code
Section 860(G)(a)(1).

                  (d) By accepting a Class CE Certificate, each Class CE
Certificateholder hereby agrees to direct the Trustee, and the Trustee hereby is
directed, to deposit into the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account the amounts
described above on each Distribution Date as to which there is any Net WAC Rate
Carryover Amount rather than distributing such amounts to the Class CE
Certificateholders. By accepting a Class CE Certificate, each Class CE
Certificateholder further agrees that such direction is given for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged by
such acceptance.

                  (e) At the written direction of the Holders of a majority in
Percentage Interest in the Class CE Certificates, the Trustee shall direct any
depository institution maintaining the



                                      137
<PAGE>



Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account to invest the funds in such account in
one or more Permitted Investments bearing interest or sold at a discount, and
maturing, unless payable on demand, (i) no later than the Business Day
immediately preceding the date on which such funds are required to be withdrawn
from such account pursuant to this Agreement, if a Person other than the Trustee
or an Affiliate manages or advises such investment, and (ii) no later than the
date on which such funds are required to be withdrawn from such account pursuant
to this Agreement, if the Trustee or an Affiliate manages or advises such
investment. If no investment direction of the Holders of a majority in
Percentage Interest in the Class CE Certificates with respect to the Net WAC
Rate Carryover Reserve Account is received by the Trustee, the Trustee shall
invest the funds in the Deutsche Bank Institutional Cash Management Fund 541 so
long as it is a Permitted Investment. Interest earned on such investment shall
be deposited into the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account.

                  (f) For federal income tax return and information reporting,
the value assigned to the right of the Holders of the Group I Certificates,
Group II Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates to receive payments from
the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account in respect of any Net WAC Rate
Carryover Amount shall be $509,000, $290,000 and $401,000, respectively.

                                   ARTICLE V

                                THE CERTIFICATES

                  SECTION 5.01 The Certificates.

                  (a) The Certificates in the aggregate shall represent the
entire beneficial ownership interest in the Mortgage Loans and all other assets
included in REMIC I. At the Closing Date, the aggregate Certificate Principal
Balance of the Certificates shall equal the aggregate Stated Principal Balance
of the Mortgage Loans.

                  The Certificates shall be substantially in the forms annexed
hereto as Exhibits A-1 through A-17. The Certificates of each Class shall be
issuable in registered form only, in denominations of authorized Percentage
Interests as described in the definition thereof. Each Certificate shall share
ratably in all rights of the related Class.

                  Upon original issue, the Certificates shall be executed and
delivered by the Trustee and the Trustee shall cause the Certificates to be
authenticated by the Certificate Registrar to or upon the order of the
Depositor. The Certificates shall be executed and attested by manual or
facsimile signature on behalf of the Trustee by an authorized signatory.
Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were
at any time the proper officers of the Trustee shall bind the Trustee
notwithstanding that such individuals or any of them have ceased to hold such
offices prior to the authentication and delivery of such Certificates or did not
hold such offices at the date of such Certificates. No Certificate shall be
entitled to any benefit under this Agreement or be valid for any purpose, unless
there appears on such Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially
in the form provided herein executed by the Certificate Registrar by manual
signature, and such certificate of authentication shall be conclusive evidence,
and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly authenticated and
delivered hereunder. All Certificates shall be dated the date of their
authentication.

                  (b) The Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates
shall initially be issued as one or more Certificates held by the Book-Entry
Custodian or, if appointed to hold such Certificates as provided below, the
Depository, and registered in the name of the Depository or its nominee and,
except as provided below, registration of such Certificates may not be
transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository that agrees to hold such
Certificates for the respective Certificate Owners with Ownership Interests
therein. The Certificate Owners shall hold their respective Ownership Interests
in and to such Certificates through the book-entry facilities of the Depository
and, except as provided below, shall not be entitled to definitive, fully
registered Certificates ("Definitive Certificates") in respect of such Ownership
Interests. All transfers by Certificate Owners of their respective Ownership
Interests in the Book-Entry Certificates shall be made in accordance with the
procedures established by the Depository Participant or brokerage firm
representing such Certificate Owner. Each Depository Participant shall only
transfer the Ownership Interests in the Book-Entry Certificates of Certificate
Owners it represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts as agent in
accordance with the Depository's normal procedures. The Trustee is hereby
initially appointed as the Book-Entry Custodian and hereby agrees to act as such
in accordance herewith and in accordance with the agreement that it



                                      139
<PAGE>



has with the Depository authorizing it to act as such. The Book-Entry Custodian
may, and if it is no longer qualified to act as such, the Book-Entry Custodian
shall, appoint, by a written instrument delivered to the Depositor, the Master
Servicer, the Trustee (if the Trustee is not the Book-Entry Custodian) and any
other transfer agent (including the Depository or any successor Depository), to
act as Book-Entry Custodian under such conditions as the predecessor Book-Entry
Custodian and the Depository or any successor Depository may prescribe, provided
that the predecessor Book-Entry Custodian shall not be relieved of any of its
duties or responsibilities by reason of any such appointment of other than the
Depository. If the Trustee resigns or is removed in accordance with the terms
hereof, if it so elects, the Depository shall immediately succeed to its
predecessor's duties as Book-Entry Custodian. The Depositor shall have the right
to inspect, and to obtain copies of, any Certificates held as Book-Entry
Certificates by the Book-Entry Custodian.

                  The Trustee, the Master Servicer, the Guarantor and the
Depositor may for all purposes (including the making of payments due on the
Book-Entry Certificates) deal with the Depository as the authorized
representative of the Certificate Owners with respect to the Book-Entry
Certificates for the purposes of exercising the rights of Certificateholders
hereunder. The rights of Certificate Owners with respect to the Book-Entry
Certificates shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between
such Certificate Owners and the Depository Participants and brokerage firms
representing such Certificate Owners. Multiple requests and directions from, and
votes of, the Depository as Holder of the Book-Entry Certificates with respect
to any particular matter shall not be deemed inconsistent if they are made with
respect to different Certificate Owners. The Trustee may establish a reasonable
record date in connection with solicitations of consents from or voting by
Certificateholders and shall give notice to the Depository of such record date.

                  If (i)(A) the Depositor advises the Trustee in writing that
the Depository is no longer willing or able to properly discharge its
responsibilities as Depository, and (B) the Depositor is unable to locate a
qualified successor or (ii) after the occurrence of a Master Servicer Event of
Default, Certificate Owners representing in the aggregate not less than 51% of
the Ownership Interests of the Book-Entry Certificates advise the Trustee
through the Depository, in writing, that the continuation of a book-entry system
through the Depository is no longer in the best interests of the Certificate
Owners, the Trustee shall notify all Certificate Owners, through the Depository,
of the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive
Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the
Trustee of the Book-Entry Certificates by the Book-Entry Custodian or the
Depository, as applicable, accompanied by registration instructions from the
Depository for registration of transfer, the Trustee shall issue the Definitive
Certificates. Such Definitive Certificates shall be issued in minimum
denominations of $25,000 ($1,000 in the case of the Class A-1 Certificates and
$50,000 in the case of the Class M-10 Certificates), except that any beneficial
ownership that was represented by a Book-Entry Certificate in an amount less
than $25,000 immediately prior to the issuance of a Definitive Certificate shall
be issued in a minimum denomination equal to the amount represented by such
Book-Entry Certificate. None of the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the
Trustee shall be liable for any delay in the delivery of such instructions and
may conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such
instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates all references herein
to obligations imposed upon or to be performed by



                                      140
<PAGE>



the Depository shall be deemed to be imposed upon and performed by the Trustee,
to the extent applicable with respect to such Definitive Certificates, and the
Trustee shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive Certificates as
Certificateholders hereunder.

                  SECTION 5.02 Registration of Transfer and Exchange of
                               Certificates.

                  (a) The Trustee shall cause to be kept at one of the offices
or agencies to be appointed by the Trustee in accordance with the provisions of
Section 8.12 a Certificate Register for the Certificates in which, subject to
such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Trustee shall provide for
the registration of Certificates and of transfers and exchanges of Certificates
as herein provided. The Trustee shall initially serve as Certificate Registrar
for the purpose of registering Certificates and transfers and exchanges of
Certificates as herein provided. The Certificate Registrar may appoint, by a
written instrument delivered to the Master Servicer and the Depositor, any other
bank or trust company to act as Certificate Registrar under such conditions as
the predecessor Certificate Registrar may prescribe, provided that the
predecessor Certificate Registrar shall not be relieved of any of its duties or
responsibilities hereunder by reason of such appointment. If the Trustee shall
at any time not be the Certificate Registrar, the Trustee shall have and
maintain the right to inspect the Certificate Register or to obtain a copy
thereof at all reasonable times, and to rely conclusively upon a certificate of
the Certificate Registrar as to the information set forth in the Certificate
Register.

                  (b) No transfer of any Class M-10 Certificate, Class CE
Certificate, Class P Certificate or Residual Certificate shall be made unless
that transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and an effective
registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws, or is made
in a transaction that does not require such registration or qualification. In
the event that such a transfer of a Class M-10 Certificate, Class CE
Certificate, Class P Certificate or Residual Certificate is to be made without
registration or qualification (other than in connection with (i) the initial
transfer of any such Certificate by the Depositor to an affiliate of the
Depositor, (ii) the transfer of any such Class CE or Class P Certificate to the
issuer under the Indenture or the indenture trustee under the Indenture or (iii)
a transfer of any such Class CE or Class P Certificate from the issuer under the
Indenture or the indenture trustee under the Indenture to the Depositor or an
Affiliate of the Depositor), the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar shall
each require receipt of: (i) if such transfer is purportedly being made in
reliance upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, written certifications from the
Certificateholder desiring to effect the transfer and from such
Certificateholder's prospective transferee, substantially in the forms attached
hereto as Exhibit F-1; and (ii) in all other cases, an Opinion of Counsel
satisfactory to it that such transfer may be made without such registration
(which Opinion of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Depositor, the Trustee,
the Master Servicer, in its capacity as such, or the Trust Fund), together with
copies of the written certification(s) of the Certificateholder desiring to
effect the transfer and/or such Certificateholder's prospective transferee upon
which such Opinion of Counsel is based, if any. None of the Depositor, the
Certificate Registrar or the Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the
Class M-10 Certificates, the Class CE Certificates, the Class P Certificates or
the Residual Certificates under the 1933 Act or any other securities laws or to
take any action not otherwise required under this Agreement to permit the
transfer of such Certificates without registration or qualification. If a
transfer of an Ownership Interest in





                                      141
<PAGE>



the Class M-10 Certificates is to be made without registration under the 1933
Act (other than in connection with (i) the initial transfer of any such
Certificate by the Depositor to an affiliate of the Depositor, (ii) the transfer
of any such Class CE or Class P Certificate to the issuer under the Indenture or
the indenture trustee under the Indenture or (iii) a transfer of any such Class
CE or Class P Certificate from the issuer under the Indenture or the indenture
trustee under the Indenture to the Depositor or an Affiliate of the Depositor),
then the Certificate Registrar shall refuse to register such transfer unless it
receives (and upon receipt, may conclusively rely upon) a certificate from the
Certificateholder desiring to effect such transfer and a certificate from such
Certificateholder's prospective transferee (which in the case of the Book-Entry
Certificates, the Certificateholder and the Certificateholder's prospective
transferee shall be deemed to have represented such certification), to the
effect that, among other things, the transfer is being made to a qualified
institutional buyer as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act in
accordance with Rule 144A. Any Certificateholder desiring to effect the transfer
of a Class M-10 Certificate, Class CE Certificate, Class P Certificate or
Residual Certificate shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the Trustee, the
Depositor, the Certificate Registrar and the Master Servicer against any
liability that may result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in
accordance with such federal and state laws.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, no certification or Opinion of
Counsel described in this Section 5.02(b) shall be required in connection with
the transfer, on the Closing Date, of any Class R Certificate by the Depositor
to an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(d) of the 1933 Act.

                  (c) No transfer of a Class CE Certificate, Class P Certificate
or Residual Certificate or any interest therein shall be made to any Plan
subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, any Person acting, directly or
indirectly, on behalf of any such Plan or any Person acquiring such Certificates
with "Plan Assets" of a Plan within the meaning of the Department of Labor
regulation promulgated at 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 ("Plan Assets"), as certified
by such transferee in the form of Exhibit G, unless the Trustee is provided with
an Opinion of Counsel for the benefit of the Trust Fund, the Depositor, the
Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Master Servicer and on which
they may rely, which shall be to the effect that the purchase and holding of
such Certificates is permissible under applicable law, shall not constitute or
result in any non-exempt prohibited transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code and shall not subject the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Trust Fund to any obligation or
liability (including obligations or liabilities under ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement, which Opinion of
Counsel shall not be an expense of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Trust Fund. Neither an Opinion of
Counsel nor any certification shall be required in connection with (i) the
initial transfer of any such Certificate by the Depositor to an affiliate of the
Depositor, (ii) the transfer of any such Certificate to the issuer under the
Indenture or the indenture trustee under the Indenture or (iii) a transfer of
any such Certificate from the issuer under the Indenture or the indenture
trustee under the Indenture to the Depositor or an Affiliate of the Depositor
(in which case such transferee shall be deemed to have represented that it is
not purchasing with Plan Assets) and the Trustee shall be entitled to
conclusively rely upon a representation (which, upon the request of the Trustee,
shall be a



                                      142
<PAGE>



written representation) from the Depositor of the status of such transferee as
an affiliate of the Depositor.

                  Each beneficial owner of the Mezzanine Certificates or any
interest therein shall be deemed to have represented, by virtue of its
acquisition or holding of that Certificate or interest therein, that either (i)
it is not a Plan or acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf of a Plan or with
Plan Assets, (ii) for Mezzanine Certificates other than the Class M-10
Certificates it has acquired and is holding such Mezzanine Certificates (other
than the Class M-10 Certificates) in reliance on the Underwriters' Exemption,
and that it understands that there are certain conditions to the availability of
the Underwriters' Exemption, including that the Certificates (other than the
Class M-10 Certificates) must be rated, at the time of purchase, not lower than
"BBB-" (or its equivalent) by Moody's, Fitch or S&P or (iii) (1) it is an
insurance company, (2) the source of funds used to acquire or hold the
certificate or interest therein is an "insurance company general account," as
such term is defined in PTCE 95-60, and (3) the conditions in Sections I and III
of PTCE 95-60 have been satisfied.

                  If any Class CE Certificate, Class P Certificate, Residual
Certificate or Mezzanine Certificate or any interest therein is acquired or held
in violation of the provisions of the preceding paragraphs, the next preceding
permitted beneficial owner shall be treated as the beneficial owner of that
Certificate retroactive to the date of transfer to the purported beneficial
owner. Any purported beneficial owner whose acquisition or holding of any such
Certificate or interest therein was effected in violation of the provisions of
the preceding paragraph shall indemnify and hold harmless the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Trust Fund
from and against any and all liabilities, claims, costs or expenses incurred by
those parties as a result of that acquisition or holding.

                  (d) (i) Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership
Interest in a Residual Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or
acquisition of such Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the
following provisions and to have irrevocably authorized the Certificate
Registrar or its designee under clause (iii)(A) below to deliver payments to a
Person other than such Person and to negotiate the terms of any mandatory sale
under clause (iii)(B) below and to execute all instruments of Transfer and to do
all other things necessary in connection with any such sale. The rights of each
Person acquiring any Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate are expressly
subject to the following provisions:

                  (A) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in
         a Residual Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall
         promptly notify the Certificate Registrar of any change or impending
         change in its status as a Permitted Transferee.

                  (B) In connection with any proposed Transfer of any Ownership
         Interest in a Residual Certificate, the Certificate Registrar shall
         require delivery to it and shall not register the Transfer of any
         Residual Certificate until its receipt of an affidavit and agreement (a
         "Transfer Affidavit and Agreement"), in the form attached hereto as
         Exhibit F-2 from the proposed Transferee, in form and substance
         satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar, representing and warranting,
         among other things, that such Transferee is a Permitted Transferee,
         that it is not acquiring its Ownership Interest in the Residual



                                      143
<PAGE>



         Certificate that is the subject of the proposed Transfer as a nominee,
         trustee or agent for any Person that is not a Permitted Transferee,
         that for so long as it retains its Ownership Interest in a Residual
         Certificate, it shall endeavor to remain a Permitted Transferee, and
         that it has reviewed the provisions of this Section 5.02(d) and agrees
         to be bound by them.

                  (C) Notwithstanding the delivery of a Transfer Affidavit and
         Agreement by a proposed Transferee under clause (B) above, if a
         Responsible Officer of the Certificate Registrar who is assigned to
         this transaction has actual knowledge that the proposed Transferee is
         not a Permitted Transferee, no Transfer of an Ownership Interest in a
         Residual Certificate to such proposed Transferee shall be effected.

                  (D) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in
         a Residual Certificate shall agree (x) to require a Transfer Affidavit
         and Agreement from any other Person to whom such Person attempts to
         transfer its Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate and (y) not
         to transfer its Ownership Interest unless it provides a Transferor
         Affidavit (in the form attached hereto as Exhibit F-2), to the
         Certificate Registrar stating that, among other things, it has no
         actual knowledge that such other Person is not a Permitted Transferee.

                  (E) Each Person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in
         a Residual Certificate, by purchasing an Ownership Interest in such
         Certificate, agrees to give the Certificate Registrar written notice
         that it is a "pass-through interest holder" within the meaning of
         temporary Treasury regulation Section 1.67-3T(a)(2)(i)(A) immediately
         upon acquiring an Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate, if it
         is, or is holding an Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate on
         behalf of, a "pass-through interest holder."

                  (ii)     The Certificate Registrar shall register the Transfer
of any Residual Certificate only if it shall have received the Transfer
Affidavit and Agreement and all of such other documents as shall have been
reasonably required by the Certificate Registrar as a condition to such
registration. In addition, no Transfer of a Residual Certificate shall be made
unless the Certificate Registrar shall have received a representation letter
from the Transferee of such Certificate to the effect that such Transferee is a
Permitted Transferee.

                  (iii)(A)  If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of
a Residual Certificate in violation of the provisions of this Section 5.02(d),
then the last preceding Permitted Transferee shall be restored, to the extent
permitted by law, to all rights as Holder thereof retroactive to the date of
registration of such Transfer of such Residual Certificate. The Certificate
Registrar shall be under no liability to any Person for any registration of
Transfer of a Residual Certificate that is in fact not permitted by this Section
5.02(d) or for making any payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof
or for taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the provisions
of this Agreement.

                  (B) If any purported Transferee shall become a Holder of a
         Residual Certificate in violation of the restrictions in this Section
         5.02(d) and to the extent that the



                                      144
<PAGE>



         retroactive restoration of the rights of the Holder of such Residual
         Certificate as described in clause (iii)(A) above shall be invalid,
         illegal or unenforceable, then the Certificate Registrar shall have the
         right, without notice to the Holder or any prior Holder of such
         Residual Certificate, to sell such Residual Certificate to a purchaser
         selected by the Certificate Registrar on such terms as the Certificate
         Registrar may choose. Such purported Transferee shall promptly endorse
         and deliver each Residual Certificate in accordance with the
         instructions of the Certificate Registrar. Such purchaser may be the
         Certificate Registrar itself or any Affiliate of the Certificate
         Registrar. The proceeds of such sale, net of the commissions (which may
         include commissions payable to the Certificate Registrar or its
         Affiliates), expenses and taxes due, if any, shall be remitted by the
         Certificate Registrar to such purported Transferee. The terms and
         conditions of any sale under this clause (iii)(B) shall be determined
         in the sole discretion of the Certificate Registrar, and the
         Certificate Registrar shall not be liable to any Person having an
         Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate as a result of its
         exercise of such discretion.

                  (iv)     The Trustee shall make available to the Internal
Revenue Service and those Persons specified by the REMIC Provisions all
information necessary to compute any tax imposed (A) as a result of the Transfer
of an Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate to any Person who is a
Disqualified Organization, including the information described in Treasury
regulations sections 1.860D-1(b)(5) and 1.860E-2(a)(5) with respect to the
"excess inclusions" of such Residual Certificate and (B) as a result of any
regulated investment company, real estate investment trust, common trust fund,
partnership, trust, estate or organization described in Section 1381 of the Code
that holds an Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate having as among its
record Holders at any time any Person which is a Disqualified Organization.
Reasonable compensation for providing such information may be accepted by the
Trustee.

                  (v)      The provisions of this Section 5.02(d) set forth
prior to this subsection (v) may be modified, added to or eliminated, provided
that there shall have been delivered to the Trustee at the expense of the party
seeking to modify, add to or eliminate any such provision the following:

                  (A) written notification from each Rating Agency to the effect
         that the modification, addition to or elimination of such provisions
         shall not cause such Rating Agency to downgrade its then-current
         ratings of any Class of Certificates; and

                  (B) an Opinion of Counsel, in form and substance satisfactory
         to the Trustee, to the effect that such modification of, addition to or
         elimination of such provisions shall not cause any Trust REMIC to cease
         to qualify as a REMIC and shall not cause any Trust REMIC, as the case
         may be, to be subject to an entity-level tax caused by the Transfer of
         any Residual Certificate to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee
         or (y) a Person other than the prospective transferee to be subject to
         a REMIC-tax caused by the Transfer of a Residual Certificate to a
         Person that is not a Permitted Transferee.

                  The Trustee shall forward to the NIMS Insurer and the
Guarantor a copy of the items delivered to it pursuant to (A) and (B) above.




                                      145

                  (e) Subject to the preceding subsections, upon surrender for
registration of transfer of any Certificate at any office or agency of the
Trustee maintained for such purpose pursuant to Section 8.12, the Trustee shall
execute and the Certificate Registrar shall authenticate and deliver, in the
name of the designated Transferee or Transferees, one or more new Certificates
of the same Class of a like aggregate Percentage Interest.

                  (f) At the option of the Holder thereof, any Certificate may
be exchanged for other Certificates of the same Class with authorized
denominations and a like aggregate Percentage Interest, upon surrender of such
Certificate to be exchanged at any office or agency of the Trustee maintained
for such purpose pursuant to Section 8.12. Whenever any Certificates are so
surrendered for exchange the Trustee, shall execute and cause the Certificate
Registrar to authenticate and deliver the Certificates which the
Certificateholder making the exchange is entitled to receive. Every Certificate
presented or surrendered for transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the
Trustee) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written instrument of
transfer in the form satisfactory to the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar
duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
In addition, with respect to each Residual Certificate, the Holder thereof may
exchange, in the manner described above, the Class R Certificate for three
separate Certificates, each representing such Holder's respective Percentage
Interest in the Class R-I Interest, the Class R-II Interest and the Class R-III
Interest, respectively, in each case that was evidenced by the Class R
Certificate being exchanged.

                  (g) No service charge to the Certificateholders shall be made
for any transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge that may be
imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  (h) All Certificates surrendered for transfer and exchange
shall be canceled and destroyed by the Certificate Registrar in accordance with
its customary procedures.

                  (i) The Trustee shall cause the Certificate Registrar (unless
the Trustee is acting as Certificate Registrar) to provide notice to the Trustee
of each transfer of a Certificate and to provide the Trustee with an updated
copy of the Certificate Register on the first Business Day in March and August
of each year, commencing in March 2005.

                  (j) Any attempted or purported transfer of any Certificate in
violation of the provisions of Section 5.02(c) hereof shall be void AB INITIO
and such Certificate shall be considered to have been held continuously by the
prior permitted Holder.

                  SECTION 5.03 Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen
                               Certificates.

                  If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the Trustee
or the Certificate Registrar, or the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar
receive evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Certificate, and (ii) there is delivered to the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the
Guarantor and the Certificate Registrar such security or indemnity as may be
required by them to save each of them harmless, then, in the absence of actual
knowledge by the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar that such Certificate has
been acquired by a bona fide



                                      146
<PAGE>



purchaser or the Trustee shall execute and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu
of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate
of the same Class and of like denomination and Percentage Interest. Upon the
issuance of any new Certificate under this Section, the Trustee may require the
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including the fees
and expenses of the Certificate Registrar) connected therewith. Any replacement
Certificate issued pursuant to this Section shall constitute complete and
indefeasible evidence of ownership in the applicable REMIC created hereunder, as
if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed Certificate
shall be found at any time.

                  SECTION 5.04 Persons Deemed Owners.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor, the Certificate Registrar and any agent of any of them
may treat the Person in whose name any Certificate is registered as the owner of
such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to Section
4.01 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the NIMS Insurer, the
Guarantor or any agent of any of them shall be affected by notice to the
contrary.

                  SECTION 5.05 Certain Available Information.

                  On or prior to the date of the first sale of any Class M-10
Certificate, Class CE Certificate, Class P Certificate or Residual Certificate
to an Independent third party, the Depositor shall provide to the Trustee ten
copies of any private placement memorandum or other disclosure document used by
the Depositor in connection with the offer and sale of the Class M-10
Certificates, the Class CE Certificates, the Class P Certificates or the
Residual Certificates. In addition, if any such private placement memorandum or
disclosure document is revised, amended or supplemented at any time following
the delivery thereof to the Trustee, the Depositor promptly shall inform the
Trustee of such event and shall deliver to the Trustee ten copies of the private
placement memorandum or disclosure document, as revised, amended or
supplemented. The Trustee shall maintain at its Corporate Trust Office and shall
make available free of charge during normal business hours for review by any
Holder of a Certificate and/or Certificate Owner or any Person identified to the
Trustee as a prospective transferee of a Certificate, originals or copies of the
following items: (i) in the case of a Holder, Certificate Owner or prospective
transferee of a Class M-10 Certificate, a Class CE Certificate, a Class P
Certificate or a Residual Certificate, the private placement memorandum or other
disclosure document relating to such Certificate, if any, in the form most
recently provided to the Trustee; and (ii) in all cases, (A) this Agreement and
any amendments hereof entered into pursuant to Section 11.01, (B) all monthly

pursuant to Section 4.02 since the Closing Date, and all other notices, reports,
statements and written communications delivered to the Certificateholders of the
relevant Class pursuant to this Agreement since the Closing Date, (C) all

Servicing Advance was, or if made, would be a Nonrecoverable Advance or
Nonrecoverable Servicing Advance,



                                      147

respectively, and (E) any and all Officers' Certificates delivered to the
Trustee by the Master Servicer since the Closing Date pursuant to Section
4.04(a). Copies and mailing of any and all of the foregoing items shall be
available from the Trustee upon request at the expense of the person requesting
the same.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                      THE DEPOSITOR AND THE MASTER SERVICER

                  SECTION 6.01 Liability of the Depositor and the Master
                               Servicer.

                  The Depositor and the Master Servicer each shall be liable in
accordance herewith only to the extent of the obligations specifically imposed
by this Agreement and undertaken hereunder by the Depositor and the Master
Servicer herein.

                  SECTION 6.02 Merger or Consolidation of the Depositor or the
                               Master Servicer.

                  Subject to the following paragraph, the Depositor shall keep
in full effect its existence, rights and franchises as a corporation under the
laws of the jurisdiction of its incorporation. Subject to the following
paragraph, the Master Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises as a corporation under the laws of the jurisdiction of its
incorporation and its qualification as an approved conventional seller/servicer
for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac in good standing. The Depositor and the Master
Servicer each shall obtain and preserve its qualification to do business as a
foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such qualification is or shall
be necessary to protect the validity and enforceability of this Agreement, the
Certificates or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform its respective duties
under this Agreement.

                  The Depositor or the Master Servicer may be merged or
consolidated with or into any Person, or transfer all or substantially all of
its assets to any Person, in which case any Person resulting from any merger or
consolidation to which the Depositor or the Master Servicer shall be a party, or
any Person succeeding to the business of the Depositor or the Master Servicer,
shall be the successor of the Depositor or the Master Servicer, as the case may
be, hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act
on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person to
the Master Servicer shall be qualified to service mortgage loans on behalf of
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac; and provided further that the Rating Agencies'
ratings of the Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates in effect
immediately prior to such merger or consolidation shall not be qualified,
reduced or withdrawn as a result thereof (as evidenced by a letter to such
effect from the Rating Agencies).

                  SECTION 6.03 Limitation on Liability of the Depositor, the
                               Master Servicer and Others.

                  None of the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer, the
Master Servicer or any of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the
Depositor, the Guarantor or the Master Servicer shall be under any liability to
the Trust Fund or the Certificateholders for any action taken or for refraining
from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for
errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the
Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer, the Master Servicer or any such
person against any breach of



                                      149
<PAGE>



warranties, representations or covenants made herein, or against any specific
liability imposed on the Master Servicer pursuant hereto, or against any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of willful misfeasance, bad
faith or negligence in the performance of duties or by reason of reckless
disregard of obligations and duties hereunder. The Depositor, the Guarantor, the
NIMS Insurer, the Master Servicer or the Trustee and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer, the Master
Servicer or the Trustee may rely in good faith on any document of any kind
which, PRIMA FACIE, is properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting
any matters arising hereunder.

                  The Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer, the Master
Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Depositor, the
Guaranator, the NIMS Insurer, or the Master Servicer shall be indemnified and
held harmless by the Trust Fund against any loss, liability or expense incurred
in connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement or the
Certificates, other than any loss, liability or expense relating to any specific
Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loans (except as any such loss, liability or expense
shall be otherwise reimbursable pursuant to this Agreement) or, in the case of
the Depositor and the Master Servicer, any loss, liability or expense incurred
by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of
duties hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of obligations and duties
hereunder. None of the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer or the Master
Servicer shall be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any
legal action unless such action is related to its respective duties under this
Agreement and, in its opinion, does not involve it in any expense or liability;
provided, however, that each of the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer
and the Master Servicer may in its discretion undertake any such action which it
may deem necessary or desirable with respect to this Agreement and the rights
and duties of the parties hereto and the interests of the Certificateholders
hereunder. In such event, unless the Depositor or the Master Servicer acts
without the consent of the Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 51% of
the Voting Rights (which consent shall not be necessary in the case of
litigation or other legal action by either to enforce their respective rights or
defend themselves hereunder), the legal expenses and costs of such action and
any liability resulting therefrom (except any loss, liability or expense
incurred by reason of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the
performance of duties hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of
obligations and duties hereunder) shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of
the Trust Fund, and the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer and the
Master Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection
Account as and to the extent provided in Section 3.05, any such right of
reimbursement being prior to the rights of the Certificateholders to receive any
amount in the Collection Account.

                  The Master Servicer (except the Trustee to the extent it has
succeeded the Master Servicer as required hereunder) shall indemnify and hold
the Trustee, the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer and the Trust Fund
harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees
and expenses that the Trustee, the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer or
the Trust Fund may sustain in any way related to the failure of the Master
Servicer to perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in compliance with
the terms of this Agreement. The Master Servicer shall immediately notify the
Trustee, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer and the Depositor if a claim is made
that may result in such claims, losses, penalties, fines, forfeitures,



                                      150
<PAGE>



legal fees or related costs, judgments, or any other costs, fees and expenses,
and the Master Servicer shall assume (with the consent of the Trustee) the
defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith,
including reasonable counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against the Master Servicer, the
Trustee, the Depositor, the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer and/or the Trust Fund in
respect of such claim. The provisions of this paragraph shall survive the
termination of this Agreement, the payment of the outstanding Certificates and
the resignation or removal of the Trustee.

                  SECTION 6.04 Limitation on Resignation of the Master Servicer.

                  The Master Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and
duties hereby imposed on it except (i) upon determination that its duties
hereunder are no longer permissible under applicable law or (ii) with the
written consent of the Trustee and the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as
provided in Section 1.03) and written confirmation from each Rating Agency
(which confirmation shall be furnished to the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the
Guarantor and the Trustee) that such resignation shall not cause such Rating
Agency to reduce the then current rating of the Class A Certificates or the
Mezzanine Certificates. Any such determination pursuant to clause (i) of the
preceding sentence, permitting the resignation of the Master Servicer, shall be
evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect obtained at the expense of the
Master Servicer and delivered to the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS
Insurer. No resignation of the Master Servicer shall become effective until the
Trustee or a successor servicer acceptable to the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor
(as provided in Section 1.03) shall have assumed the Master Servicer's
responsibilities, duties, liabilities (other than those liabilities arising
prior to the appointment of such successor) and obligations under this
Agreement.

                  Except as expressly provided herein, the Master Servicer shall
not assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or privileges hereunder to
any other Person, nor delegate to or subcontract with, nor authorize or appoint
any other Person to perform any of the duties, covenants or obligations to be
performed by the Master Servicer hereunder. If, pursuant to any provision
hereof, the duties of the Master Servicer are transferred to a successor master
servicer, the entire amount of the Servicing Fee and other compensation payable
to the Master Servicer pursuant hereto shall thereafter be payable to such
successor master servicer.

                  SECTION 6.05 Rights of the Depositor in Respect of the Master
                               Servicer.

                  The Master Servicer shall afford (and any Sub-Servicing
Agreement shall provide that each Sub-Servicer shall afford) the Depositor, the
NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Trustee, upon reasonable notice, during
normal business hours, access to all records maintained by the Master Servicer
(and any such Sub-Servicer) in respect of the Master Servicer's rights and
obligations hereunder and access to officers of the Master Servicer (and those
of any such Sub-Servicer) responsible for such obligations. Upon request, the
Master Servicer shall furnish to the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor
and the Trustee its (and any such Sub-Servicer's) most recent financial
statements and such other information relating to the Master Servicer's capacity
to perform its obligations under this Agreement that it possesses. To the extent
such information is not otherwise available to the public, the Depositor, the
NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Trustee shall not disseminate any
information obtained pursuant to the



                                      151
<PAGE>



preceding two sentences without the Master Servicer's (or any such
Sub-Servicer's) written consent, except as required pursuant to this Agreement
or to the extent that it is appropriate to do so (i) in working with legal
counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies, rating
agencies or reinsurers or (ii) pursuant to any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment, writ, injunction or decree of any court or governmental authority
having jurisdiction over the Depositor, the Guarantor, the Trustee or the Trust
Fund, and in either case, the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor or the
Trustee, as the case may be, shall use its best efforts to assure the
confidentiality of any such disseminated non-public information. The Depositor
may, but is not obligated to, enforce the obligations of the Master Servicer
under this Agreement and may, but is not obligated to, perform, or cause a
designee to perform, any defaulted obligation of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement or exercise the rights of the Master Servicer under this Agreement;
provided that the Master Servicer shall not be relieved of any of its
obligations under this Agreement by virtue of such performance by the Depositor
or its designee. The Depositor shall not have any responsibility or liability
for any action or failure to act by the Master Servicer and is not obligated to
supervise the performance of the Master Servicer under this Agreement or
otherwise.

                  SECTION 6.06 Sub-Servicing Agreements Between the Master
                               Servicer and Sub-Servicers.

                  (a) The Master Servicer may enter into Sub-Servicing
Agreements (provided that (i) such agreements would not result in a withdrawal
or a downgrade by any Rating Agency of the ratings on any Class of Certificates,
as evidenced by a letter to that effect delivered to the Depositor, the Trustee,
the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor and (ii) the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor
(as provided in Section 1.03) shall have consented to such Sub-Servicing
Agreement) with Sub-Servicers, for the servicing and administration of the
Mortgage Loans.

                  Each Sub-Servicer shall be (i) authorized to transact business
in the state or states in which the related Mortgaged Properties it is to
service are situated, if and to the extent required by applicable law to enable
the Sub-Servicer to perform its obligations hereunder and under the
Sub-Servicing Agreement, (ii) an institution approved as a mortgage loan
originator by the Federal Housing Administration or an institution the deposit
accounts in which are insured by the FDIC and (iii) a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae
approved mortgage servicer. Each Sub-Servicing Agreement must impose on the
Sub-Servicer requirements conforming to the provisions set forth in Section 6.11
and provide for servicing of the Mortgage Loans consistent with the terms of
this Agreement. The Master Servicer shall examine each Sub-Servicing Agreement
and shall be familiar with the terms thereof. The terms of any Sub-Servicing
Agreement shall not be inconsistent with any of the provisions of this
Agreement. The Master Servicer and the Sub-Servicers may enter into and make
amendments to the Sub-Servicing Agreements or enter into different forms of
Sub-Servicing Agreements; provided, however, that any such amendments or
different forms shall be consistent with and not violate the provisions of this
Agreement, and that no such amendment or different form shall be made or entered
into which could be reasonably expected to be materially adverse to the
interests of the Certificateholders, without the consent of the Holders of
Certificates entitled to at least 66% of the Voting Rights. Any variation
without the consent of the Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 66% of
the Voting Rights from the provisions set forth in Section 6.11, provisions
relating



                                      152
<PAGE>



to insurance in Section 3.10 or priority requirements of Sub-Servicing Accounts,
or credits and charges to the Sub-Servicing Accounts or the timing and amount of
remittances by the Sub-Servicers to the Master Servicer, are conclusively deemed
to be inconsistent with this Agreement and therefore prohibited. The Master
Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer copies
of all Sub-Servicing Agreements, and any amendments or modifications thereof,
promptly upon the Master Servicer's execution and delivery of such instruments.

                  (b) As part of its servicing activities hereunder, the Master
Servicer (except as otherwise provided in the last sentence of this paragraph),
for the benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders, shall enforce the
obligations of each Sub-Servicer under the related Sub-Servicing Agreement and
of the Seller under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, including, without
limitation, any obligation to make advances in respect of delinquent payments as
required by a Sub-Servicing Agreement, or to purchase a Mortgage Loan on account
of missing or defective documentation or on account of a breach of a
representation, warranty or covenant, as described in Section 2.03(a). Such
enforcement, including, without limitation, the legal prosecution of claims,
termination of Sub-Servicing Agreements, and the pursuit of other appropriate
remedies, shall be in such form and carried out to such an extent and at such
time as the Master Servicer, in its good faith business judgment, would require
were it the owner of the related Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer shall pay
the costs of such enforcement at its own expense, and shall be reimbursed
therefor only (i) from a general recovery resulting from such enforcement, to
the extent, if any, that such recovery exceeds all amounts due in respect of the
related Mortgage Loans or (ii) from a specific recovery of costs, expenses or
attorneys' fees against the party against whom such enforcement is directed.
Enforcement of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement against the Seller shall be
effected by the Master Servicer to the extent it is not the Seller, and
otherwise by the Trustee, in accordance with the foregoing provisions of this
paragraph.

                  SECTION 6.07 Successor Sub-Servicers.

                  The Master Servicer (with the consent of the NIMS Insurer or
the Guarantor as provided in Section 1.03 and for the Guarantor, with respect to
the Group I Mortgage Loans only) shall be entitled to terminate any
Sub-Servicing Agreement and the rights and obligations of any Sub-Servicer
pursuant to any Sub-Servicing Agreement in accordance with the terms and
conditions of such Sub-Servicing Agreement. In the event of termination of any
Sub-Servicer, all servicing obligations of such Sub-Servicer shall be assumed
simultaneously by the Master Servicer without any act or deed on the part of
such Sub-Servicer or the Master Servicer, and the Master Servicer either shall
service directly the related Mortgage Loans or shall enter into a Sub-Servicing
Agreement with a successor Sub-Servicer which qualifies under Section 6.06.

                  Any Sub-Servicing Agreement shall include the provision that
such agreement may be immediately terminated by the Trustee without fee, in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, in the event that the Master
Servicer shall, for any reason, no longer be the Master Servicer (including
termination due to a Master Servicer Event of Default).

                  SECTION 6.08 Liability of the Master Servicer.

                  Notwithstanding any Sub-Servicing Agreement, any of the
provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between the
Master Servicer and a Sub-Servicer or reference to actions taken through a
Sub-Servicer or otherwise, the Master Servicer shall remain obligated and
primarily liable to the Trustee and the Certificateholders for the servicing and
administering of the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions of Section
3.01 without diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of such
Sub-Servicing Agreements or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from
the Sub-Servicer and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions
as if the Master Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Mortgage
Loans. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with a
Sub-Servicer for indemnification of the Master Servicer by such Sub-Servicer and
nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such
indemnification.

                  SECTION 6.09 No Contractual Relationship Between Sub-Servicers
                               and the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor, the Trustee
                               or Certificateholders.

                  Any Sub-Servicing Agreement that may be entered into and any
transactions or services relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Sub-Servicer
in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be between the Sub-Servicer and the
Master Servicer alone, and the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor, the Trustee and
Certificateholders shall not be deemed parties thereto and shall have no claims,
rights, obligations, duties or liabilities with respect to the Sub-Servicer
except as set forth in Section 6.10. The Master Servicer shall be solely liable
for all fees owed by it to any Sub-Servicer, irrespective of whether the Master
Servicer's compensation pursuant to this Agreement is sufficient to pay such
fees.

                  SECTION 6.10 Assumption or Termination of Sub-Servicing
                               Agreements by Trustee.

                  In the event the Master Servicer shall for any reason no
longer be the master servicer (including termination due to a Master Servicer
Event of Default), the Trustee or its designee shall thereupon assume (or cause
its designee or the successor master servicer for the Trustee appointed pursuant
to Section 7.02 to assume) all of the rights and obligations of the Master
Servicer under each Sub-Servicing Agreement that the Master Servicer may have
entered into, unless the Trustee elects to terminate any Sub-Servicing Agreement
in accordance with its terms as provided in Section 6.07. Upon such assumption,
the Trustee, its designee or the successor servicer for the Trustee appointed
pursuant to Section 7.02 shall be deemed, subject to Section 6.07, to have
assumed all of the Master Servicer's interest therein and to have replaced the
Master Servicer as a party to each Sub-Servicing Agreement to the same extent as
if each Sub-Servicing Agreement had been assigned to the assuming party, except
that (i) the Master Servicer shall not thereby be relieved of any liability or
obligations under any Sub-Servicing Agreement and (ii) none of the Trustee, its
designee or any successor Master Servicer shall be deemed to have assumed any
liability or obligation of the Master Servicer that arose before it ceased to be
the Master Servicer.

<PAGE>






                  The Master Servicer at its expense shall, upon request of the
Trustee, deliver to the assuming party all documents and records relating to
each Sub-Servicing Agreement and the Mortgage Loans then being serviced and an
accounting of amounts collected and held by or on behalf of it, and otherwise
use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of the
Sub-Servicing Agreements to the assuming party.

                  SECTION 6.11 Sub-Servicing Accounts.

                  In those cases where a Sub-Servicer is servicing a Mortgage
Loan pursuant to a Sub-Servicing Agreement, the Sub-Servicer shall be required
to establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, the "Sub-Servicing
Account"). The Sub-Servicing Account shall be an Eligible Account. The
Sub-Servicer shall deposit in the clearing account (which account must be an
Eligible Account) in which it customarily deposits payments and collections on
mortgage loans in connection with its mortgage loan servicing activities on a
daily basis, and in no event more than one Business Day after the Sub-Servicer's
receipt thereof, all proceeds of Mortgage Loans received by the Sub-Servicer
less its servicing compensation to the extent permitted by the Sub-Servicing
Agreement, and shall thereafter deposit such amounts in the Sub-Servicing
Account, in no event more than two Business Days after the deposit of such funds
into the clearing account. The Sub-Servicer shall thereafter deposit such
proceeds in the Collection Account or remit such proceeds to the Master Servicer
for deposit in the Collection Account not later than two Business Days after the
deposit of such amounts in the Sub-Servicing Account. For purposes of this
Agreement, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have received payments on the
Mortgage Loans when the Sub-Servicer receives such payments.

                                     DEFAULT

                  SECTION 7.01 Master Servicer Events of Default.

                  "Master Servicer Event of Default," wherever used herein,
means any one of the following events:

                  (i) any failure by the Master Servicer to deposit in the
         Collection Account or remit to the Trustee for deposit in the
         Distribution Account any payment (other than an Advance required to be
         made from its own funds on any Master Servicer Remittance Date pursuant
         to Section 4.03) required to be made under the terms of the
         Certificates and this Agreement which continues unremedied for a period
         of one Business Day after the date upon which written notice of such
         failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to
         the Master Servicer by the Depositor or the Trustee (in which case
         notice shall be provided by telecopy), or to the Master Servicer, the
         Depositor and the Trustee by the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor or the
         Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights;
         or

                  (ii) any failure on the part of the Master Servicer duly to
         observe or perform in any material respect any of the covenants or
         agreements on the part of the Master Servicer contained in the
         Certificates or in this Agreement (or, if the Master Servicer is the
         Seller, the failure of the Seller to repurchase a Mortgage Loan as to
         which a breach has been established that requires a repurchase pursuant
         to the terms of Section 7 of the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement)
         which continues unremedied for a period of 45 days after the earlier of
         (i) the date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the
         same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Master Servicer by
         the Depositor or the Trustee, or to the Master Servicer, the Depositor
         and the Trustee by the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor or the Holders of
         Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights and (ii)
         actual knowledge of such failure by a Servicing Officer of the Master
         Servicer; or

                  (iii) a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory
         authority having jurisdiction in the premises in an involuntary case
         under any present or future federal or state bankruptcy, insolvency or
         similar law or the appointment of a conservator or receiver or
         liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshaling of
         assets and liabilities or similar proceeding, or for the winding-up or
         liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against the Master
         Servicer and if such proceeding is being contested by the Master
         Servicer in good faith, such decree or order shall have remained in
         force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60 days or results in
         the entry of an order for relief or any such adjudication or
         appointment; or

                  (iv) the Master Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a
         conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
         of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of
         or relating to the Master Servicer or of or relating to all or
         substantially all of its property; or




                                      156
<PAGE>



                  (v) the Master Servicer shall admit in writing its inability
         to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take
         advantage of any applicable insolvency or reorganization statute, make
         an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, or voluntarily suspend
         payment of its obligations; or

                  (vi) any failure by the Master Servicer of the Master Servicer
         Termination Test;

                  (vii) the Master Servicer ceases to be an approved seller or
         servicer of Fannie Mae; or

                  (viii) any failure of the Master Servicer to make any Advance
         on any Master Servicer Remittance Date required to be made from its own
         funds pursuant to Section 4.03 which continues unremedied until 3:00
         p.m. New York time on the Business Day immediately following the Master
         Servicer Remittance Date.

                  If a Master Servicer Event of Default described in clauses (i)
through (vii) of this Section shall occur, then, and in each and every such
case, so long as such Master Servicer Event of Default shall not have been
remedied, the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer or the Trustee may, at the written
direction of the Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 51% of Voting
Rights, or at the direction of the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided in
Section 1.03), the Trustee shall, by notice in writing to the Master Servicer,
the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer and the Depositor, terminate all of the rights
and obligations of the Master Servicer in its capacity as Master Servicer under
this Agreement, to the extent permitted by law, and in and to the Mortgage Loans
and the proceeds thereof. If a Master Servicer Event of Default described in
clause (viii) hereof shall occur, the Trustee shall, by notice in writing to the
Master Servicer, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and the Depositor, terminate
all of the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer in its capacity as
Master Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the
proceeds thereof and the Trustee as successor Master Servicer or a successor
Master Servicer appointed in accordance with Section 7.02, shall immediately
make such Advance (which Advance shall be part of Available Funds for such
Distribution Date) and assume, pursuant to Section 7.02, the duties of a
successor Master Servicer. On or after the receipt by the Master Servicer of
such written notice, all authority and power of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement, whether with respect to the Certificates (other than as a Holder of
any Certificate) or the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested
in the Trustee pursuant to and under this Section and, without limitation, the
Trustee is hereby authorized and empowered, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, to
execute and deliver on behalf of and at the expense of the Master Servicer, any
and all documents and other instruments and to do or accomplish all other acts
or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, whether to complete the transfer and endorsement or assignment of
the Mortgage Loans and related documents, or otherwise. The Master Servicer
agrees, at its sole cost and expense, promptly (and in any event no later than
ten Business Days subsequent to such notice) to provide the Trustee with all
documents and records requested by it to enable it to assume the Master
Servicer's functions under this Agreement, and to cooperate with the Trustee in
effecting the termination of the Master Servicer's responsibilities and rights
under this Agreement, including, without limitation, the transfer within one
Business Day to the Trustee for



                                      157
<PAGE>



administration by it of all cash amounts which at the time shall be or should
have been credited by the Master Servicer to the Collection Account held by or
on behalf of the Master Servicer, the Distribution Account or any REO Account or
Escrow Account held by or on behalf of the Master Servicer or thereafter be
received with respect to the Mortgage Loans or any REO Property serviced by the
Master Servicer (provided, however, that the Master Servicer shall continue to
be entitled to receive all amounts accrued or owing to it under this Agreement
on or prior to the date of such termination, whether in respect of Advances or
otherwise, and shall continue to be entitled to the benefits of Section 6.03,
notwithstanding any such termination, with respect to events occurring prior to
such termination). For purposes of this Section 7.01, the Trustee shall not be
deemed to have knowledge of a Master Servicer Event of Default unless a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee assigned to and working in the Trustee's
Corporate Trust Office has actual knowledge thereof or unless written notice is
received by the Trustee of any such event and such notice references the
Certificates, REMIC I or this Agreement.

                  The Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Master
Servicer (or by the Trust Fund if the Master Servicer is unable to fulfill its
obligations hereunder) for all costs associated with the transfer of servicing
from the predecessor servicer, including without limitation, any costs or
expenses associated with the complete transfer of all servicing data and the
completion, correction or manipulation of such servicing data as may be required
by the Trustee to correct any errors or insufficiencies in the servicing data or
otherwise to enable the Trustee to service the Mortgage Loans properly and
effectively.

                  SECTION 7.02 Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

                  (a)      On and after the time the Master Servicer receives a
notice of termination, the Trustee shall be the successor in all respects to the
Master Servicer in its capacity as Master Servicer under this Agreement and the
transactions set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto and arising thereafter
placed on the Master Servicer (except for any representations or warranties of
the Master Servicer under this Agreement, the responsibilities, duties and
liabilities contained in Section 2.03(c) and its obligation to deposit amounts
in respect of losses pursuant to Section 3.06) by the terms and provisions
hereof including, without limitation, the Master Servicer's obligations to make
Advances pursuant to Section 4.03; provided, however, that if the Trustee is
prohibited by law or regulation from obligating itself to make advances
regarding delinquent mortgage loans, then the Trustee shall not be obligated to
make Advances pursuant to Section 4.03; and provided further, that any failure
to perform such duties or responsibilities caused by the Master Servicer's
failure to provide information required by Section 7.01 shall not be considered
a default by the Trustee as successor to the Master Servicer hereunder;
provided, however, it is understood and acknowledged by the parties that there
shall be a period of transition (not to exceed 90 days) before the servicing
transfer is fully effected. As compensation therefor, effective from and after
the time the Master Servicer receives a notice of termination or immediately
upon assumption of the obligations to make Advances, the Trustee shall be
entitled to the Servicing Fee and all funds relating to the Mortgage Loans to
which the Master Servicer would have been entitled if it had continued to act
hereunder (other than amounts which were due or would become due to the Master
Servicer prior to its termination or resignation). Notwithstanding the above and
subject to the next paragraph, the Trustee may, if it shall be unwilling to so
act, or shall, if it is unable to



                                      158
<PAGE>



so act or if it is prohibited by law from making advances regarding delinquent
mortgage loans, or if the Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 51% of
the Voting Rights or the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided in Section
1.03) so request in writing to the Trustee promptly appoint or petition a court
of competent jurisdiction to appoint, an established mortgage loan servicing
institution acceptable to each Rating Agency (with confirmation from the Rating
Agencies that such appointment shall not result in the reduction or withdrawal
of the rating of any outstanding Class of Certificates) and acceptable to the
NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided in Section 1.03) and having a net
worth of not less than $15,000,000 as the successor to the Master Servicer under
this Agreement in the assumption of all or any part of the responsibilities,
duties or liabilities of the Master Servicer under this Agreement. No
appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer under this Agreement shall be
effective until the assumption by the successor of all of the Master Servicer's
responsibilities, duties and liabilities hereunder. In connection with such
appointment and assumption described herein, the Trustee may make such
arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on Mortgage
Loans as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however, that no such
compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Master Servicer as such
hereunder. The Depositor, the Trustee and such successor shall take such action,
consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such
succession. Pending appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer under this
Agreement, the Trustee shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided.

                  Upon removal or resignation of the Master Servicer, the
Trustee, with the cooperation of the Depositor, (x) shall solicit bids for a
successor Master Servicer as described below and (y) pending the appointment of
a successor Master Servicer as a result of soliciting such bids, shall serve as
Master Servicer of the Mortgage Loans serviced by such predecessor Master
Servicer. The Trustee shall solicit, by public announcement, bids from housing
and home finance institutions, banks and mortgage servicing institutions meeting
the qualifications set forth above (including the Trustee or any affiliate
thereof) (including that such mortgage loan servicing institution shall be
acceptable to each Rating Agency and the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as
provided in Section 1.03)). Such public announcement shall specify that the
successor Master Servicer shall be entitled to the servicing compensation agreed
upon between the Trustee, the successor Master Servicer, the Guarantor and the
Depositor; provided, however, that no such fee shall exceed the Servicing Fee.
Within thirty days after any such public announcement, the Trustee, with the
cooperation of the Depositor, shall negotiate in good faith and effect the sale,
transfer and assignment of the servicing rights and responsibilities hereunder
to the qualified party submitting the highest satisfactory bid as to the price
they shall pay to obtain such servicing. The Trustee upon receipt of the
purchase price shall pay such purchase price to the Master Servicer being so
removed, after deducting from any sum received by the Trustee from the successor
to the Master Servicer in respect of such sale, transfer and assignment all
costs and expenses of any public announcement and of any sale, transfer and
assignment of the servicing rights and responsibilities reasonably incurred
hereunder. After such deductions, the remainder of such sum shall be paid by the
Trustee to the Master Servicer at the time of such sale.

                  (b)      If the Master Servicer fails to remit to the Trustee
for distribution to the Certificateholders any payment required to be made under
the terms of the Certificates and this Agreement (for purposes of this Section
7.02(b), a "Remittance") because the Master Servicer is



                                      159
<PAGE>



the subject of a proceeding under the federal Bankruptcy Code and the making of
such Remittance is prohibited by Section 362 of the federal Bankruptcy Code, the
Trustee shall upon notice of such prohibition, regardless of whether it has
received a notice of termination under Section 7.01, advance the amount of such
Remittance by depositing such amount in the Distribution Account on the related
Distribution Date. The Trustee shall be obligated to make such advance only if
(i) such advance, in the good faith judgment of the Trustee can reasonably be
expected to be ultimately recoverable from Stayed Funds and (ii) the Trustee is
not prohibited by law from making such advance or obligating itself to do so.
Upon remittance of the Stayed Funds to the Trustee or the deposit thereof in the
Distribution Account by the Master Servicer, a trustee in bankruptcy or a
federal bankruptcy court, the Trustee may recover the amount so advanced,
without interest, by withdrawing such amount from the Distribution Account;
however, nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to affect the Trustee's
rights to recover from the Master Servicer's own funds interest on the amount of
any such advance. If the Trustee at any time makes an advance under this
Subsection which it later determines in its good faith judgment shall not be
ultimately recoverable from the Stayed Funds with respect to which such advance
was made, the Trustee shall be entitled to reimburse itself for such advance,
without interest, by withdrawing from the Distribution Account, out of amounts
on deposit therein, an amount equal to the portion of such advance attributable
to the Stayed Funds.

                  (c)      If the Master Servicer is terminated pursuant to
Section 7.01, then the successor Master Servicer shall not be permitted to
reimburse itself directly for Advances or Servicing Advances under Section
3.05(a)(ii), Section 3.05(a)(iii), Section 3.05(a)(v) or Section 3.05(a)(vii) if
the Master Servicer has not been fully reimbursed for its Advances and Servicing
Advances, but instead the successor Master Servicer shall include such amounts
in the applicable remittance to the Trustee made pursuant to Section 3.04(g) to
the extent of amounts on deposit in the Collection Account on the related Master
Servicer Remittance Date. The Trustee is hereby authorized to pay to the
terminated Master Servicer (or the related Advancing Person in accordance with
Section 3.23) and the successor Master Servicer, as applicable, reimbursements
for Advances and Servicing Advances from the Distribution Account to the same
extent each such Master Servicer would have been permitted to reimburse itself
for such Advances and/or Servicing Advances in accordance with Section
3.05(a)(ii), Section 3.05(a)(iii) or Section 3.05(a)(v), as the case may be. All
Advances and Servicing Advances made pursuant to the terms of this Agreement
shall be deemed made and shall be reimbursed on a "first in-first out" (FIFO)
basis. At such time as the Master Servicer (or related Advancing Person) has
been reimbursed for all Advances and Servicing Advances made by it, the
successor Master Servicer shall no longer be required to remit in accordance
with the first sentence of this Section 7.02(c) and shall then be permitted to
reimburse itself directly for Advances and Servicing Advances in accordance with
Section 3.05(a)(ii), Section 3.05(a)(iii), Section 3.05(a)(v) or Section
3.05(a)(vii).

                  SECTION 7.03 Notification to Certificateholders.

                  (a) Upon any termination of the Master Servicer pursuant to
Section 7.01 above or any appointment of a successor to the Master Servicer
pursuant to Section 7.02 above, the Trustee shall give prompt written notice
thereof to Certificateholders, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer at their
respective addresses appearing in the Certificate Register.

                  (b) Not later than the later of 60 days after the occurrence
of any event, which constitutes or which, with notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute a Master Servicer Event of Default or five days after a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee becomes aware of the occurrence of such an
event, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor and
to all Holders of Certificates notice of each such occurrence, unless such
default or Master Servicer Event of Default shall have been cured or waived.

                  SECTION 7.04 Waiver of Master Servicer Events of Default.

                  The Holders representing at least 66% of the Voting Rights
(with the consent of the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided in Section
1.03)) evidenced by all Classes of Certificates affected by any default or
Master Servicer Event of Default hereunder may waive such default or Master
Servicer Event of Default; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that a default or Master Servicer
Event of Default under clause (i) or (viii) of Section 7.01 may be waived only
by all of the Holders of the Regular Certificates (with the consent of the NIMS
Insurer). Upon any such waiver of a default or Master Servicer Event of Default,
such default or Master Servicer Event of Default shall cease to exist and shall
be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose hereunder. No such waiver
shall extend to any subsequent or other default or Master Servicer Event of
Default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so
waived.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                             CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE

                  SECTION 8.01 Duties of Trustee.

                  The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of a Master Servicer
Event of Default and after the curing of all Master Servicer Events of Default
which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties
as are specifically set forth in this Agreement. During a Master Servicer Event
of Default, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in
it by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their
exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the circumstances in
the conduct of such person's own affairs. Any permissive right of the Trustee
enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty.

                  The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform on their face to the requirements of this Agreement. If any such
instrument is found not to conform on its face to the requirements of this
Agreement in a material manner, the Trustee shall take such action as it deems
appropriate to have the instrument corrected, and if the instrument is not
corrected to its respective satisfaction, such dissatisfied party shall provide
notice thereof to the Certificateholders, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer.

                  No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve
the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent
failure to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:

                  (i) Prior to the occurrence of a Master Servicer Event of
         Default, and after the curing of all such Master Servicer Events of
         Default which may have occurred, the duties and obligations of the
         Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
         Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance
         of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
         Agreement, no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
         Agreement against the Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on the
         part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth
         of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
         therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee
         that conform to the requirements of this Agreement;

                  (ii) The Trustee shall not be personally liable for an error
         of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Responsible
         Officers of the Trustee unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was
         negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

                  (iii) The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect
         to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good
         faith in accordance with the direction of the NIMS Insurer, the
         Guarantor or the Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of
         the Voting Rights relating to the time, method and place of conducting
         any proceeding for



                                      162
<PAGE>



         any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power
         conferred upon it, under this Agreement.

                  The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its
duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there is
reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it, and
none of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event require it
to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance of, any of the
obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement, except during such
time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and be vested with the
rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Master Servicer in accordance with
the terms of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.02 Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

                  (i) The Trustee may request and rely upon and shall be
         protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
         Officers' Certificate, certificate of auditors or any other
         certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
         consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document reasonably
         believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
         the proper party or parties;

                  (ii) The Trustee may consult with counsel and any Opinion of
         Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and protection in
         respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it hereunder in
         good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

                  (iii) The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to
         exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this Agreement or
         to institute, conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation
         hereto at the request, order or direction of any of the
         Certificateholders, the Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer, pursuant to the
         provisions of this Agreement, unless such Certificateholders, the
         Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer, as applicable, shall have offered to the
         Trustee security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it against the
         costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or
         thereby; nothing contained herein shall, however, relieve the Trustee
         of the obligation, upon the occurrence of a Master Servicer Event of
         Default (which has not been cured or waived), to exercise such of the
         rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement, and to use the same
         degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent person would
         exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's
         own affairs;

                  (iv) The Trustee shall not be personally liable for any action
         taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be
         authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon
         it by this Agreement;




                                      163
<PAGE>



                  (v) Prior to the occurrence of a Master Servicer Event of
         Default hereunder and after the curing of all Master Servicer Events of
         Default which may have occurred, the Trustee shall not be bound to make
         any investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution,
         certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
         consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document, unless
         requested in writing to do so by the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor or the
         Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights;
         provided, however, that if the payment within a reasonable time to the
         Trustee of the costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by
         it in the making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the
         Trustee not reasonably assured to the Trustee by the NIMS Insurer, the
         Guarantor or such Certificateholders, the Trustee may require
         reasonable indemnity against such expense, or liability from such
         Certificateholders, the Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer as a condition to
         taking any such action;

                  (vi) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
         hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or
         through agents or attorneys; and

                  (vii) The Trustee shall not be personally liable for any loss
         resulting from the investment of funds held in the Collection Account,
         the Escrow Account or the REO Account made at the direction of the
         Master Servicer pursuant to Section 3.06.

                  (b) All rights of action under this Agreement or under any of
the Certificates, enforceable by the Trustee, may be enforced by it without the
possession of any of the Certificates, or the production thereof at the trial or
other proceeding relating thereto, and any such suit, action or proceeding
instituted by the Trustee shall be brought in the name of the Trustee for the
benefit of all the Holders of such Certificates, subject to the provisions of
this Agreement.

                  (c) The Depositor hereby directs the Trustee to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the Cap Contracts on the Closing Date
and thereafter on behalf of the Holders of the Group I Certificates, the Group
II Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates. The Seller, the Depositor, the
Master Servicer and the Holders of the Group I Certificates, the Group II
Certificates and the Mezzanine Certificates by their acceptance of such
Certificates, acknowledge and agree that the Trustee shall execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Cap Contracts and shall do so solely in its
capacity as Trustee of the Trust Fund and not in its individual capacity.

                  (d) The Depositor hereby directs the Trustee to execute and
deliver each of the PMI Policies on behalf of the Trust Fund in the form
presented to it by the Depositor. Every provision of this Agreement relating to
the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording protection to the Trustee
shall apply to the Trustee's execution of the PMI Policies, and the performance
of its duties and satisfaction of its obligations thereunder.

                  SECTION 8.03 The Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or
                               Mortgage Loans.

                  The recitals contained herein and in the Certificates (other
than the signature of the Trustee, the authentication of the Certificate
Registrar on the Certificates, the




                                      164
<PAGE>



acknowledgments of the Trustee contained in Article II and the representations
and warranties of the Trustee in Section 8.13) shall be taken as the statements
of the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their
correctness. The Trustee makes no representations or warranties as to the
validity or sufficiency of this Agreement (other than as specifically set forth
with respect to such party in Section 8.13) or of the Certificates (other than
the signature of the Trustee and authentication of the Certificate Registrar on
the Certificates) or of any Mortgage Loan or related document. The Trustee shall
not be accountable for the use or application by the Depositor of any of the
Certificates or of the proceeds of such Certificates, or for the use or
application of any funds paid to the Depositor or the Master Servicer in respect
of the Mortgage Loans or deposited in or withdrawn from the Collection Account
by the Master Servicer, other than, subject to Section 8.01, any funds held by
or on behalf of the Trustee in accordance with Section 3.04.

                  SECTION 8.04 Trustee May Own Certificates.

                  The Trustee in its individual capacity or any other capacity
may become the owner or pledgee of Certificates with the same rights it would
have if it were not Trustee.

                  SECTION 8.05 Trustee's Fees and Expenses.

                  (a) The Trustee shall withdraw from the Distribution Account
on each Distribution Date and pay to itself the Trustee Fee and, to the extent
that the funds therein are at any time insufficient for such purpose, the
Depositor shall pay such fees. The Trustee, or any director, officer, employee
or agent of the Trustee shall be indemnified by REMIC I and held harmless
against any loss, liability or expense (not including expenses, disbursements
and advances incurred or made by the Trustee (including the compensation and the
expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel) in the ordinary course of
the Trustee's performance in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement)
incurred by the Trustee in connection with any claim or legal action or any
pending or threatened claim or legal action arising out of or in connection with
the acceptance or administration of its obligations and duties under this
Agreement (up to a limit of $600,000 per calendar year so long as any Insured
Notes are insured by a NIMS Insurer), other than any loss, liability or expense
(i) resulting from a breach of the Master Servicer's obligations and duties
under this Agreement and the Mortgage Loans (for which the Master Servicer shall
indemnify pursuant to Section 8.05(b)), (ii) that constitutes a specific
liability of the Trustee pursuant to Section 10.01(c) or (iii) any loss,
liability or expense incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or
negligence in the performance of its duties hereunder or by reason of reckless
disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder or as a result of a breach of
its obligations under Article X hereof. Any amounts payable to the Trustee, or
any director, officer, employee or agent of the Trustee in respect of the
indemnification provided by this paragraph (a), or pursuant to any other right
of reimbursement from the Trust Fund that the Trustee, or any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Trustee may have hereunder in its capacity as such, may
be withdrawn by the Trustee from the Distribution Account at any time.

                  (b) The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trustee from,
and hold it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense resulting from a
breach of the Master Servicer's



                                      165
<PAGE>



obligations and duties under this Agreement. Such indemnity shall survive the
termination or discharge of this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the
Trustee. Any payment hereunder made by the Master Servicer to the Trustee shall
be from the Master Servicer's own funds, without reimbursement from the Trust
Fund therefor.

                  (c) The Master Servicer shall pay any annual rating agency
fees of the Rating Agencies for ongoing surveillance from its own funds without
right of reimbursement.

                  SECTION 8.06 Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.

                  The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be a corporation or
an association (other than the Depositor, the Seller, the Master Servicer or any
Affiliate of the foregoing) organized and doing business under the laws of any
state or the United States of America, authorized under such laws to exercise
corporate trust powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000 and subject to supervision or examination by federal or state
authority. If such corporation or association publishes reports of conditions at
least annually, pursuant to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid
supervising or examining authority, then for the purposes of this Section the
combined capital and surplus of such corporation or association shall be deemed
to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in its most recent report of
conditions so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall
resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 8.07.

                  SECTION 8.07 Resignation and Removal of the Trustee.

                  The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the
trust hereby created by giving written notice thereof to the Depositor, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor, the Master Servicer and the Certificateholders. Upon
receiving such notice of resignation of the Trustee, the Depositor shall
promptly appoint a successor trustee acceptable to the NIMS Insurer or the
Guarantor (as provided in Section 1.03) by written instrument, in duplicate,
which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and to the
successor trustee. A copy of such instrument shall be delivered to the
Certificateholders, the Guarantor, the Trustee and the Master Servicer by the
Depositor. If no successor Trustee shall have been so appointed and shall have
accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation, then the Guarantor may appoint a successor Trustee acceptable to
the NIMS Insurer. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have
accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee.

                  If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.06 and shall fail to resign after
written request therefor by the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as
provided in Section 1.03), or if at any time the Trustee shall become incapable
of acting, or shall be adjudged bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the
Trustee or of its respective property shall be appointed, or any public officer
shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its respective property or
affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the
Depositor, the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided



                                      166
<PAGE>



in Section 1.03) may remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee
acceptable to the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided in Section 1.03) by
written instrument, in duplicate, which instrument shall be delivered to the
Trustee so removed and to the successor trustee. A copy of such instrument shall
be delivered to the Certificateholders, the Guarantor and the Master Servicer by
the Depositor.

                  Either (i) the Holders of Certificates entitled to at least
51% of the Voting Rights, with the consent of the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor
(as provided in Section 1.03) or (ii) the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as
provided in Section 1.03), upon failure of the Trustee to perform its
obligations hereunder, may at any time remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee acceptable to the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided
in Section 1.03) by written instrument or instruments, in triplicate, signed by
such Holders or their attorneys-in-fact duly authorized, one complete set of
which instruments shall be delivered to the Depositor, one complete set to the
Trustee so removed and one complete set to the successor so appointed. A copy of
such instrument shall be delivered to the Certificateholders, the Guarantor and
the Master Servicer by the Depositor.

                  Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section shall not
become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as
provided in Section 8.08.

                  SECTION 8.08 Successor Trustee.

                  Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 8.07
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Depositor, the NIMS Insurer, the
Guarantor and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee without
any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the
rights, powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with the
like effect as if originally named as trustee herein. The predecessor trustee
shall deliver to the successor trustee all Mortgage Files and related documents
and statements, as well as all moneys, held by it hereunder (other than any
Mortgage Files at the time held by a Custodian, which Custodian shall become the
agent of any successor trustee hereunder), and the Depositor and the predecessor
trustee shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as
may reasonably be required for more fully and certainly vesting and confirming
in the successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

                  No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in
this Section unless at the time of such acceptance such successor trustee shall
be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06 and the appointment of such
successor trustee shall not result in a downgrading of any Class of Certificates
by each Rating Agency, as evidenced by a letter from each Rating Agency.

                  SECTION 8.09 Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.

                  Any corporation or association into which the Trustee may be
merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated or any corporation or
association resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Trustee shall be a party, or any corporation or association succeeding to the
business of the Trustee shall be the successor of the Trustee hereunder,
provided such corporation or association shall be eligible under the provisions
of Section 8.06, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act
on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding.

                  SECTION 8.10 Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

                  Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, for
the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in which any
part of REMIC I or property securing the same may at the time be located, the
Master Servicer and the Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and shall
execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons approved by
the Trustee and the NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided in Section 1.03)
to act as co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with the Trustee, or separate
trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of REMIC I, and to vest in such
Person or Persons, in such capacity, such title to REMIC I, or any part thereof,
and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.10, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Master Servicer and the Trustee may
consider necessary or desirable. Any such co-trustee or separate trustee shall
be subject to the written approval of the Master Servicer and the NIMS Insurer
or the Guarantor (as provided in Section 1.03). If the Master Servicer and the
NIMS Insurer or the Guarantor (as provided in Section 1.03) shall not have
joined in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request
so to do, or in case a Master Servicer Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment.
No co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms
of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 8.06 hereunder and no notice
to the Holders of Certificates of the appointment of co-trustee(s) or separate
trustee(s) shall be required under Section 8.08 hereof.

                  In the case of any appointment of a co-trustee or separate
trustee pursuant to this Section 8.10, all rights, powers, duties and
obligations conferred or imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed
upon and exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or
co-trustee jointly, except to the extent that under any law of any jurisdiction
in which any particular act or acts are to be performed by the Trustee (whether
as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the Master Servicer hereunder), the
Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform such act or acts, in
which event such rights, powers, duties and obligations (including the holding
of title to REMIC I or any portion thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be
exercised and performed by such separate trustee or co-trustee at the direction
of the Trustee.

                  Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee
shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and
co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and
the conditions of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon
its acceptance of the trust conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its



                                      168
<PAGE>



instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as may
be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. Every
such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee and a copy thereof given to the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer.

                  Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time,
constitute the Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and
authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in
respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee
or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all
of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be
exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the
appointment of a new or successor trustee.

                  SECTION 8.11 Appointment of Custodians.

                  The Trustee may, with the consent of the Depositor, the Master
Servicer and the Guarantor appoint one or more Custodians to hold all or a
portion of the Mortgage Files as agent for the Trustee, by entering into a
Custodial Agreement. The appointment of any Custodian may at any time be
terminated and a substitute Custodian appointed therefor upon the reasonable
request of the Master Servicer to the Trustee, the consent to which shall not be
unreasonably withheld. The Trustee shall pay any and all fees and expenses of
any Custodian in accordance with each Custodial Agreement (provided that if
expenses of the kind that would be reimbursable to the Trustee pursuant to
Section 8.05 if incurred by the Trustee are incurred by the Custodian, the
Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement under Section 8.05 for such kind of
expenses to the extent the Trustee has paid such expenses on behalf of the
Custodian or for which the Trustee has reimbursed the Custodian). The Trustee
initially appoints the Custodian as Custodian, and the Depositor and the Master
Servicer consent to such appointment. Subject to Article VIII hereof, the
Trustee agrees to comply with the terms of each Custodial Agreement and to
enforce the terms and provisions thereof against the Custodian for the benefit
of the Certificateholders having an interest in any Mortgage File held by such
Custodian. Each Custodian shall be a depository institution or trust company
subject to supervision by federal or state authority, shall have combined
capital and surplus of at least $10,000,000 and shall be qualified to do
business in the jurisdiction in which it holds any Mortgage File. Each Custodial
Agreement may be amended only as provided in Section 11.01. In no event shall
the appointment of any Custodian pursuant to a Custodial Agreement diminish the

                  SECTION 8.13 Representations and Warranties of the Trustee.

                  The Trustee hereby represents and warrants, to the Master
Servicer, the Guarantor and the Depositor, as of the Closing Date, that:

                  (i) It is a national banking association duly organized,
         validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United
         States.

                  (ii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by it, and
         the performance and compliance with the terms of this Agreement by it,
         shall not violate its charter or bylaws or constitute a default (or an
         event which, with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a
         default) under, or result in the breach of, any material agreement or
         other instrument to which it is a party or which is applicable to it or
         any of its assets.

                  (iii) It has the full power and authority to enter into and
         consummate all transactions contemplated by this Agreement, has duly
         authorized the execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement,
         and has duly executed and delivered this Agreement.

                  (iv) This Agreement, assuming due authorization, execution and
         delivery by the other parties hereto, constitutes a valid, legal and
         binding obligation of it, enforceable against it in accordance with the
         terms hereof, subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
         receivership, reorganization, moratorium and other laws affecting the
         enforcement of creditors' rights generally, and (B) general principles
         of equity, regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a
         proceeding in equity or at law.

                  (v) It is not in violation of, and its execution and delivery
         of this Agreement and its performance and compliance with the terms of
         this Agreement shall not constitute a violation of, any law, any order
         or decree of any court or arbiter, or any order, regulation or demand
         of any federal, state or local governmental or regulatory authority,
         which violation, in its good faith and reasonable judgment, is likely
         to affect materially and adversely either the ability of it to perform
         its obligations under this Agreement or its financial condition.

                  (vi) No litigation is pending or, to the best knowledge,
         threatened against it which would prohibit it from entering into this
         Agreement or, in its good faith reasonable judgment, is likely to
         materially and adversely affect either its ability to perform its
         obligations under this Agreement or its financial condition.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   TERMINATION

                  SECTION 9.01 Termination Upon Repurchase or Liquidation of All
                               Mortgage Loans.

                  (a) Subject to Section 9.02, the respective obligations and
responsibilities under this Agreement of the Depositor, the Guarantor, the
Master Servicer and the Trustee (other than the obligations of the Master
Servicer to the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.05 and of the Master Servicer to
provide for and the Trustee to make payments in respect of the REMIC I Regular
Interests, the REMIC II Regular Interests or the Classes of Certificates as
hereinafter set forth) shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders
and the deposit of all amounts held by or on behalf of the Trustee and required
hereunder to be so paid or deposited on the Distribution Date coinciding with or
following the earlier to occur of (i) the purchase by the Terminator (as defined
below) of all Mortgage Loans and each REO Property remaining in REMIC I and (ii)
the final payment or other liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of
the last Mortgage Loan or REO Property remaining in REMIC I; provided, however,
that in no event shall the trust created hereby continue beyond the expiration
of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the descendants of Joseph P.
Kennedy, the late ambassador of the United States to the Court of St. James,
living on the date hereof. The purchase by the Terminator of all Mortgage Loans
and each REO Property remaining in REMIC I shall be at a price (the "Termination
Price") equal to greater of (A) the aggregate fair market value of all of the
assets of REMIC I and (B) the sum of the Stated Principal Balance of the
Mortgage Loans (after giving effect to scheduled payments of principal due
during the related Due Period, to the extent received or advanced, and
unscheduled collections of principal received during the related Prepayment
Period) and the appraised fair market value of the REO Properties plus accrued
interest through the end of the calendar month preceding the month of the final
Distribution Date and any unreimbursed Advances and Servicing Advances(in the
case of fair market values required to be determined under (A) or (B) above, as
determined by the Terminator, the Trustee and, if the Terminator is not the NIMS
Insurer, the NIMS Insurer, as of the close of business on the third Business Day
next preceding the date upon which notice of any such termination is furnished
to Certificateholders pursuant to the third paragraph of this Section 9.01);
provided, however, such option may only be exercised if the Termination Price is
sufficient to pay (i) any outstanding Guarantor Reimbursement Amounts and
Guaranty Fees owed to the Guarantor and (ii) all interest accrued on, as well as
amounts necessary to retire the note balance of, each class of notes issued
pursuant to the Indenture and any amounts owed to the NIMS Insurer at the time
the option is exercised. If a termination pursuant to this Section 9.01(a) or
Section 9.01(b) will result in a draw on the Guaranty, the consent of the
Guarantor shall be required prior to the Terminator exercising such option.

                  (b) The Master Servicer (or if the Master Servicer fails to
exercise such right, the NIMS Insurer) shall have the right (the party
exercising such right, the "Terminator"), to purchase all of the Mortgage Loans
and each REO Property remaining in REMIC I pursuant to clause (i) of the
preceding paragraph no later than the Determination Date in the month
immediately preceding the Distribution Date on which the Certificates shall be
retired; provided,



                                      171
<PAGE>



however, that the Terminator may elect to purchase all of the Mortgage Loans and
each REO Property remaining in REMIC I pursuant to clause (i) above only (A) if
the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans and each REO
Property remaining in the Trust Fund at the time of such election is less than
10% of the sum of (x) the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Initial
Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date and (y) the Original Pre-Funded Amounts
and (B) if the Terminator is the Master Servicer and is an affiliate of the
Seller, the Master Servicer shall have delivered to the Trustee, the Guarantor
and the NIMS Insurer a written certification that the burdens of servicing the
Mortgage Loans and REO Properties remaining in REMIC I exceed the benefits of
the Servicing Fees that would be realized by the Master Servicer if it continued
to service such assets on behalf of the Trust Fund. By acceptance of the
Residual Certificates, the Holders of the Residual Certificates agree, in
connection with any termination hereunder, to pledge any amounts in excess of
par, and to the extent received in respect of such termination, to pay any such
amounts to the Holders of the Class CE Certificates.

                  (c) Notice of the liquidation of the REMIC I Regular Interests
shall be given promptly by the Trustee by letter to Certificateholders mailed
(a) in the event such notice is given in connection with the purchase of the
Mortgage Loans and each REO Property by the Terminator, not earlier than the
15th day and not later than the 25th day of the month next preceding the month
of the final distribution on the Certificates or (b) otherwise during the month
of such final distribution on or before the Determination Date in such month, in
each case specifying (i) the Distribution Date upon which the Trust Fund shall
terminate and final payment in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interests, the
REMIC II Regular Interests and the Certificates shall be made upon presentation
and surrender of the related Certificates at the office of the Trustee therein
designated, (ii) the amount of any such final payment, (iii) that no interest
shall accrue in respect of the REMIC I Regular Interests, the REMIC II Regular
Interests or the Certificates from and after the Interest Accrual Period
relating to the final Distribution Date therefor and (iv) that the Record Date
otherwise applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable, payments being
made only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office of
the Trustee. The Trustee shall give such notice to the Certificate Registrar at
the time such notice is given to Certificateholders. In the event such notice is
given in connection with the purchase of all of the Mortgage Loans and each REO
Property remaining in REMIC I by the Terminator, the Terminator shall deliver to
the Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account not later than the last
Business Day preceding the final Distribution Date on the Certificates an amount
in immediately available funds equal to the above-described purchase price. Upon
certification to the Trustee by a Servicing Officer of the making of such final
deposit, the Trustee shall promptly release or cause to be released to the
Terminator the Mortgage Files for the remaining Mortgage Loans, and the Trustee
shall execute all assignments, endorsements and other instruments necessary to
effectuate such transfer.

                  (d) Upon presentation of the Certificates by the
Certificateholders on the final Distribution Date, the Trustee shall distribute
to each Certificateholder so presenting and surrendering its Certificates the
amount otherwise distributable on such Distribution Date in accordance with
Section 4.01 in respect of the Certificates so presented and surrendered. Any
funds not distributed to any Holder or Holders of Certificates being retired on
such Distribution Date because of the failure of such Holder or Holders to
tender their Certificates shall, on such date, be set aside and held in trust by
the Trustee and credited to the account of the appropriate



                                      172
<PAGE>



non-tendering Holder or Holders. If any Certificates as to which notice has been
given pursuant to this Section 9.01 shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation within six months after the time specified in such notice, the
Trustee shall mail a second notice to the remaining non-tendering
Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for cancellation in order to
receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within one year after
the second notice all such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, the Trustee shall, directly or through an agent, mail a final
notice to remaining related non-tendering Certificateholders concerning
surrender of their Certificates. The costs and expenses of maintaining the funds
in trust and of contacting such Certificateholders shall be paid out of the
assets remaining in the trust funds. If within one year after the final notice
any such Certificates shall not have been surrendered for cancellation, the
Trustee shall pay to the Representative all remaining amounts, and all rights of
non-tendering Certificateholders in or to such amounts shall thereupon cease. No
interest shall accrue or be payable to any Certificateholder on any amount held
in trust by the Trustee as a result of such Certificateholder's failure to
surrender its Certificate(s) for final payment thereof in accordance with this
Section 9.01.

                  Immediately following the deposit of funds in trust hereunder
in respect of the Certificates, the Trust Fund shall terminate.

                  SECTION 9.02 Additional Termination Requirements.

                  (a) In the event that the Terminator purchases all the
Mortgage Loans and each REO Property or the final payment on or other
liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan or REO Property remaining in REMIC I
pursuant to Section 9.01, the Trust Fund shall be terminated in accordance with
the following additional requirements:

                  (i) The Trustee shall specify the first day in the 90-day
         liquidation period in a statement attached to each Trust REMIC's final
         Tax Return pursuant to Treasury regulation Section 1.860F-1 and shall
         satisfy all requirements of a qualified liquidation under Section 860F
         of the Code and any regulations thereunder, as evidenced by an Opinion
         of Counsel delivered to the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor
         obtained at the expense of the Terminator;

                  (ii) During such 90-day liquidation period, and at or prior to
         the time of making of the final payment on the Certificates, the
         Trustee shall sell all of the assets of REMIC I to the Terminator for
         cash; and

                  (iii) At the time of the making of the final payment on the
         Certificates, the Trustee shall distribute or credit, or cause to be
         distributed or credited, to the Holders of the Residual Certificates
         all cash on hand in the Trust Fund (other than cash retained to meet
         claims), and the Trust Fund shall terminate at that time.

                  (b) At the expense of the applicable Terminator (or in the
event of termination under Section 9.01(a)(ii), at the expense of the Trustee),
the Trustee shall prepare or cause to be prepared the documentation required in
connection with the adoption of a plan of liquidation of each Trust REMIC
pursuant to this Section 9.02.

                  (c) By their acceptance of Certificates, the Holders thereof
hereby agree to authorize the Trustee to specify the 90-day liquidation period
for each Trust REMIC which authorization shall be binding upon all successor
Certificateholders.

                                REMIC PROVISIONS

                  SECTION 10.01 REMIC Administration.

                  (a) The Trustee shall elect to treat each Trust REMIC as a
REMIC under the Code and, if necessary, under applicable state law. Each such
election shall be made by the Trustee on Form 1066 or other appropriate federal
tax or information return or any appropriate state return for the taxable year
ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the Certificates are
issued. For the purposes of the REMIC election in respect of REMIC I, (i) the
REMIC I Regular Interests shall be designated as the Regular Interests in REMIC
I and the Class R-I Interest shall be designated as the Residual Interest in
REMIC I, (ii) the REMIC II Regular Interests shall be designated as the Regular
Interests in REMIC II and the Class R-II Interest shall be designated as the
Residual Interest in REMIC II, (iii) the Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine
Certificates (exclusive of any amounts received from the Net WAC Rate Carryover
Reserve Account), the Class CE Certificates and the Class P Certificates shall
be designated as the Regular Interests in REMIC III and the Class R-III Interest
shall be designated as the Residual Interest in REMIC III. The Trustee shall not
permit the creation of any "interests" in any Trust REMIC (within the meaning of
Section 860G of the Code) other than the REMIC I Regular Interests, the REMIC II
Regular Interests and the interests represented by the Certificates.

                  (b) The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day"
of each Trust REMIC within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.

                  (c) The Trustee shall pay out of its own funds, without any
right of reimbursement, any and all expenses relating to any tax audit of the
Trust Fund caused by the Trustee (including, but not limited to, any
professional fees or any administrative or judicial proceedings with respect to
any Trust REMIC that involve the Internal Revenue Service or state tax
authorities), other than the expense of obtaining any tax related Opinion of
Counsel except as specified herein. The Trustee, as agent for each Trust REMIC's
tax matters person, shall (i) act on behalf of the Trust Fund in relation to any
tax matter or controversy involving any Trust REMIC and (ii) represent, after
consultation with the Guarantor, the Trust Fund in any administrative or
judicial proceeding relating to an examination or audit by any governmental
taxing authority with respect thereto. The Holder of the largest Percentage
Interest of each Class of Residual Certificates shall be designated, in the
manner provided under Treasury regulations section 1.860F-4(d) and Treasury
regulations section 301.6231(a)(7)-1, as the tax matters person of the related
REMIC created hereunder. By their acceptance thereof, the Holder of the largest
Percentage Interest of the Residual Certificates hereby agrees to irrevocably
appoint the Trustee or an Affiliate as its agent to perform all of the duties of
the tax matters person for the Trust Fund.

<PAGE>



                  (d) The Trustee shall prepare, sign and file all of the Tax
Returns in respect of each REMIC created hereunder. The expenses of preparing
and filing such returns shall be borne by the Trustee without any right of
reimbursement therefor. The Master Servicer shall provide on a timely basis to
the Trustee or its designee such information with respect to the assets of the
Trust Fund as is in its possession and reasonably required by the Trustee to
enable it to perform its obligations under this Article. The Trustee shall
provide to the Guarantor, upon request, copies of all of the Tax Returns and
other tax related information in respect of any REMIC created hereunder.

                  (e) The Trustee shall perform on behalf of each Trust REMIC
all reporting and other tax compliance duties that are the responsibility of
such REMIC under the Code, the REMIC Provisions or other compliance guidance
issued by the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local taxing authority.
Among its other duties, as required by the Code, the REMIC Provisions or other
such compliance guidance, the Trustee shall provide (i) to any Transferor of a
Residual Certificate such information as is necessary for the application of any
tax relating to the transfer of a Residual Certificate to any Person who is not
a Permitted Transferee, (ii) to the Certificateholders such information or
reports as are required by the Code or the REMIC Provisions including reports
relating to interest, original issue discount and market discount or premium
(using the Prepayment Assumption as required) and (iii) to the Internal Revenue
Service the name, title, address and telephone number of the person who shall
serve as the representative of each Trust REMIC. The Master Servicer shall
provide on a timely basis to the Trustee such information with respect to the
assets of the Trust Fund, including, without limitation, the Mortgage Loans, as
is in its possession and reasonably required by the Trustee to enable each of
them to perform their respective obligations under this subsection. In addition,
the Depositor shall provide or cause to be provided to the Trustee within ten
(10) days after the Closing Date, all information or data that the Trustee
reasonably determines to be relevant for tax purposes as to the valuations and
issue prices of the Certificates, including, without limitation, the price,
yield, prepayment assumption and projected cash flow of the Certificates.

                  (f) The Trustee shall take such action and shall cause each
REMIC created hereunder to take such action as shall be necessary to create or
maintain the status thereof as a REMIC under the REMIC Provisions (and the
Master Servicer shall assist it, to the extent reasonably requested by it). The
Trustee shall not take any action, cause the Trust Fund to take any action or
fail to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the REMIC
Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the
status of any Trust REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax
upon the Trust Fund (including but not limited to the tax on prohibited
transactions as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on
contributions to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code) (either such
event, an "Adverse REMIC Event") unless the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS
Insurer have received an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to the Trustee, the NIMS
Insurer and the Guarantor (at the expense of the party seeking to take such
action but in no event at the expense of the Trustee) to the effect that the
contemplated action shall not, with respect to any Trust REMIC, endanger such
status or result in the imposition of such a tax, nor shall the Master Servicer
take or fail to take any action (whether or not authorized hereunder) as to
which the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer has advised it in writing
that it has received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that an Adverse REMIC
Event could occur with respect to such action. In



                                      175
<PAGE>



addition, prior to taking any action with respect to any Trust REMIC or the
respective assets of each, or causing any Trust REMIC to take any action, which
is not contemplated under the terms of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall
consult with the Trustee, the NIMS Insurer, the Guarantor or its designee, in
writing, with respect to whether such action could cause an Adverse REMIC Event
to occur with respect to any Trust REMIC, and the Master Servicer shall not take
any such action or cause any Trust REMIC to take any such action as to which the
Trustee, the Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer has advised it in writing that an
Adverse REMIC Event could occur. The Trustee, the Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer
may consult with counsel to make such written advice, and the cost of same shall
be borne by the party seeking to take the action not permitted by this
Agreement, but in no event shall such cost be an expense of the Trustee. At all
times as may be required by the Code, the Master Servicer on behalf of the
Trustee shall ensure that substantially all of the assets of any Trust REMIC
shall consist of "qualified mortgages" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the
Code and "permitted investments" as defined in Section 860G(a)(5) of the Code.

                  (g) In the event that any tax is imposed on "prohibited
transactions" of any REMIC created hereunder as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of
the Code, on the "net income from foreclosure property" of such REMIC as defined
in Section 860G(c) of the Code, on any contributions to any such REMIC after the
Startup Day therefor pursuant to Section 860G(d) of the Code, or any other tax
is imposed by the Code or any applicable provisions of state or local tax laws,
such tax shall be charged (i) to the Trustee pursuant to Section 10.03 hereof,
if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the Trustee of any of its
obligations under this Article X, (ii) to the Master Servicer pursuant to
Section 10.03 hereof, if such tax arises out of or results from a breach by the
Master Servicer of any of its obligations under Article III or this Article X,
or otherwise (iii) against amounts on deposit in the Distribution Account and
shall be paid by withdrawal therefrom.

                  (h) On or before April 15th of each calendar year, commencing
April 15, 2005, the Trustee shall deliver to the Master Servicer, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor and each Rating Agency a Certificate from a Responsible
Officer of the Trustee stating, without regard to any action taken by any party
other than the Trustee, the Trustee's compliance with this Article X.

                  (i) The Trustee shall, for federal income tax purposes,
maintain books and records with respect to each Trust REMIC on a calendar year
and on an accrual basis. The Trustee shall apply for an Employer Identification
Number for the Trust Fund from the Internal Revenue Service via a Form SS-4 or
such other form as is appropriate.

                  (j) Following the Startup Day, the Trustee shall not accept
any contributions of assets to any Trust REMIC other than in connection with any
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan delivered in accordance with Section 2.03
unless it shall have received an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the
inclusion of such assets in the Trust Fund shall not cause the related REMIC to
fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding or
subject such REMIC to any tax under the REMIC Provisions or other applicable
provisions of federal, state and local law or ordinances.

<PAGE>



                  (k) Neither the Trustee nor the Master Servicer shall enter
into any arrangement by which any Trust REMIC shall receive a fee or other
compensation for services nor permit any such REMIC to receive any income from
assets other than the Mortgage Pool which are deemed to constitute "qualified
mortgages" as defined in Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code or "permitted
investments" as defined in Section 860G(a)(5) of the Code.

                  SECTION 10.02 Prohibited Transactions and Activities.

                  None of the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee
shall sell, dispose of or substitute for any of the Mortgage Loans (except in
connection with (i) the foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan, including but not
limited to, the acquisition or sale of a Mortgaged Property acquired by deed in
lieu of foreclosure, (ii) the bankruptcy of REMIC I, (iii) the termination of
REMIC I pursuant to Article IX of this Agreement, (iv) a substitution pursuant
to Article II of this Agreement or (v) a purchase of Mortgage Loans pursuant to
Article II or III of this Agreement), or acquire any assets for any Trust REMIC
(other than REO Property acquired in respect of a defaulted Mortgage Loan), or
sell or dispose of any investments in the Collection Account or the Distribution
Account for gain, or accept any contributions to any Trust REMIC after the
Closing Date (other than a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan delivered in
accordance with Section 2.03), unless it has received an Opinion of Counsel,
addressed to the Trustee, the Guarantor and the NIMS Insurer (at the expense of
the party seeking to cause such sale, disposition, substitution, acquisition or
contribution but in no event at the expense of the Trustee) that such sale,
disposition, substitution, acquisition or contribution shall not (a) affect
adversely the status of any Trust REMIC as a REMIC or (b) cause any Trust REMIC
to be subject to a tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions" pursuant
to the REMIC Provisions.

                  SECTION 10.03 Master Servicer and Trustee Indemnification.

                  (a) The Trustee agrees to indemnify the Trust Fund, the NIMS
Insurer, the Guarantor, the Depositor and the Master Servicer for any taxes and
costs including, without limitation, any reasonable attorneys fees imposed on or
incurred by the Trust Fund, the Depositor or the Master Servicer, caused solely
by the Trustee's failure to act in accordance with its standard of care set
forth in this Article X or any state, local or franchise taxes imposed upon the
Trust as a result of the location of the Trustee.

                  (b) The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trust Fund,
the Guarantor, the NIMS Insurer, the Depositor and the Trustee for any taxes and
costs including, without limitation, any reasonable attorneys' fees imposed on
or incurred by the Trust Fund, the Depositor or the Trustee, as a result of a
breach of the Master Servicer's covenants set forth in Article III or this
Article X or any state, local or franchise taxes imposed upon the Trust as a
result of the location of the Master Servicer or any subservicer.

                  This Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may be amended from
time to time by the Depositor, the Guarantor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee
and, if applicable, the Custodian with the consent of the NIMS Insurer and
without the consent of any of the Certificateholders, (i) to cure any ambiguity
or defect, (ii) to correct, modify or supplement any provisions herein
(including to give effect to the expectations of Certificateholders), or in any
Custodial Agreement, or (iii) to make any other provisions with respect to
matters or questions arising under this Agreement or in any Custodial Agreement
which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this Agreement or such
Custodial Agreement, provided that such action shall not adversely affect in any
material respect the interests of any Certificateholder, as evidenced by either
(i) an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Master Servicer, the Guarantor and
the Trustee to such effect or (ii) confirmation from the Rating Agencies that
such amendment shall not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the rating of
any outstanding Class of Certificates. No amendment shall be deemed to adversely
affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder who shall
have consented thereto, and no Opinion of Counsel shall be required to address
the effect of any such amendment on any such consenting Certificateholder.

                  This Agreement or any Custodial Agreement may also be amended
from time to time by the Depositor, the Guarantor, the Master Servicer and the
Trustee with the consent of the NIMS Insurer and the Holders of Certificates
entitled to at least 66% of the Voting Rights for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of
this Agreement or any Custodial Agreement or of modifying in any manner the
rights of the Holders of Certificates; provided, however, that no such amendment
shall (i) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing of, payments
received on Mortgage Loans which are required to be distributed on any
Certificate without the consent of the Holder of such Certificate, (ii)
adversely affect in any material respect the interests of the Holders of any
Class of Certificates (as evidenced by either (i) an Opinion of Counsel
delivered to the Trustee or (ii) written notice to the Depositor, the Master
Servicer, the Guarantor and the Trustee from the Rating Agencies that such
action shall not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any
outstanding Class of Certificates with respect to which it is a Rating Agency)
in a manner other than as described in (i), or (iii) modify the consents
required by the immediately preceding clauses (i) and (ii) without the consent
of the Holders of all Certificates then outstanding. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement, for purposes of the giving or withholding of
consents pursuant to this Section 11.01, Certificates registered in the name of
the Depositor or the Master Servicer or any Affiliate thereof shall be entitled
to Voting Rights with respect to matters affecting such Certificates.

                  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this Agreement, none
of the Trustee, the Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer shall consent to any amendment
to this Agreement unless it shall have first received an Opinion of Counsel
satisfactory to the NIMS Insurer and the Guarantor to the effect that such
amendment shall not result in the imposition of any tax on any




                                      178

Trust REMIC pursuant to the REMIC Provisions or cause any Trust REMIC to fail to
qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding.

                  Notwithstanding any of the other provisions of this Section
11.01, none of the Depositor, the Guarantor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee
shall enter into any amendment of this Agreement that would significantly change
the permitted activities of the Trust Fund without the consent of the NIMS
Insurer and the Holders of Certificates that represent more than 50% of the
aggregate Certificate Principal Balance of all Certificates.

                  Promptly after the execution of any such amendment the Trustee
shall furnish a copy of such amendment to each Certificateholder.

                  It shall not be necessary for the consent of
Certificateholders under this Section 11.01 to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve
the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing
the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders shall be
subject to such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.

                  The cost of any Opinion of Counsel to be delivered pursuant to
this Section 11.01 shall be borne by the Person seeking the related amendment,
but in no event shall such Opinion of Counsel be an expense of the Trustee.

                  The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to enter into any
amendment pursuant to this Section that affects its respective rights, duties
and immunities under this Agreement or otherwise.

                  SECTION 11.02 Recordation of Agreement; Counterparts.

                  To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement is
subject to recordation in all appropriate public offices for real property
records in all the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which any or
all of the properties subject to the Mortgages are situated, and in any other
appropriate public recording office or elsewhere, such recordation to be
effected by the Master Servicer at the expense of the Certificateholders, but
only upon direction of the Trustee accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel to the
effect that such recordation materially and beneficially affects the interests
of the Certificateholders.

                  For the purpose of facilitating the recordation of this
Agreement as herein provided and for other purposes, this Agreement may be
executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which
counterparts shall be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall
constitute but one and the same instrument.

                  SECTION 11.03 Limitation on Rights of Certificateholders.

                  The death or incapacity of any Certificateholder shall not
operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust Fund, nor entitle such
Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up



                                      179

of the Trust Fund, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities
of the parties hereto or any of them.

                  No Certificateholder shall have any right to vote (except as
expressly provided for herein) or in any manner otherwise control the operation

shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms of any of the
Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Certificateholders from time
to time as partners or members of an association; nor shall any
Certificateholder be under any liability to any third person by reason of any
action taken by the parties to this Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.

                  No Certificateholder shall have any right by virtue of any
provision of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in
equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, unless (i)
such Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee a written notice of
default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and (ii) the
Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights shall have
made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or
proceeding in the name of the Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the
Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses
and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for 15 days
after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have
neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding. It is
understood and intended, and expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with
every other Certificateholder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of
Certificates shall have any right in any manner whatsoever by virtue of any
provision of this Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the
Holders of any other of such Certificates, or to obtain or seek to obtain
priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any right
under this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal,
ratable and common benefit of all Certificateholders. For the protection and
enforcement of the provisions of this Section, each and every Certificateholder
and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law
or in equity.

                  SECTION 11.09 Grant of Security Interest.

                  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the
conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by the Depositor to the Trustee be, and be
construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by



                                      182
<PAGE>



the Depositor and not a pledge of the Mortgage Loans by the Depositor to secure
a debt or other obligation of the Depositor or the Seller. However, in the event
that, notwithstanding the aforementioned intent of the parties, the Mortgage
Loans are held to be property of the Depositor or the Seller, then, (a) it is
the express intent of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of the
Mortgage Loans by the Depositor to the Trustee to secure a debt or other
obligation of the Depositor or the Seller and (b)(1) this Agreement shall also
be deemed to be a security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of
the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect from time to time in the State of New
York; (2) the conveyance provided for in Section 2.01 hereof shall be deemed to
be a grant by the Seller and the Depositor to the Trustee of a security interest
in all of the Seller's and the Depositor's right, title and interest in and to
the Mortgage Loans and all amounts payable to the Holders of the Mortgage Loans
in accordance with the terms thereof and all proceeds of the conversion,
voluntary or involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments, securities or
other property, including without limitation all amounts, other than investment
earnings, from time to time held or invested in the Collection Account and the
Distribution Account, whether in the form of cash, instruments, securities or
other property; (3) the obligations secured by such security agreement shall be
deemed to be all of the Depositor's obligations under this Agreement, including
the obligation to provide to the Certificateholders the benefits of this
Agreement relating to the Mortgage Loans and the Trust Fund; and (4)
notifications to persons holding such property, and acknowledgments, receipts or
confirmations from persons holding such property, shall be deemed notifications
to, or acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from, financial
intermediaries, bailees or agents (as applicable) of the Trustee for the purpose
of perfecting such security interest under applicable law. Accordingly, the
Depositor hereby grants to the Trustee a security interest in the Mortgage Loans
and all other property described in clause (2) of the preceding sentence, for
the purpose of securing to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders the
performance by the Depositor of the obligations described in clause (3) of the
preceding sentence. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto intend the
conveyance pursuant to Section 2.01 and the transfer pursuant to the Mortgage
Loan Purchase Agreement to be a true, absolute and unconditional sale of the
Mortgage Loans and assets constituting the Trust Fund by the Depositor to the
Trustee.

                  SECTION 11.10 Third Party Rights.

                  The NIMS Insurer shall be deemed a third-party beneficiary of
this Agreement to the same extent as if it were a party hereto, and shall have
the right to enforce the provisions of this Agreement.

<PAGE>


exchangeable for new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations
evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder
surrendering the same.

                  No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

                  The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund
created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

                  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of
the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the

provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of

specified in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

Section 4975 of the Code, any Person acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf
of any such Plan or any Person using "Plan Assets" to acquire this Certificate
shall be made except in accordance with Section 5.02(c) of the Agreement.

                  No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the

Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

                  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of
the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the

Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

                  The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund
created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

                  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of
the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of
the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the

the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

                  The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only

                  No transfer of this Certificate to a Plan subject to ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, any Person acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf
of any such Plan or any Person using "Plan Assets" to acquire this Certificate
shall be made except in accordance with Section 5.02(c) of the Agreement.

                  No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the

such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

                  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of
the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

                  This Certificate is one of a duly authorized issue of
Certificates designated as Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates of the Series
specified on the face hereof (herein called the "Certificates") and representing
a Percentage Interest in the Class of Certificates specified on the face hereof
equal to the denomination specified on the face hereof divided by the aggregate
Certificate Principal Balance of the Class of Certificates specified on the face
hereof.

                  The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain
collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account
may be made from time to time for purposes other than distributions to
Certificateholders, such purposes including reimbursement of advances made, or
certain expenses incurred, with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

                  The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein
provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and
obligations of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the rights of
the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time by the Depositor, the
Master Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders of Certificates
entitled to at least 66% of the Voting Rights. Any such consent by the Holder of
this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange herefor or in lieu hereof whether or not notation
of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also permits the
amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the consent of the
Holders of any of the Certificates.

                  As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable
in the Certificate Register upon surrender of this Certificate for registration
of transfer at the offices or agencies appointed by the Trustee as provided in
the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form
below or other written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by, the Holder hereof or
such Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

                  The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only
without coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests
specified in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the Holder surrendering the same.

                  No transfer of this Certificate shall be made unless the
transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and an effective
registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws, or is made
in a transaction that does not require such registration or qualification. In
the event that such a transfer of this Certificate is to be made without
registration or qualification, the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar shall
require receipt of (i) if such transfer is purportedly being made in reliance
upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, written certifications from the Holder of the


                                     A-15-4
<PAGE>


Certificate desiring to effect the transfer, and from such Holder's prospective
transferee, substantially in the forms attached to the Agreement as Exhibit F-1,
and (ii) in all other cases, an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to it that such
transfer may be made without such registration or qualification (which Opinion
of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust Fund or of the Depositor, the
Trustee or the Master Servicer in their respective capacities as such), together
with copies of the written certification(s) of the Holder of the Certificate
desiring to effect the transfer and/or such Holder's prospective transferee upon
which such Opinion of Counsel is based. None of the Depositor, the Certificate
Registrar or the Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the Class of
Certificates specified on the face hereof under the 1933 Act or any other
securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Agreement
to permit the transfer of such Certificates without registration or
qualification. Any Holder desiring to effect a transfer of this Certificate
shall be required to indemnify the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate
Registrar and the Master Servicer against any liability that may result if the
transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and
state laws.

                  No transfer of this Certificate to a Plan subject to ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, any Person acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf
of any such Plan or any Person using "Plan Assets" to acquire this Certificate
shall be made except in accordance with Section 5.02(c) of the Agreement.

                  No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

                  The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund
created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

                  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of
the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

the Agreement, duly endorsed by, or accompanied by an assignment in the form

transferees.

                  The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only

                  No transfer of this Certificate shall be made unless the
transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and an effective
registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws, or is made
in a transaction that does not require such registration or qualification. In
the event that such a transfer of this Certificate is to be made without
registration or qualification, the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar shall
require receipt of (i) if such transfer is purportedly being made in reliance
upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, written certifications from the Holder of the
Certificate desiring to effect the transfer, and from such Holder's prospective
transferee, substantially in the forms attached to the Agreement as Exhibit F-1,
and (ii) in all other cases, an Opinion of Counsel satisfactory to it that such
transfer may be made without such registration or qualification (which Opinion
of Counsel shall not be an expense of the Trust Fund or of the Depositor, the
Trustee or the Master Servicer in their respective capacities as such), together
with copies of the written certification(s) of the Holder of the Certificate
desiring to effect the transfer and/or such Holder's prospective transferee upon
which such Opinion of Counsel is based. None of the Depositor, the Certificate
Registrar or the Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the Class of
Certificates specified on the face hereof under the 1933 Act or any other
securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Agreement
to permit the transfer of such Certificates without registration or
qualification. Any Holder desiring to effect a transfer of this Certificate
shall be required to indemnify the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate
Registrar and the Master Servicer against any liability that may result if the
transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and
state laws.

                  No transfer of this Certificate to a Plan subject to ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, any Person acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf
of any such Plan or any Person using "Plan Assets" to acquire this Certificate
shall be made except in accordance with Section 5.02(c) of the Agreement.

                  No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Certificate Registrar may require
payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

                  The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund
created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as


                                     A-16-4

provided in the Agreement. The exercise of such right will effect early
retirement of the Certificates; however, such right cannot be exercised until
the Optional Termination Date.

                  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of
the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

equal to the denomination specified on the face hereof divided by the aggregate
Certificate Principal Balance of the Class of Certificates specified on the face

                  The Certificates are limited in right of payment to certain
collections and recoveries respecting the Mortgage Loans, all as more
specifically set forth herein and in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement, withdrawals from the Collection Account and the Distribution Account

entitled to at least 66% of the Voting Rights. Any such consent by the Holder of

Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations evidencing the same
aggregate Percentage Interest will be issued to the designated transferee or
transferees.

                  The Certificates are issuable in fully registered form only
without coupons in Classes and denominations representing Percentage Interests
specified in the Agreement. As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain
limitations therein set forth, Certificates are exchangeable for new

transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933 Act"), and an effective
registration or qualification under applicable state securities laws, or is made
in a transaction that does not require such registration or qualification. In
the event that such a transfer of this Certificate is to be made without
registration or qualification, the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar shall
require receipt of (i) if such transfer is purportedly being made in reliance
upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, written certifications from the Holder of the

Certificate desiring to effect the transfer, and from such Holder's prospective
transferee, substantially in the forms attached to the Agreement as Exhibit F-1,

Trustee or the Master Servicer in their respective capacities as such), together
with copies of the written certification(s) of the Holder of the Certificate
desiring to effect the transfer and/or such Holder's prospective transferee upon
which such Opinion of Counsel is based. None of the Depositor, the Certificate
Registrar or the Trustee is obligated to register or qualify the Class of
Certificates specified on the face hereof under the 1933 Act or any other
securities law or to take any action not otherwise required under the Agreement
to permit the transfer of such Certificates without registration or
qualification. Any Holder desiring to effect a transfer of this Certificate
shall be required to indemnify the Trustee, the Depositor, the Certificate
Registrar and the Master Servicer against any liability that may result if the
transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and
state laws.

                  No transfer of this Certificate to a Plan subject to ERISA or

                  Prior to registration of any transfer, sale or other
disposition of this Certificate, the proposed transferee shall provide to the
Trustee (i) an affidavit to the effect that such transferee is any Person other
than a Disqualified Organization or the agent (including a broker, nominee or
middleman) of a Disqualified Organization, and (ii) a certificate that
acknowledges that (A) the Class R Certificates have been designated as a
residual interest in a REMIC, (B) it will include in its income a pro rata share
of the net income of the Trust Fund and that such income may be an "excess
inclusion," as defined in the Code, that, with certain exceptions, cannot be
offset by other losses or benefits from any tax exemption, and (C) it expects to
have the financial means to satisfy all of its tax obligations including those
relating to holding the Class R Certificates. Notwithstanding the registration
in the Certificate Register of any transfer, sale or other disposition of this
Certificate to a Disqualified Organization or an agent (including a broker,
nominee or middleman) of a Disqualified Organization, such registration shall be
deemed to be of no legal force or effect whatsoever and such Person shall not be
deemed to be a Certificateholder for any purpose, including, but not limited to,
the receipt of distributions in respect of this Certificate.

                  The Holder of this Certificate, by its acceptance hereof,
shall be deemed to have consented to the provisions of Section 5.02 of the
Agreement and to any amendment of the Agreement deemed necessary by counsel of
the Depositor to ensure that the transfer of this Certificate to any Person
other than a Permitted Transferee or any other Person will not cause the Trust
Fund to cease to qualify as a REMIC or cause the imposition of a tax upon the
REMIC.

                  No transfer of this Certificate to a Plan subject to ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code, any Person acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf
of any such Plan or any Person using "Plan Assets" to acquire this Certificate
shall be made except in accordance with Section 5.02(c) of the Agreement.

                  No service charge will be made for any such registration of
transfer or exchange of Certificates, but the Trustee may require payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge that may be imposed
in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  The Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the
Certificate Registrar and any agent of the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar nor any
such agent shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

                  The obligations created by the Agreement and the Trust Fund
created thereby shall terminate upon payment to the Certificateholders of all
amounts held by the Trustee and required to be paid to them pursuant to the
Agreement following the earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation
(or any advance with respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan remaining in
REMIC I, and (ii) the purchase by the party designated in the Agreement at a
price determined as provided in the Agreement from REMIC I of all the Mortgage
Loans and all property acquired in respect of such Mortgage Loans. The Agreement
permits, but does not require, the party designated in the Agreement to purchase
from REMIC I all the Mortgage Loans and all property acquired in respect of any
Mortgage Loan at a price determined as provided in the Agreement. The exercise
of such right will effect early retirement of the Certificates; however, such
right cannot be exercised until the Optional Termination Date.

                  The recitals contained herein shall be taken as statements of
the Depositor and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for their correctness.

                  Unless the certificate of authentication hereon has been
executed by the Certificate Registrar, by manual signature, this Certificate
shall not be entitled to any benefit under the Agreement or be valid for any
purpose.

than such documents described in Section 2.01(v)) required to be delivered to it
pursuant to this Agreement are in its possession, (ii) such documents have been
reviewed by it or such Custodian and are not mutilated, torn or defaced unless

effectiveness or suitability of any such Mortgage Loan.

                  The Trustee was under no duty or obligation (i) to inspect,
review or examine any such documents, instruments, certificates or other papers
to determine whether they are genuine, enforceable, or appropriate for the
represented purpose or whether they have actually been

                        MORTGAGE LOAN PURCHASE AGREEMENT

                  This is a Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement (the "Agreement"),
dated December 1, 2004, between Ameriquest Mortgage Company, a Delaware
corporation (the "Seller"), and Ameriquest Mortgage Securities Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Purchaser").

                              Preliminary Statement
                              ---------------------

                  The Seller intends to sell the Mortgage Loans (as hereinafter
defined) to the Purchaser on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Agreement. The Purchaser shall deposit the Mortgage Loans into a
mortgage pool constituting the Trust Fund. The Trust Fund will be evidenced by a
single series of asset-backed pass-through certificates designated as Series
2004-R12 (the "Certificates"). The Certificates will consist of seventeen
classes of certificates. The Class CE Certificates, the Class P Certificates and
the Class R Certificates (collectively, the "Non-Offered Certificates") will be
delivered to the Seller or its designee as partial consideration for the
Mortgage Loans as further described below.

                  The Certificates will be issued pursuant to a Pooling and
Servicing Agreement relating to the Series 2004-R12 Certificates, dated as of
December 1, 2004 (the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"), among the Purchaser as
depositor (in such capacity, the "Depositor"), the Seller as master servicer (in
such capacity the "Master Servicer"), the Federal National Mortgage Association
as guarantor of the Class A-1 Certificates and Deutsche Bank National Trust
Company as trustee (the "Trustee"). Pursuant to the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, the Depositor will assign all of its right, title and interest in and
to the Mortgage Loans, together with its rights under this Agreement, to the
Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders. Capitalized terms used but
not defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement.

                  The parties hereto agree as follows:

                  SECTION 1. AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE. The Seller hereby sells, and
the Purchaser hereby purchases, as of December 8, 2004 (the "Closing Date"),
certain adjustable-rate and fixed-rate conventional, one- to four-family,
residential mortgage loans (the "Mortgage Loans"), having an aggregate principal
balance as of the close of business on December 1, 2004 (the "Cut-off Date") of
$[__], after giving effect to all payments due on the Mortgage Loans on or
before the Cut-off Date (the "Closing Balance"), whether or not received,
including the right to any Prepayment Charges collected after the Cut-off Date
from the Mortgagors in connection with any Principal Prepayments on the Mortgage
Loans. Any payments (including Prepayment Charges) collected on or before the
Cut-off Date, including all scheduled payments of principal and interest due on
or before the Cut-off Date and collected after the Cut-off Date, shall belong to
the Seller. In addition to the sale of the Mortgage Loans, the Seller will cause
the Cap Contracts to be transferred to the Purchaser.

                  SECTION 2. MORTGAGE LOAN SCHEDULE AND PREPAYMENT CHARGE
SCHEDULE. The Purchaser and the Seller have agreed upon which of the mortgage
loans owned by the Seller are to be purchased by the Purchaser pursuant to this
Agreement, and the Seller shall prepare or


<PAGE>



cause to be prepared on or prior to the Closing Date a final schedule (the
"Closing Schedule") describing such Mortgage Loans and setting forth all of the
Mortgage Loans to be purchased under this Agreement. The Closing Schedule shall
conform to the requirements set forth in this Agreement and to the definition of
"Mortgage Loan Schedule" under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement. The Closing
Schedule shall be used as the Mortgage Loan Schedule under the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement. The Seller shall also prepare or cause to be prepared on or
prior to the Closing Date a final schedule (the "Prepayment Charge Schedule")
setting forth each Mortgage Loan containing a Prepayment Charge and conforming
to the definition of Prepayment Charge Schedule under the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

                  SECTION 3. CONSIDERATION.

                  (a) In consideration for the Mortgage Loans to be purchased
hereunder, the Purchaser shall, as described in Section 8, (i) pay to or upon
the order of the Seller in immediately available funds an amount equal to the
net sale proceeds of the Class A and Mezzanine Certificates and (ii) deliver to
the Seller or its designee the Non-Offered Certificates.

                  (b) In connection with the transactions contemplated by
Section 2..09 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, the Seller hereby agrees
that the Purchaser shall be under no obligation to purchase any Subsequent
Mortgage Loans unless (i) the conditions precedent contained in Section 2.09 of
the Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the Subsequent Transfer Instrument,
substantially in the form of Exhibit L of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement,
are satisfied and (ii) each Subsequent Mortgage Loan satisfies the
representations and warranties contained in Section 6 of this Agreement. The
sale of Subsequent Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Depositor shall be
effected in accordance with the terms of Section 2.09 of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement pursuant to a Subsequent Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement
substantially in the form of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 4. Transfer of the Mortgage Loans.

                  (a) POSSESSION OF MORTGAGE FILES. The Seller does hereby sell
to the Purchaser, without recourse but subject to the terms of this Agreement,
all of its rights, title and interest in, to and under the Mortgage Loans,
including the related Prepayment Charges collected after the Cut-off Date. The
contents of each Mortgage File not delivered to the Purchaser or to any
assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser on or prior to the Closing
Date are and shall be held in trust by the Seller for the benefit of the
Purchaser or any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser. Upon the
sale and contribution of the Mortgage Loans the ownership of each Mortgage Note,
the related Mortgage and the other contents of the related Mortgage File is
vested in the Purchaser and the ownership of all records and documents with
respect to the related Mortgage Loan prepared by or that come into the
possession of the Seller on or after the Closing Date shall immediately vest in
the Purchaser and shall be delivered immediately to the Purchaser or as
otherwise directed by the Purchaser.

                  (b) DELIVERY OF MORTGAGE LOAN DOCUMENTS. The Seller will, on
or prior to the Closing Date, deliver or cause to be delivered to the Purchaser
or any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser each of the following

<PAGE>



                           (1) the original Mortgage Note, endorsed in blank
         without recourse or in the following form: "Pay to the order of
         Deutsche Bank National Trust Company, as Trustee under the applicable
         agreement, without recourse," with all prior and intervening
         endorsements showing a complete chain of endorsement from the
         originator to the Person so endorsing to the Trustee, or with respect
         to any lost Mortgage Note, an original Lost Note Affidavit; provided,
         however, that such substitutions of Lost Note Affidavits for original
         Mortgage Notes may occur only with respect to Mortgage Loans, the
         aggregate Cut-off Date Principal Balance of which is less than or equal
         to 2.00% of the Pool Balance as of the Cut-off Date;

                           (2) the original Mortgage with evidence of recording
         thereon, and a copy, certified by the appropriate recording office, of
         the recorded power of attorney, if the Mortgage was executed pursuant
         to a power of attorney, with evidence of recording thereon;

                           (3) an original Assignment assigned in blank, without
         recourse;

                           (4) the original recorded intervening Assignment or
         Assignments showing a complete chain of assignment from the originator
         to the Person assigning the Mortgage to the Trustee as contemplated by
         the immediately preceding clause (iii) or the original unrecorded
         intervening Assignments;

                           (5) the original or copies of each assumption,
         modification, written assurance or substitution agreement, if any; and

                           (6) the original lender's title insurance policy or
         an attorney's opinion of title or similar guarantee of title acceptable
         to mortgage lenders generally in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged
         Property is located, together with all endorsements or riders which
         were issued with or subsequent to the issuance of such policy, insuring
         the priority of the Mortgage as a first lien on the Mortgaged Property
         represented therein as a fee interest vested in the Mortgagor, or in
         the event such original title policy is unavailable, a written
         commitment or uniform binder or preliminary report of title issued by
         the title insurance or escrow company.

                  If any document referred to in Section 4(b)(2), 4(b)(3) or
4(b)(4) above has been submitted for recording but either (x) has not been
returned from the applicable public recording office or (y) has been lost or
such public recording office has retained the original of such document, the
obligations of the Seller hereunder shall be deemed to have been satisfied upon
(1) delivery by or on behalf of the Seller promptly upon receipt thereof to the
Purchaser or any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser of either the
original or a copy of such document certified by the Seller in the case of (x)
above or the public recording office in the case of (y) above to be a true and
complete copy of the recorded original thereof and (2) if such delivered copy is
certified by the Seller, then in addition thereto, delivery promptly upon
receipt thereof of either the original or a copy of such document certified by
the public recording office to be a true and complete copy of the original. In
the event that the original lender's title insurance policy has not yet been
issued, the Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser or any assignee, transferee or
designee of the Purchaser a written commitment or interim binder or preliminary




                                       3
<PAGE>



report of title issued by the title insurance or escrow company. Promptly upon
receipt by the Seller of any such original title insurance policy the Seller
shall deliver such to the Purchaser or any assignee, transferee or designee of
the Purchaser.

                  The Seller shall promptly (and in no event later than thirty
(30) Business Days, subject to extension upon mutual agreement between the
Seller and the Trustee, following the later of (i) the Closing Date, (ii) the
date on which the Seller receives the Assignment from the Trustee and (iii) the
date of receipt by the Seller of the recording information for a Mortgage)
submit or cause to be submitted for recording, at no expense to the Trust Fund
or the Trustee, in the appropriate public office for real property records, each
Assignment referred to in (3) and (4) above and shall execute each original
Assignment referred to in (3) in the following form: "Deutsche Bank National
Trust Company, as Trustee under the applicable agreement". In the event that any
such Assignment is lost or returned unrecorded because of a defect therein, the
Seller shall promptly prepare or cause to be prepared a substitute Assignment or
cure or cause to be cured such defect, as the case may be, and thereafter cause
each such Assignment to be duly recorded. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
however, for administrative convenience and facilitation of servicing and to
reduce closing costs, so long as recordation of an Assignment is not necessary
to protect the Trustee's and the Certificateholders' interests in the related
Mortgage Loan under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the related Mortgaged
Property is located, as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel reasonably
satisfactory to the Guarantor delivered by the Master Servicer to the Trustee
and the Guarantor, the Assignments shall not be required to be submitted for
recording (except with respect to any Mortgage Loan located in Maryland) unless
such failure to record would result in a withdrawal or a downgrading by any
Rating Agency of the rating on any Class of Certificates; provided further,
however, each Assignment shall be submitted for recording by the Seller (at the
direction of the Master Servicer) in the manner described above, at no expense
to the Trust Fund or the Trustee, upon the earliest to occur of: (i) reasonable
direction by Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting
Rights, the Guarantor or the NIMS Insurer, (ii) a failure of the Master Servicer
Termination Test as set forth in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (iii) the
occurrence of the bankruptcy or insolvency of the Seller, (iv) the occurrence of
a servicing transfer as described in Section 7.02 of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement and (v) if the Seller is not the Master Servicer and with respect to
any one assignment or Mortgage, the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or
foreclosure relating to the Mortgagor under the related Mortgage.

                  Each original document relating to any Mortgage Loan which is
not delivered to the Purchaser or its assignee, transferee or designee, if held
by the Seller, shall be so held for the benefit of the Purchaser or its
assignee, transferee or designee.

                  (c) ACCEPTANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS. The documents delivered
pursuant to Section 4(b) hereof shall be reviewed by the Purchaser or any
assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser at any time before or after
the Closing Date (and with respect to each document permitted to be delivered
after the Closing Date, within seven (7) days of its delivery) to ascertain that
all required documents have been executed and received and that such documents
relate to the Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule.

                  (d) Reserved.




                                       4

                  (e) TRANSFER OF INTEREST IN AGREEMENTS. The Purchaser has the
right to assign its interest under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to the
Trustee, as may be required to effect the purposes of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement, without the consent of the Seller, and the assignee shall succeed to
the rights and obligations hereunder of the Purchaser. Any expense reasonably
incurred by or on behalf of the Purchaser or the Trustee in connection with
enforcing any obligations of the Seller under this Agreement shall be promptly
reimbursed by the Seller.

                  (f) EXAMINATION OF MORTGAGE FILES. Prior to the Closing Date,
the Seller shall either (i) deliver in escrow to the Purchaser or to any
assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser, for examination, the Mortgage
File pertaining to each Mortgage Loan or (ii) make such Mortgage Files available
to the Purchaser or to any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser for
examination at the Trustee's offices in Santa Ana, California. Such examination
may be made by the Purchaser, and its respective designees, upon reasonable
notice to the Seller and the Trustee during normal business hours before the
Closing Date and within sixty (60) days after the Closing Date. If any such
person makes such examination prior to the Closing Date and identifies any
Mortgage Loans that do not conform to the requirements of the Purchaser as
described in this Agreement, such Mortgage Loans shall be deleted from the
Closing Schedule. The Purchaser may, at its option and without notice to the
Seller, purchase all or part of the Mortgage Loans without conducting any
partial or complete examination. The fact that the Purchaser or any person has
conducted or has failed to conduct any partial or complete examination of the
Mortgage Files shall not affect the rights of the Purchaser or any assignee,
transferee or designee of the Purchaser to demand repurchase or other relief as
provided herein or under the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

                  SECTION 5. REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS OF THE
SELLER.

                  The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Purchaser as

         any event, is in compliance with the doing business laws of any such

         been made and none of the Mortgage Loans will have been contractually
         delinquent for more than one calendar month more than once since the
         origination thereof;

                           (4) Each Mortgage is a valid and enforceable first
         lien on the Mortgaged Property, including all improvements thereon,
         subject only to (a) the lien of nondelinquent current real property

         specifically reflected in the appraisal made in connection with the
         origination of the related Mortgage Loan, and (c) other matters to
         which like properties are commonly subject which do not materially

         to any Mortgage Note or Mortgage, including the obligation of the
         Mortgagor to pay the unpaid principal of or interest on such Mortgage
         Note, nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage Note
         and the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render the
         Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to any valid
         right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the
         defense of usury and no such valid right of rescission, set-off,
         counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto;

                           (8) There are no mechanics' liens or claims for work,

         against by the title insurance policy referred to in (12) below;

                           (9) Subject to the Escrow Withhold referred to in

<PAGE>


                           (10) Each Mortgage Loan at origination complied in
         all material respects with applicable local, state and federal laws and
         regulations, including, without limitation, usury, equal credit
         opportunity, real estate settlement procedures, truth-in-lending,
         disclosure laws and all applicable predatory and abusive lending laws,
         and consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby will not
         involve the violation of any such laws;

                           (11) Neither the Seller nor any prior holder of any
         Mortgage has modified, impaired or waived the Mortgage in any material
         respect (except that a Mortgage Loan may have been modified by a
         written instrument which has been recorded, if necessary, to protect
         the interests of the Purchaser and which has been delivered to the
         Trustee); satisfied, canceled or subordinated such Mortgage in whole or
         in part; released the related Mortgaged Property in whole or in part

         title insurer qualified to do business in the jurisdiction where the
         Mortgaged Property is located and in a form acceptable to Fannie Mae or
         Freddie Mac, which policy insures the Seller and successor owners of
         indebtedness secured by the insured Mortgage, as to the first priority
         lien of the Mortgage; no claims have been made under such lender's
         title insurance policy and no prior holder of the related Mortgage,

         or an Affiliate of the Seller, in accordance with the underwriting
         standards as set forth in the Prospectus Supplement (or, if generated

         equal the Index plus the Gross Margin, rounded to the nearest 0.125%,
         subject to the Periodic Rate Cap, the Maximum Mortgage Rate and the
         Minimum Mortgage Rate. The related Mortgage Note is payable

         Loan is subject to negative amortization;

                           (15) All of the improvements which were included for
         the purpose of determining the appraised value of the Mortgaged
         Property lie wholly within the boundaries and building restriction

         Originator's underwriting guidelines. All costs, fees and expenses
         incurred in making, closing or recording the Mortgage Loans were paid;

                           (20) The related Mortgage contains customary and
         enforceable provisions which render the rights and remedies of the
         holder thereof adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged
         Property of the benefits of the security, including, (i) in the case of
         a Mortgage designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (ii)
         otherwise by judicial foreclosure. There is no homestead or other

         with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or
         the right to foreclose the Mortgage;

         deed of trust, a trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve
         as such, has been properly designated and currently so serves and is
         named in such Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become
         payable by the Purchaser to the trustee under the deed of trust, except
         in connection with a trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor;

                           (22) There exist no deficiencies with respect to
         escrow deposits and payments, if such are required, for which customary
         arrangements for repayment thereof have not been made, and no escrow
         deposits or payments of other charges or payments due the Seller have
         been capitalized under the Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note;

                           (23) The origination, collection and servicing
         practices used by the Seller (or its affiliate) with respect to each
         Mortgage Loan have been in all material respects legal, proper,
         reasonable and customary in the subprime mortgage origination and
         servicing business and each of the Mortgage Loans have been serviced by
         the Seller since origination;

                           (24) There is no pledged account or other security
         other than real estate securing the Mortgagor's obligations;

         feature, or other contingent interest feature;

         that is in full force and effect with a generally acceptable carrier
         that provides for fire extended coverage and such other hazards as are
         customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located
         representing coverage not less than the lesser of the outstanding
         principal balance of the related Mortgage Loan or the minimum amount
         required to compensate for damage or loss on a replacement cost basis.
         All individual insurance policies and flood policies referred to in
         clause (27) below contain a standard mortgagee clause naming the Seller
         or the original mortgagee, and its successors in interest, as
         mortgagee, and the Seller has received no notice that any premiums due
         and payable thereon have not been paid; the Mortgage obligates the
         Mortgagor thereunder to maintain all such insurance, including flood
         insurance, at the Mortgagor's cost and expense, and upon the
         Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the Mortgage to
         obtain and maintain such insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and expense
         and to seek reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor, except as may be
         limited or restricted by applicable law;

         valid, in full force and effect; (b) all rents and other payments due
         under the lease have been paid; (c) the lessee is not in default under

                                       12
<PAGE>



         unfavorable) on its borrower credit files to Equifax, Experian and
         Trans Union Credit Information Company or their successors (the "Credit

                           (44) There is no Mortgage Loan that was originated on
         or after October 1, 2002 and before March 7, 2003 which is secured by

                           (45) The Prepayment Charges included in the
         transaction are enforceable and originated in compliance with all
         applicable federal, state and local law;

                           (46) No proceeds from any Mortgage Loan were used to

         Poor's LEVELS Version 5.6 Glossary Revised, Appendix E); and

                           (48) With respect to any Mortgage Loan originated on
         or after August 1, 2004, neither the related Mortgage nor the related
         Mortgage Note requires the borrower to submit to arbitration to resolve
         any dispute arising out of or relating in any way to the Mortgage Loan
         transaction.

                  (b) The Seller hereby represents, warrants and covenants to
the Purchaser, with respect to the Group I Mortgage Loans as of the Closing Date
and with respect to the Subsequent Group I Mortgage Loans as of the respective
Subsequent Transfer Date or as of such date specifically provided herein:

                           (1) Each Group I Mortgage Loan is in compliance with
         the anti-predatory lending eligibility for purchase requirements of
         Fannie Mae's Selling Guide;

                           (2) The methodology used in underwriting the
         extension of credit for each Group I Mortgage Loan employs objective
         mathematical principles which relate the Mortgagor's income, assets and
         liabilities to the proposed payment and such underwriting methodology
         does not rely on the extent of the Mortgagor's equity in the collateral
         as the principal determining factor in approving such credit extension.
         Such underwriting methodology confirmed that at the time of origination
         (application/approval) the Mortgagor had a reasonable ability to make
         timely payments on the Group I Mortgage Loan;

                           (3) With respect to any Group I Mortgage Loan that
         contains a provision permitting imposition of a charge upon a
         prepayment prior to maturity: (i) prior to the Group I Mortgage Loan's
         origination, the Mortgagor agreed to such charge in exchange for a
         monetary benefit, including but not limited to a rate or fee reduction,
         (ii) prior to the Group I Mortgage Loan's origination, the Mortgagor
         was offered the option of obtaining a mortgage loan that did not
         require payment of such a charge, (iii) the prepayment charge is
         disclosed to the Mortgagor in the loan documents pursuant to applicable
         state and federal law, (iv) for loans originated on or after September
         1, 2004, the duration of the prepayment period shall not exceed three
         (3) years from the date of the



                                       13
<PAGE>



         Mortgage Note unless the loan was modified to reduce the prepayment
         period to no more than three years from the date of the Mortgage Note
         and the borrower was notified in writing of such reduction in the
         prepayment period, and (v) notwithstanding any state or federal law to
         the contrary, the Master Servicer shall not impose such prepayment
         charge in any instance when the mortgage debt is accelerated as the
         result of the Mortgagor's default in making the loan payments;

                           (4) All points and fees related to each Group I
         Mortgage Loan were disclosed in writing to the Mortgagor in accordance
         with applicable state and federal law and regulation. Except in the
         case of a Group I Mortgage Loan in an original principal amount of less
         than $60,000 which would have resulted in an unprofitable origination,
         no Mortgagor was charged "points and fees" (whether or not financed) in
         an amount greater than 5% of the principal amount of such loan and such
         5% limitation is calculated in accordance with Fannie Mae's
         anti-predatory lending requirements as set forth in the Fannie Mae
         Selling Guide;

                           (5) All fees and charges (including finance charges)
         and whether or not financed, assessed, collected or to be collected in
         connection with the origination and servicing of each Group I Mortgage
         Loan have been disclosed in writing to the Mortgagor in accordance with
         applicable state and federal law and regulation;

                           (6) No Group I Mortgage Loan Mortgagor was encouraged
         or required to select a mortgage loan product offered by the Originator
         which is a higher cost product designed for a less creditworthy
         Mortgagor, unless at the time of the Mortgage Loan's origination, such
         Mortgagor did not qualify taking into account credit history and debt
         to income ratios for a lower cost credit product then offered by the
         Originator;

                           (7) The Master Servicer will transmit full-file
         credit reporting data for each Group I Mortgage Loan pursuant to Fannie
         Mae Guide Announcement 95-19 and that for each Group I Mortgage Loan,

                  SECTION 7. Repurchase Obligation for Defective Documentation
and for Breach of Representation and Warranty.

                  (a) The representations and warranties contained in Section 6
shall not be impaired by any review and examination of loan files or other
documents evidencing or relating to the Mortgage Loans or any failure on the
part of the Purchaser to review or examine such documents and shall inure to the
benefit of any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser, including the
Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders.

                  Upon discovery by the Seller, the Purchaser or any assignee,
transferee or designee of the Purchaser of any materially defective document in,
or that any material document was not transferred by the Seller (as listed on
the Trustee's Preliminary Exception Report) as part of, any Mortgage File or of
a breach of any of the representations and warranties contained in Section 5 or
Section 6 that materially and adversely affects the value of any Mortgage Loan
or the interest therein of the Purchaser or the Purchaser's assignee, transferee
or designee (it being understood that with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in (39), (40), (41), (42), (43), (44), (46), (47) and (48)
of Section 6(a) herein, a breach of any such representation or warranty shall in
and of itself be deemed to materially adversely affect the interest therein of
the Purchaser and the Purchaser's assignee, transferee or designee), the party
discovering the breach shall give prompt written notice to the others. Within
ninety (90) days of its discovery or its receipt of notice of any such missing
documentation which was not transferred to the Purchaser as described above or
materially defective documentation or any such breach of a representation

and warranty (it being understood that with respect to the representations and
warranties set forth in (39), (40), (41), (42), (43), (44), (46), (47) and (48)
of Section 6(a) herein, a breach of any such representation or warranty shall in
and of itself be deemed to materially adversely affect the interest therein of
the Purchaser and the Purchaser's assignee, transferee or designee), the Seller
promptly shall deliver such missing document or cure such defect or breach in
all material respects, or in the event the Seller cannot deliver such missing
document or such defect or breach cannot be cured, the Seller shall, within
ninety (90) days of its discovery or receipt of notice, either (i) repurchase
the affected Mortgage Loan at a price equal to the Purchase Price or (ii)
pursuant to the provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, cause the
removal of such Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund and substitute one or more
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans. In the event that any Mortgage Loan is
subject to a breach of the representation and warranty in Section 6(a)(37) and
(39) resulting in the Master Servicer's inability to collect all or part of the
Prepayment Charge from the Mortgagor, in lieu of repurchase, the Seller shall be
obligated to remit to the Master Servicer (for deposit in the Collection
Account) any shortfall in the Prepayment Charge collected upon the Mortgagor's
voluntary Principal Prepayment.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, within ninety (90) days of the

amount of the scheduled Prepayment Charge, for the benefit of the Holders of the
Class P Certificates, by depositing such amount into the Collection Account, net
of any amount previously collected by the Master Servicer and paid by the Master
Servicer, for the benefit of the Holders of the Class P Certificates, in respect
of such Prepayment Charge.

withdrawal of such Mortgage Loan from the terms of this Agreement and the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement and the addition, if any, of a Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan. The Seller shall deliver to the Purchaser such amended
Closing Schedule and shall deliver such other documents as are required by this
Agreement or the Pooling and Servicing Agreement within five (5) days of any
such amendment. Any repurchase pursuant to this Section 7(a) shall be
accomplished by deposit in the Collection Account of the amount of the Purchase
Price in accordance with Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.
Any repurchase or substitution required by this Section shall be made in a
manner consistent with Section 2.03 of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

                  In addition, upon discovery by the Seller, the Purchaser, or
any assignee, transferee or designee of the Purchaser that any Mortgage Loan
does not constitute a "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(3) of the Code, the party discovering the breach shall give prompt
written notice within five (5) Business Days to the others. Within ninety (90)
days of its discovery or its receipt of notice, the Seller promptly shall either
(i) repurchase the affected Mortgage Loan at the Purchase Price (as such term is
defined in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement) or (ii) pursuant to the
provisions of the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, cause the removal of such
Mortgage Loan from the Trust Fund and substitute one or more Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loans.

                  (b) It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the
Seller set forth in this Section 7 to cure, remit a Prepayment Charge shortfall,
repurchase or substitute for a

                       made and no event shall have occurred which, with notice
                       or the passage of time, would constitute a default under
                       this Agreement;

                  (b)  The Purchaser shall have received, or the attorneys of

                       and released to the Purchaser or to its designee, all
                       documents (including without limitation, the Mortgage

                  (d)  All other terms and conditions of this Agreement shall

The sale and delivery on the Closing Date of the Mortgage Loans described on the
Mortgage Loan Schedule in accordance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement is mandatory. It is specifically understood and agreed that each
Mortgage Loan is unique and identifiable on the date hereof and that an award of
money damages would be insufficient to compensate the Purchaser for the losses
and damages incurred by the Purchaser in the event of the Seller's failure to
deliver the Mortgage Loans on or before the Closing Date. The Seller hereby
grants to the Purchaser a lien on and a continuing security interest in the
Seller's interest in each Mortgage Loan and each document and instrument
evidencing each such Mortgage Loan to secure the performance by the Seller of
its obligation hereunder, and the Seller agrees that it holds such Mortgage
Loans in custody for the Purchaser, subject to the Purchaser's (i) right, prior
to the Closing Date, to reject any Mortgage Loan to the extent permitted by this
Agreement and (ii) obligation to deliver or cause to be delivered the
consideration for the Mortgage Loans pursuant to Section 8 hereof.



                                       19

Any Mortgage Loans rejected by the Purchaser shall concurrently therewith be
released from the security interest created hereby. The Seller agrees that, upon
acceptance of the Mortgage Loans by the Purchaser or its designee and delivery
of payment to the Seller, that its security interest in the Mortgage Loans shall
be released. All rights and remedies of the Purchaser under this Agreement are
distinct from, and cumulative with, any other rights or remedies under this
Agreement or afforded by law or equity and all such rights and remedies may be
exercised concurrently, independently or successively.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, if on the Closing Date, each of the
conditions set forth in Section 8 hereof shall have been satisfied and the
Purchaser shall not have paid or caused to be paid the Purchase Price, or any
such condition shall not have been waived or satisfied and the Purchaser
determines not to pay or cause to be paid the Purchase Price, the Purchaser
shall immediately effect the redelivery of the Mortgage Loans, if delivery to
the Purchaser has occurred and the security interest created by this Section 13
shall be deemed to have been released.

                  SECTION 14. NOTICES. All demands, notices and communications
hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if
personally delivered to or mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, or
transmitted by telex or telegraph and confirmed by a similar mailed writing, if

                  SECTION 15. SEVERABILITY OF PROVISIONS. Any part, provision,
representation or warranty of this Agreement which is prohibited or which is
held to be void or unenforceable shall be ineffective to the extent of such
prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions
hereof. Any part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which
is prohibited or unenforceable or is held to be void or unenforceable in any
jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of
such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the remaining
provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction as to any Mortgage Loan shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law which prohibits
or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof.

                  SECTION 16. AGREEMENT OF PARTIES. The Seller and the Purchaser
agree to execute and deliver such instruments and take such actions as either of
the others may, from time to time, reasonably request in order to effectuate the
purpose and to carry out the terms of this Agreement and the Pooling and

agreements made by the Seller herein or in any such certificate or other
instrument shall survive the delivery of and payment for the Mortgage Loans and
shall continue in full force and effect, notwithstanding any restrictive or
qualified endorsement on the Mortgage Notes and notwithstanding subsequent
termination of this Agreement, the Pooling and Servicing Agreement or the Trust
Fund.

                  SECTION 18. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS,
DUTIES, OBLIGATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE PARTIES HERETO SHALL BE GOVERNED
BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS (EXCLUDING THE CHOICE OF LAW
PROVISIONS) AND DECISIONS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK. THE PARTIES HERETO INTEND
THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SECTION 5-1401 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW
SHALL APPLY TO THIS AGREEMENT.

                  SECTION 19. MISCELLANEOUS. This Agreement may be executed in
two or more counterparts, each of which when so executed and delivered shall be
an original, but all of which together shall constitute one and the same
instrument. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the
parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement
supersedes all prior agreements and understandings relating to the subject
matter hereof. Neither this Agreement nor any term hereof may be changed,
waived, discharged or terminated orally, but only by an instrument in writing
signed by the party against whom enforcement of the change, waiver, discharge or
termination is sought. The headings in this Agreement are for purposes of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof. Each
of the NIMS Insurer, if any, and the Guarantor, shall be a third party
beneficiary hereof and may enforce the terms hereof as if a party hereto.

                  It is the express intent of the parties hereto that the
conveyance of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser as provided in
Section 4 hereof be, and be construed as, a sale of the Mortgage Loans by the
Seller to the Purchaser and not as a pledge of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller
to the Purchaser to secure a debt or other obligation of the Seller. However, in
the event that, notwithstanding the aforementioned intent of the parties, the
Mortgage Loans are held to be property of the Seller, then, (a) it is the
express intent of the parties that such conveyance be deemed a pledge of the
Mortgage Loans by the Seller to the Purchaser to secure a debt or other
obligation of the Seller and (b) (1) this Agreement shall also be deemed to be a
security agreement within the meaning of Articles 8 and 9 of the New York
Uniform Commercial Code; (2) the conveyance provided for in Section 4 hereof
shall be deemed to be a grant by the Seller to the Purchaser of a security
interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage
Loans and all amounts payable to the holders of the Mortgage Loans in accordance
with the terms thereof and all proceeds of the conversion, voluntary or
involuntary, of the foregoing into cash, instruments, securities or other
property, including without limitation all amounts, other than investment
earnings, from time to time held or invested in the Collection Account whether
in the form of cash, instruments, securities or other property; (3) the
possession by the Purchaser or its agent of Mortgage Notes, the related
Mortgages and such other items of property that constitute instruments, money,
negotiable documents or chattel paper shall be deemed to be "possession" for
purposes of perfecting the security interest pursuant to the New York Uniform
Commercial Code; and (4) notifications to persons holding such property, and
acknowledgments, receipts or confirmations from persons



                                       21
<PAGE>



holding such property, shall be deemed notifications to, or acknowledgments,
receipts or confirmations from, financial intermediaries, bailees or agents (as
applicable) of the Purchaser for the purpose of perfecting such security
interest under applicable law. The Seller and the Purchaser shall, to the extent
consistent with this Agreement, take such actions as may be necessary to ensure
that, if this Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the
Mortgage Loans, such security interest would be deemed to be a perfected
security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be maintained
as such throughout the term of this Agreement and the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

                  IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the Seller and the Purchaser have caused
their names to be signed by their respective officers thereunto duly authorized
as of the date first above written.

                  to Section 15 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as
                  amended.

         ___      Insurance Company. The Transferee is an insurance company
                  whose primary and predominant business activity is the writing
                  of insurance or the reinsuring of risks underwritten by
                  insurance companies and which is subject to supervision by the
                  insurance commissioner or a similar official or agency of a

                  4. For purposes of determining the aggregate amount of
securities owned and/or invested on a discretionary basis by the Transferee, the
Transferee used the cost of such securities to the Transferee and did not

in determining such aggregate amount, the Transferee may have included
securities owned by subsidiaries of the Transferee, but only if such
subsidiaries are consolidated with the Transferee in its financial statements
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and if the
investments of such subsidiaries are managed under the Transferee's direction.

amended.

                  5. The Transferee acknowledges that it is familiar with Rule
144A and understands that the Transferor and other parties related to the
Certificates are relying and will continue to rely on the statements made herein
because one or more sales to the Transferee may be in reliance on Rule 144A.

Transferee agrees that, in connection with any purchase of securities sold to
the Transferee for the account of a third party (including any separate account)
in reliance on Rule 144A, the Transferee will only



                                  F-Annex-1-2
<PAGE>



purchase for the account of a third party that at the time is a "qualified
institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A. In addition, the
Transferee agrees that the Transferee will not purchase securities for a third
party unless the Transferee has obtained a current representation letter from
such third party or taken other appropriate steps contemplated by Rule 144A to
conclude that such third party independently meets the definition of "qualified
institutional buyer" set forth in Rule 144A.

                  7. The Transferee will notify each of the parties to which
this certification is made of any changes in the information and conclusions
herein. Until such notice is given, the Transferee's purchase of the
Certificates will constitute a reaffirmation of this certification as of the
date of such purchase. In addition, if the Transferee is a bank or savings and
loan as provided above, the Transferee agrees that it will furnish to such
parties updated annual financial statements promptly after they become
available.

                    FORM OF TRANSFER AFFIDAVIT AND AGREEMENT

STATE OF NEW YORK           )
                                            : ss.:
COUNTY OF NEW YORK                  )

                  ____________________________, being duly sworn, deposes,
represents and warrants as follows:

                  1. I am a ______________________ of
____________________________ (the "Owner") a corporation duly organized and
existing under the laws of ______________, the record owner of Ameriquest
Mortgage Securities Inc., Asset-Backed Pass-Through Certificates, Series
2004-R12, Class R (the "Class R Certificates"), on behalf of whom I make this
affidavit and agreement. Capitalized terms used but not defined herein have the
respective meanings assigned thereto in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement
pursuant to which the Class R Certificates were issued.

                  2. The Owner (i) is and will be a "Permitted Transferee" as of
____________________, 2004 and (ii) is acquiring the Class R Certificates for
its own account or for the account of another Owner from which it has received
an affidavit in substantially the same form as this affidavit. A "Permitted
Transferee" is any person other than a "disqualified organization" or a
possession of the United States. For this purpose, a "disqualified organization"
means the United States, any state or political subdivision thereof, any agency
or instrumentality of any of the foregoing (other than an instrumentality all of
the activities of which are subject to tax and, except for the Federal Home Loan
Mortgage Corporation, a majority of whose board of directors is not selected by
any such governmental entity) or any foreign government, international
organization or any agency or instrumentality of such foreign government or
organization, any rural electric or telephone cooperative, or any organization
(other than certain farmers' cooperatives) that is generally exempt from federal
income tax unless such organization is subject to the tax on unrelated business
taxable income.

                  3. The Owner is aware (i) of the tax that would be imposed on
transfers of the Class R Certificates to disqualified organizations under the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended, that applies to all transfers of the
Class R Certificates after March 31, 1988; (ii) that such tax would be on the
transferor or, if such transfer is through an agent (which person includes a
broker, nominee or middleman) for a non-Permitted Transferee, on the agent;
(iii) that the person otherwise liable for the tax shall be relieved of
liability for the tax if the transferee furnishes to such person an affidavit
that the transferee is a Permitted Transferee and, at the time of transfer, such
person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is false; and (iv) that
each of the Class R Certificates may be a "noneconomic residual interest" within
the meaning of proposed Treasury regulations promulgated under the Code and that
the transferor of a "noneconomic residual interest" will remain liable for any
taxes due with respect to the income on such residual interest, unless no
significant purpose of the transfer is to impede the assessment or collection of
tax.



                                     F-2-1
<PAGE>


                  4. The Owner is aware of the tax imposed on a "pass-through
entity" holding the Class R Certificates if, at any time during the taxable year
of the pass-through entity, a non-Permitted Transferee is the record holder of
an interest in such entity. (For this purpose, a "pass-through entity" includes
a regulated investment company, a real estate investment trust or common trust
fund, a partnership, trust or estate, and certain cooperatives.)

                  5. The Owner is aware that the Certificate Registrar will not
register the transfer of any Class R Certificate unless the transferee, or the
transferee's agent, delivers to the Certificate Registrar, among other things,
an affidavit in substantially the same form as this affidavit. The Owner
expressly agrees that it will not consummate any such transfer if it knows or
believes that any of the representations contained in such affidavit and
agreement are false.

                  6. The Owner consents to any additional restrictions or
arrangements that shall be deemed necessary upon advice of counsel to constitute
a reasonable arrangement to ensure that the Class R Certificates will only be
owned, directly or indirectly, by an Owner that is a Permitted Transferee.

                  7. The Owner's taxpayer identification number is ____________.

                  8. The Owner has reviewed the restrictions set forth on the
face of the Class R Certificates and the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement under which the Class R Certificates were issued
(in particular, clauses (iii)(A) and (iii)(B) of Section 5.02(d) which authorize
the Trustee to deliver payments to a person other than the Owner and negotiate a
mandatory sale by the Trustee in the event that the Owner holds such Certificate
in violation of Section 5.02(d)); and that the Owner expressly agrees to be
bound by and to comply with such restrictions and provisions.

                  9. The Owner is not acquiring and will not transfer the Class
R Certificates in order to impede the assessment or collection of any tax.

                  10. The Owner anticipates that it will, so long as it holds
the Class R Certificates, have sufficient assets to pay any taxes owed by the
holder of such Class R Certificates, and hereby represents to and for the
benefit of the person from whom it acquired the Class R Certificates that the
Owner intends to pay taxes associated with holding such Class R Certificates as
they become due, fully understanding that it may incur tax liabilities in excess
of any cash flows generated by the Class R Certificates.

                  11. The Owner has no present knowledge that it may become
insolvent or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding for so long as it holds the
Class R Certificates.

                  12. The Owner has no present knowledge or expectation that it
will be unable to pay any United States taxes owed by it so long as any of the
Certificates remain outstanding.

                  13. The Owner is not acquiring the Class R Certificates with
the intent to transfer the Class R Certificates to any person or entity that
will not have sufficient assets to pay any taxes owed by the holder of such
Class R Certificates, or that may become insolvent or subject to a bankruptcy
proceeding, for so long as the Class R Certificates remain outstanding.

<PAGE>



                  14. The Owner will, in connection with any transfer that it
makes of the Class R Certificates, obtain from its transferee the
representations required by Section 5.02(d) of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement under which the Class R Certificate were issued and will not
consummate any such transfer if it knows, or knows facts that should lead it to
believe, that any such representations are false.

                  15. The Owner will, in connection with any transfer that it
makes of the Class R Certificates, deliver to the Certificate Registrar an
affidavit, which represents and warrants that it is not transferring the Class R
Certificates to impede the assessment or collection of any tax and that it has
no actual knowledge that the proposed transferee: (i) has insufficient assets to
pay any taxes owed by such transferee as holder of the Class R Certificates;
(ii) may become insolvent or subject to a bankruptcy proceeding for so long as
the Class R Certificates remains outstanding; and (iii) is not a "Permitted
Transferee".

                  16. The Owner is a citizen or resident of the United States, a
corporation or partnership (or other entity treated as a corporation or
partnership for federal income tax purposes) created or organized in, or under
the laws of, the United States, any state thereof or the District of Columbia
(except, in the case of a partnership or entity treated as a partnership, to the
extent provided in regulations), an estate the income of which is subject to
United States federal income taxation regardless of its source or a trust other
than a "foreign trust" described in section 7701(a)(31) of the Code.

                  _______________________________________, being duly sworn,
deposes, represents and warrants _____________________________ as follows:

                  1. I am a ____________________ of (the "Owner"), a corporation
duly organized and existing under the laws of ______________, on behalf of whom
I make this affidavit.

                  2. The Owner is not transferring the Class R (the "Residual
Certificates") to impede the assessment or collection of any tax.

                  3. The Owner has no actual knowledge that the Person that is
the proposed transferee (the "Purchaser") of the Residual Certificates: (i) has
insufficient assets to pay any taxes owed by such proposed transferee as holder
of the Residual Certificates; (ii) may become insolvent or subject to a
bankruptcy proceeding for so long as the Residual Certificates remain
outstanding and (iii) is not a Permitted Transferee.

                  4. The Owner understands that the Purchaser has delivered to
the Certificate Registrar a transfer affidavit and agreement in the form
attached to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement as Exhibit F-2. The Owner does
not know or believe that any representation contained therein is false.

                  5. At the time of transfer, the Owner has conducted a
reasonable investigation of the financial condition of the Purchaser as
contemplated by Treasury Regulations Section 1.860E-1(c)(4)(i) and, as a result
of that investigation, the Owner has determined that the Purchaser has
historically paid its debts as they became due and has found no significant
evidence to indicate that the Purchaser will not continue to pay its debts as
they become due in the future. The Owner understands that the transfer of a
Residual Certificate may not be respected for United States income tax purposes
(and the Owner may continue to be liable for United States income taxes
associated therewith) unless the Owner has conducted such an investigation.

                  6. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined herein shall have
the meanings ascribed to them in the Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

</TABLE>

         Workouts in the form of either a Forbearance or Loan Modification
require that the Borrower document the existence of a financial hardship leading
to the payment delinquency and document the ability to make the payments
required under the proposed Forbearance or Loan Modification. If the Borrower
fails to meet both of these conditions or the Borrower is uncooperative, a
Disposal Loss Mitigation Action will be employed to liquidate the delinquent
loan, assuming the Borrower does not otherwise cure the existing default. Each
of the Default Mitigation Actions and Supporting Standards may not be applicable
to each and every loan subject to a default in its monthly payments and in those
cases where a Default Mitigation Action or Supporting Standard may be
applicable, each is subject to amendment and/or waiver on an individual basis
pursuant to applicable federal, state and local laws, decisional authorities,
court orders, instructions of regulatory and/or other governmental authorities,
the advice of legal counsel, instructions from the Trustee and changes in the
loan servicing standards.
