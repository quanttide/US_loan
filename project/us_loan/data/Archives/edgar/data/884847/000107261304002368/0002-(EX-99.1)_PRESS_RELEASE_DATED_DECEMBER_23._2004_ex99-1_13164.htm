Provides Update on NMP66 Program for Breast Cancer Detection and NMP22 Sales</B> </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Newton, Mass. (December 23,
2004)</B> &#150; Matritech, Inc. (AMEX: MZT), a leading developer of protein-based
diagnostic products for the early detection of cancer, today provided an update on its
NMP66&#153; development program for breast cancer detection. At the December San Antonio
Breast Cancer Symposium, Matritech&#146;s clinical advisory board met to review recent
data on NMP66 and provide counsel on the best ways to move forward with the clinical
testing of the product. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Since presenting data at the 4th
Annual European Conference: Perspectives in Breast Cancer in Madrid, Spain in September,
Matritech&#146;s scientists have continued to refine methods for detecting the NMP66
complex in the blood of women with breast cancer. Recent testing of 20 additional samples
has been conducted using both immunoassay and reverse transcriptase polymerase chain
reaction (RT-PCR) methods. The RT-PCR assay first reported in Madrid is designed to
measure a unique RNA sequence associated with the NMP66 complex. The results from the 20
samples further validated the RT-PCR method, detecting 7 out of 8 cancers in the group.
Additional studies with more samples are scheduled for the first quarter of 2005. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;Recent technical improvements
to Matritech&#146;s NMP66 test for breast cancer have resulted in improved analytical
performance, reconfirming that the NMP66 complex can be detected and quantified in patient
blood. Testing of substantially larger numbers of blood specimens is scheduled for early
2005 and we expect to review the outcome with our clinical advisory board in the first
quarter,&#148; said Stephen D. Chubb, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Matritech,
Inc. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Matritech also commented that it
expects the fourth quarter 2004 sales growth of its NMP22&reg; products, the NMP22 Test
Kit and the NMP22 BladderChek&reg; Test, to be in line with the year-over-year growth that
the Company has achieved throughout 2004. David Corbet, Matritech&#146;s President,
commented, &#147;Our sales force continues to be successful in converting urologists to
NMP22 BladderChek Test use and, just as importantly, we&#146;re pleased with our reorder
rates which continue to grow. In the last two months, repeat orders for NMP22 BladderChek
Test have accounted for more than 60% of our NMP22 BladderChek Test business in the United
States. Product sales for 2005 should continue to reflect the product&#146;s growing
market penetration, and we expect that the sales growth of NMP22 BladderChek Tests in 2005
will exceed the sales growth of NMP22 BladderChek Tests achieved in 2004.&#148; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>About NMP66&#153;
Proteins:</B><BR>Using a research mass spectrometer,
Matritech scientists discovered the existence of certain proteins
(&#147;NMP66&#153;&#148;) in the blood of breast cancer patients and not detectable in the
blood of women without known breast malignancy. The Company&#146;s scientists have been
developing clinical formats for the detection of NMP66 in blood to enable physicians to
more effectively manage women with or at a risk for breast cancer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>About Breast Cancer:</B><BR>Breast cancer is the most common
cancer among women, other than skin cancer. It is the second leading cause of cancer death
in women, after lung cancer. According to the American Cancer Society, about 215,990 women
in the United States will be found to have invasive breast cancer in 2004. About 40,110
women will die from the disease this year. Right now there are slightly over 2 million
women living in the U.S. who have been treated for breast cancer. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>About Matritech</B><BR>Matritech is using its patented
nuclear matrix protein (NMP) technology to develop diagnostics for the detection of major
cancers. The Company&#146;s first two products, the NMP22<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Test Kit and
NMP22<SUP>&reg;</SUP> BladderChek<SUP>&reg;</SUP> Test, have been approved for both the
monitoring and diagnosis of bladder cancer. The NMP22 products are based on
Matritech&#146;s proprietary NMP technology, exclusively licensed from the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, which correlates levels of NMPs in body fluids or cells to the
presence of cancer. The Company has discovered other proteins associated with breast,
cervical, prostate, and colon cancer and is, with its own research staff and through
strategic alliances, in various stages of research and development currently targeted to
applications for breast, cervical, and prostate cancer. </FONT></P>
