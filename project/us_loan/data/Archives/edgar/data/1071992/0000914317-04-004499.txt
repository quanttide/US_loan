ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

Our Board of Directors (the "Board") approved at its December 16, 2004 meeting
an increase in director and committee fees. Commencing January 1, 2005, outside
directors will receive an annual retainer of $10,000 ($30,000 in the case of the
Chairman of the Board). Directors will also be paid $750 ($2,000 in the case of
the Chairman of the Board) for each board meeting they attend and $500 for each
committee meeting they attend. Committee chairmen will receive $750 ($1,000 in
the case of the Audit Committee Chairman) for each meeting of their committees
they attend. If a director attends fewer than 75% of the board meetings or their
committee meetings, they will not be paid any fees applicable to their service
for which they failed to achieve 75% attendance.

In addition, at the December 16, 2004 meeting, the Board approved amendments to
the Capital Bank Corporation Deferred Compensation Plan for Outside Directors
("Directors' Plan"), which amendments are subject to stockholder approval at our
2005 Annual Meeting of Shareholders. The amendments allow a Director to specify
a specific future date for the payment of fees deferred in a given year. In
addition, the fees deferred in a given year, along with earnings of previously
credited Stock Units under the Directors' Plan, will be accumulated during the
year and credited as additional Stock Units at the end of each calendar year.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS

Also at the December 16, 2004 meeting, the Board approved an increase to Capital
Bank Corporation's quarterly dividend of 20%. The new dividend of $.06 per share
will be payable on January 18, 2005 to shareholders of record on January 3,
2005. In addition at this meeting, the Board approved the repurchase of an
additional 100,000 shares of its common stock. This brings the remaining
repurchase authorization to 150,000 shares, of which no shares have been
repurchased as of December 16, 2004.


Information set forth above contains various forward-looking statements within
the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), which statements represent the Company's judgment concerning the future
and are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause the Company's actual
operating results to differ materially. Such forward-looking statements can be
identified by the use of forward-looking terminology, such as "may", "will",
"expect", "anticipate", "estimate", "believe", or "continue", or the negative
thereof or other variations thereof or comparable terminology. The Company
cautions that such forward-looking statements are further qualified by important
factors that could cause the Company's actual operating results to differ
materially from those in the forward-looking statements, as well as the factors
set forth in the Company's periodic reports and other filings with the SEC.
