number of Warrant Shares so restricted. The Company covenants and agrees that it
will honor all Exercise Notices tendered through 6:30 p.m. (New York City time)

         5. DELIVERY OF WARRANT SHARES.

                  (a) To effect exercises hereunder, the Holder shall not be
required to physically surrender this Warrant unless the aggregate Warrant
Shares represented by this Warrant is being exercised. Upon delivery of the
Exercise Notice (in the form attached hereto) to the Company (with the attached
Warrant Shares Exercise Log) at its address for notice set forth herein and upon
payment of the Exercise Price multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares that
the Holder intends to purchase hereunder, the Company shall promptly (but in no
event later than three Trading Days after the Date of Exercise (as defined
herein)) issue and deliver to the Holder, a certificate for the Warrant Shares
issuable upon such exercise, which, unless otherwise required by the Purchase
Agreement, shall be free of restrictive legends. The Company shall, upon request
of the Holder and subsequent to the date on which a registration statement
covering the resale of the Warrant Shares has been declared effective by the
Securities and Exchange Commission, use its reasonable best efforts to deliver
Warrant Shares hereunder electronically through the Depository Trust Corporation
or another established clearing corporation performing similar functions, if
available, PROVIDED, that, the Company may, but will not be required to change
its transfer agent if its current transfer agent cannot deliver Warrant Shares
electronically through the Depository Trust Corporation. A "DATE OF EXERCISE"
means the date on which the Holder shall have delivered to the Company: (i) the
Exercise Notice (with the Warrant Exercise Log attached to it), appropriately
completed and duly signed and (ii) if such Holder is not utilizing the cashless
exercise provisions set forth in this Warrant, payment of the Exercise Price for
the number of Warrant Shares so indicated by the Holder to be purchased.

                  (b) If by the third Trading Day after a Date of Exercise the
Company fails to deliver the required number of Warrant Shares in the manner
required pursuant to Section 5(a), then the Holder will have the right to
rescind such exercise.

                  (c) If by the third Trading Day after a Date of Exercise the
Company fails to deliver the required number of Warrant Shares in the manner
required pursuant to Section 5(a), and if after such third Trading Day and prior
to the receipt of such Warrant Shares, the Holder purchases (in an open market
transaction or otherwise) shares of Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a
sale by the Holder of the Warrant Shares which the Holder anticipated receiving
upon such exercise (a "BUY-IN"), then the Company shall (1) pay in cash to the
Holder the amount by which (x) the Holder's total purchase price (including
brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of Common Stock so purchased
exceeds (y) the amount obtained by multiplying (A) the number of Warrant Shares
that the Company was required to deliver to the Holder in connection with the
exercise at issue by (B) the closing sale price of the Common Stock at the time
of the obligation giving rise to such purchase obligation and (2) at the option
of the Holder, either reinstate the portion of the Warrant and equivalent number
of Warrant Shares for which such exercise was not honored or deliver to the
Holder the number of shares of Common Stock that would have been issued had the
Company timely complied with its exercise and delivery obligations hereunder.
The Holder shall provide the Company written notice and supporting documentation
indicating the amounts payable to the Holder in respect of the Buy-In.


                                       4


<PAGE>

                  (d) The Company's obligations to issue and deliver Warrant
Shares in accordance with the terms hereof are absolute and unconditional,
irrespective of any action or inaction by the Holder to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent with respect to any provision hereof, the recovery of any
judgment against any Person or any action to enforce the same, or any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, limitation or termination, or any breach or alleged
breach by the Holder or any other Person of any obligation to the Company or any
violation or alleged violation of law by the Holder or any other Person, and
irrespective of any other circumstance which might otherwise limit such
obligation of the Company to the Holder in connection with the issuance of
Warrant Shares. Nothing herein shall limit a Holder's right to pursue any other
remedies available to it hereunder, at law or in equity including, without
limitation, a decree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief with
respect to the Company's failure to timely deliver certificates representing
Warrant Shares upon exercise of the Warrant as required pursuant to the terms
hereof.

         6. CHARGES, TAXES AND EXPENSES. Issuance and delivery of Warrant Shares
upon exercise of this Warrant shall be made without charge to the Holder for any
issue or transfer tax, withholding tax, transfer agent fee or other incidental
tax or expense in respect of the issuance of such certificates, all of which
taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company; provided, however, that the
Company shall not be required to pay any tax which may be payable in respect of
any transfer involved in the registration of any certificates for Warrant Shares
or Warrants in a name other than that of the Holder. The Holder shall be
responsible for all other tax liability that may arise as a result of holding or
transferring this Warrant or receiving Warrant Shares upon exercise hereof.

         7. REPLACEMENT OF WARRANT. If this Warrant is mutilated, lost, stolen
or destroyed, the Company shall issue or cause to be issued in exchange and
substitution for and upon cancellation hereof, or in lieu of and substitution
for this Warrant, a New Warrant, but only upon receipt of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to the Company of such loss, theft or destruction and customary and
reasonable indemnity (which shall not include a surety bond), if requested.
Applicants for a New Warrant under such circumstances shall also comply with
such other reasonable regulations and procedures and pay such other reasonable
third-party costs as the Company may prescribe. If a New Warrant is requested as
a result of a mutilation of this Warrant, then the Holder shall deliver such
mutilated Warrant to the Company as a condition precedent to the Company's
obligation to issue the New Warrant.

         8. RESERVATION OF WARRANT SHARES. The Company covenants that it will at
all times reserve and keep available out of the aggregate of its authorized but
unissued and otherwise unreserved Common Stock, solely for the purpose of
enabling it to issue Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant as herein
provided, the number of Warrant Shares which are then issuable and deliverable
upon the exercise of this entire Warrant, free from preemptive rights or any
other contingent purchase rights of Persons other than the Holder (taking into
account the adjustments and restrictions of SECTION 9). The Company covenants
that all Warrant Shares so issuable and deliverable shall, upon issuance and the
payment of the applicable Exercise Price in accordance with the terms hereof, be
duly and validly authorized, issued and fully paid and nonassessable.


                                       5


<PAGE>

         9. CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. The Exercise Price and number of Warrant Shares
issuable upon exercise of this Warrant are subject to adjustment from time to
time as set forth in this SECTION 9.

                  (a) STOCK DIVIDENDS AND SPLITS. If the Company, at any time
while this Warrant is outstanding, (i) pays a stock dividend on its Common Stock
or otherwise makes a distribution on any class of capital stock that is payable
in shares of Common Stock, (ii) subdivides outstanding shares of Common Stock
into a larger number of shares, or (iii) combines outstanding shares of Common
Stock into a smaller number of shares, then in each such case the Exercise Price
shall be multiplied by a fraction of which the numerator shall be the number of
shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately before such event and of which
the denominator shall be the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding
immediately after such event. Any adjustment made pursuant to clause (i) of this
paragraph shall become effective immediately after the payment of the dividend
or the making of the distribution, and any adjustment pursuant to clause (ii) or
(iii) of this paragraph shall become effective immediately after the effective
date of such subdivision or combination.

                  (b) FUNDAMENTAL TRANSACTIONS. If, at any time while this
Warrant is outstanding there is a Fundamental Transaction, then the Holder shall
have the right thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the same
amount and kind of securities, cash or property as it would have been entitled
to receive upon the occurrence of such Fundamental Transaction if it had been,
immediately prior to such Fundamental Transaction, the holder of the number of
Warrant Shares then issuable upon exercise in full of this Warrant (the
"ALTERNATE CONSIDERATION"). For purposes of any such exercise, the determination
of the Exercise Price shall be appropriately adjusted to apply to such Alternate
Consideration based on the amount of Alternate Consideration issuable in respect
of one share of Common Stock in such Fundamental Transaction, and the Company
shall apportion the Exercise Price among the Alternate Consideration in a
reasonable manner reflecting the relative value of any different components of
the Alternate Consideration. If holders of Common Stock are given any choice as
to the securities, cash or property to be received in a Fundamental Transaction,
then the Holder shall be given the same choice as to the Alternate Consideration
it receives upon any exercise of this Warrant following such Fundamental
Transaction. At the Holder's option and request, any successor to the Company or
surviving entity in such Fundamental Transaction shall, either (1) issue to the
Holder a new warrant substantially in the form of this Warrant and consistent
with the foregoing provisions and evidencing the Holder's right to purchase the
Alternate Consideration for the aggregate Exercise Price upon exercise thereof,
or (2) purchase the Warrant from the Holder for a purchase price, payable in
cash within five Trading Days after such request (or, if later, on the effective
date of the Fundamental Transaction), equal to the Black Scholes value of the
remaining unexercised portion of this Warrant on the date of such request. The
terms of any agreement pursuant to which a Fundamental Transaction is effected
shall include terms requiring any such successor or surviving entity to comply
with the provisions of this paragraph (b) and insuring that the Warrant (or any
such replacement security) will be similarly adjusted upon any subsequent
transaction analogous to a Fundamental Transaction.


                                       6


<PAGE>

                  (c) NUMBER OF WARRANT SHARES. Simultaneously with any
adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this Section 9, the number of
Warrant Shares that may be purchased upon exercise of this Warrant shall be
increased or decreased proportionately, so that after such adjustment the
aggregate Exercise Price payable hereunder for the adjusted number of Warrant
Shares shall be the same as the aggregate Exercise Price in effect immediately
prior to such adjustment.

                  (d) CALCULATIONS. All calculations under this SECTION 9 shall
be made to the nearest cent or the nearest 1/100th of a share, as applicable.
The number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at any given time shall not
include shares owned or held by or for the account of the Company, and the
disposition of any such shares shall be considered an issue or sale of Common
Stock.

                  (e) NOTICE OF ADJUSTMENTS. Upon the occurrence of each
adjustment pursuant to this SECTION 9, the Company at its expense will promptly
compute such adjustment in accordance with the terms of this Warrant and prepare
a certificate setting forth such adjustment, including a statement of the
adjusted Exercise Price and adjusted number or type of Warrant Shares or other
securities issuable upon exercise of this Warrant (as applicable), describing
the transactions giving rise to such adjustments and showing in detail the facts
upon which such adjustment is based. Upon written request, the Company will
promptly deliver a copy of each such certificate to the Holder and to the
Company's Transfer Agent.

                  (f) NOTICE OF CORPORATE EVENTS. If the Company (i) declares a
dividend or any other distribution of cash, securities or other property in
respect of its Common Stock, including without limitation any granting of rights
or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any capital stock of the Company or any
Subsidiary, (ii) authorizes or approves, enters into any agreement contemplating
or solicits stockholder approval for any Fundamental Transaction or (iii)
authorizes the voluntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the affairs
of the Company, then the Company shall deliver to the Holder a notice describing
the material terms and conditions of such transaction (but only to the extent
such disclosure would not result in the dissemination of material, non-public
information to the Holder) at least 10 calendar days prior to the applicable
record or effective date on which a Person would need to hold Common Stock in
order to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction, and the
Company will take all steps reasonably necessary in order to insure that the
Holder is given the practical opportunity to exercise this Warrant prior to such
time so as to participate in or vote with respect to such transaction; provided,
however, that the failure to deliver such notice or any defect therein shall not
affect the validity of the corporate action required to be described in such
notice.

         10. PAYMENT OF EXERCISE PRICE. The Holder may pay the Exercise Price in
one of the following manners:

                  (a) CASH EXERCISE. The Holder may deliver immediately
available funds; or

                  (b) CASHLESS EXERCISE. The Holder may notify the Company in an
Exercise Notice of its election to utilize cashless exercise, in which event the
Company shall issue to the Holder the number of Warrant Shares determined as
follows:


                                       7


<PAGE>

                                    X = Y [(A-B)/A]

                           where:

                                    X = the number of Warrant Shares to be
                                    issued to the Holder.

                                    Y = the number of Warrant Shares with
                                    respect to which this Warrant is being
                                    exercised.

                                    A = the average of the closing sale prices
                                    for the five Trading Days immediately prior
                                    to (but not including) the Exercise Date.

                                    B = the Exercise Price.

For purposes of Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, it is intended,
understood and acknowledged that the Warrant Shares issued in a cashless
exercise transaction shall be deemed to have been acquired by the Holder, and
the holding period for the Warrant Shares shall be deemed to have commenced, on
the date this Warrant was originally issued.

         11. LIMITATIONS ON EXERCISE. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained herein, the number of Warrant Shares that may be acquired by the
Holder upon any exercise of this Warrant (or otherwise in respect hereof) shall
be limited to the extent necessary to insure that, following such exercise (or
other issuance), the total number of shares of Common Stock then beneficially
owned by such Holder and its Affiliates and any other Persons whose beneficial
ownership of Common Stock would be aggregated with the Holder's for purposes of
Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act, does not exceed 9.999% of the total number of
issued and outstanding shares of Common Stock (including for such purpose the
shares of Common Stock issuable upon such exercise). For such purposes,
beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
Exchange Act and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder. This
provision shall not restrict the number of shares of Common Stock which a Holder
may receive or beneficially own in order to determine the amount of securities
or other consideration that such Holder may receive in the event of a
Fundamental Transaction as contemplated in Section 9 of this Warrant. This
restriction may not be waived.

         12. NO FRACTIONAL SHARES. No fractional shares of Warrant Shares will
be issued in connection with any exercise of this Warrant. In lieu of any
fractional shares which would, otherwise be issuable, the Company shall pay cash
equal to the product of such fraction multiplied by the closing sale price of
one Warrant Share as reported by the applicable Trading Market on the date of
exercise.

         13. NOTICES. Any and all notices or other communications or deliveries
hereunder (including, without limitation, any Exercise Notice) shall be in
writing and shall be deemed given and effective on the earliest of (i) the date
of transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at
the facsimile number specified in this Section prior to 6:30 p.m. (New York City
time) on a Trading Day, (ii) the next Trading Day after the date of
transmission, if such notice or communication is delivered via facsimile at the
facsimile number specified in this Section on a day that is not a Trading Day or
later than 6:30 p.m. (New York City time) on any Trading Day, (iii) the Trading
Day following the date of mailing, if sent by nationally recognized overnight
courier service, or (iv) upon actual receipt by the party to whom such notice is
required to be given. The addresses for such communications shall be: (i) if to
the Company, to Emrise Corporation, Attn: President, or to Facsimile No.: (909)


                                       8

987-9228 (or such other address as the Company shall indicate in writing in
accordance with this Section), or (ii) if to the Holder, to the address or
facsimile number appearing on the Warrant Register or such other address or
facsimile number as the Holder may provide to the Company in accordance with
this Section.

         14. WARRANT AGENT. The Company shall serve as warrant agent under this
Warrant. Upon 10 days' notice to the Holder, the Company may appoint a new
warrant agent. Any corporation into which the Company or any new warrant agent
may be merged or any corporation resulting from any consolidation to which the
Company or any new warrant agent shall be a party or any corporation to which
the Company or any new warrant agent transfers substantially all of its
corporate trust or shareholders services business shall be a successor warrant
agent under this Warrant without any further act. Any such successor warrant
agent shall promptly cause notice of its succession as warrant agent to be
mailed (by first class mail, postage prepaid) to the Holder at the Holder's last
address as shown on the Warrant Register.

         15. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a) This Warrant shall be binding on and inure to the benefit
of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns. Subject to
the preceding sentence, nothing in this Warrant shall be construed to give to
any Person other than the Company and the Holder any legal or equitable right,
remedy or cause of action under this Warrant. This Warrant may be amended only
in writing signed by the Company and the Holder and their successors and
assigns.

                  (b) All questions concerning the construction, validity,
enforcement and interpretation of this Warrant shall be governed by and
construed and enforced in accordance with the internal laws of the State of New
York (except for matters governed by corporate law in the State of Delaware),
without regard to the principles of conflicts of law thereof. Each party agrees
that all legal proceedings concerning the interpretations, enforcement and
defense of this Warrant and the transactions herein contemplated ("PROCEEDINGS")
(whether brought against a party hereto or its respective Affiliates, employees
or agents) shall be commenced exclusively in the New York Courts. Each party
hereto hereby irrevocably submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the New York
Courts for the adjudication of any dispute hereunder or in connection herewith
or with any transaction contemplated hereby or discussed herein, and hereby

any and all right to trial by jury in any legal proceeding arising out of or
relating to this Warrant or the transactions contemplated hereby. If either
