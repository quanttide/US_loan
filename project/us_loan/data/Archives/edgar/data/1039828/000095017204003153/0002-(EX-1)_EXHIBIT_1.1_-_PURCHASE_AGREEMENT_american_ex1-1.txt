Ladies and Gentlemen:

          American Equity Investment Life Holding Company, an Iowa corporation
(the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein, to issue and sell to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (the "Initial
Purchaser") $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Contingent
Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024 (the "Securities"). The Securities will be
issued as a separate series pursuant to the Indenture (the "Base Indenture")
dated as of December 6, 2004 between the Company and U.S. Bank National
Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First
Supplemental Indenture (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and together with
the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), to be dated as of the Closing Date (as
defined in Section 2 hereof), between the Company and the Trustee.

          The Securities will be convertible into cash and shares of common
stock of the Company, $1.00 par value ("Common Stock"). The shares of Common
Stock into which the Securities may be convertible are referred to herein as
the "Underlying Securities".

          The sale of the Securities and the Underlying Securities will be made
without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchaser has advised the Company that the
Initial Purchaser will offer and sell the Securities purchased by it hereunder
(the "Offering") in accordance with Section 3 hereof as soon as it deems
advisable.

          In connection with the Offering, the Company has prepared a
supplement dated December 23, 2004 (the "Supplement") to the final Offering
Memorandum dated December 1, 2004 (including the information incorporated by
reference therein and together with the Supplement, the "Offering Memorandum").
The Offering Memorandum sets forth or incorporates by reference certain
information regarding the Company, the Securities and the Underlying
Securities. The Company hereby confirms that it has authorized the use of the
Offering Memorandum, and any amendment or supplement thereto, in connection
with the Offering. Unless stated to the contrary, all references herein to the
Offering Memorandum are to the Offering Memorandum at the date thereof and are
not meant to include any amendment or supplement, or any information
incorporated by reference therein subsequent to the date thereof, and any
references herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with
respect to the Offering Memorandum shall be deemed to refer to and include any
information filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), subsequent to the date of the Offering Memorandum which is
incorporated by reference therein.

          In connection with the Offering , the Company also proposes to enter
into a Registration Rights Agreement, to be dated as of the Closing Date,
between the Company and the Initial Purchaser (the "Registration Rights
Agreement").

          In consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein and of the
interests of the parties in the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties

     and the applicable rules and regulations thereunder as in effect at such
     time; the Offering Memorandum and any amendment or supplement thereto do
     not contain, and at the Closing Date will not contain, any untrue
     statement of a material fact, and do not omit to state, and at the Closing

     Agreement) under the Securities Act and the qualification of the Indenture
     under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture
     Act"), in each case as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement,
     and (ii) such additional steps as may be necessary to qualify the
     Securities for public offering by the Initial Purchaser under state
     securities or "Blue Sky" laws; provided that the Company makes no such
     representation and warranty as it relates to the representations,
     warranties and agreements of the Initial Purchaser set forth in Section 3
     of this Agreement.

          (t)  each of the Company and each Subsidiary that is engaged in the
     business of insurance or reinsurance (collectively, the "INSURANCE
     SUBSIDIARIES") is in compliance with the requirements of the insurance
     laws and regulations of its respective jurisdiction of organization or
     incorporation, as the case may be, and the insurance laws and regulations
     of other jurisdictions which are applicable to it, and has filed all
     notices, reports, documents or other information required to be filed
     thereunder, in each case, with such exceptions as would not reasonably be
     expected to result in a Material Adverse Change; neither the Company nor
     any Insurance Subsidiary has received any notification from any insurance
     regulatory authority to the effect that any additional authorization,
     approval, order, consent, license, certificate, permit, registration or

     Approvals would result in a Material Adverse Change;

          (u)  each of the Insurance Subsidiaries holds such insurance licenses,
     certificates and permits from governmental authorities (including, without
     limitation, from the insurance regulatory agencies of the various
     jurisdictions where it conducts business (the "INSURANCE LICENSES")) as
     are material to the conduct of its business as described in the Offering
     Memorandum; the Company and each Insurance Subsidiary have fulfilled and
     performed all obligations necessary to maintain such Insurance Licenses;
     there is no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened
     action, suit, proceeding or investigation that would reasonably be
     expected to result in the revocation, termination or suspension of any
     Insurance License that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
     the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Change; no insurance
     regulatory agency or body has issued, or commenced any proceeding for the
     issuance of, any order or decree impairing, restricting or prohibiting the
     payment of dividends by any Insurance Subsidiary to its parent;

     Subsidiary is in violation of, or in default in the performance,
     observance or fulfillment of, any obligation, agreement, covenant or
     condition contained therein, except where the failure to be in full force
     and effect or where such violation or default would not, individually or
     in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
     Change. No Insurance Subsidiary has received any notice from any of the
     other parties to such treaties, contracts or agreements that such other
     party intends not to perform such treaty and, to the best knowledge of the
     Company, none of the other parties to such treaties or arrangements will
     be unable to perform such treaty or arrangement except to the extent
     adequately and properly reserved for in the audited consolidated financial
     statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the
     Offering Memorandum, except where such nonperformance would not reasonably
     be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
     Adverse Change;

          (w)  the statutory financial statements of the Insurance Subsidiaries,
     from which certain data included in the Offering Memorandum have been
     derived, have been prepared, for each relevant period, in conformity with
     SAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except
     (1) as may otherwise be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and (2)
     in the case of any such financial statements for periods less than a full
     year, for any normal year-end adjustments, and present fairly in all
     material respects the statutory financial position of the Insurance
     Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the statutory basis results of
     operations of the Insurance Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby.

          (x)  the Company and each of the Subsidiaries hold all material
     licenses, certificates and permits from governmental authorities which are

     proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures) and other
     intellectual property rights ("Intellectual Property") necessary to carry
     on their business in all material respects; none of the Company or any of
     the Subsidiaries has received notice of any infringement of or conflict
     with, any Intellectual Property of any other person or entity, except to
     the extent that such infringement or conflict if determined adversely to
     the Company or such Subsidiary would not reasonably be expected to result
     in a Material Adverse Change;

          (z)  neither the Company nor, to the best of the Company's knowledge,
     any of its affiliates, has taken or may take, directly or indirectly, any

     might reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or
     manipulation of the price of the Securities to facilitate the sale or
     resale of the Securities;

          (aa) the Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and
     sale of the Securities contemplated hereunder and the application of the
     net proceeds from such sale as described in the Offering Memorandum will
     not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is
     defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
     Company Act");

          (bb) the Company and each of the Subsidiaries maintain a system of
     internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
     that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general

     accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets;
     (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
     general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for
     assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and
     appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences;

          (cc) the Company and the Subsidiaries comply with all Environmental
     Laws (as defined below), except to the extent that failure to comply with
     such Environmental Laws would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
     reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Change; none of the
     Company or any of the Subsidiaries is the subject of any pending or, to
     the best knowledge of the Company, threatened federal, state or local
     investigation evaluating whether any remedial action by the Company or any
     of the Subsidiaries is needed to respond to a release of any Hazardous
     Materials (as defined below) into the environment resulting from the
     Company's or any of the Subsidiaries' business operations or ownership or
     possession of any of their properties or assets, or is in contravention of
     any Environmental Law that could reasonably be expected, individually or
     in the aggregate, to result in any Material Adverse Change; none of the
     Company or any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim, nor
     are there pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened
     lawsuits against them, with respect to violations of an Environmental Law
     or in connection with any release of any Hazardous Material into the
     environment that could reasonably be expected in the aggregate to result
     in a Material Adverse Change; as used herein, "Environmental Laws" means
     any federal, state or local law or regulation applicable to the Company's
     or any of the Subsidiaries' business operation or ownership or possession
     of any of their properties or assets relating to environmental matters,
     and "Hazardous Materials" means those substances that are regulated by or
     form the basis of liability under any Environmental Laws;

          (dd) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries carry, or are covered
     by, insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as is generally
     deemed adequate for the conduct of their respective businesses as
     presently conducted and the value of their respective properties and as is
     customary for companies engaged in similar businesses;

          (ee) the Company and each Subsidiary are in compliance in all
     material respects with all presently applicable provisions of the Employee
     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the
     regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("ERISA"); no
     "reportable event" (as defined in ERISA) has occurred with respect to any
     "pension plan" (as defined in ERISA) for which the Company or any
     Subsidiary would have any material liability; neither the Company nor any
     Subsidiary has incurred or expects to incur any material liability under

     "Affiliate"), nor any person acting on its or their behalf (other than the

     representation) has, directly or indirectly, made offers or sales of any

     Act) in connection with any offer or sale of the Securities or the

     certifications; and

          (ll) except as disclosed in the Offering Memorandum, no holder of
     securities of the Company (other than the Registrable Securities (as

     be filed by the Company pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement.

     2.   PURCHASE, SALE AND DELIVERY OF THE SECURITIES.
          ---------------------------------------------

          (a)  On the basis of the representations, warranties and covenants
     herein contained, and subject to the conditions herein set forth, the
     Company agrees to issue and sell to the Initial Purchaser and the Initial
     Purchaser agrees to purchase from the Company, at a purchase price of 105%
     of the aggregate principal amount thereof (the "Purchase Price"), plus
     accrued interest from December 6, 2004 to the Closing Date, the
     Securities. Each Security will be convertible at the option of the holder
     into a combination of cash and the Underlying Securities at the conversion
     price set forth in the Securities (the "Conversion Price"), which
     Conversion Price is subject to adjustment in certain events as provided in
     the Securities and the Indenture. One or more global securities
     representing the Securities shall be registered by the Trustee in the name
     of the nominee of The Depository Trust Company ("DTC"), Cede & Co.,
     credited to the account of the Initial Purchaser, and deposited with the
     Trustee as custodian for DTC on the Closing Date, against payment by or on
     behalf of the Initial Purchaser to the account of the Company of the
     aggregate Purchase Price therefor by wire transfer in immediately
     available funds. Delivery of and payment for the Securities shall be made
     at the offices of Davis Polk & Wardwell, 450 Lexington Avenue, New York,
     New York 10017 at 9:30 A.M., New York City time, on the fourth full
     business day following the date of this Agreement, or at such other place,
     time or date not later than five business days thereafter as the Initial
     Purchaser and the Company may agree upon. Such time and date of delivery
     against payment are herein referred to as the "Closing Date". (As used
     herein, "business day" means a day on which the New York Stock Exchange is
     open for trading and on which banks in New York are open for business and
     are not permitted by law or executive order to be closed.)

     3.   OFFERING BY THE INITIAL PURCHASER.
          ---------------------------------

          (a)  It is understood that the Initial Purchaser will offer and sell
     the Securities in accordance with this Section as soon as the Initial
     Purchaser deems it advisable to do so. The Securities are to be initially
     offered at the offering price set forth in the Offering Memorandum. The
     Initial Purchaser may from time to time thereafter change the price and
     other selling terms.

          (b)  The Initial Purchaser understands and acknowledges that the
     Securities and the Underlying Securities have not been and will not be
     registered under the Securities Act (except as contemplated by the
     Registration Rights Agreement) and may not be offered or sold, except in
     compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or
     pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
     registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Initial
     Purchaser agrees that it has solicited and will solicit offers for the
     Securities only from, and has offered and sold and will offer, sell or
     deliver the Securities only to persons that it reasonably believes to be
     qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the
     Securities Act.

          (c)  The Initial Purchaser agrees that neither it nor any person
     acting on its behalf has engaged or will engage in any form of general
     solicitation or general advertising (as those terms are used in Rule
     502(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act) in connection with any
     offer or sale of the Securities in the United States.

          (d)  The Initial Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that
     it is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A
     under the Securities Act.

     4.   COVENANTS OF THE COMPANY.
          ------------------------

          The Company covenants and agrees with the Initial Purchaser that:

          (a)  The Company will furnish to the Initial Purchaser and counsel for
     the Initial Purchaser, without charge, during the period mentioned in
     paragraph (d) below, as many copies of the Offering Memorandum, any
     documents incorporated by reference therein and any supplements or
     amendments thereto as they may reasonably request.

          (b)  The Company will not amend or supplement the Offering Memorandum,
     other than by filing documents under the Exchange Act which are
     incorporated by reference therein, and prior to the completion of the
     distribution of the Securities by the Initial Purchaser, the Company will
     not file any document under the Exchange Act which is incorporated by
     reference in the Offering Memorandum, unless the Initial Purchaser
     previously has been advised of and furnished with a copy within a
     reasonable period of time prior to the proposed filing and the Initial
     Purchaser shall have given its consent to such filing, such consent not to
     be unreasonably withheld. The Company will prepare promptly upon request
     by the Initial Purchaser or counsel for the Initial Purchaser any
     amendments or supplements to the Offering Memorandum that may be necessary
     or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Securities by the
     Initial Purchaser. The Company will advise the Initial Purchaser of the
     time when any amendment or supplement to the Offering Memorandum has been
     made or when any document filed under the Exchange Act which is
     incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum has been filed with
     the Commission and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Initial
     Purchaser of each such amendment, supplement or filing.

          (c)  The Company will cooperate with the Initial Purchaser in
     endeavoring to qualify the Securities for sale under the securities laws
     of such jurisdictions as the Initial Purchaser may reasonably have
     designated in writing and will make such applications, file such documents
     and furnish such information as may be reasonably required for that
     purpose; provided that the Company shall not be required to qualify as a
     foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in
     any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or required to file such
     a consent or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in
     any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company
     will, from time to time, prepare and file such statements, reports and
     other documents, as are or may be required to continue such qualifications
     in effect for so long a period as the Initial Purchaser may reasonably
     request for distribution of the Securities.

          (d)  If at any time prior to the date on which all of the Securities
     shall have been sold by the Initial Purchaser, any event shall occur as a
     result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable
     opinion of the Initial Purchaser, it becomes necessary to amend or
     supplement the Offering Memorandum in order to make the statements
     therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the
     Offering Memorandum to comply with applicable law, the Company promptly
     will prepare an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Offering
     Memorandum so that the Offering Memorandum as so amended or supplemented
     will not contain statements that, in the light of the circumstances under
     which they were made, are misleading, or so that the Offering Memorandum
     will comply with applicable law.

          (e)  The Company will not, without the prior written consent of
     Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., directly or indirectly offer, sell, pledge,
     contract to sell (including any short sale), grant any option to purchase
     or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock or enter into any
     Hedging Transaction (as defined below) relating to the Common Stock for a
     period from the date hereof until and including the date that is 90 days
     after the date of this Agreement. "Hedging Transaction" means any short
     sale (whether or not against the box) or any purchase, sale or grant of
     any right (including, without limitation, any put or call option) with
     respect to any security (other than a broad-based market basket or index)
     that includes, relates to or derives any significant part of its value
     from the Common Stock. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (A) the
     sale of the Securities under this Agreement, (B) the issuance by the
     Company of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Securities
     pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, (C) the issuance by the Company of
     shares of Common Stock, stock appreciation rights or common stock
     equivalents or warrants, rights or options to purchase any of the
     foregoing pursuant to any employee, officer or director stock option plan
     or other benefit plan in effect on the date hereof (D) the issuance by the
     Company of any shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an option,
     warrant or management subscription right or the conversion of a security,
     in each case, outstanding on the date hereof, or (E) the filing of shelf
     registration statements in respect of the Securities and shares of Common
     Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities pursuant to the terms of
     the Registration Rights Agreement or any registration statement in respect
     of any employee, officer or director stock option or other benefit plan.

          (f)  The Company will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates
     to, resell any Securities that have been acquired by any of them.

          (g)  Except as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement,
     neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any person acting on
     its behalf will, directly or indirectly, make offers or sales of any
     security, or solicit offers to buy any security, under circumstances that
     would require the registration of the Securities or the Underlying
     Securities under the Securities Act.

          (h)  Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates nor any person
     acting on its behalf will engage in any form of general solicitation or
     general advertising (as those terms are used in Rule 502(c) of Regulation
     D under the Securities Act) in connection with any offer or sale of the
     Securities in the United States.

          (i)  So long as any of the Securities or the Underlying Securities are
     "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
     Securities Act, the Company will, during any period in which it is not
     subject to and in compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
     or exempt from such reporting requirements pursuant to and in compliance
     with Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, provide to each holder of such
     restricted securities and to each prospective purchaser (as designated by
     such holder) of such restricted securities, upon the request of such
     holder or prospective purchaser, any information required to be provided
     by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. This covenant is intended to
     be for the benefit of the holders, and the prospective purchasers
     designated by such holders, from time to time of such restricted
     securities.

          (j)  The Company will cooperate with the Initial Purchaser and use its
     best efforts to (x) permit the Securities to be eligible for clearance and
     settlement through DTC and (y) arrange to have the Securities be
     designated by Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. as PORTAL-eligible securities in
     accordance with the rules and regulations of the National Association of
     Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD").

          (k)  The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Underlying
     Securities to be duly authorized for listing by the New York Stock
     Exchange on or prior to the Closing Date and ensure that the Underlying
     Securities remain authorized for listing following the Closing Date for so
     long as the Common Stock is so listed.

          (l)  The Company shall apply the net proceeds of its sale of the
     Securities as set forth in the Offering Memorandum.

          (m)  The Company shall not invest, or otherwise use the proceeds
     received by the Company from its sale of the Securities in such a manner
     as would require the Company to register as an "investment company" under
     the Investment Company Act.

          (n)  The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action
     designed to cause or result in, or that has constituted or might
     reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of
     the price of any securities of the Company.

          (o)  For so long as any Securities remain outstanding, the Company
     will furnish to the Initial Purchaser copies of all reports and other
     communications (financial or otherwise) furnished by the Company to the
     Trustee or the holders of the Securities and, as soon as available, copies
     of any reports or financial statements furnished to or filed by the
     Company with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which
     any class of securities of the Company may be listed; provided, however,
     that the Company shall not be required to provide the Initial Purchaser
     with any such reports or similar forms that have been filed with the
     Commission by electronic transmission pursuant to EDGAR.

     5.   COSTS AND EXPENSES.
          ------------------

          The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: accounting fees of the
Company; the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of
printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Initial Purchaser copies of
the Offering Memorandum and any supplements or amendments thereto and the
printing and production of all other documents connected with the transactions
contemplated herein (including this Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration
Rights Agreement and any other related agreements); the listing fee of the New
York Stock Exchange; the expenses arising from having the Securities designated
as eligible for trading in the PORTAL market; the expenses associated with the

the Offering (other than advertising costs and expenses that the Initial
Purchaser expressly agrees to pay); and the expenses, including the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Initial Purchaser, incurred in
connection with the qualification of the Securities under state securities or
"Blue Sky" laws. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of
the Initial Purchaser's expenses (other than those related to qualification
under state securities or "Blue Sky" laws) except that, if this Agreement shall
not be consummated because the conditions in Section 6 hereof are not
satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Initial Purchaser
pursuant to Section 9 hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability
on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition
of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be
performed, unless such failure, refusal or inability is due primarily to the
default or omission of the Initial Purchaser, the Company shall reimburse the
Initial Purchaser for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and
disbursements of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Initial Purchaser,
reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing
to market the Securities or in contemplation of performing their obligations
hereunder; but the Company shall not in any event be liable to the Initial
Purchaser for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale
by the Initial Purchaser of the Securities.

     the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any of the
     Company's securities or the rating of any Subsidiary by any "nationally
     recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined for

     7.   Indemnification.
          ---------------

          (a)  The Company agrees:

               (i)   to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchaser and
          the affiliates, directors, officers and employees of the Initial
          Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls the Initial Purchaser
          within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
          Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages
          or liabilities to which the Initial Purchaser or any such affiliate,
          director, officer or employee or such controlling person may become
          subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such
          losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
          respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (x) any untrue
          statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
          the Offering Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto, or
          (y) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
          necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
          circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
          however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
          extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
          or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
          omission or alleged omission made in the Offering Memorandum, or any
          amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity
          with written information furnished to the Company by any Initial
          Purchaser specifically for use in the preparation thereof; or

               (ii)  to reimburse the Initial Purchaser and each such affiliate,
          director, officer and employee and each such controlling person upon
          demand for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably
          incurred by the Initial Purchaser, such affiliate, director, officer
          or employee or such controlling person in connection with
          investigating or defending or appearing as a third-party witness in
          connection with any such loss, claim, damage or liability, action or
          proceeding or in responding to a subpoena or governmental inquiry
          related to the Offering, whether or not the Initial Purchaser or any
          such controlling person is a party to any action or proceeding. In
          the event that it is finally judicially determined that the Initial
          Purchaser was not entitled to receive payments for legal and other
          expenses pursuant to this subparagraph, the Initial Purchaser will
          promptly return all sums that had been advanced pursuant hereto.

          (b)  The Initial Purchaser agrees, to indemnify and hold harmless the
     Company, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any,
     who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
     Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses,
     claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director,
     officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act
     or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
     actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
     (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
     contained in the Offering Memorandum or any amendment or supplement
     thereto, or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a
     material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
     the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will
     reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company
     or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with
     investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action
     or proceeding; provided, however, that the Initial Purchaser will be
     liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
     untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
     omission has been made in the Offering Memorandum or any amendment or
     supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
     information furnished to the Company by any Initial Purchaser specifically
     for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in
     addition to any liability which the Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.

          (c)  In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation)
     shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may
     be sought pursuant to this Section 7, such person (the "indemnified
     party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may
     be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing. No indemnification
     provided for in Section 7(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who
     shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 7(c) if the party to
     whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such
     notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to
     give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve
     the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may
     have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on
     account of the provisions of Section 7(a) or (b). In case any such
     proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall
     notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
     indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
     extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party
     similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
     satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees
     and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such
     proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
     counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
     indemnifying party shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of
     presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the
     indemnified party in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the
     indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such
     counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any
     impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified
     party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
     inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them
     or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of
     and employ counsel acceptable to the indemnified party within a reasonable
     period of time after notice of commencement of the action. It is
     understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any
     proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for
     the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all
     such indemnified parties. Such firm shall be designated in writing by
     Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in the case of parties indemnified pursuant
     to Section 7(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified
     pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for
     any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but
     if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the
     plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified
     party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement
     or judgment. In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the
     prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or
     consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim,
     action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder
     (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to
     such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or
     consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from
     all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding.

          (d)  To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 7
     is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party
     under Section 7(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages
     or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to
     therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid
     or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
     damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in
     such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
     received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchaser on the
     other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation
     provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by
     applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such
     amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
     appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the
     relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchaser on
     the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
     such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
     respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the
     Initial Purchaser on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
     proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
     expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and
     commissions received by the Initial Purchaser. The relative fault shall be
     determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
     alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
     omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
     Company on the one hand or the Initial Purchaser on the other and the
     parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
     to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the
     Initial Purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if
     contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata
     allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
     account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section.
     The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the
     losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
     respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to
     include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
     indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
     action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d),
     (i) the Initial Purchaser shall not be required to contribute any amount
     in excess of the discounts and commissions applicable to the Securities
     purchased by the Initial Purchaser and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent
     misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
     Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty
     of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

          (e)  In any proceeding relating to the Offering Memorandum or any
     supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may
     be sought under this Section 7 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any
     court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that
     process issuing from such court may be served upon it by any other
     contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees
     that any other contributing party may join it as an additional defendant
     in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.

          (f)  Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an
     indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under
     this Section 7 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified
     party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are
     incurred. A successor to any Initial Purchaser or any affiliate, director,
     officer or employee of the Initial Purchaser or any person controlling any
     Initial Purchaser, or to the Company, any director, officer or employee of
     the Company or any person controlling the Company, shall be entitled to
     the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements
     contained in this Section 7.

          -----------

          (a)  This Agreement may be terminated by the Initial Purchaser by
     notice to the Company at any time prior to the Closing Date if any of the
     following has occurred: (i) since the date as of which information is
     given in the Offering Memorandum, any Material Adverse Change or any
     development involving a prospective Material Adverse Change, whether or
     not arising in the ordinary course of business, (ii) any outbreak or
     escalation of hostilities or declaration of war or national emergency or
     other national or international calamity or crisis or change in economic
     or political conditions if the effect of such outbreak, escalation,
     declaration, emergency, calamity, crisis or change on the financial
     markets of the United States would, in the sole judgment of the Initial
     Purchaser, make it impracticable or inadvisable to market the Securities
     or to enforce contracts for the sale of the Securities, (iii) suspension
     of trading in securities generally on the New York Stock Exchange, the
     American Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq National Market or limitation on
     prices (other than limitations on hours or numbers of days of trading) for
     securities on any such exchange or market, (iv) the enactment,
     publication, decree or other promulgation of any statute, regulation, rule
     or order of any court or other governmental authority which in the opinion
     of the Initial Purchaser materially and adversely affects or may
     materially and adversely affect the business or operations of the Company,
     (v) the declaration of a banking moratorium by United States or New York
     State authorities, (vi) any downgrading, or placement on any watch list
     for possible downgrading, in the rating of any of the Company's debt
     securities by any "nationally recognized statistical rating organization"
     (as defined for purposes of Rule 436(g) under the Exchange Act), (vii) the
     suspension of trading of the Company's common stock by the New York Stock
     Exchange, the Commission, or any other governmental authority, or (viii)
     the taking of any action by any governmental body or agency in respect of
     its monetary or fiscal affairs which in the reasonable opinion of the
     Initial Purchaser has a material adverse effect on the securities markets
     in the United States; or

          (b)  as provided in Section 6 of this Agreement.

to action by the Initial Purchaser), the entirety of the seventh and eighth
