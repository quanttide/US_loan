or reduced to reflect redemptions, transfers or exchanges permitted hereby.

         Holders of the Securities shall have the benefit of the Company's
registration obligations with respect to the Securities as more fully set

Supplemental Indenture or in the Global Security shall for any reason be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,

Supplemental Indenture or of the Global Security, but this Supplemental
Indenture and the Global Security shall be construed as if such invalid or

Beneficial Owner of a Security shall be deemed to agree (i) to treat the cash

regulations, (ii) to accrue interest with respect to outstanding Securities as
original issue discount for United States federal income tax purposes (i.e.
Tax Original Issue Discount) according to the "noncontingent bond method" set
forth in the contingent payment regulations, using the comparable yield of 8%
compounded semi-annually, and (iii) to be bound by the Company's determination
of the "projected payment schedule," within the meaning of the contingent
payment regulations, with respect to the Securities. Holders or Beneficial
Owners may obtain the issue price, amount of Tax Original Issue Discount,

         (1) New Series of Securities.

         This Security shall constitute a new, separate series of Securities
under the Indenture and Holders hereof shall constitute a separate class of
Holders.

         (2) Interest.

         This Security will bear interest from December 6, 2004 or from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for,
semi-annually in arrears on June 6 and December 6 of each year (each, an
"Interest Payment Date"), subject to Section 11.08 of the Indenture,
commencing June 6, 2005. The Company will pay interest on any overdue
principal amount at the interest rate borne by the Securities at the time such
interest on the overdue principal amount accrues, compounded semi-annually,
and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest and Contingent
Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any (without regard to any applicable
grace period), at the same interest rate, compounded semi-annually. Interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) on the
Securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve

Contingent Interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of Securities in
respect of any Contingent Interest Period shall equal 0.50% per annum on the

interest as described above.

         Upon determination that Holders will be entitled to receive
Contingent Interest for a Contingent Interest Period, on or prior to the first
day of such Contingent Interest Period, the Company shall issue a press
release and notify the Trustee promptly in writing.

         (3) Method of Payment.

         The Company will pay interest (including Contingent Interest and
Liquidated Damages, if any) on this Security to the Person who is the
registered Holder of this Security at the close of business on May 20 or
November 20 (each a "Record Date"), as the case may be, immediately preceding
the related Interest Payment Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of the
Redemption Price, Repurchase Price, Change in Control Repurchase Price and the
principal amount at Stated Maturity, as the case may be, to the Holder who
surrenders a Security to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of
the Security. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States
that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private
debts. However, the Company may pay interest (including Contingent Interest
and Liquidated Damages, if any), the Redemption Price, Repurchase Price,
Change in Control Repurchase Price and the principal amount at Stated
Maturity, as the case may be, to a Holder holding Securities in definitive
form by check or wire payable in such money; provided that a Holder holding
Securities in definitive form with an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$1,000,000 may request payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to an account in North America at the election of such Holder. The Company may
mail an interest check to the Holder's registered address. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, so long as this Security is registered in the name of a Depositary
or its nominee, all payments hereon shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee.

         (4) Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar.

         Initially, U.S. Bank National Association (the "Trustee") will act as
Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and
change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice, other
than notice to the Trustee; provided that the Company will maintain at least
one Paying Agent having an office or agency in the State of New York, City of
New York, Borough of Manhattan, which shall initially be an office or agency
of the Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar.

         (5) Indenture.

         The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of
December 6, 2004 ( the "Original Indenture") between the Company and the
Trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as December
30, 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Original
Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of
the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of
the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect
from time to time (the "TIA"). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined
herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are
subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the
TIA for a statement of those terms.

         The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and
may be issued in unlimited principal amount under the Indenture. The Indenture
does not limit other indebtedness of the Company, secured or unsecured.

         (6) Redemption at the Option of the Company.

         No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. Beginning on December
15, 2011 and during the periods thereafter to maturity, the Securities of this
series are redeemable as a whole at any time, or in part from time to time, in
any integral multiple of $1,000, at the option of the Company for cash at a
Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount, together with accrued
but unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if
any) thereon, up to but not including the Redemption Date; provided that, if
the Redemption Date is between the close of business on a Record Date and the
opening of business on the related Interest Payment Date, interest will be
payable to the Holders in whose names the Securities are registered at the
close of business on the relevant Record Date.

         Notice of redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Security will be
mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date
to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered
address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities of
this series (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is
deposited with the Paying Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the Redemption Date, immediately after such Redemption Date, interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) shall cease to
accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations
larger than $1,000 of principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in
integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount.

         (7) Repurchase By the Company at the Option of the Holder on
Specified Dates; Repurchase at the Option of the Holder Upon a Change in
Control.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company
shall become obligated to repurchase, at the option of the Holder, on December
15, 2011, December 15, 2014 and December 15, 2019 (each, a "Repurchase Date"),
all or a portion of the Securities held by such Holder, in any integral
multiple of $1,000, for cash at a price per Security equal to 100% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Security (the "Repurchase Price"), together
with accrued but unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) thereon, up to but not including the Repurchase Date upon
delivery of a Repurchase Notice containing the information set forth in the
Indenture, together with the Securities subject thereto, at any time from the
opening of business on the date that is 30 Business Days prior to such
Repurchase Date until the close of business on the Business Day prior to such
Repurchase Date, and upon delivery of the Securities to the Paying Agent by
the Holder as set forth in the Indenture.

         At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions
of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase the
Securities held by such Holder after the occurrence of a Change in Control of
the Company for a Change in Control Repurchase Price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued but unpaid interest (including
Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) thereon, up to but not
including the Change in Control Repurchase Date which Change in Control
Repurchase Price shall be paid in cash (provided that if the Change in Control
Repurchase Date is between the close of business on a Record Date and the
opening of business on the related Interest Payment Date, accrued but unpaid
interest will be payable to the Holders in whose names the Securities are
registered at the close of business on the relevant Record Date). Holders have
the right to withdraw any Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Repurchase
Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice
of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

         If cash sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price or Change in Control
Repurchase Price, as the case may be, and accrued but unpaid interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) on all
Securities of this series or portions thereof to be repurchased as of the
Repurchase Date or the Change in Control Repurchase Date, as the case may be,
is held by the Paying Agent by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business
Day immediately following the Repurchase Date or the Change in Control
Repurchase Date, interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) shall cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions
thereof) as of such Repurchase Date or Change in Control Repurchase Date, and
the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such, other than the right to
receive the Repurchase Price or Change in Control Repurchase Price, as the
case may be, and interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) upon surrender of such Security.

         (8) Conversion.

         Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 10.01(a) of
the Indenture, a Holder of a Security may convert any portion of the principal
amount of any Security that is an integral multiple of $1,000 into cash and
fully paid and non-assessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the
nearest 1/10000th of a share) of Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.14 of the Indenture; provided that if such Security
is called for redemption, the conversion right will terminate at the close of
business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date
of such Security (unless the Company shall default in making the redemption
payment when due, in which case the conversion right shall terminate at the
close of business on the date such default is cured and such Security is
redeemed). Such conversion right shall commence on the initial issuance date
of the Securities and expire at the close of business on the date of maturity,
subject, in the case of conversion of any Global Security, to any Applicable
Procedures. The Conversion Price shall, as of the date of the Indenture,
initially be $14.47 per share of Common Stock. The Conversion Rate shall, as
of the date of the Indenture, initially be approximately 69.1085. The
Conversion Price and Conversion Rate will be adjusted under the circumstances
specified in the Indenture. Upon conversion, no adjustment for interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) or dividends
will be made. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion; in lieu
thereof, an amount will be paid in cash based upon the Ten Day Average Closing
Stock Price (as defined in the Indenture). Except as provided in Section
10.02(c) of the Indenture, delivery of the Principal Return, Net Shares and
cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be deemed to satisfy the Company's
obligation to pay the principal amount of a converted Security and accrued but
unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any)
thereon. Any accrued interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) payable on a converted Security will be deemed paid in full,
rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited.

         In addition, following certain corporate transactions as set forth in
Sections 10.01(a)(iii)(A) and 10.01(a)(iii)(B) that occur on or prior to
December 15, 2011 and that constitute a Change in Control (other than relating
to the composition of the Board of Directors as described in clause (d) of the
definition of Change in Control in Section 1.01) and for which 10% or more of
the fair market value of the consideration for the Common Stock (as determined
by the Board of Directors) in the corporate transaction consists of (i) cash,
(ii) other property or (iii) securities that are not traded or scheduled to be
traded immediately following such transaction on a U.S. national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, a Holder who elects to convert its
Securities in connection with such corporate transaction will be entitled to
receive Additional Shares of Common Stock upon conversion in certain
circumstances.

         To convert a Security, a Holder must (a) complete and manually sign
the conversion notice set forth below and deliver such notice to the
Conversion Agent, (b) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (c)
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the
Registrar or the Conversion Agent, (d) pay any transfer or other tax, if
required and (e) if the Security is held in book-entry form, complete and
deliver to the Depositary appropriate instructions pursuant to the Applicable
Procedures. If a Holder surrenders a Security for conversion between the close
of business on the Record Date and the opening of business on the related
Interest Payment Date, the Security must be accompanied by payment of an
amount equal to the interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount
of the Security or portion thereof then converted; provided that no such
payment shall be required if such Security has been called for redemption on a
Redemption Date within the period between close of business on such Record
Date and the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date, or if such
Security is surrendered for conversion on the Interest Payment Date. A Holder
may convert a portion of a Security equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple
thereof.

         A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase
Notice or a Change of Control Repurchase Notice exercising the option of such
Holder to require the Company to repurchase such Security as provided in
Section 3.08 or Section 3.09, respectively, of the Indenture may be converted
only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture.

         (9) Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.

         The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 of principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000.
A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture.
The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by
law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange
any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to
be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed), or any
Securities in respect of which a Repurchase Notice or a Change in Control
Repurchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a
Security to be repurchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be
repurchased), or any Securities for a period of 15 days before the mailing of
a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed.

         (10) Persons Deemed Owners.

         The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of
this Security for all purposes.

         (11) Amendment; Waiver.

         Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the
Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities
of this series at the time outstanding and (ii) certain defaults may be waived
with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities of this series at the time outstanding. Subject to
certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any
Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities
(i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, or make any
other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any
material respect, (ii) to comply with Article 5 or Section 10.11 of the
Indenture, (iii) to make provisions with respect to the conversion right of
Holders pursuant to the requirements of Section 10.01 of the Indenture, (iv)
to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture
by a successor Trustee, or (v) to comply with the provisions of the TIA or any
requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture
under the TIA.

         (12) Defaults and Remedies.

         Except as set forth in the Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in
principal amount of Securities of this series then outstanding may declare all
the Securities to be due and payable in the manner, at the time and with the
effect provided in the Indenture. Holders of Securities of this series may not
enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture.
The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless
it has received security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it. The
Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series at
the time outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or
power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Securities notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default (except a default in payment of
principal or interest when due, for any reason) if it determines in good faith
that withholding notice is in the interests of Holders.

         (13) Trustee Dealings with the Company.

         Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under
the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner
or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations
owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the
Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not
Trustee.

         (14) No Recourse Against Others.

         A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company
shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the
Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each
Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

         (15) Ranking.

         The Securities shall be unsecured senior obligations of the Company
and shall rank equally in right of payment with any other existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Company and senior to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Company.

         (16) Authentication.

         This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the
Trustee manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the
other side of this Security.

         (17) Abbreviations.

         Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an
assignee, such as TEN COM ("Tenants In Common"), TEN ENT ("Tenants By The
Entireties"), JT TEN ("Joint Tenants With Right Of Survivorship And Not As
Tenants In Common"), CUST ("Custodian") and U/G/M/A ("Uniform Gift To Minors
Act").

         (18) Governing Law.

         THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN THE INDENTURE AND THIS
SECURITY.

         (19) CUSIP Numbers.

         Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform
Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be
printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities.
No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the
Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers
printed hereon.
