Item 1.01    Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 23, 2004, American Equity Investment Life Holding Company
("AEL") entered into a purchase agreement with Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
(the "Initial Purchaser"), a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 1.1
(the "Purchase Agreement"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, AEL agreed to
sell $10 million aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Contingent
Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the "Notes") to the Initial Purchaser.

         The closing of the sale of the Notes occurred on December 30, 2004.
The Notes were not registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Securities Act"), and were sold to the Initial Purchaser in reliance on
the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act. The initial purchaser of the Notes then sold the Notes to qualified
institutional buyers pursuant to the exemption from registration provided by
Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Company relied on these exemptions
from registration based on representations made by the Initial Purchaser in
the Purchase Agreement.

         The Notes are governed by the terms of an indenture (the "Base
Indenture"), dated December 6, 2004, between AEL and U.S. Bank National
Association, as Trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture
dated December 30, 2004 (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and together with
the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), a copy of which is attached hereto as
Exhibit 4.2. AEL previously issued $250 million aggregate principal amount of
its 5.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Notes due 2024 (the "Outstanding
Notes") pursuant to the Indenture, and the Indenture permits AEL to issue
additional notes from time to time.

         The Notes and the Outstanding Notes constitute separate series of
securities under the Indenture and, accordingly, the holders of the Notes will
constitute a separate class under the Indenture. The Notes will accrue
interest from December 6, 2004. The Notes were offered at a different issue
price than the issue price for the Outstanding Notes and will have a different
projected payment schedule pursuant to which interest will be deemed to accrue
for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

         The Notes are convertible, at the holders' option, prior to the
maturity date into cash and shares of AEL's common stock in the following
circumstances:

     o    during any fiscal quarter commencing after the date of original
          issuance of the Notes, if the closing sale price of AEL's common
          stock for at least 20 trading days in the period of 30 consecutive
          trading days ending on the last trading of the fiscal quarter
          preceding the quarter in which the conversion occurs is more than
          120% of the Conversion Price (as defined below) of the Notes in
          effect on that last trading day;

     o    if AEL has called the particular Notes for redemption and the
          redemption has not yet occurred; or

     o    upon the occurrence of specified corporate transactions.

         Holders may convert any outstanding Notes into cash and shares of
AEL's common stock at an initial "Conversion Price" per share of $14.47. This
represents an initial "Conversion Rate" of approximately 69.1085 shares of
common stock per $1,000 principal amount of Notes. The Conversion Price and
resulting Conversion Rate are subject to adjustment in certain specified
events. Subject to certain exceptions, at the time Notes are tendered for
conversion, the value (the "Conversion Value") of the cash and shares of AEL's
common stock, if any, to be received by a holder converting $1,000 principal
amount of the Notes will be determined by multiplying the Conversion Rate by
the "Ten Day Average Closing Stock Price," which equals the average of the
closing per share prices of AEL's common stock on the New York Stock Exchange
on the ten consecutive trading days beginning on the second trading day
following the day the Notes are submitted for conversion. AEL will deliver the
Conversion Value to holders as follows: (1) an amount in cash (the "Principal
Return") equal to the lesser of (a) the aggregate Conversion Value of the
Notes to be converted or (b) the aggregate principal amount of the Notes to be
converted, (2) if the aggregate Conversion Value of the Notes to be converted
is greater than the Principal Return, an amount in shares (the "Net Shares"),
determined as set forth below, equal to such aggregate Conversion Value less
the Principal Return (the "Net Share Amount") and (3) an amount in cash in
lieu of fractional shares of common stock. AEL will pay the Principal Return
and cash in lieu of fractional shares and deliver the Net Shares, if any, as
promptly as practicable after determination of the Net Share Amount. The
number of Net Shares to be paid will be determined by dividing the Net Share
Amount by the Ten Day Average Closing Stock Price, rounded down to the nearest
whole share.

         The Notes will bear interest at a rate of 5.25 % per annum from
December 6, 2004. AEL will pay interest on the Notes semi-annually in arrears
on June 6 and December 6 of each year, beginning on June 6, 2005. In addition
to regular interest on the Notes, beginning with the six-month interest period
ending June 6, 2012, AEL will also pay contingent interest during any
six-month interest period in which the average trading price per $1,000
principal amount of the Notes for the five-day trading period ending on the
third day immediately preceding the first day of such six-month interest
period equals 120% or more of the principal amount of the Notes. During any
interest period in which contingent interest shall be payable, the contingent
interest payable on the Notes will equal 0.50% per annum based on such average
trading price.

         The Notes will mature on December 6, 2024. AEL may redeem some or all
of the Notes at any time or from time to time on or after December 15, 2011,
at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Notes, plus
accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest and liquidated
damages, if any) up to but not including the date of redemption, payable in
cash. Holders may require AEL to repurchase all or a portion of their Notes on
December 15, 2011, 2014 and 2019 for a repurchase price equal to 100% of the
principal amount of the Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including
contingent interest and liquidated damages, if any) up to but not including
the date of repurchase, payable in cash. Upon a change in control, as defined
in the Indenture, holders will have the right to require AEL to repurchase all
or a portion of their Notes for a period of time after the change of control.
The repurchase price will be equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Notes, plus accrued and unpaid interest (including contingent interest and
liquidated damages, if any) up to but not including the date of repurchase,
payable in cash.

         The Notes will be AEL's senior unsecured obligations and will rank
equally in right of payment with all of AEL's existing and future senior
indebtedness and senior to any existing and future subordinated indebtedness.
The Notes will effectively rank junior in right of payment to any existing and
future secured indebtedness to the extent of the value of the assets securing
such secured indebtedness. The Notes will be structurally subordinated to all
liabilities of AEL's subsidiaries.

         In connection with the sale of the Notes, AEL also entered into a
registration rights agreement, dated December 30, 2004, with the Initial
Purchaser, a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.4 (the
"Registration Rights Agreement"). Pursuant to the Registration Rights
Agreement, AEL has agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the
Securities and Exchange Commission covering resales of the Notes and AEL's
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Notes. If AEL fails to comply
with certain of its obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement, it
will be required to pay liquidated damages to the holders of the Notes.

         The summary of the foregoing transaction is qualified in its entirety
by reference to the text of the related agreements, which are included as
exhibits hereto and are incorporated herein by reference.

Deutsche Bank Securities Inc.
60 Wall Street
New York, New York  10005

Ladies and Gentlemen:

          American Equity Investment Life Holding Company, an Iowa corporation
(the "Company"), proposes, subject to the terms and conditions contained
herein, to issue and sell to Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. (the "Initial
Purchaser") $10,000,000 aggregate principal amount of its 5.25% Contingent
Convertible Senior Notes Due 2024 (the "Securities"). The Securities will be
issued as a separate series pursuant to the Indenture (the "Base Indenture")
dated as of December 6, 2004 between the Company and U.S. Bank National
Association, as trustee (the "Trustee"), as supplemented by the First
Supplemental Indenture (the "First Supplemental Indenture" and together with
the Base Indenture, the "Indenture"), to be dated as of the Closing Date (as
defined in Section 2 hereof), between the Company and the Trustee.

          The Securities will be convertible into cash and shares of common
stock of the Company, $1.00 par value ("Common Stock"). The shares of Common
Stock into which the Securities may be convertible are referred to herein as
the "Underlying Securities".

          The sale of the Securities and the Underlying Securities will be made
without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"), in reliance on exemptions from the registration requirements
of the Securities Act. The Initial Purchaser has advised the Company that the
Initial Purchaser will offer and sell the Securities purchased by it hereunder
(the "Offering") in accordance with Section 3 hereof as soon as it deems
advisable.

          In connection with the Offering, the Company has prepared a
supplement dated December 23, 2004 (the "Supplement") to the final Offering
Memorandum dated December 1, 2004 (including the information incorporated by
reference therein and together with the Supplement, the "Offering Memorandum").
The Offering Memorandum sets forth or incorporates by reference certain
information regarding the Company, the Securities and the Underlying
Securities. The Company hereby confirms that it has authorized the use of the
Offering Memorandum, and any amendment or supplement thereto, in connection
with the Offering. Unless stated to the contrary, all references herein to the
Offering Memorandum are to the Offering Memorandum at the date thereof and are
not meant to include any amendment or supplement, or any information
incorporated by reference therein subsequent to the date thereof, and any
references herein to the terms "amend", "amendment" or "supplement" with
respect to the Offering Memorandum shall be deemed to refer to and include any
information filed under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
"Exchange Act"), subsequent to the date of the Offering Memorandum which is
incorporated by reference therein.

          In connection with the Offering , the Company also proposes to enter
into a Registration Rights Agreement, to be dated as of the Closing Date,
between the Company and the Initial Purchaser (the "Registration Rights
Agreement").

          In consideration of the mutual agreements contained herein and of the
interests of the parties in the transactions contemplated hereby, the parties
hereto agree as follows:

     1.   REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.
          ---------------------------------------------

          The Company represents and warrants to the Initial Purchaser as
follows:

          (a)  the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing as
     a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Iowa, with
     the corporate power and authority to own or lease its properties and
     conduct its business as described in the Offering Memorandum and to enter
     into and perform its obligations under this Agreement; each of the direct
     and indirect subsidiaries of the Company (each, a "Subsidiary" and
     collectively, the "Subsidiaries"), has been duly incorporated or organized
     and is validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
     jurisdiction of its incorporation or organization, with the corporate or
     other power and authority to own or lease its properties and conduct its
     business as described in the Offering Memorandum; the Company and each of
     the Subsidiaries are duly qualified to transact business in all
     jurisdictions in which the conduct of their business requires such
     qualification, except to the extent that the failure to be so qualified
     would not result in a Material Adverse Change (as defined herein);

          (b)  the outstanding shares of capital stock of each of the
     Subsidiaries have been duly authorized and validly issued, are fully paid
     and non-assessable and are owned by the Company or another Subsidiary free
     and clear of all liens, encumbrances and equities and claims, except those
     securing obligations under the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated
     September 22, 2004 among the Company, West Des Moines State Bank, LaSalle
     Bank and U.S. Bank National Association, as agent (the "Credit Agreement")
     or those that are immaterial to the Company and the Subsidiaries taken as
     a whole; and, except as disclosed in the Offering Memorandum, no options,
     warrants or other rights to purchase, agreements or other obligations to
     issue or other rights to convert any obligations into or exchange any
     securities for shares of capital stock of or ownership interests in the
     Subsidiaries are outstanding;

          (c)  the Securities have been duly authorized by all necessary
     corporate action on the part of the Company and, when executed by the
     Company, authenticated by the Trustee in accordance with the terms of the
     Indenture and delivered to and paid for by the Initial Purchaser in
     accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Indenture, the
     Securities will (assuming the Indenture is a valid and binding obligation
     of the Trustee) be valid and binding obligations of the Company,
     enforceable against the Company in accordance with their terms, except to
     the extent that enforcement thereof may be limited by bankruptcy,
     insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, fraudulent conveyance or other
     similar laws now or hereinafter in effect relating to or affecting
     creditors' rights and remedies generally and by equitable principles of
     general applicability (regardless of whether enforceability is considered
     in a proceeding at law or in equity), and will be entitled to the benefits
     of the Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement;

          (d)  the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company have been
     duly authorized and validly issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;
     none of the outstanding shares of capital stock of the Company was issued
     in violation of any preemptive or similar rights of any stockholder of the
     Company; the Underlying Securities have been duly authorized and reserved,
     and when issued upon conversion of the Securities in accordance with the
     terms of the Securities will be validly issued, fully paid and
     non-assessable; and no preemptive or similar rights of stockholders exist
     with respect to any of the Underlying Securities;

          (e)  the execution and delivery of and the performance by the Company
     of its obligations under this Agreement have been duly authorized by all
     necessary corporate action on the part of the Company, and this Agreement
     has been duly executed and delivered by the Company;

          (f)  the execution and delivery of and the performance by the Company
     of its obligations under each of the Base Indenture and the First
     Supplemental Indenture have been duly authorized by all necessary
     corporate action on the part of the Company and, when duly executed and
     delivered by the Company and the Trustee (assuming each of the Base
     Indenture and the First Supplemental Indenture is a valid and binding

     under the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust Indenture
     Act"), in each case as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement,
     and (ii) such additional steps as may be necessary to qualify the
     Securities for public offering by the Initial Purchaser under state
     securities or "Blue Sky" laws; provided that the Company makes no such

     warranties and agreements of the Initial Purchaser set forth in Section 3
     of this Agreement.

          (t)  each of the Company and each Subsidiary that is engaged in the
     business of insurance or reinsurance (collectively, the "INSURANCE
     SUBSIDIARIES") is in compliance with the requirements of the insurance
     laws and regulations of its respective jurisdiction of organization or
     incorporation, as the case may be, and the insurance laws and regulations
     of other jurisdictions which are applicable to it, and has filed all
     notices, reports, documents or other information required to be filed
     thereunder, in each case, with such exceptions as would not reasonably be
     expected to result in a Material Adverse Change; neither the Company nor
     any Insurance Subsidiary has received any notification from any insurance
     regulatory authority to the effect that any additional authorization,
     approval, order, consent, license, certificate, permit, registration or
     qualification ("APPROVALS") is needed to be obtained by the Company or any
     of the Insurance Subsidiaries in any case where it could be reasonably

     Approvals would result in a Material Adverse Change;

          (u)  each of the Insurance Subsidiaries holds such insurance licenses,
     certificates and permits from governmental authorities (including, without
     limitation, from the insurance regulatory agencies of the various
     jurisdictions where it conducts business (the "INSURANCE LICENSES")) as
     are material to the conduct of its business as described in the Offering
     Memorandum; the Company and each Insurance Subsidiary have fulfilled and
     performed all obligations necessary to maintain such Insurance Licenses;
     there is no pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened
     action, suit, proceeding or investigation that would reasonably be
     expected to result in the revocation, termination or suspension of any
     Insurance License that would reasonably be expected to, individually or in
     the aggregate, result in a Material Adverse Change; no insurance
     regulatory agency or body has issued, or commenced any proceeding for the
     issuance of, any order or decree impairing, restricting or prohibiting the
     payment of dividends by any Insurance Subsidiary to its parent;

     Subsidiary is a party are in full force and effect and no Insurance
     Subsidiary is in violation of, or in default in the performance,
     observance or fulfillment of, any obligation, agreement, covenant or
     condition contained therein, except where the failure to be in full force
     and effect or where such violation or default would not, individually or
     in the aggregate, be reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse
     Change. No Insurance Subsidiary has received any notice from any of the
     other parties to such treaties, contracts or agreements that such other
     party intends not to perform such treaty and, to the best knowledge of the
     Company, none of the other parties to such treaties or arrangements will
     be unable to perform such treaty or arrangement except to the extent
     adequately and properly reserved for in the audited consolidated financial
     statements of the Company included or incorporated by reference in the
     Offering Memorandum, except where such nonperformance would not reasonably
     be expected to, individually or in the aggregate, result in a Material
     Adverse Change;

          (w)  the statutory financial statements of the Insurance Subsidiaries,
     from which certain data included in the Offering Memorandum have been
     derived, have been prepared, for each relevant period, in conformity with
     SAP applied on a consistent basis throughout the periods involved, except
     (1) as may otherwise be indicated therein or in the notes thereto and (2)
     in the case of any such financial statements for periods less than a full
     year, for any normal year-end adjustments, and present fairly in all
     material respects the statutory financial position of the Insurance
     Subsidiaries as of the dates thereof, and the statutory basis results of
     operations of the Insurance Subsidiaries for the periods covered thereby.

          (x)  the Company and each of the Subsidiaries hold all material
     licenses, certificates and permits from governmental authorities which are
     necessary to the conduct of their businesses;

     know-how (including trade secrets and other unpatented and unpatentable
     proprietary or confidential information, systems or procedures) and other
     intellectual property rights ("Intellectual Property") necessary to carry
     on their business in all material respects; none of the Company or any of
     the Subsidiaries has received notice of any infringement of or conflict
     with, any Intellectual Property of any other person or entity, except to
     the extent that such infringement or conflict if determined adversely to
     the Company or such Subsidiary would not reasonably be expected to result
     in a Material Adverse Change;

          (z)  neither the Company nor, to the best of the Company's knowledge,
     any of its affiliates, has taken or may take, directly or indirectly, any

     might reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or
     manipulation of the price of the Securities to facilitate the sale or
     resale of the Securities;

          (aa) the Company is not, and after giving effect to the offering and
     sale of the Securities contemplated hereunder and the application of the
     net proceeds from such sale as described in the Offering Memorandum will
     not be, required to register as an "investment company" as such term is
     defined in the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended (the "Investment
     Company Act");

          (bb) the Company and each of the Subsidiaries maintain a system of
     internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurances
     that (A) transactions are executed in accordance with management's general

     permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
     accepted accounting principles and to maintain accountability for assets;
     (C) access to assets is permitted only in accordance with management's
     general or specific authorization; and (D) the recorded accountability for
     assets is compared with existing assets at reasonable intervals and

          (cc) the Company and the Subsidiaries comply with all Environmental
     Laws (as defined below), except to the extent that failure to comply with
     such Environmental Laws would not, individually or in the aggregate, be
     reasonably expected to result in a Material Adverse Change; none of the
     Company or any of the Subsidiaries is the subject of any pending or, to
     the best knowledge of the Company, threatened federal, state or local
     investigation evaluating whether any remedial action by the Company or any
     of the Subsidiaries is needed to respond to a release of any Hazardous
     Materials (as defined below) into the environment resulting from the
     Company's or any of the Subsidiaries' business operations or ownership or
     possession of any of their properties or assets, or is in contravention of
     any Environmental Law that could reasonably be expected, individually or
     in the aggregate, to result in any Material Adverse Change; none of the
     Company or any of the Subsidiaries has received any notice or claim, nor
     are there pending or, to the best knowledge of the Company, threatened
     lawsuits against them, with respect to violations of an Environmental Law
     or in connection with any release of any Hazardous Material into the
     environment that could reasonably be expected in the aggregate to result
     in a Material Adverse Change; as used herein, "Environmental Laws" means
     any federal, state or local law or regulation applicable to the Company's
     or any of the Subsidiaries' business operation or ownership or possession
     of any of their properties or assets relating to environmental matters,
     and "Hazardous Materials" means those substances that are regulated by or
     form the basis of liability under any Environmental Laws;

          (dd) the Company and each of its Subsidiaries carry, or are covered
     by, insurance in such amounts and covering such risks as is generally
     deemed adequate for the conduct of their respective businesses as
     presently conducted and the value of their respective properties and as is
     customary for companies engaged in similar businesses;

          (ee) the Company and each Subsidiary are in compliance in all
     material respects with all presently applicable provisions of the Employee
     Retirement Income Security Act of 1974, as amended, including the
     regulations and published interpretations thereunder ("ERISA"); no
     "reportable event" (as defined in ERISA) has occurred with respect to any
     "pension plan" (as defined in ERISA) for which the Company or any
     Subsidiary would have any material liability; neither the Company nor any
     Subsidiary has incurred or expects to incur any material liability under
     (i) Title IV of ERISA with respect to termination of, or withdrawal from,
     any "pension plan" or (ii) Sections 412 or 4971 of the Internal Revenue
     Code of 1986, as amended, including the regulations and published
     interpretations thereunder (the "Code"); and each "pension plan" for which
     the Company or any Subsidiary would have any liability that is intended to
     be qualified under Section 401(a) of the Code is so qualified in all
     material respects and nothing has occurred, whether by action or by
     failure to act, which would cause the loss of such qualification;

          (ff) neither the Company, nor any of its affiliates (as defined in
     Rule 501(b) of Regulation D under the Securities Act, each, an
     "Affiliate"), nor any person acting on its or their behalf (other than the
     Initial Purchaser and its representatives, as to whom the Company makes no
     representation) has, directly or indirectly, made offers or sales of any
     security (as defined in the Securities Act), or solicited offers to buy
     any security, under circumstances that would require the registration of
     the Securities or the Underlying Securities under the Securities Act;

          (gg) neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any person
     acting on its or their behalf (other than the Initial Purchaser and its

     those terms are used in Rule 502(c) of Regulation D under the Securities
     Act) in connection with any offer or sale of the Securities or the
     Underlying Securities;

     to the best knowledge of the Company, any of the Company's directors or
     officers, in their capacities as such, to comply in all material respects
     with any provision of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 that are effective
     and the rules and regulations promulgated in connection therewith,
     including Section 402 related to loans and Sections 302 and 906 related to

     Securities. Each Security will be convertible at the option of the holder
     into a combination of cash and the Underlying Securities at the conversion

     business day following the date of this Agreement, or at such other place,
     time or date not later than five business days thereafter as the Initial
     Purchaser and the Company may agree upon. Such time and date of delivery
     against payment are herein referred to as the "Closing Date". (As used

     open for trading and on which banks in New York are open for business and
     are not permitted by law or executive order to be closed.)

          (a)  It is understood that the Initial Purchaser will offer and sell
     the Securities in accordance with this Section as soon as the Initial
     Purchaser deems it advisable to do so. The Securities are to be initially
     offered at the offering price set forth in the Offering Memorandum. The
     Initial Purchaser may from time to time thereafter change the price and
     other selling terms.

     Securities and the Underlying Securities have not been and will not be
     registered under the Securities Act (except as contemplated by the
     Registration Rights Agreement) and may not be offered or sold, except in
     compliance with the registration requirements of the Securities Act or
     pursuant to an exemption from, or in a transaction not subject to, the
     registration requirements of the Securities Act. Accordingly, the Initial
     Purchaser agrees that it has solicited and will solicit offers for the
     Securities only from, and has offered and sold and will offer, sell or
     deliver the Securities only to persons that it reasonably believes to be
     qualified institutional buyers as defined in Rule 144A under the
     Securities Act.

          (c)  The Initial Purchaser agrees that neither it nor any person
     acting on its behalf has engaged or will engage in any form of general
     solicitation or general advertising (as those terms are used in Rule
     502(c) of Regulation D under the Securities Act) in connection with any
     offer or sale of the Securities in the United States.

          (d)  The Initial Purchaser represents and warrants to the Company that
     it is a "qualified institutional buyer" within the meaning of Rule 144A
     under the Securities Act.

     the Initial Purchaser, without charge, during the period mentioned in
     paragraph (d) below, as many copies of the Offering Memorandum, any
     documents incorporated by reference therein and any supplements or
     amendments thereto as they may reasonably request.

     distribution of the Securities by the Initial Purchaser, the Company will
     not file any document under the Exchange Act which is incorporated by
     reference in the Offering Memorandum, unless the Initial Purchaser
     previously has been advised of and furnished with a copy within a
     reasonable period of time prior to the proposed filing and the Initial
     Purchaser shall have given its consent to such filing, such consent not to
     be unreasonably withheld. The Company will prepare promptly upon request
     by the Initial Purchaser or counsel for the Initial Purchaser any
     amendments or supplements to the Offering Memorandum that may be necessary
     or advisable in connection with the distribution of the Securities by the
     Initial Purchaser. The Company will advise the Initial Purchaser of the
     time when any amendment or supplement to the Offering Memorandum has been
     made or when any document filed under the Exchange Act which is
     incorporated by reference in the Offering Memorandum has been filed with
     the Commission and will provide evidence satisfactory to the Initial
     Purchaser of each such amendment, supplement or filing.

          (c)  The Company will cooperate with the Initial Purchaser in
     endeavoring to qualify the Securities for sale under the securities laws
     of such jurisdictions as the Initial Purchaser may reasonably have
     designated in writing and will make such applications, file such documents
     and furnish such information as may be reasonably required for that
     purpose; provided that the Company shall not be required to qualify as a
     foreign corporation or to file a general consent to service of process in
     any jurisdiction where it is not now so qualified or required to file such
     a consent or to subject itself to taxation in respect of doing business in
     any jurisdiction in which it is not otherwise so subject. The Company
     will, from time to time, prepare and file such statements, reports and
     other documents, as are or may be required to continue such qualifications
     in effect for so long a period as the Initial Purchaser may reasonably
     request for distribution of the Securities.

          (d)  If at any time prior to the date on which all of the Securities
     shall have been sold by the Initial Purchaser, any event shall occur as a
     result of which, in the judgment of the Company or in the reasonable
     opinion of the Initial Purchaser, it becomes necessary to amend or
     supplement the Offering Memorandum in order to make the statements
     therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not
     misleading, or if it is necessary at any time to amend or supplement the
     Offering Memorandum to comply with applicable law, the Company promptly
     will prepare an appropriate amendment or supplement to the Offering
     Memorandum so that the Offering Memorandum as so amended or supplemented
     will not contain statements that, in the light of the circumstances under
     which they were made, are misleading, or so that the Offering Memorandum
     will comply with applicable law.

          (e)  The Company will not, without the prior written consent of
     Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., directly or indirectly offer, sell, pledge,
     contract to sell (including any short sale), grant any option to purchase
     or otherwise dispose of any shares of Common Stock or enter into any
     Hedging Transaction (as defined below) relating to the Common Stock for a
     period from the date hereof until and including the date that is 90 days
     after the date of this Agreement. "Hedging Transaction" means any short
     sale (whether or not against the box) or any purchase, sale or grant of
     any right (including, without limitation, any put or call option) with
     respect to any security (other than a broad-based market basket or index)
     that includes, relates to or derives any significant part of its value
     from the Common Stock. The foregoing sentence shall not apply to (A) the
     sale of the Securities under this Agreement, (B) the issuance by the
     Company of shares of Common Stock upon conversion of the Securities
     pursuant to the terms of the Indenture, (C) the issuance by the Company of
     shares of Common Stock, stock appreciation rights or common stock
     equivalents or warrants, rights or options to purchase any of the
     foregoing pursuant to any employee, officer or director stock option plan
     or other benefit plan in effect on the date hereof (D) the issuance by the
     Company of any shares of Common Stock upon the exercise of an option,
     warrant or management subscription right or the conversion of a security,
     in each case, outstanding on the date hereof, or (E) the filing of shelf
     registration statements in respect of the Securities and shares of Common
     Stock issuable upon conversion of the Securities pursuant to the terms of
     the Registration Rights Agreement or any registration statement in respect
     of any employee, officer or director stock option or other benefit plan.

          (f)  The Company will not, nor will it permit any of its Affiliates
     to, resell any Securities that have been acquired by any of them.

          (g)  Except as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement,
     neither the Company, nor any of its Affiliates, nor any person acting on
     its behalf will, directly or indirectly, make offers or sales of any
     security, or solicit offers to buy any security, under circumstances that
     would require the registration of the Securities or the Underlying
     Securities under the Securities Act.

          (h)  Neither the Company nor any of its Affiliates nor any person
     acting on its behalf will engage in any form of general solicitation or
     general advertising (as those terms are used in Rule 502(c) of Regulation
     D under the Securities Act) in connection with any offer or sale of the
     Securities in the United States.

          (i)  So long as any of the Securities or the Underlying Securities are
     "restricted securities" within the meaning of Rule 144(a)(3) under the
     Securities Act, the Company will, during any period in which it is not
     subject to and in compliance with Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act
     or exempt from such reporting requirements pursuant to and in compliance
     with Rule 12g3-2(b) under the Exchange Act, provide to each holder of such
     restricted securities and to each prospective purchaser (as designated by
     such holder) of such restricted securities, upon the request of such
     holder or prospective purchaser, any information required to be provided
     by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act. This covenant is intended to
     be for the benefit of the holders, and the prospective purchasers
     designated by such holders, from time to time of such restricted
     securities.

          (j)  The Company will cooperate with the Initial Purchaser and use its
     best efforts to (x) permit the Securities to be eligible for clearance and
     settlement through DTC and (y) arrange to have the Securities be
     designated by Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. as PORTAL-eligible securities in
     accordance with the rules and regulations of the National Association of
     Securities Dealers, Inc. ("NASD").

          (k)  The Company will use its best efforts to cause the Underlying
     Securities to be duly authorized for listing by the New York Stock
     Exchange on or prior to the Closing Date and ensure that the Underlying
     Securities remain authorized for listing following the Closing Date for so
     long as the Common Stock is so listed.

          (l)  The Company shall apply the net proceeds of its sale of the
     Securities as set forth in the Offering Memorandum.

          (m)  The Company shall not invest, or otherwise use the proceeds
     received by the Company from its sale of the Securities in such a manner
     as would require the Company to register as an "investment company" under
     the Investment Company Act.

          (n)  The Company will not take, directly or indirectly, any action
     designed to cause or result in, or that has constituted or might
     reasonably be expected to constitute, the stabilization or manipulation of
     the price of any securities of the Company.

          (o)  For so long as any Securities remain outstanding, the Company
     will furnish to the Initial Purchaser copies of all reports and other
     communications (financial or otherwise) furnished by the Company to the
     Trustee or the holders of the Securities and, as soon as available, copies
     of any reports or financial statements furnished to or filed by the
     Company with the Commission or any national securities exchange on which
     any class of securities of the Company may be listed; provided, however,
     that the Company shall not be required to provide the Initial Purchaser
     with any such reports or similar forms that have been filed with the
     Commission by electronic transmission pursuant to EDGAR.

     5.   COSTS AND EXPENSES.
          ------------------

          The Company will pay all costs, expenses and fees incident to the
performance of its obligations under this Agreement, including, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, the following: accounting fees of the
Company; the fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company; the cost of
printing and delivering to, or as requested by, the Initial Purchaser copies of
the Offering Memorandum and any supplements or amendments thereto and the
printing and production of all other documents connected with the transactions
contemplated herein (including this Agreement, the Indenture, the Registration
Rights Agreement and any other related agreements); the listing fee of the New
York Stock Exchange; the expenses arising from having the Securities designated
as eligible for trading in the PORTAL market; the expenses associated with the
preparation, issuance and delivery to the Initial Purchaser of the Securities;
the fees and expenses of the Trustee, including fees and expenses of its
counsel; the expenses of the "roadshow" and any other meetings with prospective
investors in the Securities; the costs and expenses of advertising relating to
the Offering (other than advertising costs and expenses that the Initial
Purchaser expressly agrees to pay); and the expenses, including the reasonable
fees and disbursements of counsel for the Initial Purchaser, incurred in
connection with the qualification of the Securities under state securities or
"Blue Sky" laws. The Company shall not, however, be required to pay for any of
the Initial Purchaser's expenses (other than those related to qualification
under state securities or "Blue Sky" laws) except that, if this Agreement shall
not be consummated because the conditions in Section 6 hereof are not
satisfied, or because this Agreement is terminated by the Initial Purchaser
pursuant to Section 9 hereof, or by reason of any failure, refusal or inability
on the part of the Company to perform any undertaking or satisfy any condition
of this Agreement or to comply with any of the terms hereof on its part to be
performed, unless such failure, refusal or inability is due primarily to the
default or omission of the Initial Purchaser, the Company shall reimburse the
Initial Purchaser for reasonable out-of-pocket expenses, including fees and
disbursements of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Initial Purchaser,
reasonably incurred in connection with investigating, marketing and proposing
to market the Securities or in contemplation of performing their obligations
hereunder; but the Company shall not in any event be liable to the Initial
Purchaser for damages on account of loss of anticipated profits from the sale
by the Initial Purchaser of the Securities.

     6.   CONDITIONS OF OBLIGATIONS OF THE INITIAL PURCHASER.
          --------------------------------------------------

          The obligation of the Initial Purchaser to purchase the Securities on

the following additional conditions:

          (a)  The Initial Purchaser shall have received on the Closing Date the
     negative assurance letter of Skadden, Arps, Slate, Meagher & Flom LLP,
     special counsel for the Company, dated the Closing Date addressed to the
     Initial Purchaser, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
     Initial Purchaser.

          (b) Reserved.

          (c)  The Initial Purchaser shall have received on the Closing Date the
     opinion of Wendy L. Carlson, Esq., General Counsel and Chief Financial
     Officer to the Company, dated the Closing Date addressed to the Initial
     Purchaser, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Initial
     Purchaser.

          (d)  The Initial Purchaser shall have received an opinion dated the
     Closing Date of Davis Polk & Wardwell, counsel for the Initial Purchaser,
     with respect to certain legal matters relating to this Agreement, and such
     other related matters as the Initial Purchaser may reasonably require. In
     rendering such opinion, Davis Polk & Wardwell shall have received and may
     rely upon such certificates and other documents and information as they
     may reasonably request to pass upon such matters.

          (e)  Reserved.

          (f)  The Initial Purchaser shall have received on the Closing Date a
     certificate or certificates of the Chief Executive Officer and the Chief
     Financial Officer of the Company to the effect that, as of the Closing
     Date, each of them severally represents, to the best of their knowledge,
     as follows:

               (i)   the representations and warranties of the Company contained
          in Section 1 hereof are true and correct as of the Closing Date;

               (ii)  he or she has carefully examined the Offering Memorandum
          (including the documents of the Company incorporated by reference
          therein) and, in his or her opinion, as of the Closing Date, the
          statements contained in the Offering Memorandum (including the
          documents of the Company incorporated by reference therein) with
          respect to the Company are true and correct in all material respects,
          and with respect to the Company such Offering Memorandum (including
          the documents of the Company incorporated by reference therein) does
          not omit to state a material fact necessary in order to make the
          statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which
          they were made, not misleading;

               (iii) since the respective dates as of which information is
          given in the Offering Memorandum, there has not been any Material
          Adverse Change or any development involving a prospective Material
          Adverse Change, whether or not arising in the ordinary course of
          business; and

               (iv)  the Company has performed all covenants and agreements and
         satisfied all conditions on its part to be performed or satisfied
         under this Agreement and otherwise in connection with the transactions
         contemplated hereby at or prior to the Closing Date.

          (g)  The Company shall have furnished to the Initial Purchaser such
     further certificates and documents confirming the representations and
     warranties, covenants and conditions contained herein and related matters
     as the Initial Purchaser may reasonably have requested.

          (h)  The Underlying Securities shall have been duly listed, subject to
     notice of issuance, on the New York Stock Exchange and the Securities
     shall have been designated as PORTAL-eligible securities.

          (i)  Subsequent to the execution and delivery of this Agreement and
     prior to the Closing Date, there shall not have occurred any downgrading,
     nor shall any notice have been given of any intended or potential
     downgrading or of any review for a possible change that does not indicate
     the direction of the possible change, in the rating accorded any of the
     Company's securities or the rating of any Subsidiary by any "nationally
     recognized statistical rating organization", as such term is defined for
     purposes of Rule 436(g)(2) under the Securities Act.

          (j)  Each of the First Supplemental Indenture and the Registration
     Rights Agreement shall have been executed and delivered by all the parties
     thereto (other than the Initial Purchaser with respect to the Registration
     Rights Agreement).

          The opinions and certificates mentioned in this Agreement shall be
deemed to be in compliance with the provisions hereof only if they are in all
material respects satisfactory to the Initial Purchaser.

          If any of the conditions hereinabove provided for in this Section 6
shall not have been fulfilled when and as required by this Agreement to be
fulfilled, the Initial Purchaser may terminate their obligations hereunder by
notifying the Company of such termination in writing or by telegram at or prior
to the Closing Date.

          In such event, the Company and the Initial Purchaser shall not be
under any obligation to each other (except to the extent provided in Sections 5
and 7 hereof).

     7.   Indemnification.
          ---------------

          (a)  The Company agrees:

               (i)   to indemnify and hold harmless the Initial Purchaser and
          the affiliates, directors, officers and employees of the Initial
          Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls the Initial Purchaser
          within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or
          Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses, claims, damages
          or liabilities to which the Initial Purchaser or any such affiliate,
          director, officer or employee or such controlling person may become
          subject under the Securities Act or otherwise, insofar as such
          losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
          respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (x) any untrue
          statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in
          the Offering Memorandum or any amendment or supplement thereto, or
          (y) the omission or alleged omission to state therein a material fact
          necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the
          circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; provided,
          however, that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the
          extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises out of
          or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or
          omission or alleged omission made in the Offering Memorandum, or any
          amendment or supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity
          with written information furnished to the Company by any Initial
          Purchaser specifically for use in the preparation thereof; or

               (ii)  to reimburse the Initial Purchaser and each such affiliate,
          director, officer and employee and each such controlling person upon
          demand for any legal or other out-of-pocket expenses reasonably
          incurred by the Initial Purchaser, such affiliate, director, officer
          or employee or such controlling person in connection with
          investigating or defending or appearing as a third-party witness in
          connection with any such loss, claim, damage or liability, action or
          proceeding or in responding to a subpoena or governmental inquiry
          related to the Offering, whether or not the Initial Purchaser or any
          such controlling person is a party to any action or proceeding. In
          the event that it is finally judicially determined that the Initial
          Purchaser was not entitled to receive payments for legal and other
          expenses pursuant to this subparagraph, the Initial Purchaser will
          promptly return all sums that had been advanced pursuant hereto.

          (b)  The Initial Purchaser agrees, to indemnify and hold harmless the
     Company, its directors, officers and employees and each person, if any,
     who controls the Company within the meaning of either Section 15 of the
     Securities Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act, against any losses,
     claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company or any such director,
     officer or controlling person may become subject under the Securities Act
     or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
     actions or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon
     (i) any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact
     contained in the Offering Memorandum or any amendment or supplement
     thereto, or (ii) the omission or the alleged omission to state therein a
     material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of
     the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading; and will
     reimburse any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by the Company
     or any such director, officer or controlling person in connection with
     investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability, action
     or proceeding; provided, however, that the Initial Purchaser will be
     liable in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that such
     untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
     omission has been made in the Offering Memorandum or any amendment or
     supplement thereto, in reliance upon and in conformity with written
     information furnished to the Company by any Initial Purchaser specifically
     for use in the preparation thereof. This indemnity agreement will be in
     addition to any liability which the Initial Purchaser may otherwise have.

          (c)  In case any proceeding (including any governmental investigation)
     shall be instituted involving any person in respect of which indemnity may
     be sought pursuant to this Section 7, such person (the "indemnified
     party") shall promptly notify the person against whom such indemnity may
     be sought (the "indemnifying party") in writing. No indemnification
     provided for in Section 7(a) or (b) shall be available to any party who
     shall fail to give notice as provided in this Section 7(c) if the party to
     whom notice was not given was unaware of the proceeding to which such
     notice would have related and was materially prejudiced by the failure to
     give such notice, but the failure to give such notice shall not relieve
     the indemnifying party or parties from any liability which it or they may
     have to the indemnified party for contribution or otherwise than on
     account of the provisions of Section 7(a) or (b). In case any such
     proceeding shall be brought against any indemnified party and it shall
     notify the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
     indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
     extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other indemnifying party
     similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel
     satisfactory to such indemnified party and shall pay as incurred the fees
     and disbursements of such counsel related to such proceeding. In any such
     proceeding, any indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own
     counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the
     indemnifying party shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of
     presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the
     indemnified party in the event (i) the indemnifying party and the
     indemnified party shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such
     counsel, (ii) the named parties to any such proceeding (including any
     impleaded parties) include both the indemnifying party and the indemnified
     party and representation of both parties by the same counsel would be
     inappropriate due to actual or potential differing interests between them
     or (iii) the indemnifying party shall have failed to assume the defense of
     and employ counsel acceptable to the indemnified party within a reasonable
     period of time after notice of commencement of the action. It is
     understood that the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any
     proceeding or related proceedings in the same jurisdiction, be liable for
     the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm for all
     such indemnified parties. Such firm shall be designated in writing by
     Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. in the case of parties indemnified pursuant
     to Section 7(a) and by the Company in the case of parties indemnified
     pursuant to Section 7(b). The indemnifying party shall not be liable for
     any settlement of any proceeding effected without its written consent, but
     if settled with such consent or if there be a final judgment for the
     plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to indemnify the indemnified
     party from and against any loss or liability by reason of such settlement
     or judgment. In addition, the indemnifying party will not, without the
     prior written consent of the indemnified party, settle or compromise or
     consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim,
     action or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder
     (whether or not any indemnified party is an actual or potential party to
     such claim, action or proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or
     consent includes an unconditional release of each indemnified party from
     all liability arising out of such claim, action or proceeding.

          (d)  To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 7
     is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party
     under Section 7(a) or (b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages
     or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to
     therein, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to the amount paid
     or payable by such indemnified party as a result of such losses, claims,
     damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in
     such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
     received by the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchaser on the
     other from the offering of the Securities. If, however, the allocation
     provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by
     applicable law then each indemnifying party shall contribute to such
     amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
     appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the
     relative fault of the Company on the one hand and the Initial Purchaser on
     the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in
     such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
     respect thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations.
     The relative benefits received by the Company on the one hand and the
     Initial Purchaser on the other shall be deemed to be in the same
     proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering (before deducting
     expenses) received by the Company bear to the total discounts and
     commissions received by the Initial Purchaser. The relative fault shall be
     determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
     alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged
     omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the
     Company on the one hand or the Initial Purchaser on the other and the
     parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
     to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the
     Initial Purchaser agree that it would not be just and equitable if
     contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were determined by pro rata
     allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
     account of the equitable considerations referred to above in this Section.
     The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the
     losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in
     respect thereof) referred to above in this Section 7(d) shall be deemed to
     include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
     indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such
     action or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d),
     (i) the Initial Purchaser shall not be required to contribute any amount
     in excess of the discounts and commissions applicable to the Securities
     purchased by the Initial Purchaser and (ii) no person guilty of fraudulent
     misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities
     Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty
     of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

          (e)  In any proceeding relating to the Offering Memorandum or any
     supplement or amendment thereto, each party against whom contribution may
     be sought under this Section 7 hereby consents to the jurisdiction of any
     court having jurisdiction over any other contributing party, agrees that
     process issuing from such court may be served upon it by any other
     contributing party and consents to the service of such process and agrees
     that any other contributing party may join it as an additional defendant
     in any such proceeding in which such other contributing party is a party.

          (f)  Any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an
     indemnified party is entitled to indemnification or contribution under
     this Section 7 shall be paid by the indemnifying party to the indemnified
     party as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses are
     incurred. A successor to any Initial Purchaser or any affiliate, director,
     officer or employee of the Initial Purchaser or any person controlling any
     Initial Purchaser, or to the Company, any director, officer or employee of
     the Company or any person controlling the Company, shall be entitled to
     the benefits of the indemnity, contribution and reimbursement agreements

acceptable to the Company. The Company shall provide any such notations,

         Holders of the Securities shall have the benefit of the Company's
registration obligations with respect to the Securities as more fully set

         Section 4.04. Separability.

         In case any one or more of the provisions contained in this
Supplemental Indenture or in the Global Security shall for any reason be held
to be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect, such invalidity,
illegality or unenforceability shall not affect any other provisions of this
Supplemental Indenture or of the Global Security, but this Supplemental
Indenture and the Global Security shall be construed as if such invalid or
illegal or unenforceable provision had never been contained herein or therein.

         Section 4.05. Tax Treatment of Securities.

         The Company agrees, and by acceptance of a beneficial interest in a
Security each Holder and any Beneficial Owner of a Security shall be deemed to
agree, to treat, for United States federal income tax purposes, the Securities
as debt instruments that are subject to Treasury regulation section 1.1275-4
or any successor provision (the "contingent payment regulations"). For United
States federal income tax purposes, the Company further agrees, and by
acceptance of a beneficial interest in a Security each Holder and any
Beneficial Owner of a Security shall be deemed to agree (i) to treat the cash
and the fair market value of any Common Stock received upon the conversion of
a Security as a contingent payment for purposes of the contingent payment
regulations, (ii) to accrue interest with respect to outstanding Securities as
original issue discount for United States federal income tax purposes (i.e.
Tax Original Issue Discount) according to the "noncontingent bond method" set
forth in the contingent payment regulations, using the comparable yield of 8%
compounded semi-annually, and (iii) to be bound by the Company's determination
of the "projected payment schedule," within the meaning of the contingent
payment regulations, with respect to the Securities. Holders or Beneficial
Owners may obtain the issue price, amount of Tax Original Issue Discount,
issue date, comparable yield and projected payment schedule by submitting a
written request to the Company at the following address: 5000 Westown Parkway
#440, West Des Moines, IA 50266.

         Section 4.06. Multiple Originals.

         This Supplemental Indenture may be executed in any number of
counterparts, each of which shall be an original, but such counterparts shall
together constitute one and the same instrument.

                   [FORM OF REVERSE SIDE OF GLOBAL SECURITY]

                AMERICAN EQUITY INVESTMENT LIFE HOLDING COMPANY

          Series B 5.25% Contingent Convertible Senior Note Due 2024

         (1) New Series of Securities.

         This Security shall constitute a new, separate series of Securities
under the Indenture and Holders hereof shall constitute a separate class of
Holders.

         (2) Interest.

         This Security will bear interest from December 6, 2004 or from the
most recent date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for,
semi-annually in arrears on June 6 and December 6 of each year (each, an
"Interest Payment Date"), subject to Section 11.08 of the Indenture,
commencing June 6, 2005. The Company will pay interest on any overdue
principal amount at the interest rate borne by the Securities at the time such
interest on the overdue principal amount accrues, compounded semi-annually,
and it shall pay interest on overdue installments of interest and Contingent
Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any (without regard to any applicable
grace period), at the same interest rate, compounded semi-annually. Interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) on the
Securities will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve
30-day months.

         The Company shall pay additional interest ("Contingent Interest") to
the Holders during any six-month period (a "Contingent Interest Period") from
and including an Interest Payment Date to but excluding the next Interest
Payment Date, commencing with the six-month period ending June 6, 2012, if the
average Trading Price per Security for the five Trading Days ending on the
third Trading Day immediately preceding the first day of the applicable
Contingent Interest Period (the "Contingent Interest Average Trading Price")
equals 120% or more of the principal amount of such Security. The amount of
Contingent Interest payable per $1,000 principal amount of Securities in
respect of any Contingent Interest Period shall equal 0.50% per annum on the
Contingent Interest Average Trading Price. The Company will pay Contingent
Interest, if any, in the same manner and at the same time as it will pay
interest as described above.

         Upon determination that Holders will be entitled to receive
Contingent Interest for a Contingent Interest Period, on or prior to the first
day of such Contingent Interest Period, the Company shall issue a press
release and notify the Trustee promptly in writing.

         (3) Method of Payment.

         The Company will pay interest (including Contingent Interest and
Liquidated Damages, if any) on this Security to the Person who is the
registered Holder of this Security at the close of business on May 20 or
November 20 (each a "Record Date"), as the case may be, immediately preceding
the related Interest Payment Date. Subject to the terms and conditions of the
Indenture, the Company will make all payments and deliveries in respect of the
Redemption Price, Repurchase Price, Change in Control Repurchase Price and the
principal amount at Stated Maturity, as the case may be, to the Holder who
surrenders a Security to a Paying Agent to collect such payments in respect of
the Security. The Company will pay cash amounts in money of the United States
that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and private
debts. However, the Company may pay interest (including Contingent Interest
and Liquidated Damages, if any), the Redemption Price, Repurchase Price,
Change in Control Repurchase Price and the principal amount at Stated
Maturity, as the case may be, to a Holder holding Securities in definitive
form by check or wire payable in such money; provided that a Holder holding
Securities in definitive form with an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$1,000,000 may request payment by wire transfer in immediately available funds
to an account in North America at the election of such Holder. The Company may
mail an interest check to the Holder's registered address. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, so long as this Security is registered in the name of a Depositary
or its nominee, all payments hereon shall be made by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee.

         (4) Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar.

         Initially, U.S. Bank National Association (the "Trustee") will act as
Paying Agent, Conversion Agent and Registrar. The Company may appoint and
change any Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar without notice, other
than notice to the Trustee; provided that the Company will maintain at least
one Paying Agent having an office or agency in the State of New York, City of
New York, Borough of Manhattan, which shall initially be an office or agency
of the Trustee. The Company or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their
Affiliates may act as Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Registrar.

         (5) Indenture.

         The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture dated as of
December 6, 2004 ( the "Original Indenture") between the Company and the
Trustee, as supplemented by the First Supplemental Indenture dated as December
30, 2004 (the "Supplemental Indenture", and together with the Original
Indenture, the "Indenture"), between the Company and the Trustee. The terms of
the Securities include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of
the Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as in effect
from time to time (the "TIA"). Capitalized terms used herein and not defined
herein have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture. The Securities are
subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the
TIA for a statement of those terms.

         The Securities are senior unsecured obligations of the Company and
may be issued in unlimited principal amount under the Indenture. The Indenture
does not limit other indebtedness of the Company, secured or unsecured.

         (6) Redemption at the Option of the Company.

         No sinking fund is provided for the Securities. Beginning on December
15, 2011 and during the periods thereafter to maturity, the Securities of this
series are redeemable as a whole at any time, or in part from time to time, in
any integral multiple of $1,000, at the option of the Company for cash at a
Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount, together with accrued
but unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if
any) thereon, up to but not including the Redemption Date; provided that, if
the Redemption Date is between the close of business on a Record Date and the
opening of business on the related Interest Payment Date, interest will be
payable to the Holders in whose names the Securities are registered at the
close of business on the relevant Record Date.

         Notice of redemption pursuant to paragraph 5 of this Security will be
mailed at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date
to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at the Holder's registered
address. If money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all Securities of
this series (or portions thereof) to be redeemed on the Redemption Date is
deposited with the Paying Agent prior to 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on
the Redemption Date, immediately after such Redemption Date, interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) shall cease to
accrue on such Securities or portions thereof. Securities in denominations
larger than $1,000 of principal amount may be redeemed in part but only in
integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount.

         (7) Repurchase By the Company at the Option of the Holder on
Specified Dates; Repurchase at the Option of the Holder Upon a Change in
Control.

         Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the Company
shall become obligated to repurchase, at the option of the Holder, on December
15, 2011, December 15, 2014 and December 15, 2019 (each, a "Repurchase Date"),
all or a portion of the Securities held by such Holder, in any integral
multiple of $1,000, for cash at a price per Security equal to 100% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Security (the "Repurchase Price"), together
with accrued but unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) thereon, up to but not including the Repurchase Date upon
delivery of a Repurchase Notice containing the information set forth in the
Indenture, together with the Securities subject thereto, at any time from the
opening of business on the date that is 30 Business Days prior to such
Repurchase Date until the close of business on the Business Day prior to such
Repurchase Date, and upon delivery of the Securities to the Paying Agent by
the Holder as set forth in the Indenture.

         At the option of the Holder and subject to the terms and conditions
of the Indenture, the Company shall become obligated to repurchase the
Securities held by such Holder after the occurrence of a Change in Control of
the Company for a Change in Control Repurchase Price equal to 100% of the
principal amount thereof plus accrued but unpaid interest (including
Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) thereon, up to but not
including the Change in Control Repurchase Date which Change in Control
Repurchase Price shall be paid in cash (provided that if the Change in Control
Repurchase Date is between the close of business on a Record Date and the
opening of business on the related Interest Payment Date, accrued but unpaid
interest will be payable to the Holders in whose names the Securities are
registered at the close of business on the relevant Record Date). Holders have
the right to withdraw any Repurchase Notice or Change in Control Repurchase
Notice, as the case may be, by delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice
of withdrawal in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture.

         If cash sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price or Change in Control
Repurchase Price, as the case may be, and accrued but unpaid interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) on all
Securities of this series or portions thereof to be repurchased as of the
Repurchase Date or the Change in Control Repurchase Date, as the case may be,
is held by the Paying Agent by 11:00 a.m., New York City time, on the Business
Day immediately following the Repurchase Date or the Change in Control
Repurchase Date, interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) shall cease to accrue on such Securities (or portions
thereof) as of such Repurchase Date or Change in Control Repurchase Date, and
the Holder thereof shall have no other rights as such, other than the right to
receive the Repurchase Price or Change in Control Repurchase Price, as the
case may be, and interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) upon surrender of such Security.

         (8) Conversion.

         Upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 10.01(a) of
the Indenture, a Holder of a Security may convert any portion of the principal
amount of any Security that is an integral multiple of $1,000 into cash and
fully paid and non-assessable shares (calculated as to each conversion to the
nearest 1/10000th of a share) of Common Stock in accordance with the
provisions of Section 10.14 of the Indenture; provided that if such Security
is called for redemption, the conversion right will terminate at the close of
business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date
of such Security (unless the Company shall default in making the redemption
payment when due, in which case the conversion right shall terminate at the
close of business on the date such default is cured and such Security is
redeemed). Such conversion right shall commence on the initial issuance date
of the Securities and expire at the close of business on the date of maturity,
subject, in the case of conversion of any Global Security, to any Applicable
Procedures. The Conversion Price shall, as of the date of the Indenture,
initially be $14.47 per share of Common Stock. The Conversion Rate shall, as
of the date of the Indenture, initially be approximately 69.1085. The
Conversion Price and Conversion Rate will be adjusted under the circumstances
specified in the Indenture. Upon conversion, no adjustment for interest
(including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any) or dividends
will be made. No fractional shares will be issued upon conversion; in lieu
thereof, an amount will be paid in cash based upon the Ten Day Average Closing
Stock Price (as defined in the Indenture). Except as provided in Section
10.02(c) of the Indenture, delivery of the Principal Return, Net Shares and
cash in lieu of fractional shares shall be deemed to satisfy the Company's
obligation to pay the principal amount of a converted Security and accrued but
unpaid interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated Damages, if any)
thereon. Any accrued interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) payable on a converted Security will be deemed paid in full,
rather than canceled, extinguished or forfeited.

         In addition, following certain corporate transactions as set forth in
Sections 10.01(a)(iii)(A) and 10.01(a)(iii)(B) that occur on or prior to
December 15, 2011 and that constitute a Change in Control (other than relating
to the composition of the Board of Directors as described in clause (d) of the
definition of Change in Control in Section 1.01) and for which 10% or more of
the fair market value of the consideration for the Common Stock (as determined
by the Board of Directors) in the corporate transaction consists of (i) cash,
(ii) other property or (iii) securities that are not traded or scheduled to be
traded immediately following such transaction on a U.S. national securities
exchange or the Nasdaq National Market, a Holder who elects to convert its
Securities in connection with such corporate transaction will be entitled to
receive Additional Shares of Common Stock upon conversion in certain
circumstances.

         To convert a Security, a Holder must (a) complete and manually sign
the conversion notice set forth below and deliver such notice to the
Conversion Agent, (b) surrender the Security to the Conversion Agent, (c)
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the
Registrar or the Conversion Agent, (d) pay any transfer or other tax, if
required and (e) if the Security is held in book-entry form, complete and
deliver to the Depositary appropriate instructions pursuant to the Applicable
Procedures. If a Holder surrenders a Security for conversion between the close
of business on the Record Date and the opening of business on the related
Interest Payment Date, the Security must be accompanied by payment of an
amount equal to the interest (including Contingent Interest and Liquidated
Damages, if any) payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount
of the Security or portion thereof then converted; provided that no such
payment shall be required if such Security has been called for redemption on a
Redemption Date within the period between close of business on such Record
Date and the opening of business on such Interest Payment Date, or if such
Security is surrendered for conversion on the Interest Payment Date. A Holder
may convert a portion of a Security equal to $1,000 or any integral multiple
thereof.

         A Security in respect of which a Holder has delivered a Repurchase
Notice or a Change of Control Repurchase Notice exercising the option of such
Holder to require the Company to repurchase such Security as provided in
Section 3.08 or Section 3.09, respectively, of the Indenture may be converted
only if such notice of exercise is withdrawn in accordance with the terms of
the Indenture.

         (9) Denominations; Transfer; Exchange.

         The Securities are in fully registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 of principal amount and integral multiples of $1,000.
A Holder may transfer or exchange Securities in accordance with the Indenture.
The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents and to pay any taxes and fees required by
law or permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not transfer or exchange
any Securities selected for redemption (except, in the case of a Security to
be redeemed in part, the portion of the Security not to be redeemed), or any
Securities in respect of which a Repurchase Notice or a Change in Control
Repurchase Notice has been given and not withdrawn (except, in the case of a
Security to be repurchased in part, the portion of the Security not to be
repurchased), or any Securities for a period of 15 days before the mailing of
a notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed.

         (10) Persons Deemed Owners.

         The registered Holder of this Security may be treated as the owner of
this Security for all purposes.

         (11) Amendment; Waiver.

         Subject to certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, (i) the
Indenture or the Securities may be amended with the written consent of the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities
of this series at the time outstanding and (ii) certain defaults may be waived
with the written consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities of this series at the time outstanding. Subject to
certain exceptions set forth in the Indenture, without the consent of any
Holder, the Company and the Trustee may amend the Indenture or the Securities
(i) to cure any ambiguity, omission, defect or inconsistency, or make any
other change that does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any
material respect, (ii) to comply with Article 5 or Section 10.11 of the
Indenture, (iii) to make provisions with respect to the conversion right of
Holders pursuant to the requirements of Section 10.01 of the Indenture, (iv)
to evidence and provide for the acceptance of appointment under the Indenture
by a successor Trustee, or (v) to comply with the provisions of the TIA or any
requirement of the SEC in connection with the qualification of the Indenture
under the TIA.

         (12) Defaults and Remedies.

         Except as set forth in the Indenture, if an Event of Default occurs
and is continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of not less than 25% in
principal amount of Securities of this series then outstanding may declare all
the Securities to be due and payable in the manner, at the time and with the
effect provided in the Indenture. Holders of Securities of this series may not
enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture.
The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless
it has received security or indemnity reasonably satisfactory to it. The
Indenture permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of
a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities of this series at
the time outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise of any trust or
power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Securities notice of any
continuing Default or Event of Default (except a default in payment of
principal or interest when due, for any reason) if it determines in good faith
that withholding notice is in the interests of Holders.

         (13) Trustee Dealings with the Company.

         Subject to certain limitations imposed by the TIA, the Trustee under
the Indenture, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the owner
or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal with and collect obligations
owed to it by the Company or its Affiliates and may otherwise deal with the
Company or its Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not
Trustee.

         (14) No Recourse Against Others.

         A director, officer, employee or shareholder, as such, of the Company
shall not have any liability for any obligations of the Company under the
Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of or by
reason of such obligations or their creation. By accepting a Security, each
Holder waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and release are part
of the consideration for the issue of the Securities.

         (15) Ranking.

         The Securities shall be unsecured senior obligations of the Company
and shall rank equally in right of payment with any other existing and future
senior indebtedness of the Company and senior to any future subordinated
indebtedness of the Company.

         (16) Authentication.

         This Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the
Trustee manually signs the Trustee's Certificate of Authentication on the
other side of this Security.

         (17) Abbreviations.

         Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder or an
assignee, such as TEN COM ("Tenants In Common"), TEN ENT ("Tenants By The
Entireties"), JT TEN ("Joint Tenants With Right Of Survivorship And Not As
Tenants In Common"), CUST ("Custodian") and U/G/M/A ("Uniform Gift To Minors
Act").

         (18) Governing Law.

         THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK SHALL GOVERN THE INDENTURE AND THIS
SECURITY.

         (19) CUSIP Numbers.

         Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform
Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused CUSIP numbers to be
printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders of the Securities.
No representation is made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the
Securities and reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers
printed hereon.

     2.   Shelf Registration.
          ------------------

               (a)   Initial Shelf Registration. The Company shall file with the
SEC a Registration Statement for an offering to be made on a continuous basis
pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Securities (the "Initial
Shelf Registration") on or prior to the Filing Date.

               The Initial Shelf Registration shall be on Form S-3 or another
appropriate form permitting registration of the Registrable Securities for
resale by Holders in the manner or manners designated by them (excluding
Underwritten Offerings) and set forth in the Initial Shelf Registration. The
Company shall not permit any securities other than the Registrable Securities
to be included in the Initial Shelf Registration or any Subsequent Shelf
Registration (as defined below).

               The Company shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to
cause the Initial Shelf Registration to be declared effective under the
Securities Act on or prior to the Effectiveness Date and to keep the Initial
Shelf Registration continuously effective under the Securities Act until the
date (A) that is two years after the Closing Date (such period, as it may be
shortened pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) or (iii) immediately following, the
"Effectiveness Period"), or such shorter period ending when (i) all of the
Registrable Securities covered by the Initial Shelf Registration have been sold
in the manner set forth and as contemplated in the Initial Shelf Registration,
(ii) the date on which all the Registrable Securities (x) held by Persons who
are not affiliates of the Company may be resold pursuant to Rule 144(k) under
the Securities Act or (y) cease to be outstanding, (iii) all the Registrable

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

Securities have been resold pursuant to Rule 144 under the Securities Act or
(B) a Subsequent Shelf Registration covering all of the Registrable Securities
has been declared effective under the Securities Act.

               (b)   Subsequent Shelf Registrations. If the Initial Shelf
Registration ceases to be effective for any reason at any time during the
Effectiveness Period (other than because of the sale of all of the Registrable
Securities registered thereunder), the Company shall use its commercially
reasonable efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness thereof, and in any event shall within 45 days of such cessation
of effectiveness amend the Initial Shelf Registration in a manner reasonably
expected by the Company to obtain the withdrawal of the order suspending the
effectiveness thereof, or file an additional "shelf" Registration Statement
pursuant to Rule 415 covering all of the Registrable Securities (a "Subsequent
Shelf Registration"). If a Subsequent Shelf Registration is filed, the Company
shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause the Subsequent Shelf
Registration to be declared effective under the Securities Act as soon as
practicable after such filing (or if filed during a Deferral Period, after the
expiration of such Deferral Period) and to keep such Registration Statement
continuously effective for the balance of the Effectiveness Period. As used
herein, the term "Shelf Registration" means the Initial Shelf Registration or
any Subsequent Shelf Registration and the term "Shelf Registration Statement"
means any Registration Statement filed in connection with a Shelf Registration.

               (c)   Supplements and Amendments. The Company shall promptly
supplement and amend a Shelf Registration if required by the rules, regulations
or instructions applicable to the registration form used for such Shelf
Registration, if required by the Securities Act, or if reasonably requested by
the Holders of a majority in Amount of Registrable Securities covered by such
Shelf Registration Statement.

               (d)   Notice and Questionnaire. Each Holder agrees that if such
Holder wishes to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration
Statement and related Prospectus, it will do so only in accordance with this
Section 2(d) and Section 4A hereof. Each Holder wishing to sell Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus
agrees to deliver a Notice and Questionnaire to the Company at least five (5)
Business Days prior to the date that the Initial Shelf Registration Statement
is declared effective under the Securities Act. From and after the date the
Initial Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective, the Company shall,
as promptly as practicable after the date a fully completed and legible Notice
and Questionnaire, together with such other information as the Company may
reasonably request, is received by the Company, and in any event upon the later
of (x) twenty (20) days after such date, if a supplement to the related
Prospectus is required to be filed, (y) forty-five (45) days after such date,
if a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or an
additional Shelf Registration Statement is required to be filed or (z) ten (10)
Business Days after the expiration of any Deferral Period in effect when the
Notice and Questionnaire is received by the Company:

                     (i)   if required by applicable law, file with the SEC a
               post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or
               a Subsequent Shelf Registration or prepare and, if required by
               applicable law, file a supplement to the related Prospectus or a

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

               supplement or amendment to any document incorporated therein by
               reference or file any other required document so that the Holder
               delivering such Notice and Questionnaire is named as a selling
               securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the
               related Prospectus in such a manner as to permit such Holder to
               deliver such Prospectus to purchasers of the Registrable
               Securities (subject to the rights of the Company under Section
               3(b) to create a Deferral Period) in accordance with applicable
               law and, if the Company shall file a post-effective amendment to
               the Shelf Registration Statement, use its commercially
               reasonable efforts to cause such post-effective amendment to be
               declared effective under the Securities Act as promptly as
               practicable, but in any event by the date (the "Amendment
               Effectiveness Deadline Date") that is forty-five (45) days after
               the date such post-effective amendment is required by this
               clause to be filed;

                     (ii)  provide such Holder copies of any documents filed
               pursuant to Section 2(d)(i); and

                     (iii) notify such Holder as promptly as practicable after
               the effectiveness under the Securities Act of any post-effective
               amendment filed pursuant to Section 2(d)(i); provided that if
               such Notice and Questionnaire is delivered during a Deferral
               Period, the Company shall so inform the Holder delivering such
               Notice and Questionnaire and shall take the actions set forth in
               clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) above upon expiration of the
               Deferral Period. Notwithstanding anything contained herein to
               the contrary, (i) the Company shall be under no obligation to
               name any Holder that has not delivered a fully completed and
               legible Notice and Questionnaire, together with such other
               information as the Company may reasonably request, to the
               Company in accordance with this Section 2(d) and (ii) the
               Amendment Effectiveness Deadline Date shall be extended by up to
               ten (10) Business Days from the expiration of a Deferral Period
               (and the Company shall incur no obligation to pay Liquidated
               Damages during such extension) if such Deferral Period shall be
               in effect on the Amendment Effectiveness Deadline Date.

     3.   Liquidated Damages.
          ------------------

          (a)  The Company and the Initial Purchaser agree that the
Holders of Notes that are Registrable Securities will suffer damages if the
Company fails to fulfill its obligations under Section 2 hereof and that it
would not be feasible to ascertain the extent of such damages with precision.
Accordingly, the Company agrees to pay liquidated damages on the Notes that are
Registrable Securities ("Liquidated Damages") under the circumstances and to
the extent set forth below (each of which shall be given independent effect;
each a "Registration Default"):

               (i)   if the Initial Shelf Registration is not filed on or prior
          to the Filing Date, then commencing on the day after the Filing Date,
          Liquidated Damages shall accrue on the Notes that are Registrable
          Securities at a rate of 0.50% per annum on the aggregate principal
          amount of all such Notes then outstanding;

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

               (ii)  if a Shelf Registration is not declared effective by the
          SEC on or prior to the Effectiveness Date, then commencing on the day
          after the Effectiveness Date, Liquidated Damages shall accrue on the
          Notes that are Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.50% per annum on
          the aggregate principal amount of all such Notes then outstanding;

               (iii) if a Shelf Registration has been declared effective and
          such Shelf Registration ceases to be effective at any time during the
          Effectiveness Period (other than as permitted under Section 3(b)),
          then commencing on the day after the date such Shelf Registration
          ceases to be effective, Liquidated Damages shall accrue on the Notes
          that are Registrable Securities at a rate of 0.50% per annum on the
          aggregate principal amount of all such Notes then outstanding;

               (iv)  if any post-effective amendment filed pursuant to Section
          2(d)(i) has not become effective under the Securities Act on or prior
          to the Amendment Effectiveness Deadline Date, then commencing on the
          day after the Amendment Effectiveness Deadline Date, Liquidated
          Damages shall accrue on the Notes that are Registrable Securities at
          a rate of 0.50% per annum on the aggregate principal amount of all
          such Notes then outstanding; and

               (v)   if the aggregate duration of Deferral Periods in any period
          exceeds the number of days permitted in respect of such period
          pursuant to Section 3(b), then commencing on the day that caused the
          limit on the aggregate duration of Deferral Periods to be exceeded,
          Liquidated Damages shall accrue on the Notes that are Registrable
          Securities at a rate of 0.50% per annum on the aggregate principal
          amount of all such Notes then outstanding;

provided that Liquidated Damages on the Notes that are Registrable Securities
may not accrue under more than one of the foregoing clauses (i), (ii), (iii),
(iv) and (v) at any one time; provided further that in no event shall
Liquidated Damages accrue at a rate per annum exceeding 0.50% of the aggregate
principal amount of the Notes that are Registrable Securities then outstanding;
and provided further that (1) upon the filing of the Initial Shelf Registration
as required hereunder (in the case of clause (a)(i) of this Section 3), (2)
upon the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration as required hereunder (in the
case of clause (a)(ii) of this Section 3), (3) upon the effectiveness of a
Shelf Registration which had ceased to remain effective (in the case of clause
(a)(iii) of this Section 3), (4) upon the effectiveness of a post-effective
amendment as required hereunder (in the case of clause (a)(iv) of this Section
3), or (5) upon the termination of the Deferral Period that caused the limit on
the aggregate duration of Deferral Periods to be exceeded (in the case of
clause (a)(v) of this Section 3), Liquidated Damages on the Notes that are
Registrable Securities as a result of such clause shall cease to accrue. It is
understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, no
Liquidated Damages shall accrue on any Notes that are Registrable Securities
that are then covered by, and may be sold under, an effective Shelf
Registration Statement.

          (b)  Notwithstanding Section 3(a), the Company, upon written notice to
the Holders, shall be permitted to suspend the availability of a Registration
Statement covering the Registrable Securities for any bona fide reason

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

whatsoever for up to 45 consecutive days (the "Deferral Period") in any 90-day
period without being obligated to pay Liquidated Damages; provided that
Deferral Periods may not total more than 90 days in the aggregate in any
twelve-month period. The Company shall not be required to specify in the
written notice to the Holders the nature of the event giving rise to the
Deferral Period.

          (c)  So long as Notes remain outstanding, the Company shall notify the
Trustee within five Business Days after each and every date on which an event
occurs in respect of which Liquidated Damages are required to be paid. Any
amounts of Liquidated Damages due pursuant to clause (a)(i), (a)(ii), (a)(iii),
(a)(iv) or (a)(v) of this Section 3 will be payable in cash semiannually on
June 6 and December 6 of each year (each, a "Damages Payment Date"), commencing
with the first such Damages Payment Date occurring after any such Liquidated
Damages commences to accrue, to Holders to whom regular interest is payable on
the Damages Payment Date, with respect to Notes that are Registrable
Securities, provided that any Liquidated Damages accrued with respect to any
Note or portion thereof called for redemption by the Company on a redemption
date or converted into Underlying Shares on a conversion date prior to the
Damages Payment Date, shall, in any such event, be paid instead to the Holder
who submitted such Note or portion thereof for redemption or conversion on the
applicable redemption date or conversion date, as the case may be, on such date
(or promptly following the conversion date, in the case of conversion). The
amount of Liquidated Damages for Notes that are Registrable Securities will be
determined by multiplying the applicable rate of Liquidated Damages by the
aggregate principal amount of all such Notes then outstanding on the first
Damages Payment Date following such Registration Default in the case of the
first such payment of Liquidated Damages with respect to a Registration Default
(and thereafter at the next succeeding Damages Payment Date until the cure of
such Registration Default), multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is
the number of days such Liquidated Damages rate was applicable during such
period (determined on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months and, in the case of a partial month, the actual number of days elapsed),
and the denominator of which is 360. The parties agree that the sole monetary
damages payable for a violation of the terms of this Agreement with respect to
which Liquidated Damages are expressly provided shall be such Liquidated
Damages.

     4.   Registration Procedures.
          -----------------------

          In connection with its registration obligations pursuant to Section 2
hereof, the Company shall:

          (a)  Prepare and file with the SEC, on or prior to the Filing Date, a
Registration Statement or Registration Statements as prescribed by Section 2
hereof, and use its commercially reasonable efforts to cause each such
Registration Statement to become effective and remain effective as provided
herein; provided that before filing any Registration Statement or Prospectus or
any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company shall furnish to and afford
the Initial Purchaser a reasonable opportunity to review copies of all such
documents proposed to be filed (in each case, where possible, at least three
Business Days prior to such filing, or such later date as is reasonable under
the circumstances) and to reflect in each such document when so filed
reasonable comments of the Initial Purchaser.

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

          (b)  Prepare and file with the SEC such amendments and post-effective
amendments to each Shelf Registration, as may be necessary to keep such
Registration Statement continuously effective for the Effectiveness Period;
cause the related Prospectus to be supplemented by any prospectus supplement
required by applicable law, and as so supplemented to be filed pursuant to Rule
424 (or any similar provisions then in force) promulgated under the Securities
Act; and comply with the provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with
respect to the disposition of all Registrable Securities covered by such
Registration Statement during the Effectiveness Period in accordance with the
intended methods of distribution set forth in such Registration Statement as so
amended or in such Prospectus as so supplemented.

          (c)  Notify the Selling Holders and Designated Counsel, if any,
promptly (but in any event within two Business Days), (i) when a Prospectus or
any prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration
Statement has been filed, and, with respect to a Registration Statement or any
post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective under the
Securities Act (including in such notice a written statement that any Holder
may, upon request, obtain, at the sole expense of the Company, one conformed
copy of such Registration Statement or post-effective amendment, including
financial statements and schedules, documents incorporated or deemed to be
incorporated by reference and exhibits), (ii) of the issuance by the SEC of any
stop order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any
order preventing or suspending the use of any Prospectus or the initiation of
any proceedings for that purpose, (iii) of the happening of any event, the
existence of any condition or any information becoming known (but not the
nature or details concerning such event, condition or information) that makes
any statement made in such Registration Statement or related Prospectus or any
document incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue
in any material respect or that requires the making of any changes in or
amendments or supplements to such Registration Statement, Prospectus or
documents so that, in the case of the Registration Statement, it will not
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
not misleading, and that in the case of the Prospectus, it will not contain any
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading (provided,
however, that no notice of the Company pursuant to this clause (iii) shall be
required in the event that the Company promptly files a prospectus supplement
to update the Prospectus or a Current Report on Form 8-K or other appropriate
Exchange Act report that is incorporated by reference into the Registration
Statement, which, in either case, contains the requisite information with
respect to such event, condition or information that results in such
Registration Statement no longer containing any untrue statement of a material
fact or omitting to state a material fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading) and (iv) of the Company's determination that
a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate
which notice may in any case, at the discretion of the Company state that it
constitutes a notice of deferral under Section 3(b) hereof.

          (d)  Use its commercially reasonable efforts to prevent the issuance
of any order suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or of any
order preventing or suspending the use of a Prospectus and, if any such order
is issued, to use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain the withdrawal
of any such order at the earliest possible moment or if any such order or

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

suspension is during any Deferral Period, at the earliest possible time after
such Deferral Period ends, and provide prompt notice to the Selling Holders of
the withdrawal of any such order.

          (e)  Furnish as promptly as practicable after the filing of such
documents with the SEC to each Selling Holder and Designated Counsel, if any,
upon request and at the sole expense of the Company, one conformed copy of the
Registration Statement or Registration Statements and each post-effective
amendment thereto, including financial statements and schedules, and, if
requested, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein by
reference and all exhibits.

          (f)  Deliver to each Selling Holder and Designated Counsel, if any, at
the sole expense of the Company, as many copies of the Prospectus (including
each form of preliminary prospectus) and each amendment or supplement thereto
and any documents incorporated by reference therein as such Persons may
reasonably request; and, subject to Sections 4A(a) and 4A(c) hereof, the
Company hereby consents (except during any Deferral Period) to the use of such
Prospectus and each amendment or supplement thereto by each of the Selling
Holders of Registrable Securities and dealers, if any, in connection with the
offering and sale of the Registrable Securities covered by such Prospectus and
any amendment or supplement thereto in the manner set forth therein.

          (g)  Cause the Company's counsel to perform Blue Sky law
investigations and file registrations and qualifications required to be filed
in connection with the registration or qualification (or exemption from such
registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities or offer and sale
under the securities or Blue Sky laws of such jurisdictions within the United
States as any Selling Holder reasonably requests, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to keep each such registration or qualification (or
exemption therefrom) effective during the period such Registration Statement is
required to be kept effective and do any and all other acts or things
reasonably necessary or advisable under Blue Sky laws to enable the disposition
in such jurisdictions of the Registrable Securities covered by the applicable
Registration Statement in the manner set forth therein; provided that the
Company shall not be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any
jurisdiction where it is not then so qualified, (ii) take any action that would
subject it to general service of process in any such jurisdiction where it is
not then so subject or (iii) subject itself to taxation in any such
jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.

          (h)  Cooperate with the Selling Holders and their respective counsel
to facilitate the timely preparation and delivery of certificates representing
shares of Registrable Securities to be sold, which certificates shall not bear
any restrictive legends and shall be in a form eligible for deposit with The
Depository Trust Company; and enable such shares of Registrable Securities to
be in such denominations and registered in such names as the Selling Holders
may reasonably request.

          (i)  Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section
4(c)(ii), 4(c)(iii) or 4(c)(iv) hereof, as promptly as practicable prepare and
(subject to Section 4(a) hereof) file with the SEC, at the sole expense of the
Company, a supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement
or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated or

                                     -10-
<PAGE>

deemed to be incorporated therein by reference, or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable
Securities being sold thereunder, any such Prospectus will not contain an
untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact required
to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light
of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

          (j)  Prior to the effective date of the first Registration Statement
relating to the Registrable Securities, (i) provide the Trustee for the Notes
and the transfer agent for the Common Stock with certificates for the
Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust
Company and (ii) provide a CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities.

          (k)  During the Effectiveness Period, if requested in connection with
a disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement,
make available at reasonable times for inspection by one or more
representatives of the Selling Holders and any attorney or accountant retained
by any such Selling Holders (collectively, the "Inspectors"), at the offices
where normally kept, during reasonable business hours, at such time or times as
shall be mutually convenient for the Company and the Inspectors as a group, all
financial and other records, pertinent corporate documents and instruments of
the Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the "Records") as shall be
reasonably necessary to enable them to exercise any applicable due diligence
responsibilities, and cause the officers, directors and employees of the
Company and its subsidiaries to supply all information reasonably requested by
any such Inspector in connection with such Registration Statement; provided
that the Company shall have no obligation to provide any such information prior
to the execution by the party receiving such information of a confidentiality
agreement in a form reasonably acceptable to the Company. Records that the
Company determines, in good faith, to be confidential and any Records that it
notifies the Inspectors are confidential shall not be used for any purpose
other than satisfying "due diligence" obligations under the Securities Act and
exercising rights under this Agreement and shall not be disclosed by any
Inspector unless (i) the disclosure of such Records is necessary to avoid or
correct a material misstatement or material omission in such Registration
Statement, (ii) the release of such Records is ordered pursuant to a subpoena
or other order from a court of competent jurisdiction, (iii) disclosure of such
information is, in the opinion of counsel for the Selling Holder or any
Inspector, necessary or advisable in connection with any action, claim, suit or
proceeding, directly involving or potentially involving such Selling Holder or
Inspector and arising out of, based upon, relating to, or involving this
Agreement or any transactions contemplated hereby or arising hereunder or (iv)
the information in such Records has been made generally available to the public
other than through the acts of such Inspector; provided that prior notice shall
be provided as soon as practicable to the Company of the potential disclosure
of any information by such Inspector pursuant to clauses (ii) or (iii) of this
sentence to permit the Company to obtain a protective order (or waive the
provisions of this paragraph (k)). Each Inspector shall take such actions as
are reasonably necessary to protect the confidentiality of such information (if
practicable) to the extent such actions are otherwise not inconsistent with, an
impairment of or in derogation of the rights and interests of the Holder or any
Inspector, unless and until such information in such Records has been made
generally available to the public other than as a result of a breach of this
Agreement.

                                     -11-
<PAGE>

          (l)  During the Effectiveness Period, comply with all applicable rules
and regulations of the SEC applicable to any Registration Statement and make
generally available to its security holders earning statements satisfying the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder (or
any similar rule promulgated under the Securities Act) no later than 45 days
after the end of any 12-month period (or 90 days after the end of any 12-month
period if such period is a fiscal year) commencing on the first day of the
first fiscal quarter of the Company after the effective date of a Registration
Statement, which statements shall cover said 12-month periods.

          (m)  Cause the Indenture to be qualified under the TIA not later than
the effective date of the first Registration Statement relating to the
Registrable Securities; and in connection therewith, cooperate with the Trustee
and the Holders of the Registrable Securities and their respective counsel to
effect such changes to the Indenture as may be required for the Indenture to be
so qualified in accordance with the terms of the TIA; and execute, and use all
reasonable efforts to cause the Trustee to execute, all documents as may be
required to effect such changes and all other forms and documents required to
be filed with the SEC to enable the Indenture to be so qualified in a timely
manner.

          (n)  If requested by Designated Counsel, if any, or the Holders of a
majority in Amount of Registrable Securities, (i) promptly incorporate in a
prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment such information as the
Designated Counsel, if any, or such Holders reasonably determine is necessary
to be included therein, (ii) make all required filings of such prospectus
supplement or such post-effective amendment as soon as reasonably practicable
after the Company has received notification of the matters to be incorporated
in such prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment and (iii) supplement
or make amendments to such Registration Statement.

          (o)  Use its commercially reasonable efforts to take all other steps
necessary or advisable to effect the registration of the Registrable Securities
covered by a Registration Statement contemplated hereby, provided that the
Company shall not be required to take any action in connection with an
Underwritten Offering.

     4A.  Holders' Obligations. (a) Each Holder agrees, by acquisition of
the Registrable Securities, that no Holder shall be entitled to sell any of
such Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement or to receive
a Prospectus relating thereto, unless such Holder has furnished the Company
with a Notice and Questionnaire as required pursuant to Section 2(d) hereof
(including the information required to be included in such Notice and
Questionnaire) and the information set forth in the next sentence. Each Selling
Holder agrees promptly to furnish to the Company all information required to be
disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished to the Company
by such Selling Holder not misleading and any other information regarding such
Selling Holder and the distribution of such Registrable Securities as the
Company may from time to time reasonably request. Any sale of any Registrable
Securities by any Holder shall constitute a representation and warranty by such
Holder that the information relating to such Holder and its plan of
distribution is as set forth in the Prospectus delivered by such Holder in
connection with such disposition, that such Prospectus does not as of the time
of such sale contain any untrue statement of a material fact relating to or
provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution and that such Prospectus
does not as of the time of such sale omit to state any material fact relating

                                     -12-
<PAGE>

to or provided by such Holder or its plan of distribution necessary to make the
statements in such Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which
they were made, not misleading.

          (b)  The Company may require each Selling Holder of Registrable
Securities as to which any registration is being effected to furnish to the
Company such additional information regarding such Holder and its plan of
distribution of such Registrable Securities as the Company may, from time to
time, reasonably request to the extent necessary or advisable to comply with
the Securities Act. The Company may exclude from such registration the
Registrable Securities of any Selling Holder if such Holder fails to furnish
such additional information within twenty (20) Business Days after receiving
such request. Each Selling Holder as to which any Shelf Registration is being
effected agrees to furnish promptly to the Company all information required to
be disclosed so that the information previously furnished to the Company by
such Holder is not materially misleading and does not omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading in light of the circumstances under which they were
made.

          (c)  Each Holder of Registrable Securities agrees by acquisition of
such Registrable Securities that, upon actual receipt of any notice from the
Company suspending the availability of the Registration Statement pursuant to
Section 3(b) hereof, or upon the happening of any event of the kind described
in Section 4(c)(ii), 4(c)(iii) or 4(c)(iv) hereof (each Holder agrees to keep
any such notice confidential), such Holder will forthwith discontinue
disposition of such Registrable Securities covered by such Registration
Statement or Prospectus until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented or amended Prospectus contemplated by Section 4(i) hereof, or
until it is advised in writing by the Company that the use of the applicable
Prospectus may be resumed, and it has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in such Prospectus thereto.

     5.   Registration Expenses.
          ---------------------

          (a)  All fees and expenses incident to the performance of or
compliance with this Agreement by the Company shall be borne by the Company,
including, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees (including,
without limitation, fees and expenses of compliance with state securities or
Blue Sky laws, including, without limitation, reasonable fees and disbursements
of counsel in connection with Blue Sky qualifications of the Registrable
Securities and determination of the eligibility of the Registrable Securities
for investment under the laws of such jurisdictions as provided in Section 4(g)
hereof), (ii) printing expenses, including, without limitation, expenses of
printing certificates for Registrable Securities in a form eligible for deposit
with The Depository Trust Company and of printing prospectuses if the printing
of prospectuses is requested by the Holders of a majority in Amount of
Registrable Securities included in any Registration Statement, (iii) messenger,
telephone and delivery expenses, (iv) fees and disbursements of counsel for the
Company, (v) Securities Act liability insurance, if the Company desires such
insurance, (vi) fees and expenses of all other Persons retained by the Company,
(vii) internal expenses of the Company (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of officers and employees of the Company performing legal
or accounting duties), (viii) the expense of any annual audit, (ix) the fees

                                     -13-
<PAGE>

and expenses incurred in connection with the listing of the securities to be
registered on any securities exchange, if applicable, and (x) the expenses
relating to printing, word processing and distributing all Registration
Statements and any other documents necessary in order to comply with this
Agreement. Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, each
Holder shall pay all brokerage commissions with respect to any Registrable
Securities sold by it and, except as set forth in Section 5(b) below, the
Company shall not be responsible for the fees and expenses of any counsel,
accountant or advisor for the Holders.

          (b)  The Company shall bear or reimburse the Holders of the
Registrable Securities being registered in a Shelf Registration for the
reasonable fees and disbursements of Designated Counsel.

     6.   Indemnification.
          ---------------

          (a)  The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless (x) each Holder
(which, for the absence of doubt, for purposes of this Section 6 shall include
the Initial Purchaser), (y) each Person, if any, who controls (within the
meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities Act or Section 20 of the
Exchange Act) any Holder (any of the Persons referred to in this clause (b)
being hereinafter referred to as a "Controlling Person"), and (z) the
respective officers, directors, partners, employees, representatives and agents
of any Holder (including any predecessor holder) or any Controlling Person (any
person referred to in clause (x), (y) or (z) may hereinafter be referred to as
an "Indemnified Holder"), against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to
which such Indemnified Holder may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
or proceedings in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon (i) any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in
any Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement
thereto or any related preliminary prospectus or (ii) the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made; provided that the Company will not be
liable under this Section 6(a), (x) to the extent that any such loss, claim,
damage or liability arises out of or is based upon an untrue statement or
alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission made in any such
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or
any related preliminary prospectus in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information relating to any Holder furnished to the Company by or on
behalf of such Holder specifically for use therein, (y) with respect to any
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement, or omission or alleged omission
made in any preliminary prospectus if the person asserting any such loss,
claim, damage or liability who purchased Registrable Securities which are the
subject thereof did not receive a copy of the Prospectus (or the preliminary
prospectus as then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished

                                     -14-
<PAGE>

such Indemnified Holder with such amendment or supplement thereto on a timely
basis) at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale of such Registrable
Securities to such person and, in any case where such delivery is required by
applicable law, the untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or
alleged omission of a material fact made in such preliminary prospectus was
corrected in the Prospectus (or the preliminary prospectus as then amended or
supplemented if the Company shall have furnished such Indemnified Holder with
such amendment or supplement thereto on a timely basis) or (z) arising from the
offer or sale of Registrable Securities during any Deferral Period, if notice
thereof was given to such Holder. The Company shall notify such Indemnified
Holder promptly of the institution, threat or assertion of any claim,
proceeding (including any governmental investigation) or litigation in
connection with the matters addressed by this Agreement that involves the
Company or such Indemnified Holder.

          (b)  Subject to Section 6(d) below, the Company agrees to reimburse
each Indemnified Holder upon demand for any legal or other out-of-pocket
expenses reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Holder in connection with
investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage or liability, any
action or proceeding or in responding to a subpoena or governmental inquiry
related to the offering of the Registrable Securities, whether or not such
Indemnified Holder is a party to any action or proceeding. In the event that it
is finally judicially determined that an Indemnified Holder was not entitled to
receive payments for legal and other expenses pursuant to this Section 6, such
Indemnified Holder will promptly return all sums that had been advanced
pursuant hereto.

          (c)  Each Holder agrees, severally and not jointly, to indemnify and
hold harmless the Company, its directors and officers and each Person who
controls the Company (within the meaning of either Section 15 of the Securities
Act or Section 20 of the Exchange Act) to the same extent as the indemnity
provided in Section 6(a) from the Company to each Holder, but only with
reference to such losses, claims, damages or liabilities which are caused by
any untrue statement or omission or alleged untrue statement or omission made
in reliance upon and in conformity with information relating to a Holder
furnished to the Company in writing by such Holder expressly for use in any
Registration Statement or Prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto or
any related preliminary prospectus. The liability of any Holder under this
Section 6(c) shall in no event exceed the proceeds received by such Holder from
sales of Registrable Securities giving rise to such obligation.

          (d)  In case any suit, action, proceeding (including any governmental
or regulatory investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted
against any Person in respect of which indemnity may be sought pursuant to
Section 6(a) or (c), such Person (the "Indemnified Person") shall promptly
notify the Person or Persons against whom such indemnity may be sought (each an
"Indemnifying Person") in writing. No indemnification provided for in Section
6(a) or (c) shall be available to any Person who shall have failed to give
notice as provided in this Section 6(d) if the party to whom notice was not
given was unaware of the proceeding to which such notice would have related and
was materially prejudiced by the failure to give such notice. Nevertheless, the
failure to give such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person or
Persons from any liability which it or they may have to the Indemnified Person
for contribution or otherwise than on account of the provisions of Section 6(a)
or (c). In case any such proceeding shall be brought against any Indemnified
Person and it shall notify the Indemnifying Person of the commencement thereof,
the Indemnifying Person shall be entitled to participate therein and, to the
extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other Indemnifying Person similarly
notified, to assume the defense thereof, with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to such Indemnified Person and shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of
presentation) the fees and disbursements of such counsel related to such
proceeding. In any such proceeding, any Indemnified Person shall have the right

                                     -15-
<PAGE>

to retain its own counsel at its own expense. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Indemnifying Person shall pay as incurred (or within 30 days of
presentation) the fees and expenses of the counsel retained by the Indemnified
Person in the event (i) the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person
shall have mutually agreed to the retention of such counsel, (ii) the named
parties to any such proceeding (including any impleaded parties) include both
the Indemnifying Person and the Indemnified Person and representation of both
parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to actual or potential
differing interests between them or (iii) the Indemnifying Person shall have
failed to assume the defense of and employ counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Indemnified Person within a reasonable period of time after notice of
commencement of the action. It is understood that the Indemnifying Person shall
not, in connection with any proceeding or related proceedings in the same
jurisdiction, be liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one
separate firm for all such Indemnified Persons. Such firm shall be designated
in writing by Holders of a majority in Amount of Registrable Securities in the
case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(a) and by the Company in the
case of parties indemnified pursuant to Section 6(c). The Indemnifying Person
shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without its
written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a final
judgment for the plaintiff, the Indemnifying Person agrees to indemnify the
Indemnified Person from and against any loss or liability by reason of such
settlement or judgment. In addition, the Indemnifying Person will not, without
the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person, settle or compromise or
consent to the entry of any judgment in any pending or threatened claim, action
or proceeding of which indemnification may be sought hereunder (whether or not
any Indemnified Person is an actual or potential party to such claim, action or
proceeding) unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an
unconditional release of each Indemnified Person from all liability arising out
of such claim, action or proceeding.

          (e)  To the extent the indemnification provided for in this Section 6
is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an Indemnified Person under
Section 6(a) or (c) in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred to therein, except by
reason of the exceptions set forth in Section 6(a) or (c) or the failure of the
Indemnified Person to give notice as required in Section 6(d), then each
Indemnifying Person shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Person as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities
(or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Indemnifying
Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other hand from the
offering of the Notes pursuant to the Purchase Agreement and the Registrable
Securities pursuant to any Shelf Registration. If, however, the allocation
provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted by applicable
law, then each Indemnifying Person shall contribute to such amount paid or
payable by such Indemnified Person in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of the
Indemnifying Person on the one hand and the Indemnified Person on the other in
connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof),
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits
received by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds
(before deducting expenses) received by the Company under the Purchase

                                     -16-
<PAGE>

Agreement from the offering and sale of the Registrable Securities giving rise
to such obligations. The relative benefits received by any Holder shall be
deemed to be equal to the value of receiving registration rights for the
Registrable Securities under this Agreement. The relative fault of the parties
shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or
alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or alleged omission
to state a material fact relates to information supplied by the Company on the
one hand, such Indemnified Holder on the other, and the parties' relative
intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent
such statement or omission.

          (f)  The Company and the Initial Purchaser agree that it would not be
just and equitable if contribution pursuant to Section 6(e) were determined by
pro rata allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take
account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 6(e). The amount
paid or payable by an Indemnified Person as a result of the losses, claims,
damages or liabilities (or actions or proceedings in respect thereof) referred
to in Section 6(e) shall be deemed to include any legal or other expenses
reasonably incurred by such Indemnified Person in connection with investigating
or defending any such action or claim or enforcing any rights hereunder.
Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 6(e) and (f), (i) in no event shall
any Holder be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by
which the net proceeds received by such Holder from the offering or sale of the
Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement exceeds the
amount of damages which such Holder would have otherwise been required to pay
by reason of such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission and (ii) no Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the
meaning of Section 11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to
contribution from any Person who was not guilty of such fraudulent
misrepresentation.

          (g)  Except as otherwise provided in this Section 6, any losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses for which an Indemnified Person is
entitled to indemnification or contribution under this Section 6 shall be paid
by the Indemnifying Person to the Indemnified Person as such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or expenses are incurred (or within 30 days of
presentation).

     7.   Rules 144 and 144A.
          ------------------

<PAGE>

time before the expiration of the Effectiveness Period the Company is not
required to file such reports, it will, upon the request of any Holder, make
available such information necessary to permit sales pursuant to Rule 144A
under the Securities Act. The Company further covenants that, until the
Effectiveness Period has expired, it will use all reasonable efforts to take
such further action as any Holder of Registrable Securities may reasonably
request, all to the extent required from time to time to enable such holder to
sell Registrable Securities without registration under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions provided by (a) Rule 144 and Rule 144A
under the Securities Act, as such rules may be amended from time to time, or
(b) any similar rule or regulation hereafter adopted by the SEC. The Company
will provide a copy of this Agreement to prospective purchasers of Registrable
Securities identified to the Company by the Initial Purchaser upon request.
Upon the request of any Holder, the Company shall deliver to such Holder a
written statement as to whether it is subject to and has complied with such
requirements. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7 shall be
deemed to require the Company to register any of its securities pursuant to the
Exchange Act.

     8.   Underwritten Registrations.
          --------------------------

          No Holder of Registrable Securities may participate in any
Underwritten Registration hereunder.

     9.   Miscellaneous.
          -------------

          (a)  No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not, as of the date
hereof, and the Company shall not, after the date of this Agreement, enter into
any agreement with respect to any of its securities that is inconsistent with
the rights granted to the Holders of Registrable Securities in this Agreement
or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.

          (b)  Adjustments Affecting Registrable Securities. The Company shall
not, directly or indirectly, take any action with respect to the Registrable
Securities as a class with the intent of adversely affecting the ability of the
Holders of Registrable Securities to include such Registrable Securities in a
registration undertaken pursuant to this Agreement.

          (c)  Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not
be amended, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures
from the provisions hereof may not be given, otherwise than with the prior
written consent of the Company and the Holders of not less than a majority in
Amount of Registrable Securities; provided that Section 6 and this Section 9(c)
may not be amended, modified or supplemented without the prior written consent
of the Company and each Holder (including, in the case of an amendment,
modification or supplement of Section 6, any Person who was a Holder of
Registrable Securities disposed of pursuant to any Registration Statement).
Notwithstanding the foregoing, a waiver or consent to depart from the
provisions hereof with respect to a matter that relates exclusively to the
rights of Holders of Registrable Securities whose securities are being sold
pursuant to a Registration Statement and that does not directly or indirectly
affect, impair, limit or compromise the rights of other Holders of Registrable
Securities may be given by Holders of at least a majority in Amount of
Registrable Securities being sold by such Holders pursuant to such Registration
Statement. Each Holder of Registrable Securities outstanding at the time of any
amendment, modification, supplement, waiver, or consent or thereafter shall be

                                     -18-

effected pursuant to this Section, whether or not any notice of such amendment,
