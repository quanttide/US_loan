Sam&#8217;s Club and a 103,000 sq. ft. Home Depot.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">The purchase price was approximately $28.4 million including closing costs and was fully funded from the Company&#8217;s secured revolving floating-rate credit facility.  The property, in turn, is expected to become a borrowing-base collateral property in the Company&#8217;s credit facility.  The Company within the last month raised approximately $38.3 million in a common stock offering, the proceeds of which were used to pay down the credit facility.  </font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">This purchase represents the Company&#8217;s second Connecticut property; the Company purchased the Wal-Mart center in Southington, Connecticut, approximately 13 miles from the Brickyard Shopping Center, in August 2003.  On November 1, the Company purchased another New England property, Franklin Village Plaza in Franklin, Massachusetts, for approximately $73 million, as previously reported.  The Company acquired shopping center properties at an aggregate cost of approximately $165 million during 2004.</font></p>
