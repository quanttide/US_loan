<p>HOUSTON, Dec. 23 /PRNewswire-FirstCall/ -- Trico Marine Services, Inc. (OTC
Pink Sheets:
<font COLOR="#0000ff"><u>TMAR</u></font> -
<font color="#0000FF"><u>News</u></font>;
the &quot;Company&quot; or &quot;Trico&quot;) today announced that the United States Bankruptcy
Court for the Southern District of New York has granted, on an interim or final
basis, the relief sought by the Company in its initial motions, clearing the way
for Trico to continue to pay its employees and vendors, approving on an interim
basis new financing for the Company and setting a January 19 hearing date for
consideration of the Company's reorganization plan. The approval of yesterday's
motions permits Trico to continue normal operations throughout the restructuring
process. All services provided to customers are continuing on a &quot;business as
usual&quot; basis. </p>
<p><b>Trico's Bankruptcy Motions and Chapter 11 Filing </b> </p>
<p>As previously indicated, the Company and two of its domestic subsidiaries
filed a &quot;prepackaged&quot; chapter 11 financial reorganization case in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. As part of its
bankruptcy filing, the Company also filed with the Bankruptcy Court its
prepackaged plan of reorganization, which would restructure and substantially
reduce the Company's debt, strengthen its balance sheet, and increase its
liquidity. </p>
<p>The initial motions filed by the Company, and approved yesterday by the
bankruptcy court, permit the Company to continue to pay its employees salaries
and benefits, to pay vendors in the ordinary course of business, and to maintain
its cash management systems. The bankruptcy court also approved, on an interim
basis, a new $75 million debtor-in-possession (&quot;DIP&quot;) financing facility with
its existing U.S. lenders, which will provide the Company and its subsidiaries
with an additional $10 million of undrawn liquidity. The DIP facility is
comprised of a $55 million term loan, which will be used to pay all of the
outstanding indebtedness under the Company's existing U.S. secured term loan,
and a new $20 million revolving credit facility, $10 million of which is
available to the Company on an interim basis until the January 19, 2005
confirmation hearing. Upon effectiveness of Trico's plan of reorganization, and
the satisfaction of certain conditions precedent thereunder, the DIP facility
will convert into a $75 million exit financing facility, comprised of a $55
million term loan and a $20 million revolving credit facility, which will
provide the reorganized Company with liquidity for working capital and other
general corporate purposes. </p>
<p>The bankruptcy court set a January 19, 2005 hearing date for the final order
on the Company's postpetition credit agreement and for confirmation of the
prepackaged plan of reorganization. As previously announced, holders of the
Company's $250 million 8 7/8% senior notes due 2012 (the &quot;Senior Notes&quot;) have
voted overwhelmingly to accept the plan. The Company's plan has received
acceptances from 99.9% of the eligible creditors who cast votes on the plan.
Based on this high degree of support, the Company is hopeful that the plan will
be approved in all material respects and that its exit from chapter 11 will not
be delayed for any substantial length of time after the January 19, 2005
hearing. </p>
<p>Chapter 11 petitions have been filed by the following three Trico entities:
Trico Marine Services, Inc.; Trico Marine Assets, Inc.; and Trico Marine
Operators, Inc. Non-filing entities not affected by these bankruptcy proceedings
include Trico Marine International, Inc. and the following 11 direct and
indirect foreign affiliates of Trico: Trico Servicos Maritimos Ltda. (Brazil);
Coastal Inland Marine Services Ltd. (Nigeria); Trico Marine International, Ltd.
(Cayman); Trico Marine International Holdings B.V. (Netherlands); Trico Supply
AS (Norway); Trico Shipping AS (Norway); Trico Supply (UK) Limited (England &amp;
Wales); Albyn Marine Limited (England &amp; Wales); CHH-Trico PTE Ltd. (Singapore);
Servicos de Apoyo Maritimo de Mexico, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Mexico); and, finally,
Naviera Mexicana de Servicios, S. (Mexico). </p>
<p><b>The Trico Plan </b> </p>
<p>As previously announced, under Trico's plan of reorganization, the holders of
the Senior Notes will receive, in exchange for their total claims (including
principal and accrued and unpaid interest), 100% of the fully diluted new common
stock of the reorganized Trico Marine Services, Inc., before giving effect to
(i) the exercise of warrants to be distributed to the Company's existing holders
of common stock pursuant to the plan and (ii) a new employee option plan. On the
effective date of the plan of reorganization, the sole equity interests in the
reorganized Company will consist of the new common stock issued to the holders
of the Senior Notes, the warrants, and options to be issued to employees. Copies
of the plan of reorganization, disclosure statement and related documents will
be available at <font color="#0000FF"><u>http://www.kccllc.net/trico</u></font>. </p>
<p>The Company's obligations under existing operating leases, or trade credit
extended to the Company by its vendors and suppliers, will be unaffected by the
restructuring and will be paid in full. </p>
