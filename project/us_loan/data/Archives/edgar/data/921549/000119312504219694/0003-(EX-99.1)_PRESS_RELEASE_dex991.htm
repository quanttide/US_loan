or &#147;<U>Trico</U>&#148;) today announced that, as previously indicated, it and two of its domestic subsidiaries have filed a &#147;prepackaged&#148; chapter 11 financial reorganization case to restructure and substantially reduce the
Company&#146;s debt, strengthen its balance sheet, and increase its liquidity. The prepackaged bankruptcy case was filed today in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York. As part of its bankruptcy filing, the Company
also filed with the Bankruptcy Court its prepackaged plan of reorganization. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">Holders of the Company&#146;s $250 million 8 7/8% senior notes due 2012 (the &#147;<U>Senior Notes</U>&#148;) voted overwhelmingly to accept the plan. The Company&#146;s plan has received acceptances from 99.9% of the creditors who cast
votes on the plan. Based on this high degree of support, it is expected that Trico will complete its restructuring quickly, with the Company&#146;s exit from chapter 11 expected to occur in less than 60 days. </FONT></P> <P

restructuring process. All services provided to customers are expected to continue on a &#147;business as usual&#148; basis. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;We have worked over the last several months with our creditor groups to reach an agreement on a debt restructuring. During this period, we have made the necessary
preparations to ensure that the restructuring does not impact the services that Trico provides to its customers. We intend to utilize this restructuring to strengthen our business. During the restructuring, services will remain unaltered and all
vendors can expect timely payment for postpetition goods and services,&#148; said Thomas Fairley, Trico&#146;s Chief Executive Officer. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In connection with the commencement of bankruptcy, the Company also entered into a $75 million debtor-in-possession (&#147;<U>DIP</U>&#148;) financing facility with its
existing U.S. lenders. The DIP facility is comprised of a $55 million term loan, which will be used to pay all of the outstanding indebtedness under the Company&#146;s existing U.S. secured term loan, and a new $20 million revolving credit facility.
Following court approval, the new funding will supplement Trico&#146;s existing capital and allow the Company to meet its obligations related to the operation of its businesses, fulfill its payroll obligations, and pay vendors for goods and services
provided after the bankruptcy filing. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Trico&#146;s operating cash, together with the amounts obtained under its debtor-in-possession financing facility,
will enable it to operate its business and emerge from bankruptcy stronger, more streamlined, and in a better position to achieve our business goals,&#148; said Fairley. Upon effectiveness of Trico&#146;s plan of reorganization, and the satisfaction
of certain conditions precedent thereunder, the DIP facility will convert into a $75 million exit financing facility, comprised of a $55 million term loan and a $20 million revolving credit facility, which will provide the reorganized Company with
liquidity for working capital and other general corporate purposes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>The

of reorganization, Trico asked the Bankruptcy Court to consider several motions benefiting its employees, vendors, service providers, customers, and other stakeholders. Trico has asked for the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s permission to continue paying
its employees&#146; salaries and benefits, paying its vendors, maintaining its cash management systems, and to obtain financing. Trico&#146;s proposed payment of its prepetition debts, such as outstanding payments to the Company&#146;s vendors and
service providers, is subject to the approval of the Bankruptcy Court. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The
Company made its bankruptcy filings in accordance with the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s special guidelines for &#147;prepackaged&#148; bankruptcy cases, pursuant to which Trico solicited and obtained the consent of its creditors to its plan of
reorganization prior to the filing of the Chapter 11 cases. This pre-filing solicitation is expected to shorten the duration of Trico&#146;s bankruptcy. Trico expects to emerge from bankruptcy very quickly, subject to the Bankruptcy Court&#146;s
approval and hearing schedule, perhaps in 60 days or less. Trico asked the Bankruptcy Court to set a plan confirmation hearing date within 30-45 days from today. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

reorganization follows a period of negative operating results attributable to weak demand for its vessels in the Gulf of Mexico and the North Sea. In response, Trico has cut costs to preserve liquidity, refinanced its credit facilities and sold some
vessels. Other vessels have been relocated to more active markets to improve operating results. Trico will continue these measures under its new ownership and capital structure. The restructuring of Trico is designed to reenergize Trico&#146;s
efforts to expand and compete in regions expected to become more active sites of oil and gas exploration. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
