ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

          On  December  17,  2004,  Everlast  Worldwide,  Inc.  (the  "Company")
executed a license agreement (the "License Agreement") with Jacques Moret, Inc.,
a New York  corporation  (the  "Licensee").  The  License  Agreement  grants the
Licensee,  a supplier of women's apparel in the United States, a license for the
use  of  the  Everlast(R)  mark  in  the  United  States,  its  territories  and
possessions,  and any and all U.S.  military  installations  and bases worldwide
(the "Covered Territory")  commencing on January 1, 2005 (the "Effective Date").
Pursuant to the terms of the License Agreement,  the Licensee shall, among other
things,  pay  royalties  of five  percent  of net sales of product  licensed  to
Licensee (the "Licensed Products"), subject to certain exceptions, with at least
$12,500,000 in guaranteed royalties to the Company in the first five-year term.

          The Licensee acknowledged that the Company is currently a party to one
or more  third-party  licenses in the  Covered  Territory  (each a  "Third-Party
License")  that are valid and in effect  as of the  Effective  Date for  certain
types of women's apparel. The License Agreement,  however,  provides that in the
event that any Third-Party  License expires, or is terminated during the term on
the License Agreement, the Licensee shall have a right of first refusal to enter
into a new license to replace such expired or terminated Third-Party License.

          The License Agreement  terminates on December 31, 2009 and, subject to
certain  conditions,  may be renewed  for two  additional  five year  terms.  In
addition,  subject  to  certain  conditions  being  met,  the  Licensee  has the
additional  option as of December 31, 2009 to convert the License Agreement to a
fully-paid  exclusive  license for a term of 99 years,  with automatic  one-year
renewals in perpetuity thereafter at the Licensee's option, for the price of $26
million, or at December 31, 2014 for a minimum price of $30 million.

ITEM 5 -  OTHER EVENTS AND REGULATION FD DISCLOSURE.

          On December 17, 2004, the Company issued a press release to report the
execution of the License  Agreement.  Pursuant to General  Instruction F to Form
8-K, the press release  attached  hereto as Exhibit 99.1, is  incorporated  into
this Item 5 by reference.

ITEM 7.   FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION AND EXHIBITS.
