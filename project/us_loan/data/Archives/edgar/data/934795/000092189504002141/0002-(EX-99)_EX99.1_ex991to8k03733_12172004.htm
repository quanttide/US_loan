     EVERLAST WORLDWIDE INC. ANNOUNCES THE SIGNING OF THE LARGEST LICENSING
                     AGREEMENT IN COMPANY'S 94 YEAR HISTORY

       COMPANY LICENSES US WOMEN'S APPAREL CATEGORY TO JACQUES MORET, INC.

   5 YEAR LICENSE AGREEMENT PROVIDES FOR MINIMUM ROYALTY GUARANTEE PAYMENTS OF
  $12.5 MILLION WITH A LONG TERM OPTION IN 2009 FOR AN ADDITIONAL $30 MILLION


     NEW YORK, New York, December 17, 2004 -- Everlast(R) Worldwide Inc.
(Nasdaq: EVST), manufacturer, marketer and licensor of sporting goods and
apparel under the Everlast brand name, today announced the signing of its
largest license agreement to date with Jacques Moret, Inc. of New York City. As
of January 1, 2005, this new agreement grants Moret, a major supplier to the US
women's apparel market, a license for Everlast women's apparel in the United
States.

     Under the terms of the five-year agreement, Jacques Moret, Inc. will pay
approximately $12.5 million in minimum guarantees to Everlast, noting that
strong potential royalty earnings in excess of this amount are possible. At the
end of this initial five-year term, Moret has the option to sign a ninety-nine
year license for women's apparel rights for approximately $30 million.
Additionally, Moret will assume and pay for all women's apparel inventory
purchased by Everlast, future advertisements previously placed by the company
and other transitional costs associated with the women's business.

     George Horowitz, chairman, CEO, and president of Everlast said, "Everlast
has achieved tremendous success from operating its own women's apparel business.
We came to the conclusion that the brand would greatly benefit from licensing
the women's apparel category to Jacques Moret, Inc., one of the industry's
leading suppliers. As a result of this agreement, the women's line will benefit
from Moret's abilities for sourcing due to economies of scale. In addition, this
agreement with Moret will result in expanded distribution opportunities that are

available to large apparel companies such as Moret. We are quite familiar with
the management of Moret and their strengths, as we granted our Canadian women's
apparel license to them earlier this year. This helped to make the decision to
grant this license for US women's apparel an easy one."

     Horowitz continued, "Distribution levels of Everlast women's apparel will
remain unchanged and will continue to be focused on department and specialty
stores, mid-tier stores as well as sporting goods retailers. Further, this new
US women's apparel license complements our licensing agreement with FuDa for US
women's outerwear and wind wear. Also, our license with the famous Parisian
designer and apparel retailer, agnes b, will continue to have its US stores
supplied with our goods from Europe."

     In order to facilitate a smooth transition and continued Everlast growth,
Jacques Moret, Inc. has agreed to hire key sales, merchandising, and operating
personnel previously employed by Everlast's women's apparel division. Orders
already placed with Everlast for spring and summer women's apparel will be fully
shipped in joint efforts between Everlast and Jacques Moret, Inc. during the
transition period. Customer satisfaction and avoidance of disruptions will be a
top priority for both companies.

     Joey Harary, president of Jacques Moret, Inc. stated," We are extremely
excited with our relationship with Everlast. We have every belief that we will
be able to put the resources behind Everlast women's apparel that will result in
a significant expansion of shelf-space and an increase in Everlast's brand
equity."

     He continued, "Over the past four years, the management of Everlast
Worldwide has taken the brand to new heights of consumer awareness through
innovative marketing and merchandising programs. Their ability to execute one
major brand exposure campaign after the other, through product placement in the
critically-acclaimed movie Million Dollar Baby to the anticipated unscripted
drama, The Contender, produced by Mark Burnett Productions and DreamWorks, has
quite frankly amazed us."

     George Horowitz concluded by stating, "Licensing women's apparel to Jacques
Moret will allow Everlast management to focus its talents and efforts on our US
men's apparel, professional and retail boxing equipment and worldwide licensing
businesses, which have achieved double digit growth rates during 2004. In
addition, by streamlining our apparel businesses, we believe we will be able to
identify and execute even more cost containment initiatives that will start to
benefit Everlast's operating results, commencing in 2005."
