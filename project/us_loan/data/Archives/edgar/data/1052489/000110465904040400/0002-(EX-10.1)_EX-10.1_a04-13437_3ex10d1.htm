respect to the Subleased Premises, provided however that the Sublessee shall
not be responsible for:&#160; (1)

to pay for Site Assessments under Section&nbsp;10(c) of the Master Lease, any
costs not relating to an Environmental Violation first arising after the
commencement of the Term of this Sublease; (3) any Environmental Violation as

fails to commence to remediate and or correct Environmental Violations and
other violations for which the Sublessor is responsible under the immediately
preceding sentence, within thirty&nbsp;(30) days after the Sublessor&#146;s receipt

self-help remedies, then the Sublessee may perform such obligations on behalf

is the Sublessor&#146;s responsibility and/or the reasonableness of the costs
incurred, the Sublessee&#146;s sole recourse shall be to commence an appropriate
action against the Sublessor in a court of competent jurisdiction.&#160; If the Sublessee obtains a final

described on attached <u>Exhibit&nbsp;D</u>.&#160;
The Sublessor and the Sublessee represent and warrant that each shall
use good-faith diligent efforts to obtain all such documents and satisfy such
contingencies on or before the Contingency Date.&#160; Notwithstanding the foregoing, if all such

and/or transfer of any shares of the Sublessee, regardless of whether such

Landlord and all other approvals and consents required under the Master Lease

Sublessee of its primary liability under this Sublease.&#160; The consent by the Sublessor and/or the
Master Landlord to any assignment or subletting shall not render unnecessary
consent to any further assignment or subletting.&#160; The Sublessor shall reasonably cooperate with
the Sublessee&#146;s efforts to promptly obtain the Master Landlord&#146;s consent to the
extent required under the Master Lease provided that the Sublessor has consented
to same (which Sublessor&#146;s consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed).&#160; In the event
that the Sublessee desires to assign or sublet and such assignment or sublease
would trigger the payment of a security deposit under Section&nbsp;21 of the
Master Lease, to the extent such payment has not been waived by the Master
Landlord pursuant to the terms of the SNDA&#160; and provided that the Master Landlord
will not require the payment of same from the Sublessor, then the Sublessee
shall be responsible for the payment thereof.</p>

provided in the last sentence of this Section&nbsp;11) to obtain the approval
of the Master Landlord and obtain all required approvals and comply with the

Sublessee&#146;s use requires modifications to the Subleased Premises in order to

compliance at the Sublessee&#146;s expense.&#160;

removal of any improvements or alterations performed by or for the Sublessee or
any restoration, the Sublessee shall be responsible for such removal and
restoration.&#160; Notwithstanding the
foregoing to the contrary, the Sublessor&#146;s consent shall not be required and
shall be deemed given to any alterations or improvements to which the Master
Landlord consents in writing provided that the Sublessor shall have no
responsibility whatsoever for said alterations and improvements and will not
have any removal or restoration obligations with respect thereto.&#160; The Sublessor represents and warrants to the
Sublessee that there have been no alterations or improvements that were made to
the Subleased Premises prior to the commencement of the Term of this Sublease
that the Sublessor is required to remove and restore upon the expiration or
earlier termination of the Master Lease.&#160;
Prior to the commencement of this Sublease, the Sublessor shall use
reasonable efforts to obtain from the Master Landlord an estoppel certificate
confirming the foregoing representation.&#160; The Sublessor shall reasonably cooperate with
the Sublessee&#146;s efforts to obtain the Master Landlord&#146;s consent, approval or
other action under the Master Lease and Master Landlord&#146;s written agreement
that the alterations need not be removed at the expiration of the Sublease term
relative to any such alterations proposed to be made by the Sublessee, provided
however, it is understood that the Sublessor shall not have liability with
respect thereto.&#160; With respect to any
work required under this Sublease to be completed by the Sublessor, such shall
be subject to obtaining the prior written consent of the Master Landlord to the
extent required by the Master Lease, and the Sublessor shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain from the Master Landlord such consent and agreement that the
alterations need not be removed at the expiration of the Sublease term, to the
