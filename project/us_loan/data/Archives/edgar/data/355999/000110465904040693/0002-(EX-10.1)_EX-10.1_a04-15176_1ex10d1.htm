The Company, or its transfer agent, will distribute to the Participant
certificates for&#160; any portion of the

If the Participant dies before the Company has distributed certificates
for any vested portion of the Restricted Shares, the Company will distribute
certificates for that vested portion of the Restricted Shares and, to the
extent provided under Section 4 hereof, the remaining balance of the Restricted
Shares which become vested upon the Participant&#146;s death to the beneficiary
designated by the Participant on a form provided by the Company for this
purpose.&#160; If the Participant failed to
designate a beneficiary, the Company will distribute certificates for such
Restricted Shares in accordance with the Participant&#146;s will or, if the Participant
did not have a will, in accordance with the laws of descent and distribution.</font></p>

foregoing, the Committee may require the Participant, or the alternate
recipient identified in the preceding paragraph, to satisfy any potential federal,
state, local or other tax withholding liability.&#160; Such liability must be satisfied at the time
such Restricted Shares become &#147;substantially vested&#148; (as defined in the
regulations issued under Section 83 of the Code).&#160; At the election of the Participant, and
subject to such rules and limitations as may be established by the Committee
from time to time, such withholding obligations may be satisfied: (A) through a
cash payment by the Participant, (B) through the surrender of shares of Stock
that the Participant already owns (provided, however, to the extent shares
described in this clause (B) are used to satisfy more than the minimum
statutory withholding obligation, as described below, then payments made with
shares of Stock in accordance with this clause (B) shall be limited to shares
held by the Participant for not less than six months prior to the payment
date), (C) through the surrender of shares of Stock to which the Participant is
otherwise entitled in respect of the Award under this Agreement; provided,
however, that such shares under this clause (C) may be used to satisfy not more
than the minimum statutory withholding obligation of the Company or applicable

Despite the provisions of Sections 4 and 5 hereof, the Company is not
required to issue or deliver any certificates for Restricted Shares if at any
time the Company determines that the listing, registration or qualification of
such Restricted Shares upon any securities exchange or under any law, the
consent or approval of any governmental body or the taking of any other action
is necessary or desirable as a condition of, or in connection with, the
delivery of the Restricted Shares hereunder in compliance with all applicable
laws and regulations, unless such listing, registration, qualification,
consent, approval or other action has been effected or obtained, free of any
conditions not acceptable to the Company.</font></p>

distribution.&#160; Distribution of Restricted
Shares will be made only to the Participant; or, if the Committee has been
provided with evidence acceptable to it that the Participant is legally
incompetent, the Participant&#146;s personal representative; or, if the Participant
is deceased, to the designated beneficiary or other appropriate recipient in
accordance with Section 5 hereof.&#160; The
Committee may require personal receipts or endorsements of a Participant&#146;s
personal representative, designated beneficiary or alternate recipient provided
for herein, and the Committee shall extend to those individuals the rights
otherwise exercisable by the Participant with regard to any withholding tax
election in accordance with Section 5 hereof.&#160;
Any effort to otherwise assign or transfer any Restricted Shares (before
they are distributed) or any rights or interests therein or thereto under this
Agreement will be wholly ineffective, and will be grounds for termination by
the Committee of all rights and interests of the Participant and his or her
beneficiary in and under this Agreement.</font></p>
