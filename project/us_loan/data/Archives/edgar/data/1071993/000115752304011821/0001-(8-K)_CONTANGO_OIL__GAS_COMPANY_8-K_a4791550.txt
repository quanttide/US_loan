ITEM 2.01  COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

     On December 29, 2004, Contango Oil & Gas Company (the "Company")  completed
the sale of  substantially  all of its south Texas natural gas and oil interests
to Edge  Petroleum  Corporation  for $50  million.  The sale was  approved  by a
majority of the Company's  stockholders  at a Special Meeting of Stockholders on
December 29, 2004.  Pre-tax  proceeds to the Company after  netting  adjustments
will equal approximately  $43.2 million.  Adjustments were made for net revenues
that the Company  received  for  production  occurring  after July 1, 2004,  the
effective date of sale, up to the closing date of December 29, 2004. The Company
estimates taxes owed as a result of this sale at approximately  $8 million.  The
Company has no debt and  estimates it will have net proceeds  after taxes of $35
million.  Further  information  regarding  the  asset  sale is set  forth in the
Company's  definitive  proxy  statement  filed with the  Securities and Exchange
Commission on December 7, 2004.
