     MINERA ANDES CLOSES MACQUARIE BANK FINANCING FOR HUEVOS VERDES PROJECT

SPOKANE, WASHINGTON - December 16, 2004 - Minera Andes Inc. (TSX-V: MAI and US
OTC: MNEAF) today announces it has closed on the US$2 million first tranche of
the US$4 million loan facility from Macquarie Bank Limited ("Macquarie"). This
facility is being provided in two tranches for funding of Minera Andes' 49%
portion of the costs of completing a bankable feasibility study and related
development work for the San Jose/Huevos Verdes silver/gold project in
Argentina. Macquarie is an international banking group active in providing
project financing to the mining sector.

Macquarie has advanced US$1 million of the first US$2 million tranche and the
balance of US$1 million will be available to Minera Andes on fulfillment of
certain outstanding conditions precedent relating to security and similar
matters. This first tranche of US$2 million is available for up to two-years
from draw-down. The second tranche of the facility, being an additional US$2
million, is to be provided prior to June 30, 2005, subject to achievement of
positive exploration and development at Huevos Verdes to the satisfaction of
Macquarie, regulatory approvals, and completion of documentation.

The commercial terms of the loan include a facility fee of 1.5% of the principal
amount of the initial tranche and an interest rate of Libor plus 2% p.a.,
currently totaling approx 4.1% p.a. In addition, a success fee of US$20,000,
being one percent of the principal amount of the first tranche, is payable to
Xystus Limited for assisting with the structuring and negotiation of the loan
facility.

In connection with the first tranche of the facility, Minera Andes has issued
share purchase warrants to Macquarie to acquire 2,738,700 Common Shares of
Minera Andes at an exercise price of Cdn$0.91 per share. The warrants exercise
price was calculated at a 20 percent premium to the volume weighted average of
Minera Andes' common stock determined from the ten business days prior to
acceptance of this offer. Each warrant is to be exercisable for two years and
will expire on December 15, 2006. Additional share purchase warrants will be
issueable to Macquarie in regard to the second tranche of US$2.0 million, on
terms calculated in a similar manner at that time, upon fulfillment of
conditions precedent for that tranche and appropriate regulatory approvals.

Minera Andes is funded with working capital of approximately US$1.7 million for
its exploration and underground construction programs. Minera Andes is a mining
exploration company focused on gold, silver and copper exploration in Argentina
where it holds about 200,000 hectares (500,000 acres) of mineral exploration
land and co-owns the advanced stage San Jose/Huevos Verdes silver/gold project
now under construction for possible mine production, with a feasibility study
