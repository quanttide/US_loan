between &#091;Purchaser&#093; and Holder. Capitalized terms used herein and not defined
herein have the meaning set forth in the Company Support Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby acknowledge that I have carefully reviewed the Company Support
Agreement and such other documents as I have deemed appropriate. I have
discussed the contents of the Company Support Agreement, to the extent I felt
necessary, with my legal counsel. I understand fully the transactions
described in the Company Support Agreement, and I hereby approve of and consent
to all such transactions. I am aware that by the provisions of the Company
Support Agreement, my spouse agrees, among other things, to vote all of the
outstanding shares of Company capital stock that he or she now owns or
hereafter acquires, including my community property interest therein, if any,
in accordance with the Company Support Agreement, and that my spouse agrees,
among other things, to certain matters related to the control and disposition
of Company capital stock. I hereby agree, on behalf of myself and all persons
who may claim on my behalf, that prior to fulfillment of all of my spouse&#146;s
obligations under the Company Support Agreement in accordance with the terms
and provisions of the Company Support Agreement, upon any legal separation from
or dissolution of my marriage to my present spouse, or upon the death of my
spouse, any transferee of Company capital stock upon the partition of my or my
spouse&#146;s community property interest in the Company capital stock, shall, as a
precondition to such transfer, agree in writing to be bound by all of the terms
of the Company Support Agreement.
