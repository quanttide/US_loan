FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Chester, Virginia &#150; December 20, 2004 &#150; Star Scientific, Inc. (NASDAQ:STSI) today issued the following statement by Paul L. Perito, Esquire, the company&#146;s Chairman, President and COO: </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Last week RJ Reynolds notified Star Scientific by letter that the market
test of the hard smokeless tobacco product manufactured by our company for B&amp;W was &#147;deemed unsuccessful&#148;. We find this decision to be quite puzzling. We understood, based on conversations between individuals at Star and Reynolds, that
the hard tobacco test market had been very successful, and that enthusiasm had been expressed about getting this product on the market quickly. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In light of the fact that the trial of our patent infringement lawsuit against Reynolds is now scheduled to begin in one month&#146;s time, we wonder
whether the test market determination may have been influenced by litigation considerations rather than consumer reaction to the product. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Reynolds, which has described itself as a successor to B&amp;W, also informed us that the April 2001 Hard Tobacco Agreement between Star and B&amp;W was
terminated. As a result of the termination of the Agreement, however, B&amp;W and purportedly RJR are now prohibited from manufacturing, selling or distributing a hard tobacco product, and from competing with Star in the manufacture, sale or
distribution of any such product, for the next four years. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:-6px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; margin-left:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">It
is unfortunate that B&amp;W, and RJR as the purported and self-described successor to B&amp;W, have chosen to take themselves out of an emerging market with enormous potential just as it is beginning to take shape. Star&#146;s role as a leader in
this market has been further enhanced by the notification the company received last week, from the US Patent and Trademark Office, that another patent for smokeless tobacco will issue as US Patent No. 6,834,654 on December 28</FONT><FONT

hard tobacco product testing and manufacture, and we will continue to aggressively pursue additional partnerships that do not conflict with existing agreements. We also will continue to market and distribute our own breakthrough dissolvable hard
tobacco products, Ariva&reg; and Stonewall Hard Snuff&reg;. </FONT></P>
