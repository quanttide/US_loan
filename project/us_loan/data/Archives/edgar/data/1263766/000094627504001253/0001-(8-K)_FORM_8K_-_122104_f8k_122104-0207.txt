                      INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN REPORT
                      ------------------------------------


Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement
          ------------------------------------------
         The Board of  Directors  of the Company  adopted the Synergy  Financial
Group,  Inc.  Retirement  Benefits  Equalization Plan ("Plan") at its meeting on
December 21, 2004 to be  effective as of January 1, 2005.  The Plan will provide
the  participating  executives  with the same level of  benefits  that all other
employees are eligible to receive under the Company's  employee stock  ownership
plan and 401K  Savings  Plan  without  regard  to the  limitations  on levels of
compensation  and annual benefits  imposed under Sections  401(a)(17) and 415 of
the Internal  Revenue  Code.  Specifically,  the Plan will  provide  benefits to
officers that cannot be provided under the employee stock ownership plan and the
401K Savings Plan as a result of limitations  imposed by Sections 401(a)(17) and
415 of the Internal  Revenue Code,  but that would have been provided  under the
employee stock  ownership plan and the 401K Savings Plan, but for these Internal
Revenue Code limitations.  For example, this Plan will provide participants with
a benefit for any compensation that they may earn in excess of $205,000 per year
(as indexed)  comparable to the benefits  earned by all  participants  under the
employee stock ownership plan and the 401K Savings Plan for compensation  earned
below that level.  The Company may utilize a grantor  trust in  connection  with
this  Plan in  order  to set  aside  funds  that  ultimately  may be used to pay
benefits  under the Plan. The assets of the grantor trust will remain subject to
the claims of general creditors of the Company in the event of insolvency, until
paid to a participant following termination of employment according to the terms
of the Plan.  The  actual  value of  benefits  under  this  Plan and the  annual
financial  reporting  expense  associated  with  this  Plan  will be  calculated
annually based upon a variety of factors, including the actual value of benefits
for participants determined under the employee stock ownership plan and the 401K
Savings Plan each year, the applicable  limitations  under the Internal  Revenue
Code that are subject to adjustment  annually and the salary of each participant
at such  time.  Generally,  benefits  under  the Plan  will be  taxable  to each
participant  at the  time of  receipt  of such  payment,  and the  Company  will
recognize a tax-deductible compensation expense at such time.

         In addition,  the Board of Directors  of Synergy Bank (the  "Bank"),  a
wholly-owned  subsidiary of the Company,  also approved an amendment to the Life
Insurance Agreement between the Bank and John S. Fiore,  President,  which shall
provide a death benefit  payable to Mr. Fiore's  beneficiaries  of $2.0 million.
The prior  arrangement  provided for a reduction of such death benefit following
retirement after age 60.
