Item 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 30, 2004,  MedSolutions,  Inc. (the "Company") entered into
an  employment  agreement  (the  "Employment  Agreement")  with Mr.  Matthew  H.
Fleeger,  the Company's  President and Chief Executive Officer.  Pursuant to its
terms,  the Employment  Agreement will become  effective on January 1, 2005 (the
"Effective  Date").  The initial  term of the  Employment  Agreement  expires on
December 31, 2007,  at which time such term will  automatically  renew for up to
two additional  one-year terms unless either the Company or Mr. Fleeger provides
written notice of intent not to renew to the other party at least 90 days before
the expiration of the then-current term.

         Pursuant to the terms of the  Employment  Agreement,  Mr.  Fleeger will
receive an annual base salary of $200,000, which will automatically be increased
by 5% on each  anniversary  date of the  Effective  Date for the duration of the
initial term of the Employment  Agreement and any extension thereof. Mr. Fleeger
will  receive a one-time  bonus in the  amount of  $25,000  payable on April 15,
2005,  and will also be entitled to additional  bonuses from time to time as the
Company's Board of Directors may determine pursuant to the Company's bonus plans
or  programs.  Mr.  Fleeger  is  currently  eligible  for  participation  in the
Company's  executive  target  bonus  program  as  described  in Exhibit A to the
Employment Agreement.

         Pursuant to the terms of the  Employment  Agreement,  if Mr.  Fleeger's
employment is terminated by the Company without cause or by Mr. Fleeger for good
reason, he will be entitled to receive,  in accordance with the Company's normal
payroll practices, the customary installments of his salary and benefits as were
provided  to him  during  his  employment  period  until the  expiration  of the
then-current term. If Mr. Fleeger's employment is terminated due to his death or
disability,  he,  or his  designated  beneficiary  as the case  may be,  will be
entitled to receive,  in accordance with the Company's normal payroll practices,
the  customary  installments  of his salary and benefits as were provided to him
during his employment period until the expiration of the then-current term, less
the amount of any insurance  proceeds collected or to be collected by him or his
designated  beneficiary pursuant to any insurance policies for which the Company
has paid the premiums.  If Mr. Fleeger's employment is terminated by the Company
without  cause  within 12 months of (i) the  consummation  of a  reorganization,
merger or consolidation with an entity, or any other event (or series of related
events) in which the  persons  who hold a  majority  of the  outstanding  equity
securities of the Company before such transaction do not own at least a majority
of the equity securities entitled to vote to elect directors (or persons serving
in a similar  capacity)  of the entity  surviving  such  transaction,  or (ii) a
disposition of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company, he will be
entitled to receive a lump sum payment,  the amount of which will be  determined
by the  compensation  committee of the Company's  Board of Directors,  but which
will in no  event be less  than  his  aggregate  compensation  from the  Company
(including salary and benefits) during the 24-month period immediately preceding
the effective date of such event or disposition.

         The  description  contained  in  this  Item  1.01 of the  terms  of the
Employment  Agreement is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text
of the  Employment  Agreement,  a copy of which is  attached  to this  Report as
Exhibit 10.1.

Item 3.02. Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

         On  December  30,  2004,  the  Company  accepted   subscriptions   from
accredited  investors for the purchase of 143,334 shares of the Company's Series
A 10%  Convertible  Preferred  Stock,  par value $.001 (the  "Series A Preferred
Stock").  The Company received aggregate cash proceeds in the amount of $215,000
from the sale of such shares of Series A Preferred  Stock.  The Company  paid no
underwriting discounts or commissions in connection with the sale of such shares
of Series A Preferred Stock. The sale of such shares of Series A Preferred Stock
was exempted from the registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933,

as amended,  pursuant to Rule 506 of  Regulation D promulgated  thereunder.  The
shares of Series A Preferred  Stock are  convertible  into the Company's  common
stock,  par value $.001, as set forth in the  "Certificate of Designation of the
Series A 10% Convertible Preferred Stock," which was filed as Exhibit 4.1 to the
Company's  Current  Report on Form 8-K as filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission on November 18, 2004, and which is hereby  incorporated  by reference
herein.  The Company's  private  offering of shares of Series A Preferred  Stock
remained open as of the date of this Report.
