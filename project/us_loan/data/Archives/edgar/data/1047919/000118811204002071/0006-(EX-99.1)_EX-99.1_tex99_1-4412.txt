          AMBIENT RAISES PROCEEDS OF $5.5 MILLION IN PRIVATE PLACEMENT

                            MANHATTAN PILOT UNDERWAY


BOSTON, MA, DECEMBER 28, 2004 - AMBIENT CORPORATION (OTCBB: ABTG), a leader in
Power Line Communications (PLC) today announced that it has received net
proceeds, after payment of offering related fees and expenses, of $4.9 million
through the private placement of its three year 6% Convertible Debentures to
institutional and individual investors. The proceeds will be used to expand and
further accelerate Ambient's commercialization efforts, broaden its sales
channels and increase its working capital.

"We are encouraged with the positive response to this Offering," stated John
Joyce, CEO of Ambient. "Our investors have continued to show their belief in
Ambient and the viability of PLC technology."

Ambient's pilot project within a high rise apartment building in Manhattan is
now underway. With the completion of the Offering, Ambient is now able to step
up efforts to bring high-speed PLC broadband to a location in upper Manhattan.
Various utility applications, such as load management/load control are also
among the suite of projected applications to be included in this pilot.

"We are pleased that Ambient now has the resources to accelerate the
implementation efforts of our pilot in Manhattan," said Garry Betty, CEO of
EarthLink (NASDAQ: ELNK). "This is an important project to all partners involved
as well as the PLC industry in general."

The Convertible Debentures are convertible into shares of Ambient's common stock
at an initial conversion rate of $0.25 per share. Interest on the Debentures
accrues at the rate of 6% per annum and is payable bi-annually, in cash or
shares of common stock, at Ambient's option. Unless converted earlier, the
Debentures are scheduled to automatically convert on the third anniversary of
issuance into shares of Ambient's common stock. As part of this transaction, the
investors also received three-year warrants to purchase up to a total of 22
million shares of common stock at a per share exercise price of $0.50. Ambient
has undertaken to file within 30 days of closing a registration statement
covering the common stock underlying the Convertible Debentures and the related
warrants. Other details relating to the Convertible Debentures will be included
in Ambient's Current Report on Form 8-K that is being filed contemporaneously
with this release.

This press release does not constitute an offer to sell or the solicitation of
an offer to buy securities.
