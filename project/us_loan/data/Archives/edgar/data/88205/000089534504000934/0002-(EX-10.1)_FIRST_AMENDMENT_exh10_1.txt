          SECTION 3. Amendment to Section 2.11(b) of the Credit Agreement.
Section 2.11(b) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended in its entirety
to read as follows:

          (b) If on any date any Net Proceeds are received by or on behalf
     of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Prepayment
     Event, the Parent Borrower shall, within ten Business Days after such
     Net Proceeds are received, prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an amount
     equal to the aggregate amount of such Net Proceeds; provided that:

               (i) in the case of any event described in clause (a) or (b)
          of the definition of the term Prepayment Event, if the Parent
          Borrower shall deliver to the Administrative Agent a certificate
          of a Financial Officer to the effect that the Parent Borrower and
          the Subsidiaries intend to apply the Net Proceeds from such event
          ("Reinvestment Net Proceeds"), within 360 days after receipt of
          such Net Proceeds, to make Permitted Acquisitions or Investments
          permitted by Section 6.5 or acquire real property, equipment or
          other assets to be used in the business of the Parent Borrower
          and the Subsidiaries, and certifying that no Default or Event of
          Default has occurred and is continuing, then no prepayment shall
          be required pursuant to this paragraph (b) in respect of such
          event except to the extent of any Net Proceeds therefrom that
          have not been so applied by the end of such 360-day period, at
          which time a prepayment shall be required in an amount equal to
          the Net Proceeds that have not been so applied; provided, that,
          notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of any event described
          in clause (A) or (B) below, the Parent Borrower shall, within ten
          Business Days after receipt of the Net Proceeds (or portion
          thereof specified in such clauses) in respect of such event,
          prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an amount equal to such Net
          Proceeds (or specified portion thereof), and such Net Proceeds
          may not be treated as Reinvestment Net Proceeds:

                    (A) if, on any date during any fiscal year of the
               Parent Borrower, the aggregate gross proceeds (inclusive of
               amounts of the type described in the first parenthetical of
               Section 6.6(d) but exclusive of the $1,000,000,000 of Net
               Proceeds referred to in the proviso below) from Dispositions
               pursuant to Section 6.6(d) received during such fiscal year
               exceed 10% of Total Consolidated Assets, then, from and
               after such date, any Net Proceeds from each subsequent
               Prepayment Event occurring during such fiscal year resulting
               from Dispositions pursuant to Section 6.6(d) (and a ratable
               amount of Net Proceeds from any such Prepayment Event from
               Dispositions pursuant to Section 6.6(d) that first causes
               the aforementioned 10% threshold to be exceeded, which
               ratable amount shall be determined by reference to a
               fraction, the numerator of which shall be the portion of the
               gross proceeds from such Prepayment Event representing the
               excess above such 10% threshold and the denominator of which
               shall be the aggregate gross proceeds from such Prepayment
               Event) shall be applied by the Parent Borrower to prepay
               Term Loan Borrowings, provided that no prepayment shall be
               required pursuant to this clause (A) in respect of any
               portion of the up to $1,000,000,000 of the Net Proceeds that
               have been excluded from the prepayment and reinvestment
               requirements of this paragraph (b) by the Parent Borrower as
               provided in clause (ii) below; and

                    (B) if, on any date, any Net Proceeds are received by
               or on behalf of the Parent Borrower or any Subsidiary in
               respect of any Disposition described in Section 6.6(f), the
               Parent Borrower shall apply the first $150,000,000 of Net
               Proceeds from all such Dispositions, in the aggregate, to
               prepay Term Loan Borrowings to the extent required by clause
               (iii) below.

               (ii) the Parent Borrower may, at its option from time to
          time after the First Amendment Effective Date upon one or more
          written notices to the Administrative Agent, exclude up to an
          aggregate of $1,000,000,000 of Net Proceeds from Dispositions
          described in Section 6.6(d), from the prepayment requirements of
          this paragraph (b) and from the reinvestment provision in the
          foregoing clause (i); and

               (iii) (A) the Parent Borrower shall (except as provided in
          the next succeeding sentence), within ten Business Days after
          receipt of any Net Proceeds by or on behalf of the Parent
          Borrower or any Subsidiary in respect of any Disposition
          described in Section 6.6(f), prepay Term Loan Borrowings in an
          amount equal to the first $150,000,000 of such Net Proceeds (and
          such amount may not be reinvested pursuant to the reinvestment
          provision in the foregoing clause (i)), and (B) in the case of
          any Net Proceeds from Dispositions described in Section 6.6(f),
          after the first $150,000,000 of such Net Proceeds have been
          applied to prepay Term Loan Borrowings in accordance with the
          foregoing clause (iii) (A) of this paragraph (b) (or credit for
          such application shall have been given as provided in the next
          succeeding sentence), no prepayment or reinvestment shall be
          required pursuant to this paragraph (b) in respect of such
          Dispositions described in Section 6.6(f). Notwithstanding the
          foregoing, in the event that, during the period commencing on the
          First Amendment Effective Date and ending on the date of
          consummation of any Disposition described by Section 6.6(f), the
          Parent Borrower makes any optional prepayments of Term Loan
          Borrowings and, from time to time by one or more written notices
          to the Administrative Agent, directs that any such optional
          prepayment be allocated to Term Loan Borrowings in accordance
          with the first sentence of Section 2.12(b) and the second
          sentence of Section 2.12(c) (as amended by the First Amendment)
          as if such prepayment were a mandatory prepayment, then the
          amount of such optional prepayment shall be credited against the
          mandatory prepayment in respect of such Disposition that would
          otherwise be required by this paragraph (b), it being agreed that
          once so credited, such optional prepayment amount may not be
          credited against any other mandatory prepayment required by this
          paragraph (b) and not more than $150,000,000 in the aggregate of
          optional prepayments may be credited against mandatory
          prepayments otherwise required by this paragraph (b).

          SECTION 4. Amendment to Section 2.12(c) of the Credit Agreement.
Section 2.12(c) of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by deleting the
"." at the end of the second sentence thereof and inserting in lieu thereof
the following proviso:

     ; provided that, in the case of any mandatory prepayment in respect of
     a Disposition described in Section 6.6(f) that is allocated to the
     Tranche A Term Loan Borrowings or the Tranche B-1 Term Loan
     Borrowings, such prepayment may, at the option of the Parent Borrower
     upon written notice to the Administrative Agent, be applied to the
     remaining installments thereof in direct order of maturity.

          SECTION 5. Amendment to Section 5.11(a) of the Credit Agreement.

Section 6.5 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (a) deleting from
paragraph (b) thereof the term "Amendment/Restatement Effective Date" and
substituting in lieu thereof the following: "First Amendment Effective
Date" and (b) deleting from paragraph (c) thereof the phrase "Investments
by Loan Parties" and substituting in lieu thereof the following:

Date".

          SECTION 7. Amendments to Section 6.6 of the Credit Agreement.
Section 6.6 of the Credit Agreement is hereby amended by (a) deleting the
word "and" at the end of paragraph (d) thereof, (b) deleting the "." at the
end of paragraph (e) thereof and substituting "; and" in lieu thereof and
(c) inserting the following new paragraph (f) immediately after paragraph
