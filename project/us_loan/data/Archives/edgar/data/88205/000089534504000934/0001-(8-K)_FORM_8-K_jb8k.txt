ITEM 1.01.  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

The information provided in Item 2.03 of this Current Report on Form 8-K is
incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 2.03  CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER
           AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.

On December 22, 2004, SPX Corporation (the "Company") amended its credit
agreement (the "Credit Facility") with the Bank of Nova Scotia, Bank of
America, N.A., Bank One, N.A., JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., the foreign
subsidiary borrowers parties thereto and the several banks, financial
institutions and entities parties thereto. The amendment:

   (i)    expressly permits the previously announced sale of the Company's
          BOMAG and Edwards Systems Technology ("EST") businesses, while
          preserving the Company's flexibility to make other asset
          dispositions,
   (ii)   requires the Company to apply the first $150 million of proceeds
          from the sale of BOMAG and EST to pay term loans (and gives the
          Company the option to apply such amount in direct order of
          maturity of any term loans that are prepaid),
   (iii)  increases the Company's flexibility to use proceeds from asset
          dispositions for various purposes, by not requiring the Company
          to prepay term loans or reinvest (a) proceeds from the sale of
          BOMAG and EST (in excess of the first $150 million required to be
          applied to prepay term loans) and (b) up to $1 billion of
          proceeds from the sale of other assets,
   (iv)   provides that if the Credit Facilities are rated Ba3 or lower by
          Moody's or BB+ or lower by S&P, (a) the otherwise applicable
          interest rate margin on revolving loans, swingline loans and
          tranche A term loans will increase by 0.25%, and (b) the
          applicable interest rate margin on tranche B-1 term loans will be
          2.25% for Eurocurrency loans and 1.25% for ABR loans,
   (v)    refreshes the Company's ability to make certain investments,
          including investments in foreign subsidiaries,
   (vi)   modifies the formula relating to permitted stock buy-backs by the
          Company, including permitting the Company to purchase an
          unlimited amount of its equity if its ratio of Consolidated Total
          Debt to Consolidated EBITDA (as such terms are defined in the
          Credit Facility) is less than 2.5 to 1.0, and
   (vii)  provides for other technical modifications.

The foregoing description of the amendment to the Credit Facility is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the text of the amendment, which
is attached as Exhibit 10.1 hereto and incorporated herein by reference.

On December 23, 2004, the Company issued a press release related to this
event. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.1 hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 2.06   MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS.

In accordance with the Company's policy, the Company conducts its annual
impairment testing of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in the
fourth quarter in connection with its annual long-range forecasting
process.

On December 22, 2004, the Company's Chief Financial Officer concluded that
an impairment of goodwill exists at its telecommunications business
(Radiodetection) and its industrial tools and hydraulic unit business
(Fluid Power). These impairments may result in a material non-cash charge
to earnings in the fourth quarter. Until the Company completes the testing
procedures, which include appraisals of assets at these businesses, it is
not able to estimate the amount or range of amounts of such impairment
charge. The total amount of goodwill recorded for these two units was
$227.9 million at September 30, 2004. When the Company makes a
determination of the amount or range of amounts of such impairment, it will
amend this Form 8-K to disclose such amount or range.

ITEM 5.02   DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION
            OF DIRECTORS; APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.

On December 21, 2004, Christopher J. Kearney, President and Chief Executive
Officer, was appointed to the Board of Directors of the Company. On
December 22, 2004, the Company issued a press release related to this
event. A copy of the press release is attached as Exhibit 99.2 hereto and
incorporated herein by reference.
