<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Altus Explorations, Inc</B>.
(&#147;Altus&#148; or &#147;Assignor&#148;), a Nevada Corporation, and <B>Orbit Energy,
LLC </B>(&#147;Orbit&#148; or &#147;Operator&#148;), a Nevada Limited Liability Company,
are Parties to a Farmout Agreement made and entered into on the <SUP>30th</SUP> day of

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In connection with the continuing
development of the Kansas acreage, Altus and Orbit desire to amend the Lake Creek Prospect
Farmout Agreement to provide Altus the right to continue to participate in the drilling
and development of prospect acreage located outside the original Lake Creek Prospect
Acreage. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Pursuant to this amendment, Altus and
Orbit agree that Altus has the right to participate in the drilling and development of
Lake Creek area acreage with a working interest up to 25%, of which 10% shall be
&#147;carried&#148; by Orbit while Altus will be responsible for its proportionate share
of capital expenditures on the remaining 15% working interest. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>This amendment and Altus&#146; right
to participate in the continued drilling and development of Lake Creek area acreage
outside the original Lake Creek Prospect Acreage relates solely to the drilling and
completion of the Lake Creek No. 2 well, the Lake Creek No. 3 well, and the Lake Creek No.

payment to Orbit, upon Orbit&#146;s request, for its proportionate share of capital
expenditures attributable to the 15% working interest shall constitute Altus&#146;
election to participate in the drilling and completion of a well. Non-remittance of
Altus&#146; proportionate share of capital expenditures when requested by Orbit, shall
constitute Altus&#146; election to participate in the drilling and completion of a well
