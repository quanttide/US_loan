Energy Corporation (NYSE: SGY) announced that it has signed a purchase and sale agreement
to acquire approximately 35,000 net exploration acres in the Williston Basin of North
Dakota and Montana from a small independent company effective January 1, 2005. The
acquisition cost of approximately $85 million is expected to be funded with borrowings
under Stone&#146;s bank credit facility pending final closing, which is expected in
February 2005. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;This
acquisition represents another significant step in efforts to diversify our asset
base,&#148; stated David H. Welch, president and chief executive officer. &#147;Combined
with our recent acreage acquisition in Utah, we have created several growth opportunities
for exploration and development in the Rocky Mountain region.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
acquisition includes proved reserves and a minimal amount of oil production. Approximately
85% of the purchase price is expected to be allocated to unevaluated acreage. Much of this
acreage is located within the Bakken formation fairway with attractive stacked-pay
potential. Stone expects to begin exploring the acreage with a multi-well drilling program
beginning in 2005. </FONT></P>
