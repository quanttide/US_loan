                                 The Kroger Co.
                                 Debt Securities

                             Underwriting Agreement

To the Representatives of the                                   December 9, 2004
  several Underwriters named in the
   respective Pricing Agreements
   hereinafter described.

Dear Sirs:

      From time to time The Kroger Co., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), and
the Guarantors on Schedule I and the signature pages hereto propose to enter
into one or more Pricing Agreements (each a "Pricing Agreement") in the form of
Annex I hereto, with such additions and deletions as the parties thereto may
determine, and, subject to the terms and conditions stated herein and therein,
to issue and sell to the firms named in Schedule I to the applicable Pricing
Agreement (such firms constituting the "Underwriters" with respect to such
Pricing Agreement and the securities specified therein) certain of its debt
securities (the "Securities") specified in Schedule II to such Pricing Agreement
(with respect to such Pricing Agreement, the "Designated Securities").

      The terms and rights of any particular issuance of Designated Securities
shall be as specified in the Pricing Agreement relating thereto and in or
pursuant to the indenture (the "Indenture") identified in such Pricing
Agreement.

      1. Particular sales of Designated Securities may be made from time to time
to the Underwriters of such Securities, for whom the firms designated as
representatives of the Underwriters of such Securities in the Pricing Agreement
relating thereto will act as representatives (the "Representatives"). The term
"Representatives" also refers to a single firm acting as sole representative of
the Underwriters and to Underwriters who act without any firm being designated
as their representative. This Underwriting Agreement shall not be construed as
an obligation of the Company to sell any of the Securities or as an obligation
of any of the Underwriters to purchase the Securities. The obligation of the
Company to issue and sell any of the Securities and the obligation of any of the
Underwriters to purchase any of the Securities shall be evidenced by the Pricing
Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities specified therein. Each
Pricing Agreement shall specify the aggregate principal amount of such
Designated Securities, the initial public offering price of such Designated
Securities, the purchase price to the Underwriters of such Designated
Securities, the names of the Underwriters of such Designated Securities, the
names of the Representatives of such Underwriters and the principal amount of
such Designated Securities to be purchased by each Underwriter and shall set
forth the date, time and manner of delivery to such Designated Securities and
payment therefor. The Pricing Agreement shall also specify (to the extent not
set forth in the Indenture and the registration statement and

                                      -1-

<PAGE>

prospectus with respect thereto) the terms of such Designated Securities. A
Pricing Agreement shall be in the form of an executed writing (which may be in
counterparts), and may be evidenced by an exchange of telegraphic communications
or any other rapid transmission device designed to produce a written record of
communications transmitted. The obligations of the Underwriters under this
Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be several and not joint.

                  2. The Company represents and warrants to, and agrees with,
each of the Underwriters that:

            (a) A registration statement in respect of the Securities has been
      filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission"); such
      registration statement and any post-effective amendment thereto, each in
      the form heretofore delivered or to be delivered to the Representatives
      and, excluding exhibits to such registration statement, but including all
      documents incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained therein,
      to the Representatives for each of the other Underwriters, have been
      declared effective by the Commission in such form; no other document with
      respect to such registration statement or document incorporated by
      reference therein has heretofore been filed or transmitted for filing with
      the Commission; and no stop order suspending the effectiveness of such
      registration statement has been issued and no proceeding for that purpose
      has been initiated or threatened by the Commission (any preliminary
      prospectus included in such registration statement or filed with the
      Commission pursuant to Rule 424(a) of the rules and regulations of the
      Commission under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), being
      hereinafter called a "Preliminary Prospectus"; the various parts of such
      registration statement, including all exhibits thereto and the documents
      incorporated by reference in the prospectus contained in the registration
      statement at the time such part of the registration statement became
      effective but excluding Form T-1, each as amended at the time such part of
      the registration statement became effective, being hereinafter called the
      "Registration Statement"; the prospectus relating to the Securities, in
      the form in which it has most recently been filed, or transmitted for
      filing, with the Commission on or prior to the date of this Agreement,
      being hereinafter called the "Prospectus"; any reference herein to any
      Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and
      include the documents incorporated by reference therein pursuant to the
      applicable form under the Act, as of the date of such Preliminary
      Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be; any reference to any
      amendment or supplement to any Preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus
      shall be deemed to refer to and include any documents filed after the date
      of such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as the case may be, under
      the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), and
      incorporated by reference in such Preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus, as
      the case may be; any reference to any amendment to the Registration
      Statement shall be deemed to refer to and include any annual report of the
      Company filed pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange Act after
      the effective date of the Registration Statement that is incorporated by
      reference in the Registration Statement; and any reference to the
      Prospectus as amended or supplemented shall be deemed to refer to the
      Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the applicable
      Designated Securities in the form in which it is filed with the Commission
      pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Act in accordance with Section 5(a)
      hereof, including any documents incorporated by reference therein as of
      the date of such filing);

                                      -2-

<PAGE>

            (b) The documents incorporated by reference in the Prospectus, when
      they became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
      be, conformed in all material respects to the requirements of the Act or
      the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the rules and regulations of the
      Commission thereunder, and none of such documents contained an untrue
      statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact required
      to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
      misleading; and any further documents so filed and incorporated by
      reference in the Prospectus or any further amendment or supplement
      thereto, when such documents become effective or are filed with the
      Commission, as the case may be, will conform in all material respects to
      the requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the
      rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder and will not contain an
      untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
      required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein
      not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and warranty
      shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance upon and
      in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by an
      Underwriter of Designated Securities through the Representatives expressly
      for use in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to such
      Securities;

            (c) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus conform, and any
      further amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or the
      Prospectus will conform, in all material respects to the requirements of
      the Act and the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the "Trust
      Indenture Act") and the rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder
      and do not and will not, as of the applicable effective date as to the
      Registration Statement and any amendment thereto and as of the applicable
      filing date as to the Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto,
      contain an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
      fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
      therein not misleading; provided, however, that this representation and
      warranty shall not apply to any statements or omissions made in reliance
      upon and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the
      Company by an Underwriter of Designated Securities through the
      Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or
      supplemented relating to such Securities;

            (d) The Company and its subsidiaries have not sustained since the
      date of the latest audited financial statements included or incorporated
      by reference in the Prospectus any material loss or interference with
      their businesses, taken as a whole, from fire, explosion, flood or other
      calamity, whether or not covered by insurance, or from any labor dispute
      or court or governmental action, order or decree, otherwise than as set
      forth or contemplated in the Prospectus; and, since the respective dates
      as of which information is given in the Registration Statement and the
      Prospectus, there has not been any material change in the capital stock or
      long-term debt of the Company and its subsidiaries on a consolidated basis
      or any material adverse change, or any development involving a prospective
      material adverse change, in or affecting the general affairs, management,
      financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the
      Company and its subsidiaries, taken as a whole, otherwise than as set
      forth or contemplated in the Prospectus;

            (e) The Company and its subsidiaries have good and marketable title
      in fee simple to all real property and good and marketable title to all
      personal property owned by them, in each case free and clear of all liens,
      encumbrances and defects

                                      -3-

      except such as are described in the Prospectus or such as do not
      materially affect the value of such property and do not interfere with the
      use made and proposed to be made of such property by the Company and its
      subsidiaries; and any real property and buildings held under lease by the
      Company and its subsidiaries are held by them under valid, subsisting and
      enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not material and do not
      interfere with the use made and proposed to be made of such property and
      buildings by the Company and its subsidiaries;

            (f) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly existing
      as a corporation in good standing under the laws of the State of Ohio,
      with power and authority (corporate and other) to own its properties and
      conduct its business as described in the Prospectus, and has been duly
      qualified as a foreign corporation for the transaction of business and is
      in good standing under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it
      owns or leases properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such
      qualification, or is subject to no material liability or disability by
      reason of the failure to be qualified in any such jurisdiction; and each
      subsidiary of the Company has been duly incorporated and is validly
      existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of its

      and clear of all liens, encumbrances, equities or claims;

            (h) The Securities have been duly authorized, and, when Designated
      Securities are issued and delivered pursuant to this Agreement and the
      Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated Securities against
      payment of the consideration specified in the Pricing Agreement, such
      Designated Securities will have been duly executed, authenticated, issued
      and delivered and will constitute valid and legally binding obligations of
      the Company, enforceable in accordance with their terms, subject, as to
      enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and other laws of
      general applicability relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to

      the Trust Indenture Act and, at the Time of Delivery for such Designated
      Securities (as defined in Section 4 hereof), the Indenture will constitute
      a valid and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its
      terms, subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency,

      Agreement and any Pricing Agreement, and the consummation of the
      transactions herein and therein contemplated will not conflict with or
      result in a breach of any of the terms or

                                      -4-

      provisions of, or constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage,
      deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which
      the Company or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company
      or any of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or
      assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor will such
      action result in any violation of the provisions of the Articles of
      Incorporation, as amended, or the Regulations of the Company or any

      agency or body having jurisdiction over the Company or any of its

      the Securities or the consummation by the Company of the other
      transactions contemplated by this Agreement or any Pricing Agreement or
      the Indenture, except such as have been, or will have been prior to the

            (j) Other than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, there
      are no legal or governmental proceedings pending to which the Company or
      any of its subsidiaries is a party or of which any property of the Company
      or any of its subsidiaries is the subject with respect to which there is a
      reasonable likelihood of a determination which would individually or in
      the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial
      position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of the Company and
      its subsidiaries; and, to the best of the Company's knowledge, no such
      proceedings are threatened or contemplated by governmental authorities or
      threatened by others;

            (k) None of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, any
      Pricing Agreement or the Indenture (including, without limitation, the use

practicable, and in such authorized denominations and registered in such names
as the Representatives may request upon at least forty-eight hours' prior notice

Securities:

            (a) To prepare the Prospectus as amended and supplemented in
      relation to the applicable Designated Securities in a form approved by the
      Representatives and to file such Prospectus pursuant to Rule 424(b) under
      the Act not later than the Commission's close of business on the second

      relating to the applicable Designated Securities or, if applicable, such
      earlier time as may be required by Rule 424(b); to make no further
      amendment or any supplement to the Registration Statement or Prospectus as
      amended or supplemented after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating

      which shall be disapproved by the Representatives for such Securities
      promptly after reasonable notice thereof; to advise the Representatives
      promptly of any such amendment or supplement after such Time of Delivery
      and furnish the Representatives with copies thereof; to file promptly all
      reports and any definitive proxy or information statements required to be
      filed by the Company with the Commission pursuant to Section 13(a), 13(c),
      14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act for so long as the delivery of a
      prospectus is required in connection with the offering or sale of such
      Securities, and during such same period to advise the Representatives,
      promptly after it receives notice thereof, of the time when any amendment
      to the Registration Statement has been filed or becomes effective or any
      supplement to the Prospectus or any amended Prospectus has been filed with
      the Commission, of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order or of
      any order preventing or suspending the use of any prospectus relating to
      the Securities, of the suspension of the qualification of such Securities
      for offering or sale in any jurisdiction, of the initiation of or
      threatening of any proceeding for any such purpose, or of any request by

      suspending any such qualification, to use promptly its best efforts to
      obtain its withdrawal;

            (b) Promptly from time to time to take such action as the
      Representatives may reasonably request to qualify such Securities for
      offering and sale under the securities laws of such jurisdictions in the
      United States as the Representatives may request and to comply with such
      laws so as to permit the continuance of sales and dealings therein in such
      jurisdictions for as long as may be necessary to complete the distribution
      of such Securities, provided that in connection therewith

                                      -6-

<PAGE>

      the Company shall not be required to qualify as a foreign corporation or
      to file a general consent to service of process in any jurisdiction;

            (c) To furnish the Underwriters with copies of the Prospectus as
      amended or supplemented in such quantities as the Representatives may from
      time to time reasonably request, and, if the delivery of a prospectus is
      required at any time prior to the expiration of nine months after the time
      of issue of the Prospectus in connection with the offering or sale of any
      Designated Securities and if at such time any event shall have occurred as
      a result of which the Prospectus as then amended or supplemented would
      include an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
      material fact necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the
      light of the circumstances under which they were made when such Prospectus
      is delivered, not misleading, or, if for any other reason it shall be
      necessary during such same period to amend or supplement the Prospectus or
      to file under the Exchange Act any document incorporated by reference in
      the Prospectus in order to comply with the Act, the Exchange Act or the
      Trust Indenture Act, to notify the Representatives and upon their request
      to file such document and to prepare and furnish without charge to each
      Underwriter and to any dealer in securities as many copies as the
      Representatives may from time to time reasonably request of an amended
      Prospectus or a supplement to the Prospectus which will correct such
      statement or omission or effect such compliance; and in case any
      Underwriter is required to deliver a prospectus in connection with sales
      of any Designated Securities at any time nine months or more after the
      time of issue of the Prospectus as amended or supplemented with respect to
      such Designated Securities, upon the request of the Representatives but at
      the expense of such Underwriter, to prepare and deliver to such
      Underwriter as many copies as it may request of a further amended or
      supplemented Prospectus for such Designated Securities complying with
      Section 10(a)(3) of the Act;

            (d) To make generally available to its security holders as soon as
      practicable, but in any event not later than eighteen months after the
      effective date of the Registration Statement (as defined in Rule 158(c) ),
      an earning statement of the Company and its subsidiaries (which need not
      be audited) complying with Section 11 (a) of the Act and the rules and
      regulations of the Commission thereunder (including at the option of the
      Company Rule 158); and

            (e) During the period beginning from the date of the Pricing
      Agreement for such Designated Securities and continuing to and including
      the earlier of (i) the termination of trading restrictions for such
      Designated Securities, as notified to the Company by the Representatives,
      and (ii) the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, not to
      offer, sell, contract to sell or otherwise dispose of any debt securities
      of the Company which mature more than one year after such Time of Delivery
      and which are substantially similar to such Designated Securities, without
      the prior written consent of the Representatives.

      6. The Company covenants and agrees with the several Underwriters that the
Company will pay or cause to be paid the following: (i) the fees, disbursements

and any advertising expenses connected with any offers they may make.

      7. The obligations of the Underwriters of any Designated Securities under
the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities shall be subject,
in the discretion of the Representatives, to the condition that all
representations and warranties and other statements of the Company in or
incorporated by reference in the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated
Securities are, at and as of the Time of Delivery for such Designated
Securities, true and correct, the condition that the Company shall have
performed all of its obligations hereunder theretofore to be performed, and the
following additional conditions:

            (a) The Prospectus as amended or supplemented in relation to the
      applicable Designated Securities shall have been filed with the Commission

      with Section 5 (a) hereof; no stop order suspending the effectiveness of
      the Registration Statement or any part thereof shall have been issued and
      no proceeding for that purpose shall have been initiated or threatened by

            (c) Paul Heldman, Senior Vice President, Secretary and General
      Counsel of the Company, shall have furnished to the Representatives his
      written opinion, dated the Time of Delivery for such Designated
      Securities, in form and substance satisfactory to the Representatives, to
      the effect that:

                  (i) The Company has been duly incorporated and is validly
            existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Ohio,
            with corporate power and authority to own its properties and conduct
            its business as described in the Prospectus as amended or
            supplemented;

                  (ii) The Company has an authorized capitalization as set forth
            in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, and all of the issued
            shares of capital stock of the Company have been duly and validly
            authorized and issued and are fully paid and non-assessable;

                  (iii) The Company has been duly qualified as a foreign
            corporation for the transaction of business and is in good standing
            under the laws of each other jurisdiction in which it owns or leases
            properties, or conducts any business, so as to require such
            qualification, or is subject to no material liability or disability
            by reason of the failure to be so qualified in any such jurisdiction
            (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the opinion in
            this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect of matters
            of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company, provided that
            such counsel shall state that he believes that both the Underwriters
            and he are justified in relying upon such opinions and
            certificates);

                  (iv) Each subsidiary of the Company, with respect to which the
            Company owns, directly or indirectly, an equity interest of more
            than 50% (each a "subsidiary"), has been duly incorporated and is
            validly existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of
            its jurisdiction of incorporation; and all of the issued shares of
            capital stock of each such subsidiary have been duly and validly
            authorized and issued, are fully paid and non-assessable, and
            (except for directors' qualifying shares) are owned directly or
            indirectly by the Company, free and clear of all liens,
            encumbrances, equities or claims, other than as described in the
            Prospectus (such counsel being entitled to rely in respect of the
            opinion in this clause upon opinions of local counsel and in respect
            of matters of fact upon certificates of officers of the Company,
            provided that such counsel shall state that he believes that both
            the Underwriters and he are justified in relying upon such opinions
            and certificates);

                  (v) The Company and its subsidiaries have good and marketable
            title in fee simple to all real property owned by them, in each case
            free and clear of all liens, encumbrances and defects except such as
            are described in the Prospectus or such as do not materially affect
            the value of such property and do not interfere with the use made
            and proposed to be made of such property by the Company and its
            subsidiaries; and any real property and buildings held under lease
            by the Company and its subsidiaries are held by them under valid,
            subsisting and enforceable leases with such exceptions as are not
            material and do not interfere with the use made and proposed to be
            made of such property and buildings by the Company and its
            subsidiaries (in giving the opinion in this clause, such counsel may
            state that no examination of record titles for the

                                      -9-

<PAGE>

            purpose of such opinion has been made, and that he is relying upon a
            general review of the titles of the Company and its subsidiaries,
            upon opinions of local counsel and abstracts, reports and policies
            of title companies rendered or issued at or subsequent to the time
            of acquisition of such property by the Company or its subsidiaries,
            upon opinions of counsel to the lessors of such property and, in
            respect of matters of fact, upon certificates of officers of the
            Company or its subsidiaries, provided that such counsel shall state
            that he believes that both the Underwriters and he are justified in
            relying upon such opinions, abstracts, reports, policies and
            certificates);

                  (vi) To the best of such counsel's knowledge and other than as
            set forth in the Prospectus, there are no legal or governmental
            proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries
            is a party or of which any property of the Company or any of its
            subsidiaries is the subject with respect to which there is a
            reasonable likelihood of determinations which would individually or
            in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the consolidated
            financial position, stockholders' equity or results of operations of
            the Company and its subsidiaries; and, to the best of such counsel's
            knowledge, no such proceedings are threatened or contemplated by
            governmental authorities or threatened by others;

                  (vii) This Agreement and the Pricing Agreement with respect to
            the Designated Securities have been duly authorized, executed and
            delivered by the Company;

                  (viii) The Designated Securities have been duly authorized,
            executed, authenticated, issued and delivered, and the Designated
            Securities (assuming that (i) the Trustee has all requisite power
            and authority to perform its obligations under the Indenture and has
            made all necessary filings and received all necessary consents, (ii)
            the Indenture has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
            the Trustee and (iii) the Trustee's certificates of authentication
            have been manually executed by an authorized officer of the Trustee)
            constitute valid and binding obligations of the Company, enforceable
            against the Company in accordance with their terms and are entitled
            to the benefits of the Indenture, except that (a) such enforcement
            may be subject to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
            moratorium, or other laws now or hereafter in effect affecting
            creditors' rights generally, and (b) the enforceability thereof is
            subject to the general principles of equity (whether such
            enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law);
            provided, however, that such counsel need express no opinion as to
            the application or effect of any applicable fraudulent conveyance,
            fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation or preferential transfer
            laws or any laws governing the distribution of assets of the Company
            to its stockholders; and the terms of the Designated Securities and
            the Indenture conform in all material respects to the descriptions
            thereof in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

                  (ix) The Indenture (i) has been duly authorized, executed and
            delivered by the Company and (ii) (assuming that (a) the Trustee has
            all requisite power and authority to perform its obligations under
            the Indenture and has made all necessary filings and received all
            necessary consents, and (b) the Indenture has been duly authorized,
            executed and delivered by the Trustee) constitutes a valid and
            binding instrument of the Company, enforceable in accordance with

                                      -10-

<PAGE>

            its terms, except (a) that such enforcement may be subject to
            bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium, or other laws
            now or hereafter in effect affecting creditors' rights generally,
            and (b) that the enforceability thereof is subject to general
            principles of equity (whether such enforceability is considered in a
            proceeding in equity or at law); provided, however, that such
            counsel need express no opinion as to the application or effect of
            any applicable fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer,
            fraudulent obligation or preferential transfer laws or any laws
            governing the distribution of assets of the Company to its
            stockholders; and the Indenture has been duly qualified under the
            Trust Indenture Act;

                  (x) The issuance and sale of the Designated Securities and the
            compliance by the Company with all of the provisions of the
            Designated Securities, the Indenture, this Agreement and the Pricing
            Agreement with respect to the Designated Securities and the
            consummation of the transactions herein and therein contemplated, to
            the best of such counsel's knowledge, will not conflict with or
            result in a breach of any of the terms or provisions of, or
            constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
            loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which the Company
            or any of its subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any
            of its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or
            assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, nor
            will such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the
            Articles of Incorporation, as amended, or the Regulations of the
            Company or any statute of the United States of America or of Ohio or
            any other statute known to such counsel or any order, rule or
            regulation of any court or governmental agency or body having
            jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of
            their properties; provided, however, that such counsel need express
            no opinion as to the application or effect of any applicable
            fraudulent conveyance, fraudulent transfer, fraudulent obligation or
            preferential transfer laws or any laws governing the distribution of
            assets of the Company to its stockholders;

                  (xi) To the best of such counsel's knowledge, no consent,
            approval, authorization, order, registration or qualification of or
            with any such court or governmental agency or body is required for
            the issuance and sale of the Designated Securities or the
            consummation of the other transactions contemplated by this
            Agreement or such Pricing Agreement or the Indenture, except such as
            have been obtained under the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and
            such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or
            qualifications as may be required under state securities or Blue Sky
            laws in connection with the purchase and distribution of the
            Designated Securities by the Underwriters and as may be required due
            to the Underwriters' or the Trustees' legal or regulatory status;

                  (xii) The Company is not subject to regulation under the
            Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended;

                  (xiii) The documents incorporated by reference in the
            Prospectus as amended or supplemented (other than (a) the financial
            statements, notes and schedules thereto included or incorporated by
            reference therein and (b) other financial and statistical
            information included or incorporated by reference therein, as to all
            of which such counsel need express no opinion), when they

                                      -11-

            became effective or were filed with the Commission, as the case may
            be, complied as to form in all material respects with the
            requirements of the Act or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the
            rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder; and such counsel
            has no reason to believe that any of such documents, when they
            became effective or were so filed, as the case may be, contained, in
            the case of a registration statement which became effective under
            the Act, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state
            a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make
            the statements therein not misleading, or, in the case of other
            documents which were filed under the Act or the Exchange Act with
            the Commission, an untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to
            state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
            therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
            made when such documents were so filed, not misleading; and

                  (xiv) The Registration Statement and the Prospectus as amended
            or supplemented and any further amendments and supplements thereto
            made by the Company prior to the Time of Delivery for the Designated
            Securities (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and
            schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b)
            other financial and statistical information included or incorporated
            by reference therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as exhibits to the
            Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express
            no opinion) comply as to form in all material respects with the
            requirements of the Act and the Trust Indenture Act and the rules
            and regulations thereunder; such counsel has no reason to believe
            that, as of its effective date, the Registration Statement or any
            further amendment thereto made by the Company prior to the Time of
            Delivery (other than (a) the financial statements, notes and
            schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein, (b)
            other financial and statistical information included or incorporated
            by reference therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as exhibits to the
            Registration Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express
            no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a material fact or
            omitted to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
            necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or that, as
            of its date, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented or any
            further amendment or supplement thereto made by the Company prior to
            the Time of Delivery (other than (a) the financial statements, notes
            and schedules thereto included or incorporated by reference therein,
            (b) other financial and statistical information included or
            incorporated by reference therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as
            exhibits to the Registration Statement, as to all of which such
            counsel need express no opinion) contained an untrue statement of a
            material fact or omitted to state a material fact necessary to make
            the statements therein, in light of the circumstances in which they
            were made, not misleading or that, as of the Time of Delivery,
            either the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or
            supplemented or any further amendment or supplement thereto made by
            the Company prior to the Time of Delivery (other than (a) the
            financial statements, notes and schedules thereto included or
            incorporated by reference therein, (b) other financial and
            statistical information included or incorporated by reference
            therein or (c) the Forms T-1 filed as exhibits to the Registration
            Statement, as to all of which such counsel need express no opinion)
            contains an untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
            material fact necessary to make the statements therein, in light of
            the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading; and such
            counsel does not know of any amendment to the Registration Statement
            required to be filed or any contracts or other documents of a
            character required

                                      -12-

<PAGE>

            to be filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or required
            to be incorporated by reference into the Prospectus as amended or
            supplemented or required to be described in the Registration
            Statement or the Prospectus as amended or supplemented which are not
            filed or incorporated by reference or described as required;

            (d) On the date of the Pricing Agreement for such Designated
      Securities and at the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities, the
      independent accountants of the Company who have certified the financial
      statements of the Company and its subsidiaries included or incorporated by
      reference in the Registration Statement shall have furnished to the
      Representatives letters, dated the respective dates of delivery of such
      letters, to the effect set forth in Annex II hereto, in form and substance
      satisfactory to the Representatives;

            (e) [Intentionally Omitted]

            (f) (i) Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries shall have
      sustained since the date of the latest audited financial statements
      included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus as amended or
      supplemented any loss or interference with its business from fire,
      explosion, flood or other calamity, whether or not covered by insurance,
      or from any labor dispute or court or governmental action, order or
      decree, otherwise than as set forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as
      amended or supplemented, and (ii) since the respective dates as of which
      information is given in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented there
      shall not have been any change in the capital stock or long-term debt of
      the Company and its subsidiaries or any change, or any development
      involving a prospective change, in or affecting the general affairs,
      management, financial position, stockholders' equity or results of
      operations of the Company and its subsidiaries, otherwise than as set
      forth or contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented, the
      effect of which, in any such case described in Clause (i) or (ii), is in
      the judgment of the Representatives so material and adverse as to make it
      impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the
      delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner
      contemplated in the Prospectus as amended or supplemented;

            (g) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
      Designated Securities (i) no downgrading shall have occurred in the rating
      accorded the debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries by any
      "nationally recognized statistical rating organization," as that term is
      defined by the Commission for purposes of Rule 436(g) (2) under the Act
      and (ii) no such organization shall have publicly announced that it has
      under surveillance or review, with possible negative implications, its
      rating of any of the debt securities of the Company and its subsidiaries;

            (h) On or after the date of the Pricing Agreement relating to the
      Designated Securities there shall not have occurred any of the following:
      (i) a suspension or material limitation in trading in securities generally
      on the New York Stock Exchange; (ii) a general moratorium on commercial
      banking activities in New York declared by either Federal or New York
      State authorities; or (iii) the outbreak or escalation of hostilities
      involving the United States or the declaration by the United States of a
      national emergency or war, if the effect of any such event specified in

                                      -13-

<PAGE>

      this Clause (iii) in the judgment of the Representatives makes it
      impracticable or inadvisable to proceed with the public offering or the
      delivery of the Designated Securities on the terms and in the manner
      contemplated by the Prospectus as amended and supplemented; and

            (i) The Company shall have furnished or caused to be furnished to
      the Representatives at the Time of Delivery for the Designated Securities
      a certificate or certificates of officers of the Company satisfactory to
      the Representatives as to the accuracy of the representations and
      warranties of the Company herein at and as of such Time of Delivery, as to
      the performance by the Company of all of its obligations hereunder to be
      performed at or prior to such Time of Delivery, as to the matters set
      forth in subsections (a) and (f) of this Section and as to such other
      matters as the Representatives may reasonably request.

      8. (a) The Company will indemnify and hold harmless each Underwriter
against any losses, claims, damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which
such Underwriter may become subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such
losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out
of or are based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a
material fact contained in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary
prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any
amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
reimburse each Underwriter for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred
by such Underwriter in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim; provided, however, that the Company shall not be liable in any
such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability arises
out of or is based upon an untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or
omission or alleged omission made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary
prospectus supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such
amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by any Underwriter of Designated Securities
through the Representatives expressly for use in the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented relating to such Securities.

      (b) Each Underwriter will indemnify and hold harmless the Company against
any losses, claims, damages or liabilities to which the Company may become
subject, under the Act or otherwise, insofar as such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or are based upon an
untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material fact contained in any
Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus supplement, the Registration
Statement, the Prospectus as amended or supplemented and any other prospectus
relating to the Securities, or any amendment or supplement thereto, or arise out
of or are based upon the omission or alleged omission to state therein a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, in each case to the extent, but only to the extent, that
such untrue statement or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged
omission was made in any Preliminary Prospectus, any preliminary prospectus
supplement, the Registration Statement, the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented and any other prospectus relating to the Securities, or any such
amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with written
information furnished to the Company by such Underwriter through the
Representatives expressly for use therein;

and will reimburse the Company for any legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred by the Company in connection with investigating or defending any such
action or claim.

      (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above of notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying
party under such subsection, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the omission so to notify the indemnifying party shall
not relieve it from any liability which it may have to any indemnified party
otherwise than under such subsection. In case any such action shall be brought
against any indemnified party and it shall notify the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to participate
therein and, to the extent that it shall wish, jointly with any other
indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the
consent of the indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and,
after notice from the indemnifying party to such indemnified party of its
election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying party shall not be
liable to such indemnified party under such subsection for any legal expenses of
other counsel or any other expenses, in each case subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party, in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation.

      (d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section 8 is unavailable
to or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party under subsection (a) or
(b) above in respect of any losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions
in respect thereof) referred to therein, then each indemnifying party shall
contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result
of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof)
in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received
by the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated Securities
on the other from the offering of the Designated Securities to which such loss,
claim, damage or liability (or action in respect thereof) relates. If, however,
the allocation provided by the immediately preceding sentence is not permitted
by applicable law or if the indemnified party failed to give the notice required
under subsection (c) above, then each indemnifying party shall contribute to
such amount paid or payable by such indemnified party in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative
fault of the Company on the one hand and the Underwriters of the Designated
Securities on the other in connection with the statements or omissions which
resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect
thereof), as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Company on the one hand and such Underwriters on the
other shall be deemed to be in the same proportion as the total net proceeds
from such offering (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to
the total underwriting discounts and commissions received by such Underwriters,
in each case as set forth in the table on the cover page of the Prospectus as
amended or supplemented to relate to a particular offering of Designated
Securities. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
supplied by the Company on the one hand or such Underwriters on the other and
the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity
to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The Company and the
Underwriters agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution
pursuant to this subsection (d) were determined by pro rata allocation (even if
the Underwriters were treated as one entity for such purpose) or by any other
method of allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations

                                      -15-

<PAGE>

referred to above in this subsection (d). The amount paid or payable by an
indemnified party as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
actions in respect thereof) referred to above in this subsection (d) shall be
deemed to include any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this subsection (d), no Underwriter
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the applicable Designated Securities underwritten by it and
distributed to the public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any
damages which such Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of
such untrue or alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No
person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The obligations of the Underwriters
of Designated Securities in this subsection (d) to contribute are several in
proportion to their respective underwriting obligations with respect to such
Securities and not joint.

      (e) The obligations of the Company under this Section 8 shall be in
addition to any liability which the Company may otherwise have and shall extend,
upon the same terms and conditions, to each person, if any, who controls any
Underwriter within the meaning of the Act; and the obligations of the
Underwriters under this Section 8 shall be in addition to any liability which
the respective Underwriters may otherwise have and shall extend, upon the same
terms and conditions, to each officer and director of the Company and to each
person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of the Act.

      9. (a) If any Underwriter shall default in its obligation to purchase the
Designated Securities which it has agreed to purchase under the Pricing
Agreement relating to such Designated Securities, the Representatives may in
their discretion arrange for themselves or another party or other parties to
purchase such Designated Securities on the terms contained herein. If within
thirty-six hours after such default by any Underwriter the Representatives do
not arrange for the purchase of such Designated Securities, then the Company
shall be entitled to a further period of thirty-six hours within which to
procure another party or other parties satisfactory to the Representatives to
purchase such Designated Securities on such terms. In the event that, within the
respective prescribed period, the Representatives notify the Company that they
have so arranged for the purchase of such Designated Securities, or the Company
notifies the Representatives that it has so arranged for the purchase of such
Designated Securities, the Representatives or the Company shall have the right
to postpone the Time of Delivery for such Designated Securities for a period of
not more than seven days, in order to effect whatever changes may thereby be
made necessary in the Registration Statement or the Prospectus as amended or
supplemented, or in any other documents or arrangements, and the Company agrees
to file promptly any amendments or supplements to the Registration Statement or
the Prospectus which in the opinion of the Representatives may thereby be made
necessary. The term "Underwriter" as used in this Agreement shall include any
person substituted under this Section with like effect as if such person had
originally been a party to the Pricing Agreement with respect to such Designated
Securities.

      (b) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of such Designated Securities which remains
unpurchased does not exceed one-eleventh of

                                      -16-

<PAGE>

the aggregate principal amount of the Designated Securities, then the Company
shall have the right to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase the
principal amount of Designated Securities which such Underwriter agreed to
purchase under the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities and,
in addition, to require each non-defaulting Underwriter to purchase its pro rata
share (based on the principal amount of Designated Securities which such
Underwriter agreed to purchase under such Pricing Agreement) of the Designated
Securities of such defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters for which such
arrangements have not been made; but nothing herein shall relieve a defaulting
Underwriter from liability for its default.

      (c) If, after giving effect to any arrangements for the purchase of the
Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or Underwriters by the
Representatives and the Company as provided in subsection (a) above, the
aggregate principal amount of Designated Securities which remains unpurchased
exceeds one-eleventh of the aggregate principal amount of the Designated
Securities, as referred to in subsection (b) above, or if the Company shall not
exercise the right described in subsection (b) above to require non-defaulting
Underwriters to purchase Designated Securities of a defaulting Underwriter or
Underwriters, then the Pricing Agreement relating to such Designated Securities
shall thereupon terminate, without liability on the part of any non-defaulting
Underwriter or the Company, except for the expenses to be borne by the Company
and the Underwriters as provided in Section 6 hereof and the indemnity and
contribution agreements in Section 8 hereof; but nothing herein shall relieve a
defaulting Underwriter from liability for its default.

      10. The respective indemnities, agreements, representations, warranties
and other statements of the Company and the several Underwriters, as set forth
in this Agreement or made by or on behalf of them, respectively, pursuant to
this Agreement, shall remain in full force and effect, regardless of any
investigation (or any statement as to the results thereof) made by or on behalf
of any Underwriter or any controlling person of any Underwriter, or the Company,
or any officer or director or controlling person of the Company, and shall
survive delivery of and payment for the Securities.

      11. If any Pricing Agreement shall be terminated pursuant to Section 9
hereof, the Company shall not then be under any liability to any Underwriter
with respect to the Designated Securities covered by such Pricing Agreement
except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof; but, if for any other
reason Designated Securities are not delivered by or on behalf of the Company as
provided herein, the Company will reimburse the Underwriters through the
Representatives for all out-of-pocket expenses approved in writing by the
Representatives, including fees and disbursements of counsel, reasonably
incurred by the Underwriters in making preparations for the purchase, sale and
delivery of such Designated Securities, but the Company shall then be under no
further liability to any Underwriter with respect to such Designated Securities
except as provided in Section 6 and Section 8 hereof.

      12. In all dealings hereunder, the Representatives of the Underwriters of
Designated Securities shall act on behalf of each of such Underwriters, and the
parties hereto shall be entitled to act and rely upon any statement, request,
notice or agreement on behalf of any Underwriter made or given by such
Representatives jointly or by such of the Representatives, if any, as may be
designated for such purpose in the Pricing Agreement.

                                      -17-

<PAGE>

      All statements, requests, notices and agreements hereunder shall be in
writing, and if to the Underwriters shall be delivered or sent by mail, telex or
facsimile transmission to the address of the Representatives as set forth in the
Pricing Agreement; and if to the Company shall be delivered or sent by mail,
telex or facsimile transmission to the address of the Company set forth in the
Registration Statement: Attention: Secretary; provided, however, that any notice
to an Underwriter pursuant to Section 8(c) hereof shall be delivered or sent by
mail, telex or facsimile transmission to such Underwriter at its address set
forth in its Underwriters' Questionnaire, or telex constituting such
Questionnaire, which address will be supplied to the Company by the
Representatives upon request. Any such statements, requests, notices or
agreements shall take effect upon receipt thereof.

      13. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement shall be binding upon, and
inure solely to the benefit of, the Underwriters, the Company and, to the extent
provided in Section 8 and Section 10 hereof, the officers and directors of the
Company and each person who controls the Company or any Underwriter, and their
respective heirs, executors, administrators, successors and assigns, and no
other person shall acquire or have any right under or by virtue of this
Agreement or any such Pricing Agreement. No purchaser of any of the Securities
from any Underwriter shall be deemed a successor or assign by reason merely of
such purchase.

      14. Time shall be of the essence of each Pricing Agreement. As used
herein, "business day" shall mean any day when the Commission's office in
Washington, D.C. is open for business.

      15. THIS AGREEMENT AND EACH PRICING AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND
CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

      16. This Agreement and each Pricing Agreement may be executed by any one
or more of the parties hereto and thereto in any number of counterparts, each of
which shall be deemed to be an original, but all such respective counterparts
shall together constitute one and the same instrument.

ANNEX I

                                Pricing Agreement

[NAMES OF CO-REPRESENTATIVE(S),]
   As Representatives of the several
   Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto,

      ________________, 20__

Dear Sirs:

      The Kroger Co., an Ohio corporation (the "Company"), proposes, subject to
the terms and conditions stated herein and in the Underwriting Agreement, dated
_________________ (the "Underwriting Agreement"), to issue and sell to the
Underwriters named in Schedule I hereto (the "Underwriters") the Securities
specified in Schedule II hereto (the "Designated Securities"). Each of the
provisions of the Underwriting Agreement is incorporated herein by reference in
its entirety, and shall be deemed to be a part of this Agreement to the same
extent as if such provisions had been set forth in full herein; and each of the
representations and warranties set forth therein shall be deemed to have been
made at and as of the date of this Pricing Agreement, except that each
representation and warranty which refers to the Prospectus in Section 2 of the
Underwriting Agreement shall be deemed to be a representation or warranty as of
the date of the Underwriting Agreement in relation to the Prospectus (as therein
defined), and also a representation and warranty as of the date of this Pricing
Agreement in relation to the Prospectus as amended or supplemented relating to
the Designated Securities which are the subject of this Pricing Agreement. Each
reference to the Representatives herein and in the provisions of the
Underwriting Agreement so incorporated by reference shall be deemed to refer to
you. Unless otherwise defined herein, terms defined in the Underwriting
Agreement are used herein as therein defined. The Representatives designated to
act on behalf of each of the Underwriters of the Designated Securities pursuant
to Section 12 of the Underwriting Agreement and the address of the
Representatives referred to in such Section 12 are set forth at the end of
Schedule II hereto.

      An amendment to the Registration Statement, or a supplement to the
Prospectus, as the case may be, relating to the Designated Securities, in the
form heretofore delivered to you is now proposed to be filed with the
Commission.

      Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein and in the
Underwriting Agreement incorporated herein by reference, the Company agrees to
issue and sell to each of the Underwriters, and each of the Underwriters agrees,
severally and not jointly, to purchase from the Company, at the time and place
and at the purchase price to the Underwriters set forth in Schedule II hereto,
the principal amount of Designated Securities set forth opposite the name of
such Underwriter in Schedule I hereto.

      If the foregoing is in accordance with your understanding, please sign and
return to us __ counterparts hereof, and upon acceptance hereof by you, on
behalf of each of the Underwriters, this letter and such acceptance hereof,
including the provisions of the Underwriting Agreement incorporated herein by
reference, shall constitute a binding agreement between each of the Underwriters
and the Company. It is understood that your acceptance of this letter on behalf
of each of the Underwriters is or will be pursuant to the authority set forth in

      ANNEX II

      Pursuant to Section 7 (d) of the Underwriting Agreement, the accountants
shall furnish letters to the Underwriters to the effect that:

            (i) They are independent certified public accountants with respect
      to the Company and its subsidiaries within the meaning of the Act and the
      applicable published rules and regulations thereunder;

            (ii) In their opinion, the financial statements and any
      supplementary financial information and schedules audited (and, if
      applicable, prospective financial statements and/or pro forma financial
      information examined) by them and included or incorporated by reference in
      the Registration Statement or the Prospectus comply as to form in all
      material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Act
      or the Exchange Act, as applicable, and the related published rules and
      regulations thereunder; and, if applicable, they have made a review in
      accordance with standards established by the American Institute of
      Certified Public Accountants of the consolidated interim financial
      statements, selected financial data, pro forma financial information,
      prospective financial statements and/or condensed financial statements
      derived from audited financial statements of the Company for the periods
      specified in such letter, as indicated in their reports thereon, copies of
      which have been furnished to the representatives of the Underwriters (the
      "Representatives");

            (iii) The unaudited selected financial information with respect to
      the consolidated results of operations and financial position of the
      Company for the five most recent fiscal years included in the Prospectus
      and included or incorporated by reference in Item 6 of the Company's
      Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal year agrees with the
      corresponding amounts (after restatement where applicable) in the audited
      consolidated financial statements for five such fiscal years which were
      included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Reports on
      Form 10-K for such fiscal years;

            (iv) On the basis of limited procedures, not constituting an audit
      in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards, consisting of a
      reading of the unaudited financial statements and other information
      referred to below, a reading of the latest available interim financial
      statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, inspection of the minute
      books of the Company and its subsidiaries since the date of the latest

      Prospectus, inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries
      responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other inquiries
      and procedures as may be specified in such letter, nothing came to their
      attention that caused them to believe that:

            (A) the unaudited condensed consolidated statements of income,
        consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of cash flows
        included or incorporated by reference in the Company's Quarterly Reports

        requirements of the Exchange Act as it applies to Form 10-Q and the
        related published rules and regulations thereunder or are not in
        conformity with generally accepted accounting principles applied on a
        basis substantially consistent with the basis for the audited
        consolidated statements of income, consolidated balance sheets and
        consolidated statements of cash flows included or incorporated by

            sheet items included in the Prospectus do not agree with the
            corresponding items in the unaudited consolidated financial
            statements from which such data and items were derived, and any such
            unaudited data and items were not determined on a basis
            substantially consistent with the basis for the corresponding
            amounts in the audited consolidated financial statements included or
            incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual Report on Form
            10-K for the most recent fiscal year;

                  (C) the unaudited financial statements which were not included
            in the Prospectus but from which were derived the unaudited
            condensed financial statements referred to in clause (A) and any
            unaudited income statement data and balance sheet items included in
            the Prospectus and referred to in Clause (B) were not determined on

            financial statements included or incorporated by reference in the
            Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal
            year;

            applicable accounting requirements of the Act and the published
            rules and regulations thereunder or the pro forma adjustments have
            not been properly applied to the historical amounts in the
            compilation of those statements;

                  (E) as of a specified date not more than five days prior to
            the date of such letter, there have been any changes in the
            consolidated capital stock (other than issuances of capital stock
            upon exercise of options and stock appreciation rights, upon
            earn-outs of performance shares and upon conversions of convertible

            Prospectus, except in each case for changes, increases or decreases
            which the Prospectus discloses have occurred or may occur or which
            are described in such letter; and

                  (F) for the period from the date of the latest financial
            statements included or incorporated by reference in the Prospectus
            to the specified date referred to in Clause (E) there were any
            decreases in consolidated net revenues or operating profit or the
            total or per share amounts of consolidated net income or other items
            specified by the Representatives, or any increases in any items
            specified by the Representatives, in each case as compared with the
            comparable period of the preceding year and with any other period of

            each case for increases or decreases which the Prospectus discloses
