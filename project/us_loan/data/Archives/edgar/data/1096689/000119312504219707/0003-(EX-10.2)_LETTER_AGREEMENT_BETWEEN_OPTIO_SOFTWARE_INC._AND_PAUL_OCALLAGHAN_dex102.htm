to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. In this regard, the Company recognizes that, as is the case with many publicly held corporations, the possibility of a change in control may exist
and that such possibility, and the uncertainty and questions which it may raise among management, may result in the departure or distraction of management personnel to the detriment of the Company and its shareholders. Accordingly, the
Company&#146;s Board of Directors has determined that appropriate steps should be taken to reinforce and encourage the continued attention and dedication of members of the Company&#146;s management, including yourself, to their assigned duties
without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
