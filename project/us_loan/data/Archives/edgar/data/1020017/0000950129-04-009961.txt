<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT (&#147;<I>Agreement&#148;</I>) is by and between I-Sector Corporation, a Delaware
corporation with principal offices at 6401 Southwest Freeway, Houston, Texas 77074 (&#147;Company&#148;) and
Brian Fontana, an individual residing at 4817 Palm Street, Bellaire, TX 77401 (&#147;Employee&#148;) and is
effective January&nbsp;3, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of Employee&#146;s employment or continued employment by Company and any
additional compensation or benefits that Company may now or from time to time bestow upon Employee,
Employee and Company agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;Company Shall Provide Confidential Information. </B>To the extent necessary to perform his or her
duties hereunder, Company shall provide to and/or will give Employee access to pertinent
Confidential Information (defined below) of Company. In addition, because of the nature of
Employee&#146;s duties and responsibilities to Company, Employee from time to time will have access or
be exposed to certain other Confidential Information of Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;Employees Who Sell Company&#146;s Products and Services. </B>As used in this Agreement, the word
&#147;Employee&#148; shall be deemed to include, but not be limited to, Company&#146;s Sales Agents and Sales
Managers. In the event Employee deals, in any way, with Company&#146;s customers, Employee agrees that
the empathy, rapport and goodwill (collectively &#147;goodwill&#148;) he/she develops with Company&#146;s
customers are extremely valuable and necessary for the sale(s) of Company&#146;s products and services
to such customers and shall be deemed to be protectable and proprietary interests of Company and
not of Employee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;Company&#146;s Confidential Information. </B>Employee agrees that all of Company&#146;s Confidential
Information, whatever its nature and/or form and whether obtained by Employee orally, by
observation, by exposure to customers or other persons, from written materials or otherwise, shall
at all times be the exclusive and confidential property of Company and shall be at all times
regarded, treated and protected as such by Employee in accordance with this <I>Agreement</I>. Further,
Employee agrees that Company&#146;s Confidential Information of which he/she learns at any time shall be
deemed to have been provided by Company to Employee, in confidence, irrespective of whether or not
Company provided same to Employee or whether prepared, discovered, developed or contributed to,
wholly or in part, by Employee or any other individual or entity during Employee&#146;s employment with
Company or prior to such employment with Company. Employee agrees that such Confidential
Information is not only the proprietary and protectable property of Company, but that it shall be
treated and kept as secret by Employee at all times and any unauthorized use and/or disclosure of
same, or any part thereof, will constitute a breach(es) of this Agreement and will constitute a
breach(es) of Employee&#146;s fiduciary duty to Company regarding the Confidential Information and will
constitute a breach(es) of the confidential relationship between Company and Employee regarding the
Confidential Information. Employee agrees that all of Company&#146;s Confidential Information,
including but not limited to, the specific items listed in paragraph 3, below, is not known to
Company&#146;s competitors and such competitors do not use such specific information in their business.
Employee further agrees that none of the specific items listed in paragraph 3, below, are matters
of public knowledge or of general knowledge in the industry in which Company conducts its business;
Employee agrees that none of such specific items are readily ascertainable by any competitor of
Company by reasonable and ordinary means; Employee agrees that Company&#146;s Confidential Information
is proprietary to, about or created by Company and gives Company some competitive business
advantage or the opportunity of obtaining such advantage. Employee agrees that the unauthorized
disclosure or use of Company&#146;s Confidential Information might be detrimental to the interests of
Company. Employee agrees that Company&#146;s Confidential Information is not typically disclosed by
Company to, or known by third parties who are not employed by Company. Employee agrees that
Company&#146;s Confidential Information also includes, but is not limited to, information known by
Employee to be considered confidential by Company, or from all the relevant circumstances
considered confidential by Company, or from all the relevant circumstances should reasonably be
assumed by Employee to be confidential and proprietary to Company. Employee agrees that Company
utilizes continuing and effective means of preserving

asserting such exclusion. For purposes of this <I>Agreement, </I>the following definitions shall apply:

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>PRESS RELEASE</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>I-Sector Announces Hiring Of CFO</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">HOUSTON&#151;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#151;Dec. 16, 2004&#151;I-Sector Corporation (AMEX:ISR; the &#147;Company&#148; &#151; News)
announced today that it has named Brian Fontana to serve as its Chief Financial Officer, effective
January&nbsp;3, 2005.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Fontana has previously held the position of CFO at three NYSE listed public companies, one
Nasdaq listed company and two privately held companies. He has an extensive financial management
background that includes the management of the accounting, finance, investor relations, internal
information systems and legal functions for large, complex organizations, including organizations
that were executing strategies for rapid expansion through acquisitions. As CFO, he has managed
multiple initial public offerings, follow on equity offerings, private equity offerings, public
debt placements and syndicated bank financings.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Fontana&#146;s prior experience includes serving as CFO of: 1) Talent Tree, Inc., a privately-held
4,000 employee contingent workforce outsourcing organization with 50 locations throughout the U.S.;
2) PerformanceRetail, Inc., an early-stage venture-capital funded software company; 3) Drypers
Corporation, a NASDAQ listed $400&nbsp;million revenue multinational diaper manufacturing company; 4)
Pentacon, Inc., a NYSE listed $300&nbsp;million revenue fastener distribution company; 5) Prime
Service, Inc., a NYSE listed $500&nbsp;million revenue equipment rental company; and 6) National
Convenience Stores, Inc., a NYSE listed $1&nbsp;billion revenue operator of convenience stores.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Regarding Mr.&nbsp;Fontana&#146;s appointment to the position of Chief Financial Officer of I-Sector, James
H. Long, Chairman and CEO of I-Sector stated, &#147;I am delighted that we have been able to attract a
CFO of Brian&#146;s caliber. Brian brings advanced, broad-based financial management experience that
will be critically important as I-Sector continues to grow, particularly as we begin the process of
expanding nationally through acquisitions. I am impressed with Brian&#146;s experience, energy level,
work ethic and values. His experience heading up the financial management of companies involved in
rapid expansion through acquisition will be invaluable as I-Sector executes its plans to create a
national presence through strategic acquisitions. His skills in building financial and operating
disciplines in larger, more complex, geographically disbursed organizations will enhance our
ability to execute our strategy of national expansion. We have taken considerable time and
expended considerable energy seeking to fill the CFO position with the best possible candidate and
I am confident that Brian is the right person for the job; I am excited about the addition to our
executive management team, I am confident that Brian will make a significant contribution to our
organization and I look forward to working with him.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Fontana is 47&nbsp;years old, is a 1981 graduate of the University of Texas, where he earned a BBA
in Finance, and is married with two children.
