created by this <I>Agreement, </I>other than the one-time cash payment described hereinafter, are
discretionary and may be changed from time to time at the sole discretion of Company, however,
total compensation, as changed, shall not be lower than the base compensation in effect at the time
the change is made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;Duties, Responsibilities. </B>Employee shall function in whatever capacity(ies) Company shall
assign, whether for Company or its subsidiary(ies) and shall report to such executive officer, or

Employee&#146;s duties to Company. Employee represents and warrants to Company that this <I>Agreement</I>, the
performance of his/her obligations under this <I>Agreement </I>or the employment relationship between
Company and Employee under this <I>Agreement </I>do not and will not violate or conflict with any
non-competition (as pertaining to being employed by a competitor), non-solicitation (as pertaining
to customers), non-interference (as pertaining to employees, agents or servants) or confidentiality
agreement (as pertaining to trade secrets and other confidential information), or any other
obligation to which Employee is subject. Employee also represents and warrants to Company that
he/she will not use the trade secrets or other confidential information of former employers or
others in connection with his/her employment by Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.&nbsp;Fiduciary Duties. </B>Employee acknowledges and agrees that Employee owes a fiduciary duty of
loyalty, fidelity and allegiance to act at all times in the best interests of Company. Employee

reputation of Company or any of its Affiliates (as defined below in paragraph 6). Additionally,

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">(g)&nbsp;Enforcement
of the above paragraphs 7 (b)&nbsp;through (e), inclusive, is the only practical means of enforcing paragraph 7(a), above, and of enforcing the <I>Confidentiality Agreement</I>.
Employee agrees that enforcement of paragraphs 7 (b)&nbsp;through (e), inclusive, is necessary to
protect Company&#146;s goodwill and other business interests. Paragraphs 7 (a)&nbsp;through (e),
inclusive, shall be deemed ancillary to the <I>Confidentiality Agreement</I>. Employee agrees that
all of the provisions of this <I>Agreement </I>and the <I>Confidentiality Agreement </I>are valid and
enforceable as written and according to their terms. For purposes of this <I>Agreement, </I>the
following definitions shall apply: (a) &#147;Company&#148; shall be deemed to mean and refer to the
entity named in the first paragraph hereof; (b) &#147;Parent&#148; shall be deemed to mean and refer
to any corporation which, directly or indirectly, controls Company or the referred to
subsidiaries through ownership or control of at least 80% of the authorized, issued and
outstanding shares of the common voting stock of Company or each of such subsidiaries; (c)
the word &#147;Affiliates<I>&#148; </I>includes Company&#146;s Parent (if any) and subsidiaries of Company or
Company&#146;s Parent (if any). The obligations of Employee as to this paragraph 7 hereof shall
apply to Company and its Affiliates, in which case such Affiliates shall be deemed to be
third party beneficiaries of such paragraph. The obligations of Company hereunder shall not
apply to such Parent and/or subsidiaries.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>8.&nbsp;Assignment. </B>This Agreement applies to Company and its subsidiaries, Affiliates, successors,
assigns or its associated companies. Company may assign this Agreement at any time without notice
(but Employee cannot). This Agreement is personal to Employee and no individual or entity shall
have any interest in same except Employee, personally, on the one hand, and Company and its
subsidiaries, Affiliates, successors, assigns or its associated companies, on the other hand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>9.&nbsp;Savings Clause &#151; Non-Waiver. </B>The failure of Company to at any time enforce any provision hereof
shall never be construed to be a waiver of such provision or of the right of Company to enforce
each and every provision hereof at any time. In the event any paragraph, provision or clause, or
any combination of same hereof shall be found or held to be unenforceable at law or in equity, or
under any ordinance, statute or regulation, such finding or holding shall not in any way affect the
other paragraphs, provisions and clauses which shall remain in full force and effect.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>10.&nbsp;Attorney&#146;s Fees &#151; Venue. </B>This Agreement shall be governed by the internal laws, and not the
law of conflicts, of the State of Texas, or, at Company&#146;s option, governed by the internal laws of
the state or states where this Agreement, and/or any of its provisions, may be at issue in any
litigation involving Company, in all respects. Venue respecting any litigation arising from this
Agreement and/or Employee&#146;s employment with Company shall, at Company&#146;s option, be properly laid
only in a court of competent jurisdiction in Harris County, Texas. Each party hereto acknowledges
and agrees that it has had the opportunity to consult with its own legal counsel in connection with
the negotiation of this <I>Agreement </I>and that it has bargaining power equal to that of the other party
hereto in connection with the negotiation, execution and delivery of the <I>Agreement. </I>Accordingly,
the parties hereto agree that the rule of contract construction that an agreement shall be
construed against the drafter shall have no application in the construction or interpretation of
this <I>Agreement.</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>11.&nbsp;Termination. </B>Employee&#146;s employment by Company may be terminated at any time by either party,
with or without cause. However, in any case in which the Company terminates the employment
relationship without cause, severance compensation equal to six months base salary, plus an addition one month of
base salary for each year of employment, up to an additional six months of base salary, for a
maximum of twelve months of base salary if the employment relationship had extended six years or
more shall be paid. The covenants and agreements of Employee set forth in paragraph 7 are of a
continuing nature and shall survive the expiration, termination or cancellation of this <I>Agreement</I>
and Employee&#146;s employment with Company regardless of the reason(s) for such termination or
cancellation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>12.&nbsp;Consideration For This </B><B><I>Agreement</I></B><B>. </B>In addition to the employment, or continued employment, of
the Employee by Company, and in addition to the mutual covenants and promises of the parties
contained herein, Company shall, contemporaneous with the execution of this <I>Agreement </I>by Employee,
or within thirty days thereafter, pay to Employee additional and special consideration of a
one-time cash payment of $100.00 as additional and special consideration to support the covenants
and agreements of Employee contained herein. Such $100.00 is paid for both this <I>Agreement </I><B>and </B>the
