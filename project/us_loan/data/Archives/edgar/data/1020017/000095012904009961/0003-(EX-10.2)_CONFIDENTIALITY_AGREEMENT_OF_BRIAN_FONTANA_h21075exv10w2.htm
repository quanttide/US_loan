<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>CONFIDENTIALITY, DEVELOPMENT AND NON-INTERFERENCE AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS AGREEMENT (&#147;<I>Agreement&#148;</I>) is by and between I-Sector Corporation, a Delaware
corporation with principal offices at 6401 Southwest Freeway, Houston, Texas 77074 (&#147;Company&#148;) and
Brian Fontana, an individual residing at 4817 Palm Street, Bellaire, TX 77401 (&#147;Employee&#148;) and is
effective January&nbsp;3, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In consideration of Employee&#146;s employment or continued employment by Company and any
additional compensation or benefits that Company may now or from time to time bestow upon Employee,
Employee and Company agree as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>1.&nbsp;Company Shall Provide Confidential Information. </B>To the extent necessary to perform his or her
duties hereunder, Company shall provide to and/or will give Employee access to pertinent
Confidential Information (defined below) of Company. In addition, because of the nature of
Employee&#146;s duties and responsibilities to Company, Employee from time to time will have access or
be exposed to certain other Confidential Information of Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>2.&nbsp;Employees Who Sell Company&#146;s Products and Services. </B>As used in this Agreement, the word
&#147;Employee&#148; shall be deemed to include, but not be limited to, Company&#146;s Sales Agents and Sales
Managers. In the event Employee deals, in any way, with Company&#146;s customers, Employee agrees that
the empathy, rapport and goodwill (collectively &#147;goodwill&#148;) he/she develops with Company&#146;s
customers are extremely valuable and necessary for the sale(s) of Company&#146;s products and services
to such customers and shall be deemed to be protectable and proprietary interests of Company and
not of Employee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>3.&nbsp;Company&#146;s Confidential Information. </B>Employee agrees that all of Company&#146;s Confidential
Information, whatever its nature and/or form and whether obtained by Employee orally, by
observation, by exposure to customers or other persons, from written materials or otherwise, shall
at all times be the exclusive and confidential property of Company and shall be at all times
regarded, treated and protected as such by Employee in accordance with this <I>Agreement</I>. Further,
Employee agrees that Company&#146;s Confidential Information of which he/she learns at any time shall be
deemed to have been provided by Company to Employee, in confidence, irrespective of whether or not
Company provided same to Employee or whether prepared, discovered, developed or contributed to,
wholly or in part, by Employee or any other individual or entity during Employee&#146;s employment with
Company or prior to such employment with Company. Employee agrees that such Confidential
Information is not only the proprietary and protectable property of Company, but that it shall be
treated and kept as secret by Employee at all times and any unauthorized use and/or disclosure of
same, or any part thereof, will constitute a breach(es) of this Agreement and will constitute a
breach(es) of Employee&#146;s fiduciary duty to Company regarding the Confidential Information and will
constitute a breach(es) of the confidential relationship between Company and Employee regarding the
Confidential Information. Employee agrees that all of Company&#146;s Confidential Information,
including but not limited to, the specific items listed in paragraph 3, below, is not known to
Company&#146;s competitors and such competitors do not use such specific information in their business.
Employee further agrees that none of the specific items listed in paragraph 3, below, are matters
of public knowledge or of general knowledge in the industry in which Company conducts its business;
Employee agrees that none of such specific items are readily ascertainable by any competitor of
Company by reasonable and ordinary means; Employee agrees that Company&#146;s Confidential Information
is proprietary to, about or created by Company and gives Company some competitive business
advantage or the opportunity of obtaining such advantage. Employee agrees that the unauthorized
disclosure or use of Company&#146;s Confidential Information might be detrimental to the interests of
Company. Employee agrees that Company&#146;s Confidential Information is not typically disclosed by
Company to, or known by third parties who are not employed by Company. Employee agrees that
Company&#146;s Confidential Information also includes, but is not limited to, information known by
Employee to be considered confidential by Company, or from all the relevant circumstances
considered confidential by Company, or from all the relevant circumstances should reasonably be
assumed by Employee to be confidential and proprietary to Company. Employee agrees that Company
utilizes continuing and effective means of preserving
