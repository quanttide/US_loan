<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>I-Sector Announces Hiring Of CFO</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">HOUSTON&#151;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#151;Dec. 16, 2004&#151;I-Sector Corporation (AMEX:ISR; the &#147;Company&#148; &#151; News)
announced today that it has named Brian Fontana to serve as its Chief Financial Officer, effective
January&nbsp;3, 2005.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Fontana has previously held the position of CFO at three NYSE listed public companies, one
Nasdaq listed company and two privately held companies. He has an extensive financial management
background that includes the management of the accounting, finance, investor relations, internal
information systems and legal functions for large, complex organizations, including organizations
that were executing strategies for rapid expansion through acquisitions. As CFO, he has managed
multiple initial public offerings, follow on equity offerings, private equity offerings, public
debt placements and syndicated bank financings.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Fontana&#146;s prior experience includes serving as CFO of: 1) Talent Tree, Inc., a privately-held
4,000 employee contingent workforce outsourcing organization with 50 locations throughout the U.S.;
2) PerformanceRetail, Inc., an early-stage venture-capital funded software company; 3) Drypers
Corporation, a NASDAQ listed $400&nbsp;million revenue multinational diaper manufacturing company; 4)
Pentacon, Inc., a NYSE listed $300&nbsp;million revenue fastener distribution company; 5) Prime
Service, Inc., a NYSE listed $500&nbsp;million revenue equipment rental company; and 6) National
Convenience Stores, Inc., a NYSE listed $1&nbsp;billion revenue operator of convenience stores.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Regarding Mr.&nbsp;Fontana&#146;s appointment to the position of Chief Financial Officer of I-Sector, James
H. Long, Chairman and CEO of I-Sector stated, &#147;I am delighted that we have been able to attract a
CFO of Brian&#146;s caliber. Brian brings advanced, broad-based financial management experience that
will be critically important as I-Sector continues to grow, particularly as we begin the process of
expanding nationally through acquisitions. I am impressed with Brian&#146;s experience, energy level,
work ethic and values. His experience heading up the financial management of companies involved in
rapid expansion through acquisition will be invaluable as I-Sector executes its plans to create a
national presence through strategic acquisitions. His skills in building financial and operating
disciplines in larger, more complex, geographically disbursed organizations will enhance our
ability to execute our strategy of national expansion. We have taken considerable time and
expended considerable energy seeking to fill the CFO position with the best possible candidate and
I am confident that Brian is the right person for the job; I am excited about the addition to our
executive management team, I am confident that Brian will make a significant contribution to our
organization and I look forward to working with him.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mr.&nbsp;Fontana is 47&nbsp;years old, is a 1981 graduate of the University of Texas, where he earned a BBA
in Finance, and is married with two children.
