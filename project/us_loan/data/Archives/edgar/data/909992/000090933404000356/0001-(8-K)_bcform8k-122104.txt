                                THE BEARD COMPANY

                                    FORM 8-K

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

     The Company has arranged for an investment banking firm to sell $1,500,000
of 12% convertible subordinated notes to accredited investors in a private
placement on a best efforts basis. The Company or Additional Selling Agents may
also sell some of the notes. The notes are convertible into shares of the
Company's common stock at a Conversion Price of $1.00 per share. The investment
banking firm will receive a 6% commission on the notes which they sell and will
also receive warrants to purchase up to 60,000 shares of the Company's common
stock depending upon the amount of notes it sells.

     The purpose of the offering is two-fold: assuming the maximum amount of the
notes are sold (i) a portion of the net proceeds of the offering will be used to
provide the Company with the necessary working capital to bridge the gap until
it obtains the funds necessary to proceed with a coal reclamation project (the
Pinnacle Project) which it expects to commence during the first quarter of 2005,
and (ii) the remainder of the net proceeds would be used to finance the Pinnacle
Project, if necessary.

     In connection with the private placement, the Company has disclosed
material non-public information to the Private Placement Agent and will be
disclosing such information to other parties who receive the Confidential
Private Placement Memorandum (the "PPM").

     The securities offered have not been and will not be registered under the
Securities Act of 1933 or any state securities laws and may not be offered or
sold absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration
requirements.

     Included in the PPM is a schedule of five pending coal reclamation projects
that Beard Technologies, Inc. ("BTI") is currently working on which sets forth
the anticipated life of each project (ranging from five and one-half to nine
years), together with the slurry reserves, anticipated clean coal production,
anticipated gross revenues, anticipated capital costs and estimated free cash
flow for such projects. Collectively the projects are estimated to have slurry
reserves of 28,100,000 tons, recoverable clean coal of 12,051,000 tons, future
gross revenues of $236,103,000, total capital costs of $38,500,000, and free
cash flow of $128,739,000 during the life of the projects.

     Also included in the PPM were the Statements of Projected Operations and
the accompanying Notes to the Statements of Projected Operations attached as
Exhibit 99.1 under Item 9.01 hereof. The Statements of Projected Operations,
which are set forth in Exhibit 99.1, were made based upon the assumptions set
forth in the Notes to the Statements of Projected Operations, which assume that
the projects described therein actually materialize and that the required
financing therefor is obtained. However, as pointed out in the Notes to the
Statements of Projected Operations, there is no assurance that the required
financing will be obtained or that any of the projects will materialize.

     If less than $1,500,000 is raised in the offering, then the Company is
prepared to seek project financing for the Pinnacle Project to provide any
shortfall.
