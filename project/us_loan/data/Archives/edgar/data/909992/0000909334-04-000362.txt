Information to be Included in the Report

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

     On December 21, 2004, the Company filed a Form 8-K reporting that it had
arranged for an investment banking firm to sell $1,500,000 of 12% convertible
subordinated notes (the "Notes") to accredited investors in a private placement
on a best efforts basis and issued a press release in connection therewith.

     In connection with the private placement, the Company disclosed material
information to the Private Placement Agent and such information will be
disclosed to other parties who receive the Confidential Private Placement
Memorandum (the "PPM"). Pursuant to Regulation FD, the Company disclosed this
material information in the Company's Form 8-K filed December 21, 2004.

     On December 29, 2004, the Company amended the offering (the "Amended PPM")
to increase the amount being sold up to a maximum of $2,100,000 and to add a
schedule of production equipment owned by Beard Technologies, Inc. and having an
estimated fair market value of approximately $2,315,000. Holders of the Notes
will be granted a contingent security interest in the equipment in the event the
Company does not proceed with a coal reclamation project (the Pinnacle Project)
which it expects to commence during the first quarter of 2005.

     Included in the PPM were Statements of Projected Operations and the
accompanying Notes thereto which were attached as Exhibit 99.1 under Item 9.01
of the Company's December 21, 2004 Form 8-K filing. In the Amended PPM the
Statements of Projected Operations have been revised to reflect lower net
earnings per common share in 2006 and 2007 as a result of an increase in the
weighted average common shares expected to be outstanding for such years. A copy
of the revised Statements of Projected Operations is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The Notes have not changed since the earlier filing and the caveats thereto
still apply.

                           FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

The Statements of Projected Operations include "forward-looking statements"
within the meaning of Section 27a of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
Section 21e of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended. All statements
other than statements of historical facts are forward-looking statements.
Although we believe that the expectations reflected in such statements are
reasonable, we cannot assure you that such expectations will occur. Our actual
future performance could differ materially from such statements as a result of
many factors, including but not limited to coal prices, production costs, and
recoverable reserves. Important factors that could cause actual results to
differ materially from the Company's expectations are disclosed in the Amended
PPM and at pages 16-18 of the Company's Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
December 31, 2003.

                       THE BEARD COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

                 NOTES TO THE STATEMENTS OF PROJECTED OPERATIONS
                                   (Unaudited)

(a)  The Company's principal business is coal slurry pond reclamation. The Coal
     Segment is currently pursuing a number of different projects. On September
     7 the Company announced that BTI had signed an agreement to reclaim slurry
     for Pinnacle Mining Company, LLC. This agreement has an initial term of six
     years, extendible for an additional four years if significant recoverable
     reserves remain at the end of the initial term. The Company is also
     pursuing other projects as reflected in the Schedule of Active and
     Potential Projects at Exhibit A.

     The projections reflect Project A (Pinnacle) beginning in January 2005 and
     running through December 2010. The projections also assume that a second
     pond recovery project (Project B) starts in July 2005 and runs through
     November 2011, that a third pond recovery project (Project C) starts in
     January 2006 and runs through May 2014, that a fourth pond recovery project
     (Project D) starts in May 2006 and runs through September 2012, and that a
     fifth pond recovery project (Project E) starts in September 2006 and runs
     through January 2013. On each of the five pond recovery projects, the
     projections assume that BTI receives an overhead charge of $50,000 per
     month for the first five months and $30,000 per month thereafter from the
     LLC operating the projects.

     The projections assume that the Company owns 60% of the five Projects and
     that investors own 40%. The Company has retained, on a non-exclusive basis,
     a New York City based firm which specializes in the private placement of
     debt and equity securities for energy companies (the "Placement Agent") to
     raise $10,500,000 of equity from institutional investors to finance the
     five Projects, and it is further assumed that $5,000,000 of USDA-guaranteed
     financing will be secured for each of the five Projects. While it is
     pursuing the equity funding the Placement Agent will also be pursuing the
     placement of debt financing of up to $24,600,000 in the event the USDA
     financing fails to materialize or if the equity placement should be
     unsuccessful. However, there is no assurance that the required equity or
     debt financing will be obtained, that the USDA-guaranteed loans will be
     obtained or that any of the projects will materialize.

     The projections also assume that BTI's basic overhead increases by $90,000
     in 2005, by $150,000 in 2006, and by $150,000 in 2007.

(b)  2004 revenues, expenses and profits of the CO2 Segment have been based upon
     actual results for the first ten months of 2004, with anticipated
     improvement in revenues and net profit beginning in 2005 due to expected
     better marketing and pricing and reduced pipeline charges resulting from
     the McElmo Dome Settlement.

(c)  In China the projections assume that a "mini-plant", costing $1.6 million,
     is funded by outside investors who receive 90% of the cash flow from the
     project. The projections assume that the mini-plant is started in February
     2005, with payout of the investor's investment projected to occur in August
     2006. Beard Environmental Engineering, LLC's ("BEE") interest in the plant
     will increase to 50% after investor payout. The projections also assume
     that a second mini-plant, with similar cost and ownership, is started in
     December 2005, with payout projected to occur in June 2007. It is further
     assumed that the operations of each of the two plants will cover $30,000
     per month of the China Segment's overhead.

(d)  Revenues and expenses for the e-Commerce Segment have also been reflected
     in an anticipated worst case scenario. Revenues reflect the revenues
     presently anticipated from starpay's existing license agreement. starpay's
     basic overhead is assumed to remain at its present level of approximately
     $11,000 per month pending the outcome of the Visa litigation. In addition,
     starpay's share of the legal costs related to the lawsuit have been
     estimated at $30,000 for the last quarter of 2004, at $50,000 for 2005 and
     at $25,000 for 2006.

(e)  Includes all of the operating expenses of the Coal, CO2, China and
     e-Commerce Segments based upon the assumptions set forth in footnotes (a),
     (b), (c) and (d). Also assumes that Beard (Parent) overhead is at $960,000
     in 2004, increases to $1,200,000 in 2005 and drops to $1,100,000 in 2006.
     The $240,000 increase in 2005 is to cover the estimated cost of complying
     with the new Sarbanes-Oxley 404 requirements. It is anticipated that the
     cost for SOX 404 compliance will be less after the initial year.

(f)  Interest expense includes the interest associated with the Parent Company
     debt, together with the interest cost associated with the five Coal
     projects discussed in footnote (a). Interest cost associated with the
     current offering is not included since the amount of borrowings has not yet
     been determined.

(g)  Reflects our current estimate of the net earnings expected to be received
     from an unconsolidated subsidiary for the periods shown. It is anticipated
