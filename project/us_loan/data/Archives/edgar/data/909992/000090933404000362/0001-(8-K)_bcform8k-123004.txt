Information to be Included in the Report

Item 7.01 Regulation FD Disclosure.

     On December 21, 2004, the Company filed a Form 8-K reporting that it had
arranged for an investment banking firm to sell $1,500,000 of 12% convertible
subordinated notes (the "Notes") to accredited investors in a private placement
on a best efforts basis and issued a press release in connection therewith.

     In connection with the private placement, the Company disclosed material
information to the Private Placement Agent and such information will be
disclosed to other parties who receive the Confidential Private Placement
Memorandum (the "PPM"). Pursuant to Regulation FD, the Company disclosed this
material information in the Company's Form 8-K filed December 21, 2004.

     On December 29, 2004, the Company amended the offering (the "Amended PPM")
to increase the amount being sold up to a maximum of $2,100,000 and to add a
schedule of production equipment owned by Beard Technologies, Inc. and having an
estimated fair market value of approximately $2,315,000. Holders of the Notes
will be granted a contingent security interest in the equipment in the event the
Company does not proceed with a coal reclamation project (the Pinnacle Project)
which it expects to commence during the first quarter of 2005.

     Included in the PPM were Statements of Projected Operations and the
accompanying Notes thereto which were attached as Exhibit 99.1 under Item 9.01
of the Company's December 21, 2004 Form 8-K filing. In the Amended PPM the
Statements of Projected Operations have been revised to reflect lower net
earnings per common share in 2006 and 2007 as a result of an increase in the
weighted average common shares expected to be outstanding for such years. A copy
of the revised Statements of Projected Operations is attached as Exhibit 99.1.
The Notes have not changed since the earlier filing and the caveats thereto
still apply.
