ITEM 2.01         COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OF ASSETS

On December 9, 2004 the Registrant purchased all of the assets of Candent
Corporation that are used in the business of operating Internet-based online
dating, information, retail, industrial and financial portals. The Registrant
also assumed all of the liabilities of Candent Corporation that arose from that
business, although it is believed that there are no liabilities. The Registrant
assigned the assets and liabilities to a wholly-owned subsidiary named "Intrance
Corporation."

In consideration for the acquired assets, the Registrant caused Intrance
Corporation to issue 275,000 shares of a Series A Preferred Stock to Candent
Corporation. The holder of the Intrance preferred shares will received a
quarterly dividend equal to ten percent of Intrance's operating income. The
Intrance preferred shares are redeemable at a price of $10 per share. The holder
of the Intrance preferred shares can convert each share of Series A Preferred
Stock into one hundred shares of the Registrant's common stock. The holder of
Intrance Series A Preferred Stock is not entitled to vote at shareholders
meetings.

On the date of issue, all of the Intrance Series A Preferred Stock acquired by
Candent Corporation could be converted into 27,500,000 shares of the
Registrant's common stock, which would represent 6.18% of the fully-diluted
outstanding shares. In the event that the Registrant issues any common shares
after this date, the number of shares into which the Intrance Series A Preferred
Stock can be converted will be proportionately increased, so that at all times
the Intrance Series A Preferred Stock will be convertible into a number of
shares which will equal 6.18% of the Registrant's outstanding shares after the
conversion. The Registrant's agreement with Candent Corporation also provides
that if Candent corporation obtains less than $2,750,000 from the sale of the
common stock into which the Intrance preferred shares are convertible, the
Registrant will issue additional shares to Candent Corporation until it obtains
$2,750,000 in sales proceeds.

The President of Candent Corporation is the spouse of the owner of Incandent
Capital LLC, which owns the majority of the Registrant's voting shares. The
equity in Candent Corporation is held in trust for the benefit of its President.
