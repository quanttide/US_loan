Item 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

See Item 2.03, which is incorporated herein by reference.

ITEM 2.03. CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION OR AN OBLIGATION UNDER AN
OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENT OF A REGISTRANT.

On December 22, 2004, the Company entered into an Indenture (the "Indenture"),
between the Company, as Issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as
Trustee, which is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1. In connection with the
Indenture, the Company issued and sold $65 million aggregate principal amount of
its 2.50% convertible subordinated debentures due 2025 (the "Debentures"),
pursuant to a purchase agreement entered into between the Company and the
initial purchasers. The initial purchasers received a discount of 3% of the par
value of the Debentures. The closing of the sale occurred on December 22, 2004.
The Company also granted to the initial purchasers an option to purchase up to
an additional $15 million aggregate principal amount of its Debentures.

The Debentures were offered and sold to the initial purchasers in reliance on
the exemption from registration provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"). The initial purchasers of the
Debentures then offered and sold the Debentures only to qualified institutional
buyers, as defined in Rule 144A under the Securities Act. The Debentures and the
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures have not been registered
under the Securities Act or any state securities laws, and may not be offered or
sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from
the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws.

The Debentures were issued at a price of 100% of the principal amount of the
Debentures, or $1,000 per Debenture, plus accrued interest from December 22,
2004. The Debentures will bear interest at a rate of 2.50% per year. The Company
will pay interest on the Debentures on January 15th and July 15th of each year,
beginning on July 15, 2005. The Debentures will mature on January 15, 2025. The
Debentures are unsecured and subordinated in right of payment to all of the
Company's existing and future senior indebtedness and are effectively
subordinated to all debt and other liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.

The Debentures are convertible at any time prior to the close of business on the
business day immediately preceding the maturity date or, if the Debentures are
called for redemption, on the business day prior to the redemption date. The
initial conversion rate is 43.9560 shares of the Company's common stock per
$1,000 principal amount of Debentures (subject to adjustment in certain events).
This is equivalent to a conversion price of $22.75 per share of common stock. In
addition, if certain corporate transactions that constitute a change of control
occur on or prior to January 15, 2012, the Company will increase the conversion
rate in certain circumstances, unless such transaction constitutes a public
acquirer change of control and the Company elects to modify the conversion into
public acquirer common stock. In addition, if certain transactions that
constitute a change of control occur on or prior to January 15, 2012, under
certain circumstances, we will increase the conversion rate by a number of
additional shares for any conversion of Debentures in connection with such
transactions.

The Indenture does not contain any financial covenants or any restrictions on
the payment of dividends, the making of investments, the incurrence of senior
debt or other indebtedness, the granting of liens or mortgages, or the issuance
or repurchase of securities by the Company. The Indenture does not contain any
covenants or other provisions to protect holders of the Debentures in the event
of a highly leveraged transaction or a fundamental change, except to the extent
described in the immediately preceding paragraph.

The Company may redeem for cash the Debentures in whole or in part at any time
beginning on January 15, 2008 and prior to January 15, 2012, at a redemption
price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures to be redeemed,
plus accrued and unpaid interest, including liquidated damages, if any, to but
excluding the redemption date, if the last reported sale price of the Company's
common stock has exceeded 140% of the conversion price for at least 20 trading
days in any consecutive 30-day trading period ending on the trading day prior to
the date of mailing of the notice of redemption. On or after January 20, 2012,
the Company may redeem for cash some or all of the Debentures at any time at a
redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures to be
redeemed, plus any accrued and unpaid interest, including liquidated damages, if
any, to but excluding the redemption date.

<PAGE>

Holders of the Debentures may require the Company to repurchase some or all of
their Debentures on January 15, 2012, January 15, 2015 and January 15, 2020, or
upon the occurrence of a fundamental change, at 100% of the principal amount of
the Debentures to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest,
including liquidated damages, if any, to but excluding the repurchase date.

Each of the following will constitute an event of default under the Indenture:

      o     the Company's failure to pay when due the principal on any of the
            Debentures at maturity, upon redemption or exercise of a repurchase
            right or otherwise;

      o     the Company's failure to pay an installment of interest (including
            liquidated damages, if any) on any of the Debentures for 30 days
            after the date when due;

      o     the Company's failure to deliver shares of its common stock,
            together with cash in lieu thereof in respect of any fractional
            shares, upon conversion of a Debenture, and that failure continues
            for 10 days;

      o     the Company's failure to perform or observe any other term, covenant
            or agreement contained in the Debentures or the Indenture for a
            period of 60 consecutive days after written notice of such failure,
            requiring the Company to remedy the same, shall have been given to
            the Company by the trustee or to the Company and the trustee by the
            holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
            Debentures then outstanding;

      o     the Company's failure to make any payment by the end of the
            applicable grace period, if any, after the maturity of any
            indebtedness for borrowed money in an amount in excess of $10.0
            million, or if there is an acceleration of indebtedness for borrowed
            money in an amount in excess of $10.0 million because of a default
            with respect to such indebtedness without such indebtedness having
            been discharged or such acceleration having been withdrawn, cured,
            waived, rescinded or otherwise annulled, in either case, for a
            period of 30 days after written notice to the Company by the trustee
            or to the Company and the trustee by holders of at least 25% in
            aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding;

      o     the Company's failure to give timely notice of a fundamental change;
            and

      o     certain events of the Company's bankruptcy, insolvency or
            reorganization or any significant subsidiary of the Company.

If an event of default specified in the seventh bullet point above occurs and is
continuing, then the principal of all the Debentures and the interest thereon
shall automatically become immediately due and payable. If an event of default
shall occur and be continuing, other than an event of default specified in the
seventh bullet point above, the trustee or the holders of at least 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding may declare the
Debentures due and payable at their principal amount together with accrued
interest.

In connection with the sale of the Debentures, the Company entered into a
Registration Rights Agreement, dated as of December 22, 2004 (the "Registration
Rights Agreement"), with the initial purchasers, under which the Company has
agreed to file a shelf registration statement with the Securities and Exchange
Commission covering resales of the Debentures and the common stock issuable upon
conversion of the Debentures within 100 days after the first date of original
issuance of the Debentures, and thereafter to use its reasonable best efforts to
cause such shelf registration statement to become effective under the Securities
Act within 240 days after the first date of original issuance of the Debentures.
If the Company does not comply with its registration obligations it will be
required to pay liquidated damages to the holders of the Debentures. The
Registration Rights Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.3.

      any stock certificate representing Common Stock issued upon conversion of
      such Security shall bear a Restricted Securities Legend in substantially
      the following form:

            THE COMMON STOCK EVIDENCED HEREBY (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) HAS NOT BEEN
            REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES SECURITIES ACT OF 1933 ("THE
            "SECURITIES ACT"). THE HOLDER OF THIS CERTIFICATE AGREES FOR THE

            SUBSEQUENT HOLDER IS REQUIRED TO, NOTIFY ANY PURCHASER OF THIS

            (iii) Removal of the Restricted Securities Legends. Each Security or
      share of Common Stock issued upon conversion of such Security shall bear
      the Restricted Securities Legend set forth in Section 2.03(a)(i) or
      2.03(a)(ii), as the case may be, until the earlier of:

                  (A) the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales
            thereof under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or any successor
            provision);

                  (B) such Security or Common Stock has been sold pursuant to a
            registration statement that has been declared effective under the
            Securities Act (and that was effective at the time of such sale); or

                  (C) such Common Stock has been issued upon conversion of
            Securities that have been sold pursuant to a registration statement
            that has been declared effective under the Securities Act (and that
            was effective at the time of such sale).

      The Holder must give notice thereof to the Trustee and any transfer agent
for the Common Stock, as applicable.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Restricted Securities Legend may be
removed if there is delivered to the Company such satisfactory evidence, which
may include an opinion of independent counsel, as may be reasonably required by
the Company, that neither such legend nor the restrictions on transfer set forth
therein are required to ensure that transfers of such Security will not violate
the registration requirements of the Securities Act. Upon provision of such
satisfactory evidence, the Trustee, at the written direction of the Company,
shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such Securities another Security
or Securities having an equal aggregate principal amount that does not bear such
legend. If the Restricted Securities Legend has been removed from a Security as
provided above, no other Security issued in exchange for all or any part of such
Security shall bear such legend, unless the Company has reasonable cause to
believe that such other Security is a "restricted security" within the meaning
of Rule 144 and instructs the Trustee in writing to cause a Restricted
Securities Legend to appear thereon.

      Any Security (or security issued in exchange or substitution thereof) as
to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in accordance with
their terms or as to which the conditions for removal of the Restricted
Securities Legend set forth in Section 2.03(a)(i) as set forth therein have been
satisfied may, upon surrender of such Security for exchange to the Registrar in
accordance with the provisions of Section 2.07 hereof, be exchanged for a new
Security or Securities, of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which
shall not bear the Restricted Securities Legend required by Section 2.03(a)(i).


                                       20
<PAGE>

      Any such Common Stock as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have
expired in accordance with their terms or as to which the conditions for removal
of the Restricted Securities Legend set forth in Section 2.03(a)(ii) as set
forth therein have been satisfied may, upon surrender of the certificates
representing such shares of Common Stock for exchange in accordance with the
procedures of the transfer agent for the Common Stock, be exchanged for a new
certificate or certificates for a like aggregate number of shares of Common
Stock, which shall not bear the Restricted Securities Legend required by Section
2.03(a)(ii).

      (b) Global Security Legend. Each Global Security shall also bear the
following legend on the face thereof:

            UNLESS THIS CERTIFICATE IS PRESENTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE
            OF THE DEPOSITORY TRUST COMPANY ("DTC") TO DOV PHARMACEUTICAL, INC.
            (OR ITS SUCCESSOR) OR ITS AGENT FOR REGISTRATION OF TRANSFER,
            EXCHANGE, CONVERSION OR PAYMENT, AND ANY CERTIFICATE ISSUED IS
            REGISTERED IN THE NAME OF CEDE & CO. OR IN SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS
            REQUESTED BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC (AND ANY PAYMENT
            HEREON IS MADE TO CEDE & CO. OR TO SUCH OTHER ENTITY AS IS REQUESTED
            BY AN AUTHORIZED REPRESENTATIVE OF DTC), ANY TRANSFER, PLEDGE OR
            OTHER USE HEREOF FOR VALUE OR OTHERWISE BY OR TO ANY PERSON IS
            WRONGFUL SINCE THE REGISTERED OWNER HEREOF, CEDE & CO., HAS AN
            INTEREST HEREIN.

      Section 2.04. Execution, Authentication, Delivery and Dating. An Officer
shall execute the Securities on behalf of the Company by manual or facsimile
signature. If the Officer whose signature is on a Security no longer holds that
office at the time the Security is authenticated, the Security shall be valid
nevertheless.

      At any time and from time to time after the execution and delivery of this
Indenture, the Company may deliver Securities executed by the Company to the
Trustee for authentication, together with a Company Order for the authentication
and delivery of such Securities, and the Trustee in accordance with such Company
Order shall authenticate and deliver such Securities as in this Indenture
provided and not otherwise.


                                       21
<PAGE>

      Each Security shall be dated the date of its authentication.

      No Security shall be entitled to any benefit under this Indenture, or be
valid or obligatory for any purpose, unless there appears on such Security a
certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided for herein
executed by or on behalf of the Trustee by manual signature, and such
certificate upon any Security shall be conclusive evidence, and the only
evidence, that such Security has been duly authenticated and delivered
hereunder.

      The Trustee may appoint an authenticating agent or agents reasonably
acceptable to the Company with respect to the Securities. Unless limited by the
terms of such appointment, an authenticating agent may authenticate Securities
whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference in this Indenture to
authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by such agent.

      Section 2.05. Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain an
office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, where
Securities may be presented for registration of transfer or for exchange (the
"REGISTRAR") and an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of
New York, where Securities may be presented for payment (the "PAYING AGENT").
The Registrar shall keep a register of the Securities (the "REGISTER") and of
their transfer and exchange. The Company may appoint one or more co-Registrars
and one or more additional Paying Agents for the Securities. The term "Paying
Agent" includes any additional Paying Agent and the term "Registrar" includes
any additional registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent or Registrar
without prior notice to any Holder.

      The Company will cause each Paying Agent (other than the Trustee) to
execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent
shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this Section, that
such Paying Agent will:

            (i) hold all sums held by it for the payment of the principal of or
      interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on Securities in trust for
      the benefit of the Persons entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
      to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as provided in this Indenture;

            (ii) give the Trustee notice of any Default by the Company in the
      making of any payment of principal or interest (including Liquidated
      Damages, if any); and


                                       22
<PAGE>

            (iii) at any time during the continuance of any such Default, upon
      the written request of the Trustee, forthwith pay to the Trustee all sums
      so held in trust by such Paying Agent.

      The Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of the name
and address of any Paying Agent who is not a party to this Indenture. If the
Company fails to appoint or maintain another entity as Registrar or Paying
Agent, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company or any Affiliate of the
Company may act as Paying Agent or Registrar; provided, however, that none of
the Company, its Subsidiaries or the Affiliates of the foregoing shall act:

            (i) as Paying Agent in connection with redemptions, offers to
      purchase and discharges, as otherwise specified in this Indenture, and

            (ii) as Paying Agent or Registrar if a Default or Event of Default
      has occurred and is continuing.

      The Company hereby initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar and Paying
Agent for the Securities.

      Section 2.06. Paying Agent to Hold Assets in Trust. Not later than 12:00
Noon (New York City time) on each due date of the principal and interest
(including Liquidated Damages, if any) on any Securities, the Company shall
deposit with one or more Paying Agents money in immediately available funds
sufficient to pay such principal and interest (including Liquidated Damages, if
any) so becoming due. The Company at any time may require a Paying Agent to pay
all money held by it to the Trustee. Upon payment over to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent (if other than the Company) shall have no further liability for the
money so paid over to the Trustee.

      If the Company shall act as a Paying Agent, it shall, prior to or on each
due date of the principal of or interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any)
on any of the Securities, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the
Holders a sum sufficient with monies held by all other Paying Agents, to pay the
principal or interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) so becoming due
until such sums shall be paid to such Persons or otherwise disposed of as
provided in this Indenture, and shall promptly notify the Trustee of its action
or failure to act.

      Section 2.07. General Provisions Relating to Transfer and Exchange. The
Securities are issuable only in registered form. A Holder may transfer a
Security only by written application to the Registrar stating the name of the
proposed transferee and otherwise complying with the terms of this Indenture. No
such transfer shall be effected until, and such transferee shall succeed to the
rights of a Holder only upon, final acceptance and registration of the transfer
by the Registrar in the Register. Furthermore, any Holder of a Global Security
shall, by acceptance of such Global Security, agree that transfers of beneficial
interests in such Global Security may be effected only through a book-entry
system maintained by the Holder of such Global Security (or its agent) and that
ownership of a beneficial interest in the Security shall be required to be
reflected in a book-entry. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of a
Restricted Security, a beneficial interest in a Global Security being
transferred in reliance on an exemption from the registration requirements of
the Securities Act other than in accordance with Rule 144 and Rule 144A may only
be transferred for a Physical Security.


                                       23
<PAGE>

      When Securities are presented to the Registrar with a request to register
the transfer or to exchange them for an equal aggregate principal amount of
Securities of other authorized denominations, the Registrar shall register the
transfer or make the exchange as requested if its requirements for such
transactions are met (including that such Securities are duly endorsed or
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer duly executed by the Holder
thereof or by an attorney who is authorized in writing to act on behalf of the
Holder). Subject to Section 2.04 hereof, to permit registrations of transfers
and exchanges, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate
Securities at the Registrar's request. No service charge shall be made for any
registration of transfer or exchange or redemption of the Securities, but the
Company may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any transfer tax or
similar governmental charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such
transfer taxes or other similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges
pursuant to Section 2.14, 7.05 or 10.07 hereof).

      In the event of a redemption in part, neither the Company nor the
Registrar shall be required to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange,
Securities during the period of 15 days before the mailing of the notice of
redemption.

      Section 2.08. Book-Entry Provisions for the Global Securities. (a) The
Global Securities initially shall

            (i) be registered in the name of the Depositary (or a nominee
      thereof);

            (ii) be delivered to the Trustee as custodian for such Depositary;
      and

            (iii) bear the Restricted Securities Legend as set forth in Section
      2.03(a)(i) hereof.

      Members of, or participants in, the Depositary ("DTC PARTICIPANTS") shall
have no rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global Security held on
their behalf by the Depositary, or the Trustee as its custodian, or under such
Global Security, and the Depositary may be treated by the Company, the Trustee
and any agent of the Company or the Trustee as the absolute owner of such Global
Security for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing
contained herein shall prevent the Company, the Trustee or any agent of the
Company or Trustee from giving effect to any written certification, proxy or
other authorization furnished by the Depositary or impair, as between the
Depositary and the DTC Participants, the operation of customary practices
governing the exercise of the rights of a Holder of any Security.


                                       24
<PAGE>

      (b) The registered Holder of a Global Security may grant proxies and
otherwise authorize any Person, including DTC Participants and Persons that may
hold interests through DTC Participants, to take any action that a Holder is
entitled to take under this Indenture or the Securities.

      (c) A Global Security may not be transferred, in whole or in part, to any
Person other than the Depositary (or a nominee thereof), and no such transfer to
any such other Person may be registered. Beneficial interests in a Global
Security may be transferred in accordance with the rules and procedures of the
Depositary and the provisions of Section 2.09 hereof.

      (d) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Indenture or the
Securities, a Global Security shall not be exchanged in whole or in part for a
Security registered in the name of any person other than the Depositary or one
or more nominees thereof, provided that a Global Security may be exchanged for
Securities registered in the names of any person designated by the Depositary in
the event that the Depositary has notified the Company that it is unwilling or
unable to continue as Depositary for such Global Security or such Depositary has
ceased to be a "clearing agency" registered under the Exchange Act, and a
successor Depositary is not appointed by the Company within 90 days, to the
extent permitted by the Depositary, the Company determines at any time that the
Securities shall no longer be represented by Global Securities and shall inform
such Depositary of such determination and participants in such Depository elect
to withdraw their beneficial interests in the Global Securities from such
Depository, following notification by the Depository of their right to do so; or
a beneficial owner of Securities requests to exchange such beneficial owner's
interest in the Global Securities for Certificated Securities. Any Global
Security exchanged pursuant to clause (i) above shall be so exchanged in whole
and not in part, and any Global Security exchanged pursuant to clause (ii) or
(iii) above may be exchanged in whole or from time to time in part as directed
by the Depositary. Any Security issued in exchange for a Global Security or any
portion thereof shall be a Global Security; provided that any such Security so
issued that is registered in the name of a person other than the Depositary or a
nominee thereof shall not be a Global Security.

      Upon the occurrence of (i), (ii) or (iii) above, the Depositary shall
surrender such Global Security or Global Securities to the Trustee for
cancellation and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee, upon receipt of an
Officers' Certificate and Company Order for the authentication and delivery of
Securities, shall authenticate and deliver in exchange for such Global Security
or Global Securities, Physical Securities of like tenor as that of the Global
Securities in an aggregate principal amount equal to the aggregate principal
amount of such Global Security or Global Securities. Such Physical Securities
shall be registered in such names as the Depositary shall identify in writing as
the beneficial owners of the Securities represented by such Global Security or
Global Securities (or any nominees thereof).


                                       25
<PAGE>

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, in connection with any such surrender and
subsequent exchange pursuant to Section 2.08(d) hereof, the Registrar shall
reflect on its books and records the date and a decrease in the principal amount
of such Global Security in an amount equal to the principal amount of the
beneficial interest in such Global Security to be transferred.

      Section 2.09. Special Transfer Provisions. Unless a Security is
transferred after the time period referred to in Rule 144(k) under the
Securities Act or otherwise sold pursuant to a registration statement that has
been declared effective under the Securities Act (and that continues to be
effective at the time of such sale), the following provisions shall apply:

            (i) if the Securities to be transferred consist of an interest in
      the Global Securities, the transfer of such interest may be effected only
      through the book-entry system maintained by the Depositary; and

            (ii) if the Securities to be transferred consist of Physical
      Securities, the Registrar shall register the transfer if such transfer is
      being made by a proposed transferor who has checked the box provided on
      the form of Security stating, or has otherwise advised the Company and the
      Registrar in writing, that the sale has been made in compliance with the
      provisions of Rule 144A to a transferee who has signed the certification
      provided on the form of Security stating or has otherwise advised the
      Company and the Registrar in writing that:

                  (A) it is purchasing the Securities for its own account or an
            account with respect to which it exercises sole investment
            discretion, in each case for investment and not with a view to
            distribution;

                  (B) it and any such account is a QIB within the meaning of
            Rule l44A;

                  (C) it is aware that the sale to it is being made in reliance
            on Rule 144A;

                  (D) it acknowledges that it has received such information
            regarding the Company as it has requested pursuant to Rule 144A or
            has determined not to request such information; and


                                       26
<PAGE>

                  (E) it is aware that the transferor is relying upon its
            foregoing representations in order to claim the exemption from
            registration provided by Rule 144A.

      By its acceptance of any Security bearing the Restricted Securities
Legend, each Holder of such a Security acknowledges the restrictions on transfer
of such Security set forth in this Indenture and agrees that it will transfer
such Security only as provided in this Indenture. The Registrar shall not
register a transfer of any Security unless such transfer complies with the
restrictions on transfer of such Security set forth in this Indenture. The
Registrar shall be entitled to receive and rely on written instructions from the
Company verifying that such transfer complies with such restrictions on
transfer. In connection with any transfer of Securities, each Holder agrees by
its acceptance of the Securities to furnish the Registrar or the Company such
certifications, legal opinions or other information as either of them may
reasonably require to confirm that such transfer is being made pursuant to an
exemption from, or a transaction not subject to, the registration requirements
of the Securities Act; provided, however, that the Registrar shall not be
required to determine (but may rely on a determination made by the Company with
respect to) the sufficiency of any such certifications, legal opinions or other
information.

      The Registrar shall retain copies of all letters, notices and other
written communications received pursuant to Section 2.08 hereof or this Section
2.09. The Company shall have the right to inspect and make copies of all such
letters, notices or other written communications at any reasonable time upon the
giving of reasonable written notice to the Registrar.

      Section 2.10. Holder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as current a
form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it of the
names and addresses of Holders and shall otherwise comply with Section 312(a) of
the TIA. If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish to the
Trustee prior to or on each Interest Payment Date and at such other times as the
Trustee may request in writing a list in such form and as of such date as the
Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of Holders relating to
such Interest Payment Date or request, as the case may be.

      Section 2.11. Persons Deemed Owners. The Company, the Trustee and any
agent of the Company or the Trustee may treat the registered Holder of a Global
Security as the absolute owner of such Global Security for the purpose of
receiving payment thereof or on account thereof and for all other purposes
whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and notwithstanding any
notice of ownership or writing thereon, or any notice of previous loss or theft
or other interest therein. The Company, the Trustee and any agent of the Company
or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name any Security is registered as
the owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment of principal of
and interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on such Security and for all
other purposes whatsoever, whether or not such Security be overdue, and
notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing thereon, or any notice of
previous loss or theft or other interest therein.


                                       27
<PAGE>

      Section 2.12. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Securities. If any
mutilated Security is surrendered to the Trustee, the Company shall execute and
the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver in exchange therefor a new Security
of like tenor and principal amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously
outstanding.

      If there is delivered to the Company and the Trustee

            (i) evidence to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft
      of any Security, and

            (ii) such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save
      each of them and any agent of either of them harmless,

then, in the absence of notice to the Company or the Trustee that such Security
has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Company shall execute and, upon
request, the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in lieu of any such
destroyed, lost or stolen Security, a new Security of like tenor and principal
amount and bearing a number not contemporaneously outstanding.

      In case any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Security has become
or is about to become due and payable, the Company in its discretion, but
subject to any conversion rights, may, instead of issuing a new Security, pay
such Security, upon satisfaction of the condition set forth in the preceding
paragraph.

      Upon the issuance of any new Security under this Section, the Company may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee) connected therewith.

      Every new Security issued pursuant to this Section in lieu of any
destroyed, lost or stolen Security shall constitute an original additional
contractual obligation of the Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or
stolen Security shall be at any time enforceable by anyone, and such new
Security shall be entitled to all the benefits of this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Securities duly issued hereunder.


                                       28
<PAGE>

      The provisions of this Section are exclusive and shall preclude (to the
extent lawful) all other rights and remedies with respect to the replacement or
payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Securities.

      Section 2.13. Treasury Securities. In determining whether the Holders of
the requisite principal amount of Outstanding Securities are present at a
meeting of Holders for quorum purposes or have given any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent or waiver hereunder, Securities owned
by the Company or any Affiliate of the Company shall be disregarded and deemed
not to be Outstanding, except that, in determining whether the Trustee shall be
protected in relying upon any such determination as to the presence of a quorum
or upon any such request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent or
waiver, only such Securities of which the Trustee has received written notice
and are so owned shall be so disregarded.

      Section 2.14. Temporary Securities. Pending the preparation of Securities
in definitive form, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall, upon written
request of the Company, authenticate and deliver temporary Securities (printed
or lithographed). Temporary Securities shall be issuable in any authorized
denomination, and substantially in the form of the Securities in definitive form
but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be appropriate for
temporary Securities, all as may be determined by the Company. Every such
temporary Security shall be executed by the Company and authenticated by the
Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the same manner, and with
the same effect, as the Securities in definitive form. Without unreasonable
delay, the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee Securities in
definitive form (other than in the case of Securities in global form) and
thereupon any or all temporary Securities (other than any such Securities in
global form) may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency
maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 9.02 and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver in exchange for such temporary Securities an equal
aggregate principal amount of Securities in definitive form. Such exchange shall
be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor. Until
so exchanged, the temporary Securities shall in all respects be entitled to the
same benefits and subject to the same limitations under this Indenture as
Securities in definitive form authenticated and delivered hereunder.

      Section 2.15. Cancellation. All securities surrendered for payment,
redemption, repurchase, conversion, registration of transfer or exchange shall,
if surrendered to any Person other than the Trustee, be delivered to the
Trustee. All Securities so delivered shall be canceled promptly by the Trustee,
and no Securities shall be issued in lieu thereof except as expressly permitted
by any of the provisions of this Indenture. Upon written instructions of the
Company, the Trustee shall destroy canceled Securities and, after such
destruction, shall deliver a certificate of such destruction to the Company. If
the Company shall acquire any of the Securities, such acquisition shall not
operate as a redemption or satisfaction of the indebtedness represented by such
Securities unless the same are delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

      Section 2.16. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Securities may
use "CUSIP" numbers (if then generally in use), and the Trustee shall use CUSIP
numbers in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders;
provided, however, that any such notice shall state that no representation is
made as to the correctness of such numbers either as printed on the Securities
or as contained in any such notice and that reliance may be placed only on the
other identification numbers printed on the Securities, and any such redemption
shall not be affected by any defect in or omission of such numbers. The Company
shall promptly notify the Trustee of any change in the CUSIP numbers.

      Section 2.17. Defaulted Interest. If the Company fails to make a payment
of interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on any Security when due and
payable ("DEFAULTED INTEREST"), it shall pay such Defaulted Interest plus (to
the extent lawful) any interest payable on the Defaulted Interest, in any lawful
manner. It may elect to pay such Defaulted Interest, plus any such interest
payable on it, to the Persons who are Holders of such Securities on which the
interest is due on a subsequent Special Record Date. The Company shall notify
the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be paid
on each such Security. The Company shall fix any such Special Record Date and
payment date for such payment. At least 15 days before any such Special Record
Date, the Company shall mail to Holders affected thereby a notice that states
the Special Record Date, the Interest Payment Date, and amount of such interest
(and such Liquidated Damages, if any) to be paid.

      Section 2.18. Rule 144A. The Company agrees that it will refuse to
register any transfer of Securities or Common Stock that is not made in
accordance with the provisions of Rule 144A under the Securities Act, pursuant
to a registration statement that has been declared effective under the
Securities Act or pursuant to an available exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act; provided that this Section 2.18 shall not be
applicable to any Securities or shares of Common Stock that do not bear the
legend set forth in Section 2.03(a)(i) or (ii) hereof.

      Section 2.19. Reopening the Indenture. The Company may, without the
consent of the Holders of Securities, reopen the Indenture and issue additional
Securities under the Indenture with the same terms and with the same CUSIP
number as the Securities offered hereby in an unlimited aggregate principal
amount, which will form the same series with the Securities, provided that no
such additional Securities may be issued unless fungible with the Securities
offered hereby for U.S. federal income tax purposes. The Company may also from
time to time repurchase the Securities in open market purchases or negotiated
transactions without prior notice to Holders of Securities.

      Section 4.02. Acceleration of Maturity; Rescission and Annulment. If an
Event of Default with respect to Outstanding Securities (other than an Event of
Default specified in Section 4.01(g) or 4.01(h) hereof) occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal
amount of the Outstanding Securities, by written notice to the Company, may
declare due and payable 100% of the principal amount of all Outstanding
Securities plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages,
if any) to the date of payment. Upon a declaration of acceleration, such
principal and accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any)
to the date of payment shall be immediately due and payable.

      If an Event of Default specified in Section 4.01(g) or 4.01(h) hereof
occurs, all unpaid principal of and accrued and unpaid interest (including
Liquidated Damages, if any) on the Outstanding Securities shall become and be
immediately due and payable, without any declaration or other act on the part of
the Trustee or any Holder.

      The Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities by written notice to the Trustee may rescind and annul an
acceleration and its consequences if:

            (i) all existing Events of Default, other than the nonpayment of
      principal of or interest on the Securities that has become due solely
      because of the acceleration, have been remedied, cured or waived, and

            (ii) the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or decree
      of a court of competent jurisdiction;

provided, however, that in the event such declaration of acceleration has been
made based on the existence of an Event of Default under Section 4.01(e) hereof
and such Event of Default has been remedied, cured or waived in accordance with
Section 4.01(e) hereof, then, without any further action by the Holders, such
declaration of acceleration shall be rescinded automatically and the
consequences of such declaration shall be annulled. No such rescission or
annulment shall affect any subsequent Default or impair any right consequent
thereon.

      Section 4.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default with respect to
Outstanding Securities occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may pursue any
available remedy by proceeding at law or in equity to collect the payment of
principal of or interest on the Securities or to enforce the performance of any
provision of the Securities.


                                       33
<PAGE>

      The Trustee may maintain a proceeding in which it may prosecute and
enforce all rights of action and claims under this Indenture or the Securities,
even if it does not possess any of the Securities or does not produce any of
them in the proceeding.

      Section 4.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. The Holders, either (a) through the
written consent of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities or (b) by the adoption of a resolution, at a meeting of
Holders of the Outstanding Securities at which a quorum is present, by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities represented at such meeting, may, on behalf of the Holders of all of
the Securities, waive an existing Default or Event of Default, except a Default
or Event of Default:

            (i) in the payment of the principal of or interest (including
      Liquidated Damages, if any) on any Security (provided, however, that
      subject to Section 4.02 hereof, the Holders of a majority in aggregate
      principal amount of the Outstanding Securities may rescind an acceleration
      and its consequences, including any related payment default that resulted
      from such acceleration);

            (ii) in respect of the failure to convert any Security in accordance
      with Article 12; or

            (iii) in respect of a covenant or provision hereof that, under
      Section 7.02 hereof, cannot be modified or amended without the consent of
      the Holder of each Outstanding Security affected.

      Upon any such waiver, such Default shall cease to exist, and any Event of
Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been cured, for every purpose
of this Indenture; provided, however, that no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

      Section 4.05. Control by Majority. The Holders, either (a) through the
written consent of not less than a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities, or (b) by the adoption of a resolution, at a meeting of
Holders of the Outstanding Securities at which a quorum is present, by the
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding
Securities represented at such meeting, shall have the right to direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on the Trustee. However, the
Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that:

            (i) conflicts with any law or with this Indenture,


                                       34
<PAGE>

            (ii) the Trustee determines may be unduly prejudicial to the rights
      of the Holders not joining therein, or

            (iii) may expose the Trustee to personal liability.

      The Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by the Trustee that is
not inconsistent with such direction.

      Section 4.06. Limitation on Suit. No Holder of any Security shall have any
right to pursue any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities
(including instituting any proceeding, judicial or otherwise, with respect to
this Indenture or for the appointment of a receiver or trustee) unless: (i) such
Holder has previously given written notice to the Trustee of an Event of Default
that is continuing;

            (ii) the Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of
      the Outstanding Securities shall have made written request to the Trustee
      to pursue the remedy;

            (iii) such Holder or Holders have offered to the Trustee indemnity
      satisfactory to it against any costs, expenses and liabilities incurred in
      complying with such request;

            (iv) the Trustee has failed to comply with the request for 60 days
      after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity; and

            (v) during such 60-day period, no direction inconsistent with such
      written request has been given to the Trustee by the Holders of a majority
      in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities (or such
      amount as shall have acted at a meeting pursuant to the provisions of this
      Indenture);

provided, however, that no one or more of such Holders may use this Indenture to
prejudice the rights of another Holder or to obtain preference or priority over
another Holder.

      Section 4.07. Unconditional Rights of Holders to Receive Payment and to
Convert. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, the Holder of
any Security shall have the right, which is absolute and unconditional, to
receive payment of the principal of and interest (including Liquidated Damages,
if any) on such Security on the Stated Maturity expressed in such Security (or,
in the case of redemption, on the Redemption Date, or in the case of the
exercise of a Repurchase Right or Put Repurchase Right, on the Repurchase Date
or Put Repurchase Date, as applicable) and to convert such Security in
accordance with Article 12, and to bring suit for the enforcement of any such
payment on or after such respective dates and right to convert, and such rights
shall not be impaired or affected without the consent of such Holder.


                                       35

      Section 4.08. Collection of Indebtedness and Suits for Enforcement by the
Trustee. The Company covenants that if:

            (i) a Default or Event of Default occurs in the payment of any
      interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on any Security when such
      interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) becomes due and payable
      and such Default or Event of Default continues for a period of 30 days, or

            (ii) a Default or Event of Default occurs in the payment of the
      principal of any Security at the Maturity thereof,

the Company shall, upon demand of the Trustee, pay to it, for the benefit of the
Holders of such Securities, the whole amount then due and payable (as expressed
therein or as a result of any acceleration effected pursuant to Section 4.02
hereof) on such Securities for principal and interest (including Liquidated
Damages, if any) and, to the extent that payment of such interest shall be
legally enforceable, interest on any overdue principal and on any overdue
interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any), in each case at the Interest
Rate, and, in addition thereto, such further amount as shall be sufficient to
cover the costs and expenses of collection, including the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel.

      If the Company fails to pay such amounts forthwith upon such demand, the
Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust, may institute a
judicial proceeding for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, may
prosecute such proceeding to judgment or final decree and may enforce the same
against the Company and collect the moneys adjudged or decreed to be payable in
the manner provided by law out of the property of the Company, wherever
situated.

      If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may in its
discretion proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Holders of Securities by such appropriate judicial proceedings as the Trustee
shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any such rights, whether for
the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement in this Indenture or in
aid of the exercise of any power granted herein, or to enforce any other proper
remedy.

      Section 4.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. In case of the pendency
of any receivership, insolvency, liquidation, bankruptcy, reorganization,
arrangement, adjustment, composition or other judicial proceeding relative to
the Company or the property of the Company or its creditors, the Trustee
(irrespective of whether the principal of the Securities shall then be due and
payable as therein expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of
whether the Trustee shall have made any demand on the Company for the payment of
overdue principal or interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any)) shall be
entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceeding or otherwise, (1) to
file and prove a claim for the whole amount of principal and interest (including
Liquidated Damages, if any) owing and unpaid in respect of the Securities and to
file such other papers or documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to
have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel) and of the Holders of Securities allowed in such judicial
proceeding, and (2) to collect and receive any moneys or other property payable
or deliverable on any such claim and to distribute the same; and any custodian,
receiver, assignee, trustee, liquidator, sequestrator or other similar official
in any such judicial proceedings is hereby authorized by each Holder of
Securities to make such payments to the Trustee and, in the event that the
Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the Holders of
Securities, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents
and counsel and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 5.08.


                                       36
<PAGE>

      Nothing contained herein shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to
authorize or consent to or accept, or adopt on behalf of any Holder of a
Security, any plan of reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition
affecting the Securities or the rights of any Holder thereof or to authorize the
Trustee to vote in respect of the claim of any Holder of a Security in any such
proceeding.

      Section 4.10. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or any
Holder of a Security has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or
remedy under this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or
abandoned for any reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to
such Holder, then and in every such case, subject to any determination in such
proceeding, the Company, the Trustee and the Holders of Securities shall be
restored severally and respectively to their former positions hereunder and
thereafter all rights and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue
as though no such proceeding had been instituted.

      Section 4.11. Rights and Remedies. Except as otherwise provided with
respect to the replacement or payment of mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen
Securities in the last paragraph of Section 2.12, no right or remedy conferred
in this Indenture upon or reserved to the Trustee or to the Holders of
Securities is intended to be exclusive of any other right or remedy, and every
right and remedy shall, to the extent permitted by law, be cumulative and in
addition to every other right and remedy given hereunder or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or otherwise. The assertion or employment of any right or
remedy hereunder, or otherwise, shall not prevent the concurrent assertion or
employment of any other appropriate right or remedy.


                                       37
<PAGE>

      Section 4.12. Delay or Omission Not Waiver. No delay or omission of the
Trustee or of any Holder of any Security to exercise any right or remedy
accruing upon any Event of Default shall impair any such right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of any such Event of Default or any acquiescence therein.
Every right and remedy given by this Article or by law to the Trustee or to the
Holders of Securities may be exercised from time to time, and as often as may be
deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the Holders of Securities, as the case
may be.

      Section 4.13. Application of Money Collected. Subject to Article 13, any
money and property collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article shall be
applied in the following order, at the date or dates fixed by the Trustee and,
in case of the distribution of such money and property on account of principal
or interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any), upon presentation of the
Securities and the notation thereon of the payment if only partially paid and
upon surrender thereof if fully paid:

            FIRST: To the payment of all amounts due the Trustee, Conversion
      Agent, Paying Agent, and Registrar under Section 5.08 (including payment
      of all liabilities incurred and all advances made by the Trustee and the
      costs and expenses of collection);

            SECOND: To the payment of the amounts then due and unpaid for
      principal of and interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on the
      Securities in respect of which or for the benefit of which such money has
      been collected, ratably, without preference or priority of any kind,
      according to the amounts due and payable on such Securities for principal
      and interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any), respectively; and

            THIRD: Any remaining amounts shall be repaid to the Company.

      Section 4.14. Undertaking for Costs. All parties to this Indenture agree,
and each Holder of any Security by such Holder's acceptance thereof shall be
deemed to have agreed, that any court may in its discretion require, in any suit
for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or in any suit
against the Trustee for any action taken, suffered or omitted by it as Trustee,
the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay the costs
of such suit, and that such court may in its discretion assess reasonable costs,
including reasonable attorneys' fees, against any party litigant in such suit,
having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by
such party litigant; but the provisions of this Section shall not apply to any
suit instituted by the Company, to any suit instituted by the Trustee, to any
suit instituted by any Holder, or group of Holders, holding in the aggregate
more than 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Outstanding Securities, or to
any suit instituted by any Holder of any Security for the enforcement of the
payment of the principal of or interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any)
on any Security on or after the Stated Maturity expressed in such Security (or,
in the case of redemption or exercise of a Repurchase Right or Put Repurchase
Right, on or after the Redemption Date, the Repurchase Date or the Put
Repurchase Date, respectively) or for the enforcement of the right to convert
any Security in accordance with Article 12.

      Section 4.15. Waiver of Stay or Extension Laws. The Company covenants (to
the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any time insist upon,
or plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim to take the benefit or advantage of,
any stay or extension law wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in
force, that may affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture; and
the Company (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) hereby expressly waives
all benefit or advantage of any such law and covenants that it will not hinder,
delay or impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but
will suffer and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law
had been enacted.

                                   THE TRUSTEE

      Section 5.01. Certain Duties and Responsibilities. Except during the
continuance of an Event of Default,

            (i) The Trustee undertakes to perform such duties and only such
      duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture or the TIA, and no
      implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this Indenture against
      the Trustee; and

            (ii) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
      conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness
      of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions furnished
      to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture;
      provided, however, that in the case of any such certificates or opinions
      that by any provision hereof are specifically required to be furnished to
      the Trustee, the Trustee shall examine the certificates or opinions to
      determine whether or not, on their face, they conform to the requirements
      of this Indenture (but need not investigate or confirm the accuracy of any
      facts stated therein).


                                       39
<PAGE>

      (b) In case an Event of Default actually known to a Responsible Officer of
the Trustee has occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of
the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and use the same degree of
care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person would exercise or use
under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's own affairs.

      (c) No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

            (i) This paragraph (c) shall not be construed to limit the effect of
      paragraph (a) of this Section 5.01;

            (ii) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made
      in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it shall be proved that the
      Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts; and

            (iii) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action
      taken or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with a
      direction received by it of the Holders of a majority in principal amount
      of the Outstanding Securities (or such lesser amount as shall have acted
      at a meeting pursuant to the provisions of this Indenture) relating to the
      time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
      available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or power conferred upon
      the Trustee, under this Indenture.

      (d) Whether or not herein expressly so provided, every provision of this
Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of or affording
protection to the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section
5.01.

      (e) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to expend or
risk its own funds or otherwise incur any liability in the performance of any of
its duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers. The
Trustee may refuse to perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it
receives indemnity satisfactory to it against any loss, liability, cost or
expense (including, without limitation, reasonable fees of counsel).

      (f) The Trustee shall not be obligated to pay interest on any money or
other assets received by it unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Company.

facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument,
opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond, debenture,
note, coupon, other evidence of indebtedness or other paper or document, but the
Trustee, in its discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into
such facts or matters as it may see fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to
make such further inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the
books, records and premises of the Company, personally or by agent or attorney
at the sole cost of the Company, and shall incur no liability or additional
liability of any kind by reason of such inquiry or investigation.

      (h) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice or actual knowledge of
any Event of Default or a Registration Default or the obligation of the Company
to pay Liquidated Damages unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual
knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event that is in fact a
Default is received by the Trustee pursuant to Section 14.02 hereof, and such
notice references the Securities and this Indenture.

      (i) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits given to
the Trustee hereunder, including, without limitation, its right to be
indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in each
of its capacities hereunder, and each Paying Agent, authenticating agent,
Conversion Agent or Registrar acting hereunder.

      Section 5.02. Certain Rights of Trustee. Subject to the provisions of
Section 5.01 hereof and subject to Sections 315(a) through (d) of the TIA:

            (i) The Trustee may conclusively rely on any document believed by it

      The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the
      document.

            (ii) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require
      an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel, or both. The Trustee
      shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith
      in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or the Opinion of Counsel.

            (iii) The Trustee may act through attorneys and agents and shall not
      be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any attorney or agent
      appointed with due care.

            (iv) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action taken or omitted
      to be taken by it in good faith that it reasonably believed to be
      authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it
      by this Indenture, unless the Trustee's conduct constitutes negligence.

            (v) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the
      advice of such counsel as to matters of law shall be full and complete
      authorization and protection in respect of any action taken, omitted or
      suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the advice
      or opinion of such counsel.

            (vi) Unless otherwise specifically provided in this Indenture, any
      demand, request, direction or notice from the Company shall be sufficient
      if signed by an Officer of the Company.

            (vii) The permissive rights of the Trustee to do things enumerated
      in this Indenture shall not be construed as a duty unless so specified
      herein.

      Section 5.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its individual
or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may
otherwise deal with the Company or any Affiliate of the Company with the same
rights it would have if it were not Trustee. However, in the event that the
Trustee acquires any conflicting interest (as such term is defined in Section
310(b) of the TIA), it must eliminate such conflict within 90 days, apply to the
SEC for permission to continue as trustee (to the extent permitted under Section
310(b) of the TIA) or resign. Any agent may do the same with like rights and
duties. The Trustee is also subject to Section 5.11 and 5.12 hereof.

      Section 5.04. Money Held in Trust. Money held by the Trustee in trust
hereunder need not be segregated from other funds except to the extent required
by law. The Trustee shall be under no liability for interest on any money
received by it hereunder except as otherwise expressly agreed with the Company.

      Section 5.05. Trustee's Disclaimer. The recitals contained herein and in
the Securities (except for those in the certificate of authentication) shall be
taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee assumes no
responsibility for their correctness. The Trustee makes no representations as to
the validity, sufficiency or priority of this Indenture or of the Securities.
The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by the Company
of Securities or the proceeds thereof.

      Section 5.06. Notice of Defaults. Within 90 days after the occurrence of
any Default or Event of Default hereunder of which the Trustee has received
written notice, the Trustee shall give notice to Holders pursuant to Section
14.02 hereof, unless such Default or Event of Default shall have been cured or
waived; provided, however, that, except in the case of a Default or Event of
Default in the payment of the principal of or interest (including Liquidated
Damages, if any), or in the payment of any redemption or repurchase obligation,
on any Security, the Trustee shall be protected in withholding such notice if
and so long as Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith determine that
the withholding of such notice is in the interest of the Holders.

      Section 5.07. Reports by Trustee to Holders. The Trustee shall transmit to
Holders such reports concerning the Trustee and its actions under this Indenture
as may be required by Section 313 of the TIA at the times and in the manner
provided by the TIA.

      A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Holders shall be filed
with the SEC, if required, and each stock exchange, if any, on which the
Securities are listed. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee when the
Securities become listed on any stock exchange.

      Section 5.08. Compensation and Indemnification. The Company shall pay to
the Trustee, the Conversion Agent, the Paying Agent and the Registrar (each an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") from time to time compensation for their respective
services as Trustee, Conversion Agent, Paying Agent or Registrar, as the case
may be, as agreed in writing. The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by
any law on compensation of a trustee of an express trust. The Company shall
reimburse each Indemnified Party upon request for all reasonable out-of-pocket
expenses, disbursements and advances incurred or made by it in connection with
the performance of its duties under this Indenture. Such expenses shall include
the reasonable fees and expenses of each of such Indemnified Party's agents and
counsel.

      The Company hereby indemnifies each Indemnified Party and its agents,
employees, stockholders and directors and officers for, and holds each of them
harmless against, any loss, cost, claim, liability or expense (including taxes)
incurred by any of them except for such actions to the extent caused by any
gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Indemnified Party,
arising out of or in connection with the acceptance and administration of this
Indenture or the trusts hereunder or the performance of their duties hereunder,
including the reasonable costs and expenses of enforcing this Indenture against
the Company (including this Section 5.08) and defending themselves against any
claim or liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of
their rights, powers or duties hereunder (including the reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel). An Indemnified Party shall notify the Company promptly of
any claim asserted against such Indemnified Party for which such Indemnified
Party has advised the Trustee that it may seek indemnity hereunder. Failure by
the Indemnified Party to so notify the Company shall not relieve the Company of
its obligations hereunder. At the Indemnified Party's sole discretion, the
Company shall defend the claim and the Indemnified Party shall cooperate and may
participate in the defense; provided that any settlement of a claim shall be
approved in writing by the Indemnified Party. Alternatively, the Indemnified
Party may at its option have separate counsel of its own choosing and the
Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such counsel; provided
that the Company shall not be required to pay such fees and expenses if it
assumes the Indemnified Party's defense and there is no conflict of interest
between or alternative defenses between the Company and the Indemnified Party in
connection with such defense as reasonably determined by the Indemnified Party.
The Company need not pay for any settlement made without its written consent,
which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.


                                       43
<PAGE>

      To secure the Company's payment obligations in this Section 5.08, each
Indemnified Party shall have a lien prior to the Securities on all monies,
property collected by the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee, except assets or
money held in trust to pay principal of or interest and Additional Interest, if
any, on particular Securities.

      When an Indemnified Party incurs expenses or renders services after an
Event of Default specified in Section 4.01 occurs, such expenses (including the
reasonable fees and expenses of its counsel) and the compensation for such
services are intended to constitute expenses of administration under any
Bankruptcy Law.

      The obligations of the Company under this Section 5.08 shall survive the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture or the resignation or removal of
the Trustee, Paying Agent or the Registrar.

      "TRUSTEE" for purposes of this Section 5.08 shall include any predecessor
Trustee; provided, however, that the bad faith, gross negligence or willful
misconduct of any Trustee hereunder shall not affect the rights of any other
Trustee hereunder.

      Section 5.09. Replacement of Trustee. A resignation or removal of the
Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee shall become effective only upon
the successor Trustee's acceptance of appointment as provided in this Section
5.09.

      The Trustee may resign and be discharged from the trust hereby created by
so notifying the Company in writing. The Holders of at least a majority in
aggregate principal amount of Outstanding Securities may remove the Trustee by
so notifying the Trustee and the Company in writing. The Company must remove the
Trustee if:

            (i) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 5.11 hereof or Section
      310 of the TIA;

            (ii) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting;

            (iii) the Trustee is adjudged a bankrupt or an insolvent or an order
      for relief is entered with respect to the Trustee under any Bankruptcy
      Law; or

            (iv) a Custodian or public officer takes charge of the Trustee or
      its property.


                                       44
<PAGE>

      If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the office
of the Trustee for any reason, the Company shall promptly appoint a successor
Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled to payment of its fees and reimbursement
of its expenses while acting as Trustee.

      Any Holder may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the
removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a successor Trustee if the Trustee
fails to comply with Section 5.11 hereof.

      If an instrument of acceptance by a successor Trustee shall not have been
delivered to the Trustee within 30 days after the giving of such notice of
resignation or removal, the resigning or removed Trustee, as the case may be,
may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent jurisdiction
for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

      A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its appointment
to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Thereupon the resignation or removal
of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor Trustee shall
have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this Indenture. The
Company shall mail a notice of the successor Trustee's succession to the
Holders. The retiring Trustee shall promptly transfer all property held by it as
Trustee to the successor Trustee. Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee
pursuant to this Section 5.09, the Company's obligations under Section 5.08
hereof shall continue for the benefit of the retiring Trustee with respect to
expenses, losses and liabilities incurred by it prior to such replacement.

      Section 5.10. Successor Trustee by Merger, Etc.. Subject to Section 5.11
hereof, if the Trustee consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers
or sells all or substantially all of its corporate trust business (including the
administration of the trust created by this Indenture) to, another corporation
or national banking association, the successor entity without any further act
shall be the successor Trustee as to the Securities.

      Section 5.11. Corporate Trustee Required; Eligibility. The Trustee shall
at all times satisfy the requirements of Sections 310(a)(1), (2) and (5) of the
TIA. The Trustee shall at all times have (or, in the case of a corporation
included in a bank holding company system, the related bank holding company
shall at all times have) a combined capital and surplus of at least $100 million
as set forth in its (or its related bank holding company's) most recent
published annual report of condition. The Trustee is subject to Section 310(b)
of the TIA.

      Section 5.12. Collection of Claims Against the Company. The Trustee is
subject to Section 311(a) of the TIA, excluding any creditor relationship listed
in Section 311(b) of the TIA. A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall
be subject to Section 311(a) of the TIA to the extent indicated therein.

Security; provided, however, that unless a record date shall have been
established, any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to
its Security or portion of a Security if the Trustee receives written notice of
revocation before the date the amendment, supplement or waiver becomes
effective.


                                       49
<PAGE>

      An amendment, supplement or waiver becomes effective on receipt by the
Trustee of written consents from or affirmative votes by, as the case may be,
the Holders of the requisite percentage of aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities, and thereafter shall bind every Holder of Securities;
provided, however, if the amendment, supplement or waiver makes a change
described in any of clauses (a) through (j) of Section 7.02 hereof, the

case may be, Holder.

      Section 7.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an amendment,
supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security:

      (a) the Trustee may require the Holder of a Security to deliver such
Security to the Trustee, the Trustee may place an appropriate notation on the

place an appropriate notation on any Security thereafter authenticated; or

      (b) if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the Company in exchange
for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall authenticate a new Security
that reflects the changed terms.

      Failure to make the appropriate notation or issue a new Security shall not
affect the validity and effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

      Section 7.06. Trustee to Sign Amendment, Etc. The Trustee shall sign any
supplement or amendment authorized pursuant to this Article 7 if the amendment
does not adversely affect the rights, duties, liabilities or immunities of the
Trustee. If the supplement or amendment does adversely affect the rights,
duties, liabilities or immunities of the Trustee, the Trustee may but need not
sign it. In signing or refusing to sign such supplement or amendment, the

for any purpose specified in Section 8.01 hereof, by written request setting
forth in reasonable detail the action proposed to be taken at the meeting, and
the Trustee shall not have made the first publication of the notice of such
meeting within 21 days after receipt of such request or shall not thereafter

may call such meeting for such purposes by giving notice thereof as provided in
paragraph (a) of this Section.

                                   ARTICLE 9
                                   COVENANTS

      Section 9.01. Payment of Principal and Interest. The Company will duly and
punctually pay the principal of and interest (including Liquidated Damages, if
any) on the Securities in accordance with the terms of the Securities and this
Indenture. The Company will deposit or cause to be deposited with the Trustee as
directed by the Trustee, no later than the day of the Stated Maturity of any
Security or installment of interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any), all
payments so due.

      Section 9.02. Maintenance of Offices or Agencies. The Company hereby
appoints the Trustee's Corporate Trust Office as its office where Securities may
be:

                  (i) presented or surrendered for payment;

                  (ii) surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange;

                  (iii) surrendered for conversion;


                                       53
<PAGE>

and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the
Securities and this Indenture may be served.

      The Company may at any time and from time to time vary or terminate the
appointment of any such office or appoint any additional offices for any or all
of such purposes; provided, however, that until all of the Securities have been
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation, or moneys sufficient to pay the
principal of and interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on the
Securities have been made available for payment and either paid or returned to
the Company pursuant to the provisions of Section 9.03 hereof, the Company will
maintain in The City of New York, an office or agency where Securities may be
presented or surrendered for payment, where Securities may be surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange, where Securities may be surrendered for
conversion and where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of
the Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt
written notice to the Trustee, and notice to the Holders in accordance with
Section 14.02 hereof, of the appointment or termination of any such agents and
of the location and any change in the location of any such office or agency.

      If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required office
or agency in The City of New York, or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the
address thereof, presentations and surrenders may be made at, and notices and
demands may be served on, the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee.

      Section 9.03. Corporate Existence. Subject to Article 6 hereof, the
Company will do or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in
full force and effect its corporate existence, rights (charter and statutory)
and franchises; provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to
preserve any such right or franchise if the Company determines that the
preservation thereof is no longer desirable in the conduct of the business of
the Company and that the loss thereof is not disadvantageous in any material
respect to the Holders.

      Section 9.04. Reports. (a) The Company shall make available to the Trustee
and the Holders within 15 days after it is required to file them with the SEC
copies of the annual and quarterly reports and other information, documents and
other reports deemed "filed" for the purposes of Section 18 of the Exchange Act
or incorporated by reference in any filing under the Securities Act or the
Exchange Act (or copies of such portions of any of the foregoing as the SEC may
by rules and regulations prescribe) that the Company is required to file with
the SEC pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act; provided, however,
that the Company shall not be required to deliver to the Trustee any materials
for which the Company has sought and received confidential treatment by the SEC.
The Company also shall comply with the other provisions of Section 314(a) of the
TIA.


                                       54
<PAGE>

      (b) If at any time the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) of
the Exchange Act, upon the request of a Holder of a Security, the Company will
promptly furnish or cause to be furnished to such Holder or to a prospective
purchaser of such Security designated by such Holder, as the case may be, the
information, if any, required to be delivered by it pursuant to Rule 144A(d)(4)
under the Securities Act to permit compliance with Rule 144A in connection with
the resale of such Security; provided, however, that the Company shall not be
required to furnish such information in connection with any request made on or
after the date that is two years from the Issue Date.

      Section 9.05. Compliance Certificate. The Company shall deliver to the
Trustee, within 120 days after the end of each fiscal year of the Company
beginning with the fiscal year ending on December 31, 2004, an Officers'
Certificate stating whether or not the signer thereof has knowledge of any
failure by the Company to comply with all conditions and covenants then required
to be performed under this Indenture and, if so, specifying each such failure
and the nature thereof. Within five Business Days of an Officer of the Company
coming to have actual knowledge of a Default, regardless of the date, the
Company shall deliver an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee specifying such
Default and the nature and status thereof.

      Section 9.06. Registration Rights. The Company agrees that all Holders are
entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement. Whenever in this
Indenture there is mentioned, in any context, the payment of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on, or in respect of, any Security, such mention
shall be deemed to include mention of the payment of "Liquidated Damages"
provided for in this Section to the extent that, in such context, Liquidated
Damages are, were or would be payable in respect thereof pursuant to the
provisions of this Section and express mention of the payment of Liquidated
Damages (if applicable) in any provisions hereof shall not be construed as
excluding Liquidated Damages in those provisions hereof where such express
mention is not made.

      In no event will Liquidated Damages on the Securities due to a
Registration Default accrue at a rate per year exceeding 0.50%. Liquidated
Damages will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year composed of twelve
30-day months. If a Holder elects to convert some or all of its Securities into
Common Stock during a Registration Default, the Conversion Rate will increase by
3% as set forth in Section 12.01. The right of a Holder to Liquidated Damages or
increase in the Conversion Rate, as the case may be, shall be the sole remedy of
the Holder in the event of a Registration Default.

      If a Security, or the shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion of a
Security, constitutes Registrable Securities (which is defined herein as defined
in the Registration Rights Agreement), and the Holder thereof elects to sell
such Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement (which
is defined herein as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) then, by its
acceptance thereof, the Holder of such Registrable Securities will have agreed
to be bound by the terms of the Registration Rights Agreement relating to the
Registrable Securities that are subject of such election.


                                       55
<PAGE>

      If Liquidated Damages are payable by the Company pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate to that effect stating (i) the amount of such Liquidated
Damages that are payable, (ii) the reason why such Liquidated Damages are
payable and (iii) the date on which such damages are payable. Unless and until a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives such an Officers' Certificate, the
Trustee may assume without inquiry that no Liquidated Damages are payable. If
the Company has paid Liquidated Damages directly to the persons entitled to such
amounts, the Company shall deliver to the Trustee a certificate setting forth
the particulars of such payment.


                                   ARTICLE 10
                            REDEMPTION OF SECURITIES

      Section 10.01. Redemption of Securities. The Securities are not redeemable
prior to January 15, 2008. On and after January 15, 2008, but before January 15,
2012, the Securities may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or
in part, upon notice as set forth in Section 10.04, at a redemption price equal
to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities (the "REDEMPTION PRICE"), plus
any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date if the Last Reported Sale Price of the Company's
Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the Conversion Price for at least 20 Trading
Days in any consecutive 30 Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day prior to
the date of mailing of the notice of redemption (it being understood for
purposes of this section that the Conversion Price in effect at the close of
business on each of the 30 consecutive Trading Days should be used). In
addition, on and after January 20, 2012, the Company may, at its option, redeem
the Securities in whole at any time or in part from time to time, on any date
prior to Maturity, upon notice as set forth in Section 10.04, at the Redemption
Price, plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if
any) to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, without regard to the Last Reported
Sale Price of the Common Stock.

      Section 10.02. Notice to Trustee. If the Company elects to redeem
Securities pursuant to the redemption provisions of Section 10.01 hereof, it
shall notify the Trustee at least 30 days but not more than 60 days prior to the
Redemption Date of such intended Redemption Date, the principal amount of
Securities to be redeemed and the CUSIP numbers of the Securities to be
redeemed.


                                       56
<PAGE>

      Section 10.03. Selection of Securities to be Redeemed. If fewer than all
the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall select the particular
Securities to be redeemed from the Outstanding Securities on a pro rata basis or
by lot or in accordance with any other method the Trustee considers fair and
appropriate. Securities and portions thereof that the Trustee selects shall be
in amounts equal to the minimum authorized denominations for Securities to be
redeemed or any whole multiple thereof.

      If any Security selected for partial redemption is converted in part
before termination of the conversion right with respect to the portion of the
Security so selected, the converted portion of such Security shall be deemed to
be the portion selected for redemption (provided, however, that the Holder of
such Security so converted and deemed redeemed shall not be entitled to any
additional interest payment as a result of such deemed redemption than such
Holder would have otherwise been entitled to receive upon conversion of such
Security). Securities that have been converted during a selection of Securities
to be redeemed may be treated by the Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of
such selection.

      The Trustee shall promptly notify the Company and the Registrar in writing
of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any Securities
selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be redeemed.

      For all purposes of this Indenture, unless the context otherwise requires,
all provisions relating to the redemption of Securities shall relate, in the
case of any Securities redeemed or to be redeemed only in part, to the portion
of the principal amount of such Securities that has been or is to be redeemed.

      Section 10.04. Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption shall be given
in the manner provided in Section 14.02 hereof to the Holders of Securities to
be redeemed. Such notice shall be given not less than 30 nor more than 60 days
prior to the Redemption Date.

      All notices of redemption shall state:

            (1) the Redemption Date;

            (2) the Redemption Price, including any accrued and unpaid interest
      (including Liquidated Damages, if any) to, but excluding, the Redemption
      Date, if any;

            (3) if fewer than all the Outstanding Securities are to be redeemed,
      the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be redeemed and the
      aggregate principal amount of Securities that will be Outstanding after
      such partial redemption;


                                       57
<PAGE>

            (4) that on the Redemption Date the Redemption Price and any accrued
      and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) to, but
      excluding, the Redemption Date, if any, will become due and payable upon
      each such Security to be redeemed, and that interest thereon (including
      Liquidated Damages, if any) shall cease to accrue on and after such date;

            (5) the Conversion Price, the date on which the right to convert the
      principal of the Securities to be redeemed will terminate and the places
      where such Securities may be surrendered for conversion;

            (6) the place or places where such Securities are to be surrendered
      for payment of the Redemption Price and any accrued and unpaid interest;
      and

            (7) the CUSIP number of the Securities.

      The notice given shall specify the last date on which exchanges or
transfers of Securities may be made pursuant to Section 2.07 hereof, and shall
specify the serial numbers of Securities and the portions thereof called for
redemption.

      Notice of redemption of Securities to be redeemed at the election of the
Company shall be given by the Company or, at the Company's written request given
at least 45 days prior to the Redemption Date, by the Trustee in the name of and
at the expense of the Company.

      Section 10.05. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Notice of redemption having
been given as provided in Section 10.04 hereof, the Securities so to be redeemed
shall, on the Redemption Date, become due and payable at the Redemption Price
therein specified, and from and after such date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of the Redemption Price and any accrued and unpaid
interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any)) such Securities shall cease to
bear interest. Upon surrender of any such Security for redemption in accordance
with such notice, such Security shall be paid by the Company at the Redemption
Price plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if
any); provided, however, that the installments of interest on Securities whose
Stated Maturity is prior to or on the Redemption Date shall be payable to the
Holders of such Securities, or one or more Predecessor Securities, registered as
such on the relevant Record Date according to their terms and the provisions of
Section 2.01 hereof.

      If any Security called for redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender
thereof for redemption, the principal shall, until paid, bear interest from the
Redemption Date at the Interest Rate.


                                       58
<PAGE>

      Section 10.06. Deposit of Redemption Price. Prior to or on any Redemption
Date, the Company shall deposit with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent an
amount of money sufficient to pay the Redemption Price of all the Securities to
be redeemed on that Redemption Date, other than any Securities called for
redemption on that date that have been converted prior to the date of such
deposit, and any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if
any) on such Securities.

      If any Security called for redemption is converted, any money deposited
with the Trustee or with a Paying Agent or so segregated and held in trust for
the redemption of such Security shall (subject to any right of the Holder of
such Security or any Predecessor Security to receive interest as provided in the
fourth to last paragraph of Section 2.01 hereof) be paid to the Company upon
request of the Company or, if then held by the Company, shall be discharged from
such trust.

      Section 10.07. Securities Redeemed in Part. Any Security that is to be
redeemed only in part shall be surrendered at an office or agency of the Company
designated for that purpose pursuant to Section 9.02 hereof (with, if the
Company or the Trustee so requires, due endorsement by, or a written instrument
of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee duly executed
by, the Holder thereof or the Holder's attorney duly authorized in writing), and
the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver to the
Holder of such Security without service charge, a new Security or Securities of
any authorized denomination as requested by such Holder in aggregate principal
amount equal to and in exchange for the unredeemed portion of the principal of
the Security so surrendered.

      Section 10.08. Conversion Arrangement On Call For Redemption. In
connection with any redemption of Securities, the Company may arrange for the
purchase and conversion of any Securities called for redemption by an agreement
with one or more investment banks or other purchasers to purchase such
Securities by paying to the Trustee in trust for the Holders of the Securities,
on or prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City time on the Redemption Date, an amount
that, together with any amounts deposited with the Trustee by the Company for
the redemption of such Securities, is not less than the Redemption Price of, and
any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) with
respect to, such Securities. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in this Article 10, the obligation of the Company to pay the Redemption Price of
such Securities shall be deemed to be satisfied and discharged to the extent
such amount is so paid by such purchasers. If such an agreement is entered into,
any Securities not duly surrendered for conversion by the Holders thereof may,
at the option of the Company, be deemed, to the fullest extent permitted by law,
acquired by such purchasers from such Holders and surrendered by such purchasers
for conversion, all as of immediately prior to the close of business on


                                       59
<PAGE>

the Business Day prior to the Redemption Date, subject to payment of the above
amount as aforesaid. The Trustee shall hold and pay to the Holders whose
Securities are selected for redemption any such amount paid to it for purchase
and conversion in the same manner as it would moneys deposited with it by the
Company for the redemption of Securities. Without the Trustee's prior written
consent, no arrangement between the Company and such purchasers for the purchase
and conversion of any Securities shall increase or otherwise affect any of the
powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations of the Trustee as set forth in
this Indenture, and the Company agrees to indemnify the Trustee from, and hold
it harmless against, any loss, liability or expense arising out of or in
connection with any such arrangement for the purchase and conversion of any
Securities between the Company and such purchasers, including the costs and
expenses incurred by the Trustee in the defense of any claim or liability
arising out of or in connection with the exercise or performance of any of its
powers, duties, responsibilities or obligations under this Indenture.

                            REPURCHASE OF SECURITIES

      Section 11.01. Repurchase Right Upon Fundamental Change. General. In the
event that a Fundamental Change shall occur at any time prior to Maturity of the
Securities, each Holder shall have the right (the "REPURCHASE RIGHT"), at the
Holder's option to require the Company to repurchase, and upon the exercise of
such right in accordance with this Section 11.01 hereof the Company shall
repurchase, all of such Holder's Securities not theretofore called for
redemption, or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is equal to
$1,000 or any whole multiple thereof (provided, however, that no single Security
may be repurchased in part unless the portion of the principal amount of such
Security to be Outstanding after such repurchase is equal to $1,000 or whole
multiples thereof), on the date (the "REPURCHASE DATE") that is not less than 20
nor more than 35 Business Days after the date of the Company Notice at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be
repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages,
if any) to, but excluding, the Repurchase Date (the "REPURCHASE PRICE");
provided, however, that if the Repurchase Date falls after a Record Date and on
or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Company shall pay the
full amount of any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquated Damages, if
any) payable on such Interest Payment Date to the Holder of record at the close
of business on the corresponding Record Date; provided, further, that
installments of interest on Securities whose Stated Maturity is prior to or on
the Repurchase Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one
or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such on the relevant Record Date
according to their terms and the provisions of Section 2.01 hereof.

      (b) Company Notice. On or prior to the 15th day after the occurrence of a
Fundamental Change, the Company, or, at the written request and expense of the
Company, on or prior to the 15th day after such occurrence, the Trustee, shall
give to all Holders of Securities notice, in the manner provided in Section
14.02 hereof, of the occurrence of the Fundamental Change and of the Repurchase
Right set forth herein arising as a result thereof (the "COMPANY NOTICE"). The
Company shall also deliver a copy of such notice of a Repurchase Right to the
Trustee. Each notice of a Repurchase Right shall state:

            (i) the Repurchase Date;

            (ii) the date by which the Repurchase Right must be exercised;

            (iii) the Repurchase Price;

            (iv) a description of the procedure that a Holder must follow to
      exercise a Repurchase Right, and the place or places where such Securities
      are to be surrendered for payment of the Repurchase Price;

            (v) that on the Repurchase Date the Repurchase Price will become due
      and payable upon each such Security designated by the Holder to be
      repurchased, and that interest thereon shall cease to accrue on and after
      said date;

            (vi) the Conversion Rate then in effect, the date on which the right
      to convert the principal amount of the Securities to be repurchased will

      Notice of Exercise of Repurchase Right certificate included in Exhibit A
      annexed hereto are to be delivered for payment of the Repurchase Price.

      No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices or defect therein
shall limit any Holder's right to exercise a Repurchase Right or affect the
validity of the proceedings for the repurchase of Securities.

      (c) Conditions to the Company's Obligation to Repurchase. To exercise a
Repurchase Right, a Holder shall deliver to the Trustee on or prior to the
Repurchase Date written notice ("FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE REPURCHASE NOTICE") of the
Holder's exercise of such right in the form of the Notice of Exercise of
Repurchase Right certificate included in Exhibit A annexed hereto, which notice
shall set forth:

            (i) the name of the Holder, the principal amount of the Securities
      to be repurchased (and, if any Security is to be repurchased in part, the
      serial number thereof, the portion of the principal amount thereof to be
      repurchased) and a statement that an election to exercise the Repurchase
      Right is being made thereby, and


                                       61
<PAGE>

            (ii) the applicable Depository procedures or, in the case of
      Physical Securities, the certificate number(s) of the Holder's Securities
      with respect to which the Repurchase Right is being exercised.

      (d) Withdrawal of Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice. A Holder may
withdraw any Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice in whole or in part by a
written notice of withdrawal delivered to the Paying Agent prior to the close of
business on the Repurchase Date. The notice of withdrawal must state:

            (i) the principal amount of the withdrawn Securities;

            (ii) the applicable Depositary procedures or, with respect to
      Physical Securities, the certificate number(s) of the withdrawn
      Securities; and

            (iii) the principal amount of Securities, if any, that remains
      subject to the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice.

      The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by it of
any Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal
thereof.

      (e) Payment of Repurchase Price by the Company; Effect on Holders of
Repurchased Securities. Payment of the Repurchase Price for a Security for which
a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice has been delivered and not withdrawn is
conditioned upon book-entry transfer or delivery of the Security, together with
necessary endorsements, to the Paying Agent at its Corporate Trust Office, or
any other office of the Paying Agent, at any time after delivery of the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice. The Company shall pay the Repurchase Price
for the Security promptly following the later of the Repurchase Date and the
time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the Security. If the Paying Agent
holds money or securities sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price on the relevant
Repurchase Date, then, immediately following the Repurchase Date:

            (i) the repurchased Securities will cease to be Outstanding and
      interest will cease to accrue, and

            (ii) all other rights of the Holders of such repurchased Securities
      will terminate (other than the right to receive the Repurchase Price upon
      delivery or transfer of such repurchased Securities),


                                       62
<PAGE>

      in each case, whether or not book-entry transfer of the repurchased
Securities is made or whether or not the repurchased Securities are delivered to
the Paying Agent.

      (f) If any Security (or portion thereof) surrendered for repurchase shall
not be so paid on the Repurchase Date, the principal amount of such Security (or
portion thereof, as the case may be) shall, until paid, bear interest to the
extent permitted by applicable law from the Repurchase Date at the Interest
Rate, and each Security shall remain convertible into Common Stock until the
principal of such Security (or portion thereof, as the case may be) shall have
been paid or duly provided for.

      (g) Any Security that is to be repurchased only in part shall be
surrendered to the Trustee (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due
endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Trustee duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holder of such Security
without service charge, a new Security or Securities, containing identical terms
and conditions, each in an authorized denomination in aggregate principal amount
equal to and in exchange for the unpurchased portion of the principal of the
Security so surrendered.

      (h) All Securities delivered for repurchase shall be delivered to the
Trustee to be canceled at the direction of the Trustee, which shall dispose of
the same as provided in Section 2.15 hereof.

      (i) In connection with any repurchase of the Securities pursuant to this
Section 11.01, the Company will comply with Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act to
the extent applicable at that time.

      (j) Whenever in this Indenture (including Sections 2.02, 4.01(a) and 4.07
hereof) or Exhibit A annexed hereto there is a reference, in any context, to the
principal of any Security as of any time, such reference shall be deemed to
include reference to the Repurchase Price payable in respect to such Security to
the extent that such Repurchase Price is, was or would be so payable at such
time, and express mention of the Repurchase Price in any provision of this
Indenture shall not be construed as excluding the Repurchase Price in those
provisions of this Indenture when such express mention is not made.

      Section 11.02. Repurchase of Securities by the Company at Option of the
Holder. General. Each Holder shall have the right (the "PUT REPURCHASE RIGHT")
to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of its Securities on
January 15, 2012, January 15, 2015 and January 15, 2020 (or, if any such date is
not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding Business Day) (each, a "PUT
REPURCHASE DATE"), at 100% of the principal amount of the Securities to be so
repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages,
if any) to, but excluding, such Put Repurchase Date (the "PUT REPURCHASE
PRICE"); provided, however, that if the Put Repurchase Date falls after a Record
Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Company
shall pay the full amount of any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquated
Damages, if any) payable on such Interest Payment Date to the Holder of record
at the close of business on the corresponding Record Date; Securities shall be
repurchased only in integral multiples of $1,000 of principal amount (provided,
however, that no single Security may be repurchased in part unless the portion
of the principal amount of such Security to be Outstanding after such repurchase
is equal to $1,000 or whole multiples thereof).


                                       63
<PAGE>

      (b) Company Notice. On or before the twenty-third (23rd) Business Day
prior to each Put Repurchase Date, the Company shall provide to the Trustee, the
Paying Agent and to all Holders at their respective addresses as shown on the
Register, and to Beneficial Owners of the Securities where required by
applicable law, a notice stating, among other things:

            (i) the name and address of the Trustee, the Paying Agent and the
      Conversion Agent; and

            (ii) the procedures that Holders must follow to require the Company
      to repurchase their Securities.

      Simultaneously with providing such notice, the Company shall publish a
notice containing this information in a newspaper of general circulation in The
City of New York or publish the information on the Company's website or through
such other public medium as the Company may use at that time.

      (c) Conditions to the Company's Obligation to Repurchase. The Company will
be required to repurchase only Securities with respect to which each of the
following conditions has been satisfied:

            (i) delivery to the Paying Agent by the Holder of a written notice
      of repurchase (a "PUT REPURCHASE NOTICE") during the period beginning at
      any time from the opening of business on the date that is twenty-three
      (23) Business Days prior to the relevant Put Repurchase Date until the
      close of business on the third (3rd) Business Day prior to such Put
      Repurchase Date stating:

                  (A) the applicable Depositary procedures or, in the case of
            Physical Securities, the certificate number(s) of the Holder's
            Securities to be delivered for repurchase;


                                       64
<PAGE>

                  (B) the portion of the principal amount of Securities to be
            repurchased, in whole multiples of $l,000; and

                  (C) that the Securities are to be repurchased by the Company
            pursuant to paragraph 6(b) of the Securities and this Section 11.02;
            and

            (ii) delivery of such Securities to the Trustee or Paying Agent
      prior to, on or after the Put Repurchase Date (together with all necessary
      endorsements).

      (d) Withdrawal of Put Repurchase Notice. A Holder may withdraw any Put
Repurchase Notice in whole or in part by a written notice of withdrawal
delivered to the Trustee or the Paying Agent prior to the close of business on
the third (3rd) Business Day prior to the applicable Put Repurchase Date. The
notice of withdrawal must state:

            (i) the principal amount of the withdrawn Securities;

            (ii) the applicable Depositary procedures or, with respect to
      Physical Securities, the certificate number(s) of the withdrawn
      Securities; and

            (iii) the principal amount of Securities, if any, that remains
      subject to the Put Repurchase Notice.

      The Trustee or Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the
receipt by it of any Put Repurchase Notice or written notice of withdrawal
thereof.

      The Put Repurchase Price shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 11.02
only if the Securities so delivered by the Holder conform in all respects to the
description thereof in the related Put Repurchase Notice, as determined by the
Company in its sole discretion.

      (e) Payment of Put Repurchase Price by the Company; Effect on Holders of
Repurchased Securities. Payment of the Put Repurchase Price for a Security for
which a Put Repurchase Notice has been delivered and not withdrawn is
conditioned upon book-entry transfer or delivery of the Security, together with
necessary endorsements, to the Paying Agent at its Corporate Trust Office, or
any other office of the Paying Agent, at any time after delivery of the Put
Repurchase Notice. The Company shall pay the Put Repurchase Price to the Paying
Agent promptly following the later of the relevant Put Repurchase Date or the
time of book-entry transfer or delivery of the repurchased Securities. If either
the Trustee or the Paying Agent holds money or securities sufficient to pay the
Put Repurchase Price on the Business Day immediately following the Put
Repurchase Date, then immediately after the Put Repurchase Date:


                                       65
<PAGE>

            (i) the repurchased Securities will cease to be Outstanding and
      interest will cease to accrue, and

            (ii) all other rights of the Holders of such repurchased Securities
      will terminate (other than the right to receive the Put Repurchase Price
      upon delivery or transfer of such repurchased Securities),

in each case, whether or not book-entry transfer of the repurchased Securities
is made or whether or not the repurchased Securities are delivered to the Paying
Agent.

      (f) If any Security (or portion thereof) surrendered for repurchase shall
not be so paid on the Put Repurchase Date, the principal amount of such Security
(or portion thereof, as the case may be) shall, until paid, bear interest to the
extent permitted by applicable law from the Put Repurchase Date at the Interest
Rate, and each Security shall remain convertible into Common Stock until the
principal of such Security (or portion thereof, as the case may be) shall have
been paid or duly provided for.

      (g) Any Security that is to be repurchased only in part shall be
surrendered to the Trustee (with, if the Company or the Trustee so requires, due
endorsement by, or a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Company and the Trustee duly executed by the Holder thereof or his attorney duly
authorized in writing), and the Company shall execute, and the Trustee shall
authenticate and make available for delivery to the Holder of such Security
without service charge, a new Security or Securities, containing identical terms
and conditions, each in an authorized denomination in aggregate principal amount
equal to and in exchange for the unpurchased portion of the principal of the
Security so surrendered.

      (h) All Securities delivered for repurchase shall be delivered to the
Trustee to be canceled at the direction of the Trustee, which shall dispose of
the same as provided in Section 2.15 hereof.

      (i) In connection with any repurchase of the Securities pursuant to this
Section 11.02, the Company will comply with Rule 13e-4 under the Exchange Act to
the extent applicable at that time.

      (j) No Securities may be repurchased by the Company pursuant to this
Section 11.02 if the principal amount of the Securities has been accelerated,
and such acceleration has not been rescinded, on or prior to the relevant Put
Repurchase Date.

      (k) Whenever in this Indenture (including Sections 2.02, 4.01(a) and 4.07
hereof) or Exhibit A annexed hereto there is a reference, in any context, to the
principal of any Security as of any time, such reference shall be deemed to
include reference to the Put Repurchase Price payable in respect to such
Security to the extent that such Put Repurchase Price is, was or would be so
payable at such time, and express mention of the Put Repurchase Price in any
provision of this Indenture shall not be construed as excluding the Put
Repurchase Price in those provisions of this Indenture when such express mention
is not made.

                                   ARTICLE 12
                            CONVERSION OF SECURITIES

      Section 12.01. Conversion Right and Conversion Rate. (i) Subject to
compliance with the provisions of this Article, at the option of the Holder
thereof, any Security or any portion of the principal amount thereof that is
$1,000 or a multiple of $1,000 may be converted, at any time, at the principal
amount thereof, or of such portion thereof, into the number of duly authorized,
fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock at the Conversion Rate in
effect at the time of conversion. Such conversion right shall commence on the
Issue Date and expire at the close of business on the Business Day immediately
preceding Maturity or, if the Securities have been called for redemption, at the
close of business on the Business Day immediately prior the Redemption Date.

            (ii) If a transaction described in clause (2) of the definition of
      Change of Control occurs on or prior to January 15, 2012, the Company
      shall give notice to the Trustee and all Holders at least 20 days prior to
      the anticipated Effective Date of such Change of Control. A Holder
      converting any Security pursuant to this Article 12, at anytime beginning
      on the date that is 15 days prior to the anticipated Effective Date of
      such Change of Control and ending on the date that is 15 days after the
      actual Effective Date, shall be entitled to receive, in addition to a
      number of shares of Common Stock equal to the Conversion Rate per $1,000
      principal amount of Securities, an additional number of shares of Common
      Stock (the "ADDITIONAL SHARES") as set forth in this clause (a)(ii). If
      the Conversion Date for such Securities occurs on or after the 15th day
      prior to the anticipated Effective Date, the Additional Shares, or the
      value thereof, will be delivered to the converting Holders on the later of
      the Effective Date and the third Business Day following the Conversion
      Date.

            As set forth in Section 12.04, unless the Company elects to change
      the conversion obligation into Acquirer Common Stock, if a Holder tenders
      Securities for conversion after the Effective Date of such Change of
      Control transaction, the Securities will be converted into the kind and
      amount of shares of stock, securities or other property or assets
      (including cash or any combination thereof) that the Holders would have
      owned or been entitled to receive in such Change of Control transaction
      had such Securities been converted and the Holders had received Common
      Stock immediately prior to such transaction. If the Conversion Date is
      after the Effective Date and on or prior to the date that is 15 days after
      the Effective Date, the kind and amount of such shares of stock,
      securities or other property will be based on the Conversion Rate plus the
      Additional Shares.


                                       67
<PAGE>

            The number of Additional Shares shall be determined by reference to
      the table attached as Schedule A hereto, based on the Effective Date and
      the Stock Price; provided that if the Stock Price is equal to or in excess
      of $150 per share (subject in each case to adjustment as described below)
      or if the Stock Price is less than $17.50 per share (subject to
      adjustment), the number of Additional Shares shall be zero; provided that
      if the Stock Price is between two Stock Price amounts in the table or the
      Conversion Date is between two dates in the table, the number of
      Additional Shares shall be determined by a straight-line interpolation
      between the number of Additional Shares set forth for the higher and lower
      Stock Price amounts and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 365-day
      year.

            The Stock Prices set forth in the first row of the table in Schedule
      A hereto and set forth in the proviso in the first sentence of the
      preceding paragraph shall be adjusted as of any date on which the
      Conversion Rate of the Securities is adjusted. The adjusted Stock Prices
      shall equal the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such
      adjustment, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
      Conversion Rate immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the
      Stock Price adjustment and the denominator of which is the Conversion Rate
      as so adjusted. The Company's obligation to deliver Additional Shares
      shall be subject to adjustment in the same manner as the Conversion Rate
      as set forth Section 12.04 and Section 12.11.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event will the total number of
      shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 53.5000 per $1,000
      principal amount of Securities, subject to adjustments in the same manner
      as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 12.04 and Section 12.11.

            Promptly following the Effective Date, the Company shall calculate
      the Stock Price and the number of Additional Shares based on the
      applicable Stock Price and Effective Date. No less than three Business
      Days following the Effective Date, the Company shall notify the Trustee of
      the results of such calculations and notify the Holders of the Stock
      Price, the number of Additional Shares per $1,000 principal amount of
      Securities. The Company shall issue a press release containing the
      information described in this paragraph and publish such information on
      its website.


                                       68
<PAGE>

      (b) In case a Security or portion thereof is called for redemption, such
conversion right in respect of the Security or the portion so called, shall
expire at the close of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Redemption Date, unless the Company defaults in making the payment due upon
redemption. If a Holder exercises its Repurchase Right or Put Repurchase Right
with respect to a Security or portion thereof, such conversion right in respect
of the Security or portion thereof shall expire at the close of business on the
Business Day preceding the Repurchase Date or Put Repurchase Date, as
applicable.

      (c) Each $1,000 principal amount of the Securities shall be convertible
into 43.9560 shares of Common Stock (herein called the "CONVERSION RATE"),
subject to adjustment in certain instances as provided in paragraphs (a), (b),
(c), (d), (e) and (f) of Section 12.04 hereof; provided that if, at any time a
Holder tenders Securities for conversion, there exists a Registration Default,
the Conversion Rate shall be increased by 3% for such Securities converted.

      (d) Notwithstanding the foregoing, and in lieu of increasing the
Conversion Rate by the Additional Shares as set forth above, in the case of a
Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Company may elect that, from and after
the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control, the right to
convert a Security will be changed into a right to convert a Security into a
number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock. Upon such election (which shall be no
later than the 15th day prior to the anticipated Effective Date of such Public
Acquirer Change of Control), the Conversion Rate following the Effective Date of
such transaction will be a number of shares of Acquirer Common Stock equal to
the product of:

      (i)   the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to the Effective
            Date of such Change of Control, multiplied by

      (ii)  the average of the quotients obtained, for each Trading Day in the
            10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on the Trading Day next
            succeeding the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of
            Control (the "VALUATION PERIOD"), of:

            (1)   the Acquisition Value of the Common Stock on each such Trading
                  Day in the Valuation Period, divided by

            (2)   the Last Reported Sale Price of the Acquirer Common Stock on
                  each such Trading Day in the Valuation Period.

      After the adjustment of the Conversion Rate in connection with a Public
Acquirer Change of Control, the Conversion Rate will be subject to further
similar adjustments in the event that any of the events described above occur
thereafter and will also be subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 12.04 and
Section 12.11. The Company shall notify Holders of any such election pursuant to
this clause (d) by publishing a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in
the City of New York or publishing a notice on the Company's website or such
other public medium as the Company may use from time to time.


                                       69
<PAGE>

      Section 12.02. Exercise of Conversion Right. To exercise the conversion
right, the Holder of any Security to be converted shall surrender such Security
duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or in blank, at the office of any
Conversion Agent, accompanied by a duly signed conversion notice substantially
in the form attached to the Security to the Company stating that the Holder
elects to convert such Security or, if less than the entire principal amount
thereof is to be converted, the portion thereof to be converted. The date a
Holder complies with these requirements for any Securities shall be the
"CONVERSION DATE" with respect to such Securities.

      Securities shall be deemed to have been converted immediately prior to the
close of business on the Conversion Date, and at such time the rights of the
Holders of such Securities as Holders shall cease, and the Person or Persons
entitled to receive the Common Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated
for all purposes as the record holder or holders of such Common Stock at such
time. Except as provided above in this Section 12.02, no adjustment shall be
made for interest and Liquidated Damages, if any, accrued on any Security
converted or for dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of such
Security as provided in this Article 12. As promptly as practicable on or after
the conversion date, but in no event later than the fifth Business Day
thereafter, the Company shall cause to be issued and delivered to such
Conversion Agent a certificate or certificates for the number of full shares of
Common Stock issuable upon conversion, together with payment in lieu of any
fraction of a share as provided in Section 12.03 hereof.

      In the case of any Security that is converted in part only, upon such
conversion the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and
deliver to the Holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new Security or
Securities of authorized denominations in aggregate principal amount equal to
the unconverted portion of the principal amount of such Securities.

      If shares of Common Stock to be issued upon conversion of a Restricted
Security, or Securities to be issued upon conversion of a Restricted Security in
part only, are to be registered in a name other than that of the Holder of such
Restricted Security, such Holder must deliver to the Conversion Agent a
certificate in substantially the form set forth in the form of Security set
forth in Exhibit A annexed hereto, dated the date of surrender of such
Restricted Security and signed by such Holder, as to compliance with the
restrictions on transfer applicable to such Restricted Security. Neither the
Trustee nor any Conversion Agent, Registrar or Transfer Agent shall be required
to register in a name other than that of the Holder shares of Common Stock or
Securities issued upon conversion of any such Restricted Security not so
accompanied by a properly completed certificate.


                                       70
<PAGE>

      The Company hereby initially appoints the Trustee as the Conversion Agent.

      Delivery to the Holder of Securities of the full number of shares of
Common Stock into which the Securities are convertible pursuant to the terms of
this Article 12 shall be deemed to satisfy the Company's obligation with respect
to such Securities. Accordingly, any accrued but unpaid interest shall be deemed
to be paid in full upon conversion, rather than cancelled, extinguished or
forfeited.

      Section 12.03. Fractional Shares. No fractional shares of Common Stock
shall be issued upon conversion of any Security or Securities. If more than one
Security shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the same Holder, the
number of full shares that shall be issued upon conversion thereof shall be
computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the Securities (or
specified portions thereof) so surrendered. Instead of any fractional share of
Common Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of any Security or
Securities (or specified portions thereof), the Company shall pay a cash
adjustment in respect of such fraction (calculated to the nearest one-100th of a
share) in an amount equal to the same fraction of the Last Reported Sale Price
of the Common Stock as of the Trading Day preceding the date of conversion.

      Section 12.04. Adjustment of Conversion Rate. The Conversion Rate shall be
subject to adjustments, calculated by the Company, from time to time as follows:

      (a) In case the Company shall pay or make a dividend or other distribution
in shares of Common Stock, subdivide outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
greater number of shares of Common Stock or combine the outstanding shares of
Common Stock into a lesser number of shares of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate
in effect at the opening of business on the day following the Record Date fixed
for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other
distribution, or the Record Date for such subdivision or combination, as the
case may be, shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

                                                  1
                                  1             OS
                                CR  =  CR    x -----
                                         0      OS
                                                  0

         where,

              OS   =  the number of shares of Common Stock that would be
                      outstanding immediately after such event

      If, after any such Record Date, any dividend or distribution is not in
fact paid or the outstanding shares of Common Stock are not subdivided or
combined, as the case may be, the Conversion Rate shall be immediately
readjusted, effective as of the date the Board of Directors determines not to
pay such dividend or distribution, or subdivide or combine the outstanding
shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, to the Conversion Rate that would
have been in effect if such Record Date had not been fixed.

      (b) In case the Company shall issue rights or warrants to all holders of
its outstanding shares of Common Stock entitling them to subscribe for or
purchase shares of Common Stock for a period expiring 45 days or less from the
date of issuance of such rights or warrants at a price per share less than the
Current Market Price of the Common Stock (as defined in (h)), on the business
day immediately preceding the announcement of such issuance, the Conversion Rate
in effect at the opening of business on the day following the Record Date shall
be adjusted based on the following formula:

                                         OS
                           1               0 +  X

                0     on the Record Date

                1  =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the
              CR      Record Date

              OS   =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding at the
                0     close of business on the Record Date

              X    =  the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable
                      pursuant to such rights

              Y    =  the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the
                      aggregate price payable to exercise such rights divided
                      by the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the
                      Common Stock for the ten consecutive Trading Days prior
                      to the Business Day immediately preceding the
                      announcement of the issuance of such rights

      If, after any such Record Date, any such rights or warrants are not in
fact issued, or are not exercised prior to the expiration thereof, the
Conversion Rate shall be immediately readjusted, effective as of the date such
rights or warrants expire, or the date the Board of Directors determines not to
issue such rights or warrants, to the Conversion Rate that would have been in
effect if the unexercised rights or warrants had never been granted or such
Record Date had not been fixed, as the case may be.

      (c) In case the Company shall pay a dividend or distribution consisting
exclusively of cash to all holders of its Common Stock, the Conversion Rate in
effect at the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such
dividend or distribution shall be adjusted based on the following formula:


                                        SP

              CR   =  the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business
                0     on the Record Date

                1  =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the
              CR      Record Date

              SP   =  the Current Market Price
                0

              C    =  the amount in cash per share distributed by the Company
                      to holders of Common Stock

      In the event that C is greater than or equal to SP0, in lieu of the
adjustment contemplated, Holders will be entitled to participate ratably in the
cash distribution as though their Securities had been converted to shares of
Common Stock on the applicable date of calculation for the amounts to be
received by holders of Common Stock. If after any such Record Date, any such
dividend or distribution is not in fact made, the Conversion Rate shall be
immediately readjusted, effective as of the date of the Board of Directors
determines not to make such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate
that would have been in effect if such Record Date had not been fixed

      (d) In case the Company shall, by dividend or otherwise, distribute to all
holders of its Common Stock shares of its capital stock (other than Common
Stock) or evidences of its indebtedness or assets (including cash or securities,
but excluding (i) any rights or warrants referred to in (b), (ii) any dividend
or distribution paid exclusively in cash and the Conversion Rate in effect at
the opening of business on the day following the Record Date for such dividend
or distribution shall be adjusted based on the following formula:

              CR   =  the Conversion Rate in effect at the close of business
                0     on the Record Date

                1  =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the
              CR      Record Date

                      Directors) of the shares of capital stock, evidences of
                      indebtedness, assets or property distributed with
                      respect to each outstanding share of Common Stock on the
                      Record Date for such distribution

      In the event that FMV is greater than or equal to SP0, in lieu of the
adjustment contemplated, Holders will be entitled to participate ratably in the
relevant distribution as though their Securities had been converted to shares of
Common Stock on the applicable date of calculation for the amounts to be
received by holders of Common Stock. If after any such Record Date, any such
dividend or distribution is not in fact made, the Conversion Rate shall be
immediately readjusted, effective as of the date of the Board of Directors
determines not to make such dividend or distribution, to the Conversion Rate
that would have been in effect if such Record Date had not been fixed.

      For purposes of this clause (d), in case the Company shall, by dividend or
otherwise, distribute to all holders of its Common Stock shares of Capital Stock
of, or similar equity interests in, a Subsidiary or other business unit of the
Company, the Conversion Rate shall be adjusted based on the following formula:


                                        FMV    MP

                0     on the Record Date

                1  =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the

                      Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the
                      10 Trading Days commencing on and including the fifth
                      Trading Day after the date on which "ex-distribution
                      trading" commences for such dividend or distribution on
                      the Nasdaq National Market or such other national or
                      regional exchange or market on which the Common Stock is
                      then listed or quoted

                      "ex-distribution trading" commences for such dividend or

      Rights or warrants distributed by the Company to all holders of Common
Stock entitling the holders thereof to subscribe for or purchase shares of the
Company's capital stock (either initially or under certain circumstances), which
rights or warrants, until the occurrence of a specified event or events
("TRIGGER EVENT"):

      (i)   are deemed to be transferred with such shares of Common Stock,

      (ii)  are not exercisable, and

      (iii) are also issued in respect of future issuances of Common Stock

shall be deemed not to have been distributed for purposes of this Section
12.04(d) (and no adjustment to the Conversion Rate under this Section 12.04(d)
will be required) until the occurrence of the earliest Trigger Event. To the
extent a Conversion Date occurs prior to any such Trigger Event, a Holder will
receive, in addition to the Common Stock, such rights or warrants. If such right
or warrant is subject to subsequent events, upon the occurrence of which such
right or warrant shall become exercisable to purchase different securities,
evidences of indebtedness or other assets or entitle the holder to purchase a
different number or amount of the foregoing or to purchase any of the foregoing
at a different purchase price, then the occurrence of each such event shall be
deemed to be the date of issuance and record date with respect to a new right or
warrant (and a termination or expiration of the existing right or warrant
without exercise by the holder thereof). In addition, in the event of any
distribution (or deemed distribution) of rights or warrants, or any Trigger
Event or other event (of the type described in the preceding sentence) with
respect thereto, that resulted in an adjustment to the Conversion Rate under
this Section 12.04(d):

            (1) in the case of any such rights or warrants that shall all have
      been redeemed or repurchased without exercise by any holders thereof, the
      Conversion Rate shall be readjusted upon such final redemption or
      repurchase to give effect to such distribution or Trigger Event, as the
      case may be, as though it were a cash distribution, equal to the per share
      redemption price or repurchase price received by a holder of Common Stock
      with respect to such rights or warrant (assuming such holder had retained
      such rights or warrants), made to all holders of Common Stock as of the
      date of such redemption or repurchase, and


                                       75
<PAGE>

            (2) in the case of such rights or warrants all of which shall have
      expired or been terminated without exercise, the Conversion Rate shall be
      readjusted as if such rights and warrants had never been issued.

      For purposes of this Section 12.04(d) and Section 12.04(a), Section
12.04(b) and Section 12.04(c), any dividend or distribution to which this
Section 12.04(d) is applicable that also includes shares of Common Stock, a
subdivision or combination of Common Stock to which Section 12.04(b) applies, or
rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock to which
Section 12.04(c) applies (or any combination thereof), shall be deemed instead
to be:

            (1) a dividend or distribution of the evidences of indebtedness,
      assets, shares of capital stock, rights or warrants other than such shares
      of Common Stock, such subdivision or combination or such rights or
      warrants to which Section 12.04(a), Section 12.04(b) and Section 12.04(c)
      apply, respectively (and any Conversion Rate increase required by this
      Section 12.04(d) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall then
      be made), immediately followed by

            (2) a dividend or distribution of such shares of Common Stock, such
      subdivision or combination or such rights or warrants (and any further
      Conversion Rate increase required by Section 12.04(a), Section 12.04(b)
      and Section 12.04(c) with respect to such dividend or distribution shall
      then be made), except:

                  (A) the Record Date of such dividend or distribution shall be
            substituted as (x) "the date fixed for the determination of
            stockholders entitled to receive such dividend or other
            distribution", "Record Date fixed for such determination" and
            "Record Date" within the meaning of Section 12.04(a), (y) "the day
            upon which such subdivision becomes effective" and "the day upon
            which such combination becomes effective" within the meaning of
            Section 12.04(b), and (z) "the Record Date fixed for the
            determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or
            warrants," such "Record Date," "the Record Date fixed for the
            determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or
            warrants" and "such dated fixed for the determination of

            meaning of Section 12.04(b), and

                  (B) any shares of Common Stock included in such dividend or
            distribution shall not be deemed "outstanding at the close of
            business on the Record Date fixed for such determination" within the
            meaning of Section 12.04(a) and any reduction or increase in the
            number of shares of Common Stock resulting from such subdivision or
            combination shall be disregarded in connection with such dividend or
            distribution.

      (e) In case the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company purchases all or
any portion of the Common Stock pursuant to a tender offer or exchange offer by
the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company for the Common Stock and the cash
and value of any other consideration included in the payment per share of the
Common Stock exceeds the Current Market Price per share on the Trading Day next
succeeding the last date on which tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to
such tender or exchange offer (the "EXPIRATION DATE"), the Conversion Rate shall
be will be adjusted based on the following formula:

                      Stock validly tendered or exchanged and not withdrawn as

                1  =  the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on
              SP      the Trading Day next succeeding the Expiration Date

      Such increase (if any) shall become effective immediately prior to the
opening of business on the day following the Expiration Date. In the event that
the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender offer,
but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting any
such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate shall
again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such
tender or exchange offer had not been made. If the application of this Section
12.04(e) to any tender or exchange offer would result in a decrease in the
Conversion Rate, no adjustment shall be made for such tender or exchange offer
under this Section 12.04(e).

Company or any Subsidiary for an amount that increases the offeror's ownership
of Common Stock to more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the Common Stock
outstanding and shall involve the payment by such Person of consideration per

Directors, whose determination shall be conclusive, and described in a
resolution of the Board of Directors) that as of the last date (the "OFFER
EXPIRATION DATE") tenders or exchanges may be made pursuant to such tender or
exchange offer (as it shall have been amended) exceeds the Last Reported Sale

Expiration Date, and in which, as of the Offer Expiration Date the Board of
Directors is not recommending rejection of the offer, the Conversation Rate

      Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening of
business on the day following the Offer Expiration Date. In the event that such
Person is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or exchange
offer, but such Person is permanently prevented by applicable law from effecting
any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the Conversion Rate
shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect
if such tender or exchange offer had not been made. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the adjustment described in this Section 12.04(f) shall not be made
if, as of the Offer Expiration Date, the offering documents with respect to such
offer disclose a plan or intention to cause the Company to engage in any
transaction described in Section 12.11.

such computation.

      For purposes of this paragraph, the term "ex" date, when used:

                  (A) with respect to any issuance or distribution, means the
            first date on which the shares of the Common Stock trade on the
            applicable exchange or in the applicable market, regular way,
            without the right to receive such issuance or distribution;

                  (B) with respect to any subdivision or combination of shares
            of Common Stock, means the first date on which the Common Stock
            trades regular way on such exchange or in such market after the time
            at which such subdivision or combination becomes effective, and

                  (C) with respect to any tender or exchange offer, means the
            first date on which the Common Stock trades regular way on such
            exchange or in such market after the Expiration Date or Offer
            Expiration Date of such offer.

      Notwithstanding the foregoing, whenever successive adjustments to the
Conversion Rate are called for pursuant to this Section 12.04, such adjustments
shall be made to the Current Market Price as may be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the intent of this Section 12.04 and to avoid unjust or inequitable
results as determined in good faith by the Board of Directors.

      (i) "FAIR MARKET VALUE" shall mean the amount that a willing buyer would
pay a willing seller in an arm's length transaction.

      (j) "RECORD DATE" shall mean, with respect to any dividend, distribution
or other transaction or event in which the holders of Common Stock have the
right to receive any cash, securities or other property or in which the Common
Stock (or other applicable security) is exchanged for or converted into any
combination of cash, securities or other property, the date fixed for
determination of stockholders entitled to receive such cash, securities or other
property (whether such date is fixed by the Board of Directors or by statute,
contract or otherwise).

      (k) The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in
addition to those required by Section 12.04(a), (b), (c), (d), (e) and (f), as
the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid or diminish any income
tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase Common Stock resulting from
any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any
event treated as such for income tax purposes.

      The Company may from time to time, to the extent permitted by law and
subject to applicable rules of the Nasdaq National Market, increase the
Conversion Rate of the Securities by any amount for any period of at least 20
days. In such event, the Company shall give at least 15 days notice of such
increase. The Company may make such increases in the Conversion Rate, in
addition to those set forth above, as the Board of Directors deems advisable to
avoid or diminish any income tax to Holders of the Common Stock resulting from
any dividend or distribution of stock (or rights to acquire stock) or from any
event treated as such for income tax purposes.

      (l) Except as otherwise provided in this Article 12, no adjustment need be
made for the issuance of Common Stock or any securities convertible into or
exchangeable for Common Stock or that carry the right to purchase any of the
foregoing. All calculations under this Article 12 shall be made by the Company
and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one hundredth of a
share, as the case may be. No adjustment need be made for a change in the par
value or no par value of the Common Stock.


                                       80

      (m) To the extent the Holders of Securities may participate on an
as-converted basis equally with the holders of Common Stock in any event or
occurrence, then Section 12.04 hereof shall not apply to such event on
occurrence.

      (n) In any case in which this Section 12.04 provides that an adjustment
shall become effective immediately after a Record Date for an event, the Company
may defer until the occurrence of such event (i) issuing to the Holder of any
Security converted after such Record Date and before the occurrence of such
event the additional shares of Common Stock issuable upon such conversion by
reason of the adjustment required by such event over and above the Common Stock
issuable upon such conversion before giving effect to such adjustment and (ii)
paying to such holder any amount in cash in lieu of any fraction pursuant to
Section 12.03 hereof.

      (o) For purposes of this Section 12.04, the number of shares of Common
Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the treasury of
the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip certificates
issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company will not pay
any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock held in the
treasury of the Company.

      Section 12.05. Notice of Adjustments of Conversion Rate. Whenever the
Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided (other than in the case of an
adjustment pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 12.04(i) for which the
notice required by such paragraph has been provided), the Company shall promptly
file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee an
Officers' Certificate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and showing in
reasonable detail the facts upon which such adjustment is based. Unless and
until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate
describing an adjustment of the Conversion Price, the Trustee may assume without
inquiry that no such adjustment has been made. Promptly after delivery of such
Officers' Certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice stating that the
Conversion Rate has been adjusted and setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate
and the date on which each adjustment becomes effective, and shall mail such
notice to each Holder at the address of such Holder as it appears in the
Register within 20 days of the effective date of such adjustment. Failure to
deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such
adjustment.

      Section 12.06. Notice Prior to Certain Actions. In case at any time after
the date hereof:

            (1) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution)
      on its Common Stock payable otherwise than in cash out of its capital
      surplus or its consolidated retained earnings;


                                       81
<PAGE>

            (2) the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of its
      Common Stock of rights or warrants to subscribe for or purchase any shares
      of capital stock of any class (or of securities convertible into shares of
      capital stock of any class) or of any other rights;

            (3) there shall occur any reclassification of the Common Stock of
      the Company (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding
      Common Stock, a change in par value, a change from par value to no par
      value or a change from no par value to par value), or any merger,
      consolidation, binding share exchange or combination to which the Company
      is a party and for which approval of any shareholders of the Company is
      required, or the sale, lease or other transfer in one transaction or a
      series of related transactions to another corporation of the consolidated
      assets of the Company and its Subsidiaries, substantially as an entirety;
      or

            (4) there shall occur the voluntary or involuntary dissolution,
      liquidation or winding up of the Company;

the Company shall cause to be filed at each office or agency maintained for the
purpose of conversion of securities pursuant to Section 9.02 hereof, and shall
cause to be provided to the Trustee and all Holders in accordance with Section
14.02 hereof, at least 20 days (or 10 days in any case specified in clause (1)
or (2) above) prior to the applicable record or effective date hereinafter
specified, a notice stating:

            (A) the date on which a record is to be taken for the purpose of
      such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants, or, if a record is not to
      be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock of record to be
      entitled to such dividend, distribution, rights or warrants are to be
      determined, or

            (B) the date on which such reclassification, merger, consolidation,
      binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution,
      liquidation or winding up is expected to become effective, and the date as
      of which it is expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be
      entitled to exchange their shares of Common Stock for securities, cash or
      other property deliverable upon such reclassification, merger,
      consolidation, binding share exchange, sale, lease, transfer, dissolution,
      liquidation or winding up.

      Neither the failure to give such notice nor any defect therein shall
affect the legality or validity of the proceedings or actions described in
clauses (1) through (4) of this Section 12.06.


                                       82

      Section 12.07. Company to Reserve Common Stock. The Company shall at all
times reserve and keep available, free from preemptive rights, out of its
authorized but unissued Common Stock, for the purpose of effecting the
conversion of Securities, the full number of shares of fully paid and
non-assessable Common Stock then issuable upon the conversion of all Outstanding
Securities.

      Section 12.08. Tax on Conversions. Except as provided in the next
sentence, the Company will pay any and all taxes (other than taxes on income)
and duties that may be payable in respect of the issue or delivery of shares of
Common Stock on conversion of Securities pursuant hereto. A Holder delivering a
Security for conversion shall be liable for and will be required to pay any tax
or duty that may be payable in respect of any transfer involved in the issue and
delivery of shares of Common Stock in a name other than that of the Holder of
the Security or Securities to be converted, and no such issue or delivery shall
be made unless the Person requesting such issue has paid to the Company the
amount of any such tax or duty, or has established to the satisfaction of the
Company that such tax or duty has been paid.

      Section 12.09. Covenant as to Common Stock. The Company covenants that all
shares of Common Stock that may be issued upon conversion of Securities will
upon issue be fully paid and nonassessable and, except as provided in Section
12.08, the Company will pay all taxes, liens and charges with respect to the
issue thereof.

      Section 12.10. Cancellation of Converted Securities. All Securities
delivered for conversion shall be delivered to the Trustee to be canceled by or
at the direction of the Trustee, which shall dispose of the same as provided in
Section 2.09.

      Section 12.11. Effect of Recapitalization, Reclassification,
Consolidation, Merger or Sale. If any of following events occur, namely:

            (i) any recapitalization, reclassification or change of the
      outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a change in par value, or
      from par value to no par value, or from no par value to par value, or as a
      result of a subdivision or combination),

            (ii) any merger, consolidation, binding share exchange or
      combination of the Company with another corporation as a result of which
      holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive stock, securities or
      other property or assets (including cash) with respect to or in exchange
      for such Common Stock or

            (iii) any sale, lease or other transfer of the consolidated assets
      of the Company and its Subsidiaries, substantially as an entirety, to any
      other corporation as a result of which holders of Common Stock shall be
      entitled to receive stock, securities or other property or assets
      (including cash) with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock,


                                       83
<PAGE>

the Company or the successor or purchasing corporation, as the case may be,
shall execute with the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with
the TIA as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental indenture if
such supplemental indenture is then required to so comply) providing that each
Security shall be convertible into the kind and amount of shares of stock and
other securities or property or assets (including cash) that such Holder would
have been entitled to receive upon such recapitalization, reclassification,
change, merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease
or other transfer had such Securities been converted into Common Stock
immediately prior to such recapitalization, reclassification, change, merger,
consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease or other
transfer assuming such holder of Common Stock did not exercise its rights of
election, if any, as to the kind or amount of securities, cash or other property
receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification, change, merger,
consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease or other
transfer (provided that, if the kind or amount of securities, cash or other
property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification, change,
merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease or other
transfer is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such
rights of election shall not have been exercised ("NON-ELECTING SHARE"), then
for the purposes of this Section 12.11 the kind and amount of securities, cash
or other property receivable upon such recapitalization, reclassification,
change, merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease
or other transfer for each Non-Electing Share shall be deemed to be the kind and
amount so receivable per share by a plurality of the Non-Electing Shares). Such
supplemental indenture shall provide for adjustments that shall be as nearly
equivalent as may be practicable to the adjustments provided for in this Article
12. If, in the case of any such recapitalization, reclassification, change,
merger, consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease or other
transfer, the stock or other securities and assets receivable thereupon by a
holder of shares of Common Stock includes shares of stock or other securities
and assets of a corporation other than the successor or purchasing corporation,
as the case may be, in such recapitalization, reclassification, change, merger,
consolidation, binding share exchange, combination, sale, lease or other
transfer, then such supplemental indenture shall also be executed by such other
corporation and shall contain such additional provisions to protect the
interests of the Holders of the Securities as the Board of Directors shall
reasonably consider necessary by reason of the foregoing, including to the
extent practicable the provisions providing for the Repurchase Rights and Put
Repurchase Rights set forth in Article 11 hereof.


                                       84
<PAGE>

      The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental
indenture to be mailed to each Holder, at the address of such Holder as it
appears on the Register, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to
deliver such notice shall not affect the legality or validity of such
supplemental indenture.

      The above provisions of this Section 12.11 shall similarly apply to
successive recapitalizations, reclassifications, mergers, consolidations,
binding share exchanges, combinations, sales, leases or other transfers.

      Section 12.12. Responsibility of Trustee for Conversion Provisions. The
Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or
responsibility to any Holder of Securities to determine whether any facts exist
that may require any adjustment of the Conversion Price, or with respect to the
nature or intent of any such adjustments when made, or with respect to the
method employed, or herein or in any supplemental indenture provided to be
employed, in making the same. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall
be accountable with respect to the validity or value (of the kind or amount) of
any Common Stock, or of any other securities or property, that may at any time
be issued or delivered upon the conversion of any Security; and it or they do
not make any representation with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any
Conversion Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to make any
cash payment or to issue, transfer or deliver any shares of stock or share
certificates or other securities or property upon the surrender of any Security
for the purpose of conversion; and the Trustee and any Conversion Agent shall
not be responsible or liable for any failure of the Company to comply with any
of the covenants of the Company contained in this Article.


                                   ARTICLE 13
                           SUBORDINATION OF DEBENTURES

      Section 13.01. Agreement of Subordination. The Company covenants and
agrees, and each Holder of Securities issued hereunder by its acceptance thereof
likewise covenants and agrees, that all Securities shall be issued subject to
the provisions of this Article 13, and each Person holding any Securities,
whether upon original issue or upon registration of transfer, assignment or
exchange thereof, accepts and agrees to be bound by such provisions.

      The payment of the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on all
Securities (including, but not limited to, the Redemption Price, Repurchase
Price or Put Repurchase Price with respect to the Securities subject to
redemption or repurchase in accordance with Article 10 and Article 11 as
provided in this Indenture) issued hereunder shall, to the extent and in the
manner hereinafter set forth, be subordinated and subject in right of payment to
the prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, whether outstanding at the
date of this Indenture or thereafter incurred.


                                       85
<PAGE>

      No provision of this Article 13 shall prevent the occurrence of any
default or Event of Default hereunder or have any effect on the rights of the
Holders of the Debentures or the Trustee to accelerate the maturity of the
Securities.

      Section 13.02. Payments to Holders of Securities. No payment shall be made
with respect to the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities
(including, but not limited to, the Redemption Price, Repurchase Price or Put
Repurchase Price with respect to the Securities subject to redemption or
repurchase in accordance with Article 10 and Article 11, as provided in this
Indenture), except payments and distributions made by the Trustee as permitted
by the first paragraph of Section 13.05, if:

            (i) a default in the payment of principal, premium, if any,
      interest, rent or other obligations in respect of Designated Senior
      Indebtedness occurs and is continuing (or, in the case of Designated
      Senior Indebtedness for which there is a period of grace, in the event of
      such a default that continues beyond the period of grace, if any,
      specified in the instrument or lease evidencing such Designated Senior
      Indebtedness) (a "PAYMENT DEFAULT"); or

            (ii) a default, other than a Payment Default, on any Designated
      Senior Indebtedness occurs and is continuing that then permits holders of
      such Designated Senior Indebtedness to accelerate its maturity (or in the
      case of any lease that is Designated Senior Indebtedness, a default occurs
      and is continuing that permits the lessor to either terminate the lease or
      require the Company to make an irrevocable offer to terminate the lease
      following an event of default thereunder) and the Trustee receives a
      notice of the default (a "PAYMENT BLOCKAGE NOTICE") from a holder of
      Designated Senior Indebtedness or a Representative of Designated Senior
      Indebtedness (a "NON-PAYMENT DEFAULT").

      If the Trustee receives any Payment Blockage Notice pursuant to clause
(ii) above, no subsequent Payment Blockage Notice shall be effective for
purposes of this Section 13.02 unless and until at least 365 days shall have
elapsed since the initial effectiveness of the immediately prior Payment
Blockage Notice. No Non-Payment Default that existed or was continuing on the
date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be
made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice.

      The Company may and shall resume payments on any distributions in respect
of the Securities (including, but not limited to, the Redemption Price,
Repurchase Price or Put Repurchase Price with respect to the Securities to be
redeemed or repurchased) upon the earlier of:


                                       86
<PAGE>

            (1) in the case of a Payment Default, the date upon which any such
      Payment Default is cured or waived or ceases to exist, or

            (2) in the case of a Non-Payment Default, the earlier of (a) the
      date upon which such Non-Payment Default is cured or waived or ceases to
      exist or (b) 179 days after the date on which the applicable Payment
      Blockage Notice is received by the Trustee if the maturity of such
      Designated Senior Indebtedness has not been accelerated (or in the case of
      any lease, 179 days after notice is received if the Company has not
      received notice that the lessor under such lease has exercised its right
      to terminate the lease or require the Company to make an irrevocable offer
      to terminate the lease following an event of default thereunder), unless
      this Article 13 otherwise prohibits the payment or distribution at the
      time of such payment or distribution.

      Upon any payment by the Company, or distribution of assets of the Company
of any kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, to creditors
upon any dissolution or winding up or liquidation or reorganization of the
Company, whether voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership or other proceedings, all amounts due or to become due upon all
Senior Indebtedness shall first be paid in full in cash or other payment
satisfactory to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness before any payment is
made on account of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest (including
Liquidated Damages, if any) on the Securities, and upon any such dissolution or
winding up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company or bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership or other similar proceeding, any payment by the
Company, or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character,
whether in cash, property or securities, to which the Holders or the Trustee
would be entitled, except for the provisions of this Article 13, shall be paid
by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee,
agent or other Person making such payment or distribution, or by the Holders or
by the Trustee under this Indenture if received by them or it, directly to the
holders of Senior Indebtedness (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the
respective amounts of Senior Indebtedness held by such holders, or as otherwise
required by law or a court order) or their Representative or Representatives, as
their respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay all Senior
Indebtedness in full, in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or
distribution to or for the holders of Senior Indebtedness, before any payment or
distribution is made to the Holders or to the Trustee.


                                       87
<PAGE>

      For purposes of this Article 13, cash, property or securities shall not be
deemed to include shares of Common Stock of the Company as reorganized or
readjusted, or securities of the Company or any other corporation provided for
by a plan of reorganization or readjustment, the payment of which is
subordinated at least to the extent provided in this Article 13 with respect to
the Securities to the payment of all Senior Indebtedness which may at the time
be outstanding; provided that (i) the Senior Indebtedness is assumed by the new
corporation, if any, resulting from any reorganization or readjustment, and (ii)
the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness (other than leases which are
not assumed by the Company or the new corporation, as the case may be) are not,
without the consent of such holders, altered by such reorganization or
readjustment. The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company into, another corporation or the liquidation or dissolution of the
Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or
substantially as an entirety, to another Person upon the terms and conditions
provided for in Article 6 shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 13.02 if such
other Person shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or
transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article 6.

      In the event of the acceleration of the Securities because of an Event of
Default, no payment or distribution shall be made to the Trustee or any Holder
in respect of the principal of, premium, if any, or interest on the Securities
(including, but not limited to, the redemption price with respect to the
Securities called for redemption in accordance with Section 10.01 or submitted
for redemption in accordance with Section 11.01, as the case may be, as provided
in this Indenture), except payments and distributions made by the Trustee as
permitted by the first paragraph of Section 13.05, until all Senior Indebtedness
has been paid in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of
Senior Indebtedness or such acceleration is rescinded in accordance with the
terms of this Indenture. If payment of the Securities is accelerated because of
an Event of Default, the Company shall promptly notify holders of Senior
Indebtedness of the acceleration.

      In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provisions, any payment
or distribution of assets of the Company of any kind or character, whether in
cash, property or securities (including, without limitation, by way of setoff or
otherwise), prohibited by the foregoing provisions in this Section 13.02, shall
be received by the Trustee or the Holders before all Senior Indebtedness is paid
in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness, or provision is made for such payment thereof in accordance with
its terms in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of such Senior
Indebtedness, to the extent that the Trustee or any Holder has acquired notice,
by whatever means, that all Senior Indebtedness has not been paid in full, such
payment or distribution shall be held in trust for the benefit of and shall be
paid over or delivered to the holders of Senior Indebtedness or their
Representative or Representatives, as their respective interests may appear, as
calculated by the Company, for application to the payment of any Senior
Indebtedness remaining unpaid to the extent necessary to pay all Senior
Indebtedness in full in cash or other payment satisfactory to the holders of
such Senior Indebtedness, after giving effect to any concurrent payment or
distribution to or for the holders of such Senior Indebtedness.

      Nothing in this Section 13.02 shall apply to claims of, or payments to,
the Trustee under or pursuant to Section 5.08. This Section 13.02 shall be
subject to the further provisions of Section 13.05.

      Section 13.03. Subrogation. Subject to the payment in full of all Senior
Indebtedness, the rights of the Holders shall be subrogated to the extent of the
payments or distributions made to the holders of such Senior Indebtedness
pursuant to the provisions of this Article 13 (equally and ratably with the
holders of all Indebtedness of the Company which by its express terms is
subordinated to other Indebtedness of the Company to substantially the same
extent as the Securities are subordinated and is entitled to like rights of
subrogation) to the rights of the holders of Senior Indebtedness to receive
payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company
applicable to the Senior Indebtedness until the principal, premium, if any, and
interest on the Securities shall be paid in full, and, for the purposes of such
subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior
Indebtedness of any cash, property or securities to which the Holders or the
Trustee would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article 13, and no
payment pursuant to the provisions of this Article 13, to or for the benefit of
the holders of Senior Indebtedness by Holders or the Trustee, shall, as among
the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the
Holders, be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or on account of the Senior
Indebtedness, and no payments or distributions of cash, property or securities
to or for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to the subrogation provisions of
this Article 13, which would otherwise have been paid to the holders of Senior
Indebtedness, shall be deemed to be a payment by the Company to or for the
account of the Securities. It is understood that the provisions of this Article
13 are intended solely for the purposes of defining the relative rights of the
Holders, on the one hand, and the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, on the
other hand.

      Nothing contained in this Article 13 or elsewhere in this Indenture or in
the Securities is intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its
creditors other than the holders of Senior Indebtedness, and the Holders, the
obligation of the Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay to the
Holders the principal of, premium, if any, and interest on the Securities as and
when the same shall become due and payable in accordance with their terms, or is
intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the Holders and creditors of
the Company other than the holders of the Senior Indebtedness, nor shall
anything herein or therein prevent the Trustee or, subject to Section 4.06 and
Section 4.07, the Holder from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by
applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any,
under this Article 13 of the holders of Senior Indebtedness in respect of cash,
property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such
remedy.

      Upon any payment or distribution of assets of the Company referred to in
this Article 13, the Trustee and the Holders shall be entitled to rely upon any
order or decree made by any court of competent jurisdiction in which such
bankruptcy, dissolution, winding up, liquidation or reorganization proceedings
are pending, or a certificate of the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy,
liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or distribution,
delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders of the Debentures, for the purpose of
ascertaining the Persons entitled to participate in such distribution, the
holders of the Senior Indebtedness and other indebtedness of the Company, the
amount thereof or payable thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or to
this Article 13.

      Section 13.04. Authorization to Effect Subordination. Each Holder of a
Debenture by the Holder's acceptance thereof authorizes and directs the Trustee
on the Holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
effectuate the subordination as provided in this Article 13 and appoints the
Trustee to act as the Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes.
If the Trustee does not file a proper proof of claim or proof of debt in the
form required in any proceeding referred to in Section 4.09 hereof at least
thirty (30) days before the expiration of the time to file such claim, the
holders of any Senior Indebtedness or their Representatives are hereby
authorized to file an appropriate claim for and on behalf of the Holders.

      Section 13.05. Notice to Trustee. The Company shall give prompt written
notice in the form of an Officers' Certificate to a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee and to any Paying Agent of any fact known to the Company that would
prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by the Trustee or any Paying
Agent in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article
13. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Article 13 or any other provision of
this Indenture, the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence
of any facts that would prohibit the making of any payment of monies to or by
the Trustee in respect of the Securities pursuant to the provisions of this
Article 13, unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have
received written notice thereof at the Corporate Trust Office from the Company
(in the form of an Officers' Certificate) or a Representative or a holder or
holders of Senior Indebtedness, and before the receipt of any such written
notice, the Trustee shall be entitled in all respects to assume that no such
facts exist; provided, however, that if by the Business Day prior to the date
upon which by the terms hereof any such monies may become payable for any
purpose (including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of, or
premium, if any, or interest on any Security) the Trustee shall not have
received, with respect to such monies, the notice provided for in this Section
13.05, then, anything herein contained to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Trustee shall have full power and authority to apply monies received to the
purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to
the contrary that may be received by it on or after such prior date.


                                       90

      The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written
notice by a Representative or a person representing himself to be a holder of
Senior Indebtedness (or a trustee on behalf of such holder) to establish that
such notice has been given by a Representative or a holder of Senior
Indebtedness or a trustee on behalf of any such holder or holders. The Trustee
shall not be required to make any payment or distribution to or on behalf of a
holder of Senior Indebtedness pursuant to this Article 13 unless it has received
satisfactory evidence as to the amount of Senior Indebtedness held by such
Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such
payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such
Person under this Article 13.

      Section 13.06. Trustee's Relation to Senior Indebtedness. The Trustee, in
its individual capacity, shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this
Article 13 in respect of any Senior Indebtedness at any time held by it, to the
same extent as any other holder of Senior Indebtedness, and nothing in Section
5.12 or elsewhere in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee of any of its
rights as such holder.

      With respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness, the Trustee undertakes
to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are
specifically set forth in this Article 13, and no implied covenants or
obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Indebtedness shall be read
into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe
any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Indebtedness and the Trustee shall
not be liable to any holder of Senior Indebtedness (i) for any failure to make
any payments or distributions to such holder or (ii) if it shall pay over or
deliver money to Holders, the Company or any other Person in compliance with
this Article 13.

      Section 13.07. No Impairment of Subordination. No right of any present or
future holder of any Senior Indebtedness to enforce subordination as herein
provided shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or
failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in
good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the
terms, provisions and covenants of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge
thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. Senior
Indebtedness may be created, renewed or extended and holders of Senior
Indebtedness may exercise any rights under any instrument creating or evidencing
such Senior Indebtedness, including, without limitation, any waiver of default
thereunder, without any notice to or consent from the Holders of the Securities
or the Trustee. No compromise, alteration, amendment, modification, extension,
renewal or other change of, or waiver, consent or other action in respect of,
any liability or obligation under or in respect of the Senior Indebtedness or
any terms or conditions of any instrument creating or evidencing such Senior
Indebtedness shall in any way alter or affect any of the provisions of this
Article 13 or the subordination of the Securities provided thereby.

      Section 13.08. Certain Conversions Not Deemed Payment. For the purposes of
this Article 13 only, (1) the issuance and delivery of Junior Securities upon
conversion of Securities in accordance with Article 12 and (2) the payment,
issuance or delivery of cash, property or securities upon conversion of a
Security as a result of any transaction specified in Section 12.11 shall not be
deemed to constitute a payment or distribution on account of the principal of,
premium, if any, or interest on Securities or on account of the purchase or
other acquisition of Securities. For the purposes of this Section 13.08, the
term "JUNIOR SECURITIES" means (a) Common Stock of the Company or (b) securities
of the Company that are subordinated in right of payment to all Senior
Indebtedness that may be outstanding at the time of issuance or delivery of such
securities to substantially the same extent as, or to a greater extent than, the
Securities are so subordinated as provided in this Article 13. Nothing contained
in this Article 13 or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the Securities is
intended to or shall impair, as among the Company, its creditors (other than
holders of Senior Indebtedness) and the Security Holders, the right, which is
absolute and unconditional, of the Holder of any Security to convert such
Security in accordance with Article 12.

      Section 13.09. Article Applicable to Paying Agents. If at any time any
Paying Agent other than the Trustee shall have been appointed by the Company and
be then acting hereunder, the term "TRUSTEE" as used in this Article 13 shall
(unless the context otherwise requires) be construed as extending to and
including such Paying Agent within its meaning as fully for all intents and
purposes as if such Paying Agent were named in this Article 13 in addition to or
in place of the Trustee; provided, however, that the first paragraph of Section
13.05 shall not apply to the Company or any Affiliate of the Company if it or
such Affiliate acts as Paying Agent.

      The Trustee shall not be responsible for the actions or inactions of any
other Paying Agents (including the Company if acting as its own Paying Agent)
and shall have no control of any funds held by such other Paying Agents.

      Section 13.10. Senior Indebtedness Entitled to Rely. The holders of Senior
Indebtedness (including, without limitation, Designated Senior Indebtedness)
shall have the right to rely upon this Article 13, and no amendment or
modification of the provisions contained herein shall diminish the rights of
such holders unless such holders shall have agreed in writing thereto.

      Any notice or communication to a Holder shall be mailed by first-class
mail to his address shown on the Register kept by the Registrar. Failure to mail
a notice or communication to a Holder or any defect in such notice or
communication shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other Holders.

above within the time prescribed, it is duly given as of the date it is mailed,
whether or not the addressee receives it, except that notice to the Trustee
shall only be effective upon receipt thereof by the Trustee.


                                       93
<PAGE>

      If the Company mails a notice or communication to Holders, it shall mail a
copy to the Trustee at the same time.

      Section 14.03. Communication by Holders with Other Holders. Holders may
communicate pursuant to Section 312(b) of the TIA with other Holders with
respect to their rights under the Securities or this Indenture. The Company, the
Trustee, the Registrar and anyone else shall have the protection of Section
312(c) of the TIA.

      Section 14.04. Acts of Holders of Securities. (a) Any request, demand,
authorization, direction, notice, consent, waiver or other action provided by
this Indenture to be given or taken by Holders of Securities may be embodied in
and evidenced by:

            (1) one or more instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by
      such Holders in person or by agent or proxy duly appointed in writing;

            (2) the record of Holders of Securities voting in favor thereof,
      either in person or by proxies duly appointed in writing, at any meeting
      of Holders of Securities duly called and held in accordance with the
      provisions of Article 8; or

            (3) a combination of such instruments and any such record.

      Except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become
effective when such instrument or instruments or record or both are delivered to
the Trustee and, where it is hereby expressly required, to the Company. Such
instrument or instruments and record (and the action embodied therein and
evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "ACT" of the Holders
of Securities signing such instrument or instruments and so voting at such
meeting. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing appointing
any such agent or proxy, or of the holding by any Person of a Security, shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Indenture and (subject to Section 5.01
hereof) conclusive in favor of the Trustee and the Company if made in the manner
provided in this Section. The record of any meeting of Holders of Securities
shall be proved in the manner provided in Section 8.06 hereof.

      (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be provided in any manner that the Trustee reasonably
deems sufficient.


                                       94
<PAGE>

      (c) The principal amount and serial numbers of Securities held by any
Person, and the date of such Person holding the same, shall be proved by the
Register.

      (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
election, waiver or other Act of the Holders of any Security shall bind every
future Holder of the same Security and the Holder of every Security issued upon
the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof
in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or
the Company in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action is made
upon such Security.

      (e) The Company may, but is not obligated to, fix a record date (which
need not be within the time limits otherwise prescribed by Trust Indenture Act
Section 316(c)) for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to act with
respect to any amendment or waiver or in any other regard, except that during
the continuance of an Event of Default, only the Trustee may set a record date
as to notices of default, any declaration or acceleration or any other remedies
or other consequences of the Event of Default. If a record date is fixed, those
Persons that were Holders at such record date and only those Persons will be
entitled to act, or to revoke any previous act, whether or not those Persons
continue to be Holders after the record date. No act with respect to any
amendment or waiver or in any other regard under this Indenture will be
effective for more than 90 days after the record date for the taking of such
action.

      Section 14.05. Certificate and Opinion as to Conditions Precedent. In any
case where several matters are required to be certified by, or covered by an
opinion of, any specified Person, it is not necessary that all such matters be
certified by, or covered by the opinion of, only one such Person, or that they
be so certified or covered by only one document, but one such Person may certify
or give an opinion with respect to some matters and one or more other such
Persons as to other matters, and any such Person may certify or give an opinion
as to such matters in one or several documents.

      Any certificate or opinion of an officer of the Company may be based,
insofar as it relates to legal matters, upon an Opinion of Counsel, unless such
officer knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the
Opinion of Counsel with respect to the matters upon which such certificate or
opinion is based is erroneous. Any such Opinion of Counsel may be based, insofar
as it relates to factual matters, upon a certificate or representations by, an
officer or officers of the Company stating that the information with respect to
such factual matters is in the possession of the Company, unless such counsel
knows, or in the exercise of reasonable care should know, that the certificate
or representations with respect to such matters are erroneous.


                                       95

      Where any Person is required to make, give or execute two or more
applications, requests, consents, certificates, statements, opinions or other
instruments under this Indenture, they may, but need not, be consolidated and
form one instrument.

      Upon any application or request by the Company to the Trustee to take any
action under any provision of this Indenture, the Company shall furnish to the
Trustee an Officers' Certificate stating that all conditions precedent, if any,
provided for in this Indenture relating to the proposed action have been
complied with, except that in the case of any such application or request as to
which the furnishing of such document is specifically required by any provision
of this Indenture relating to such particular application or request, no
additional certificate need be furnished.

      Section 14.06. Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion. Each
certificate or opinion with respect to compliance with a condition or covenant
provided for in this Indenture shall include:

            (1) a statement that each individual signing such certificate or
      opinion on behalf of the Company has read such covenant or condition and
      the definitions herein relating thereto;

            (2) a brief statement as to the nature and scope of the examination
      or investigation upon which the statements or opinions contained in such
      certificate or opinion are based;

            (3) a statement that, in the opinion of each such individual, he has
      made such examination or investigation as is necessary to enable him to
      express an informed opinion as to whether or not such covenant or
      condition has been complied with; and

            (4) a statement as to whether, in the opinion of each such
      individual, such condition or covenant has been complied with.

      Section 14.07. Effect of Headings and Table of Contents. The Article and
Section headings herein and the Table of Contents are for convenience only and
shall not affect the construction hereof.

      Section 14.08. Successors and Assigns. All covenants and agreements in
this Indenture by the Company shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so
expressed or not.

      Section 14.09. Separability Clause. In case any provision in this
Indenture or the Securities shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the
validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in
any way be affected or impaired thereby.

      Section 14.10. Benefits of Indenture. Nothing contained in this Indenture
or in the Securities, express or implied, shall give to any Person, other than
the parties hereto and their successors hereunder, the holders of Senior
Indebtedness and the Holders of Securities, any benefit or legal or equitable
right, remedy or claim under this Indenture.

      Section 14.11. Governing Law. THIS INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK.

      Section 14.12. Counterparts. This instrument maybe executed in any number
of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be an
original but all such counterparts shall together constitute but one and the
same instrument.

      Section 14.13. Legal Holidays. In any case where any Interest Payment
Date, Redemption Date or Stated Maturity of any Security or the last day on
which a Holder of a Security has a right to convert such Security shall not be a
Business Day, then (notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture or of
the Securities) payment of interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) or
principal or conversion of the Securities, need not be made on such day, but may
be made on the next succeeding Business Day with the same force and effect as if
made on the Interest Payment Date or Redemption Date or at the Stated Maturity
or on such last day for conversion; provided, however, that in the case that
payment is made on such succeeding Business Day, no interest shall accrue on the
amount so payable for the period from and after such Interest Payment Date,
Redemption Date or Stated Maturity, as the case may be.

      Section 14.14. Recourse Against Others. No recourse for the payment of the
principal of or interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on any Security,
or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, shall be had
against any incorporator, shareholder, officer or director, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or of any successor corporation, whether by
virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance
thereof and as part of the consideration for the issue thereof, expressly waived
and released.

                            DOV PHARMACEUTICAL, INC.

                2.50% CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE DUE 2025

      Capitalized terms used herein but not defined shall have the meanings
assigned to them in the Indenture referred to below unless otherwise indicated.

      1. Principal and Interest. DOV Pharmaceutical, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "COMPANY"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of
this Security at the Interest Rate from the most recent date to which interest
has been paid or provided for, or if no interest has been paid or provided for,
from the Issue Date until repayment at Maturity, redemption or repurchase. The
Company shall pay interest on this Security semiannually in arrears on January
15 and July 15 of each year (each an "INTEREST PAYMENT DATE"), commencing July
15, 2005.

      Interest on this Security shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
of twelve 30-day months and for any period shorter than a full semiannual period
for which interest is calculated, on the basis of a 30-day month and, for such
periods of less than a month, the actual number of days elapsed over a 30-day
month.

      Subject to Section 2.17 of the Indenture, a Holder of any Security at the
close of business on a Regular Record Date shall be entitled to receive interest
on such Security on the corresponding Interest Payment Date. A Holder of any
Security that is converted after the close of business on a Regular Record Date
and prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date shall be entitled to
receive interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) on the principal amount
of such Security, notwithstanding the conversion of such Security prior to such
Interest Payment Date. However, any such Holder that surrenders any such
Security for conversion during the period between the close of business on such
Regular Record Date and ending with the opening of business on the corresponding
Interest Payment Date shall be required to pay the Company an amount equal to
the interest (excluding Liquidated Damages, if any) on the principal amount of
such Security so converted, that is payable by the Company to such Holder on
such Interest Payment Date, at the time such Holder surrenders such Security for
conversion. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Holder that surrenders for
conversion any Security (a) that has been called for redemption by the Company
in a notice of redemption given by the Company pursuant to Section 10.04 of the
Indenture on a Redemption Date that is after such Regular Record Date and on or
prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, (b) with respect to which
the Company has specified a Repurchase Date that is after such Regular Record
Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date or (c) on
which Defaulted Interest is payable at the time of conversion, but only to the
extent of such Defaulted Interest, need not make the payment referred to in the
preceding sentence. In either case described in clause (a) or clause (b) above,
such Holder shall be entitled to receive (and retain) the interest to be
received on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount of the Security
being surrendered for conversion.


                                       A-6
<PAGE>

      The Company shall pay Liquidated Damages in accordance with the terms of
the Registration Rights Agreement.

      If a Holder elects to convert some or all of its Securities into Common
Stock during a Registration Default, the Conversion Rate will increase by 3%.
Any amount of Liquidated Damages shall be payable semiannually, in arrears, on
each Interest Payment Date and shall cease to accrue on the earlier of (i) the
day after the end of the Shelf Registration Period (as defined in the
Registration Rights Agreement) and (ii) the date the Registration Default is
cured. The Holder of this Security is entitled to the benefits of the
Registration Rights Agreement.

      2. Method of Payment. Interest on any Security that is payable, and is to
be punctually paid or duly provided for, on any Interest Payment Date shall be
paid to the person in whose name that Security (or one or more Predecessor
Securities) is registered at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
for such interest.

      Principal of and interest on, Global Securities shall be payable to the
Depositary in immediately available funds.

      Principal of Physical Securities shall be payable at the office or agency
of the Company maintained for such purpose, initially the Corporate Trust Office
of the Trustee. Interest on Physical Securities shall be payable by (i) U.S.
Dollar check drawn on a bank located in the city where the Corporate Trust
Office of the Trustee is located mailed to the address of the Person entitled
thereto as such address shall appear in the Register, or (ii) upon application
to the Registrar not later than the relevant Record Date by a Holder of an
aggregate principal amount of Securities in excess of $5,000,000, wire transfer
in immediately available funds.

      3. Paying Agent and Registrar. Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, National
Association, the Trustee under the Indenture, will act as Paying Agent and
Registrar. The Company may change the Paying Agent or Registrar without notice
to any Holder.

      4. Indenture. The Company issued this Security under an Indenture, dated
as of December 22, 2004 (the "INDENTURE"), between the Company and Wells Fargo
Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "TRUSTEE"). The terms of this
Security include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the
Indenture by reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended ("TIA").
This Security is subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the
Indenture and the TIA for a statement of all such terms. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, in the event of any inconsistency between the terms of this
Security and the terms of the Indenture, the terms of the Indenture shall
control.


                                       A-7
<PAGE>

      5. Redemption of Securities. This Security is not redeemable prior to
January 15, 2008. On or after January 15, 2008, but before January 15, 2012, the
Securities may be redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part,
upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the Redemption Price,
plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any) to,
but excluding, the Redemption Date if the Last Reported Sale Price of the
Company's Common Stock has exceeded 140% of the Conversion Price for at least 20
Trading Days in any consecutive 30 Trading Day period ending on the Trading Day
prior to the date of mailing of the notice of redemption. In addition, on or
after January 20, 2012, this Security may be redeemed, at the option of the
Company, in whole or in part, upon not less than 30 nor more than 60 days'
notice, at the Redemption Price, plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including
Liquidated Damages, if any) to, but excluding, the Redemption Date, without
regard to the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock.

      If fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the Trustee shall
select the particular Securities to be redeemed from the Outstanding Securities
by the methods as provided in the Indenture. If any Security selected for
partial redemption is converted in part before termination of the conversion
right with respect to the portion of the Security so selected, the converted
portion of such Security shall be deemed to be the portion selected for
redemption (provided, however, that the Holder of such Security so converted and
deemed redeemed shall not be entitled to any additional interest payment as a
result of such deemed redemption than such Holder would have otherwise been
entitled to receive upon conversion of such Security). Securities that have been
converted during a selection of Securities to be redeemed may be treated by the
Trustee as Outstanding for the purpose of such selection.

      On and after the Redemption Date, interest shall cease to accrue on
Securities or portions of Securities called for redemption, unless the Company
defaults in the payment of the Redemption Price and any accrued and unpaid
interest.

      Notice of redemption shall be given by the Company to the Holders as
provided in the Indenture.

      6. Repurchase Rights.

            (a) Repurchase Right Upon a Fundamental Change. If a Fundamental
      Change occurs at any time prior to Maturity of the


                                       A-8
<PAGE>

      Securities, the Holder of Securities, at the Holder's option, shall have
      the right, in accordance with the provisions of the Indenture, to require
      the Company to repurchase the Securities (or any portion of the principal
      amount hereof that is at least $1,000 or a multiple thereof; provided,
      however, that the portion of the principal amount of this Security to be
      Outstanding after such repurchase is at least equal to $1,000) at a
      repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Securities
      to be repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid interest (including
      Liquidated Damages, if any) to, but excluding, the Repurchase Date (the
      "REPURCHASE PRICE"); provided, however, that if the Repurchase Date falls
      after a Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment
      Date, the Company shall pay the full amount of any accrued and unpaid
      interest (including Liquated Damages, if any) payable on such Interest
      Payment Date to the Holder of record at the close of business on the
      corresponding Record Date; provided, further, that installments of
      interest on Securities whose Stated Maturity is prior to or on the
      Repurchase Date shall be payable to the Holders of such Securities, or one
      or more Predecessor Securities, registered as such on the relevant Record
      Date according to their terms and the provisions of Section 2.01 of the
      Indenture.

      A Company Notice shall be given by the Company to the Holders as provided
in the Indenture. To exercise a Repurchase Right, a Holder must deliver to the
Trustee a Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice as provided in the Indenture.

            (b) Repurchase by the Company at the Option of the Holder. Subject
      to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, each Holder shall have the
      right to require the Company to repurchase all or a portion of their
      Securities on January 15, 2012, January 15, 2015 and January 15, 2020 (or,
      if any such date is not a Business Day, on the immediately succeeding
      Business Day) (each, a "PUT REPURCHASE DATE"), at 100% of the principal
      amount of the Securities to be so repurchased, plus any accrued and unpaid
      interest (including Liquidated Damages, if any), if any, to, but
      excluding, such Put Repurchase Date (the "PUT REPURCHASE PRICE");
      provided, however, that if the Put Repurchase Date falls after a Record
      Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the
      Company shall pay the full amount of any accrued and unpaid interest
      (including Liquated Damages, if any) payable on such Interest Payment Date
      to the Holder of record at the close of business on the corresponding
      Record Date. On or before the twenty-third (23rd) Business Day prior to
      each Put Repurchase Date, the Company shall provide to the Trustee, the
      Paying Agent and to all Holders at their respective addresses as shown on
      the Register, and to Beneficial Owners of the Securities where required by
      applicable law, a notice as provided in the Indenture. The Company will be
      required to repurchase only Securities with respect to which a Holder has
      delivered a Put Repurchase Notice in accordance with the terms and
      conditions of the Indenture and subject to the satisfaction of the other
      conditions set forth in the Indenture.


                                       A-9
<PAGE>

      7. Conversion Rights. (a) Subject to and upon compliance with the
provisions of the Indenture, the Holder of Securities shall be entitled, at such
Holder's option, at any time before the close of business on the Business Day
immediately preceding January 15, 2025, to convert the Holder's Securities (or
any portion of the principal amount hereof that is $1,000 or a multiple
thereof), at the principal amount thereof or of such portion thereof into duly
authorized, fully paid and nonassessable shares of Common Stock of the Company
at the Conversion Rate in effect at the time of conversion. In addition, the
Holder of Securities is entitled to receive Additional Shares upon conversion in
certain circumstances as more fully described in the Indenture. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if, at the time a Holder tenders Securities for conversion, there
exists a Registration Default, the Conversion Rate shall be increased by 3%.

            (b) In the case of a Security (or a portion thereof) called for
      redemption, such conversion right in respect of the Security (or such
      portion thereof) so called shall expire at the close of business on the
      Business Day immediately preceding the Redemption Date, unless the Company
      defaults in making the payment due upon redemption. If a Holder exercises
      its Repurchase Right or Put Repurchase Right with respect to a Security
      (or a portion thereof), such conversion right in respect of the Security
      (or portion thereof) shall expire at the close of business on the Business
      Day preceding the Repurchase Date or Put Repurchase Date, as applicable.

            (c) Each $1,000 principal amount of the Securities shall initially
      be convertible into 43.9560 shares of Common Stock (referred to as the
      "CONVERSION RATE"). The Conversion Price shall be initially equal to
      approximately $22.75 per share of Common Stock. The Conversion Rate shall
      be adjusted under certain circumstances as provided in the Indenture.

            (d) Subject to subsection (b) above, regardless of anything else
      contained herein, Holders may surrender their Securities for conversion
      into shares of the Company's Common Stock at any time prior to the close
      of business on the Business Day immediately preceding January 15, 2025.

            (e) To exercise the conversion right, the Holder must surrender the
      Security (or portion thereof) duly endorsed or assigned to the Company or
      in blank, at the office of the Conversion Agent, accompanied by a duly
      signed conversion notice to the Company. Any Security


                                       A-10
<PAGE>

      surrendered for conversion during the period between the close of business
      on any Regular Record Date and the opening of business on the
      corresponding Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by payment of an
      amount equal to the accrued and unpaid interest (excluding Liquidated
      Damages, if any) payable on such Interest Payment Date by the Company on
      the principal amount of the Security being surrendered for conversion.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing, any such Holder that surrenders for
      conversion any Security (i) that has been called for redemption by the
      Company in a notice of redemption given by the Company pursuant to Section
      10.04 of the Indenture on a Redemption Date after such Regular Record Date
      and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, (ii) with
      respect to which the Company has specified a Repurchase Date that is after
      such Regular Record Date and on or prior to the next succeeding Interest
      Payment Date or (iii) only to the extent of overdue interest, if any
      overdue interest exists on Conversion Date, in any such case, need not pay
      the Company an amount equal to the interest on the principal amount of
      such Security so converted at the time such Holder surrenders such
      Security for conversion.

            (f) No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
      conversion of any Securities. Instead of any fractional share of Common
      Stock that would otherwise be issued upon conversion of such Securities,
      the Company shall pay a cash adjustment as provided in the Indenture.

      8. Subordination. The Indebtedness evidenced by this Security is, to the
extent and in the manner provided in the Indenture, subordinated and subject in
right of payment to the prior payment in full of all amounts then due on all
Senior Indebtedness of the Company. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting
the same, (a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes
and directs the Trustee on such Holder's behalf to take such action as may be
necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination so provided and (c)
appoints the Trustee such Holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such
purposes.

      9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange. The Securities are issuable in
registered form, without interest coupons, in denominations of $1,000 principal
amount and whole multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof. A Holder may register
the transfer or exchange of Securities in accordance with the Indenture. The
Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents and the Company may require a Holder to pay
any taxes and fees required by law or permitted by the Indenture.

      In the event of a redemption in part, neither the Company nor the
Registrar shall be required to issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any
certificated Securities during the period of 15 days immediately preceding the
mailing of the redemption notice.


                                       A-11
<PAGE>

      In the event of redemption, conversion or repurchase of the Securities in
part only, a new Security or Securities for the unredeemed, unconverted or
unpurchased portion thereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof.

      10. Persons Deemed Owners. The registered Holder of this Security shall be
treated as its owner for all purposes.

      11. Unclaimed Money. The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the
Company any money held by them for the payment of principal or interest that
remains unclaimed for two years after the date upon which such payment shall
have become due. After payment to the Company, Holders entitled to the money
must look to the Company for payment as general creditors unless an applicable
abandoned property law designates another Person, and all liability of the
Trustee and the Paying Agent with respect to such money shall cease.

      12. [Reserved]

      13. Amendment; Supplement; Waiver. The Indenture permits, with certain
exceptions as therein provided, the amendment thereof and the modification of
the rights and obligations of the Company and the rights of the Holders of the
Securities under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with
the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Outstanding Securities (or such lesser amount as shall have acted at a meeting
pursuant to the provisions of the Indenture). The Indenture also contains
provisions permitting the Holders of specified percentages in principal amount
of the Securities at the time Outstanding, on behalf of the Holders of all the
Securities, to waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the

            "underwriter" shall mean any underwriter of Registrable Securities

Shelf Registration Statement providing for the registration of, and the sale on
a continuous or delayed basis by the Holders of, all of the Registrable
Securities, from time to time in accordance with the methods of distribution
elected by such Holders, pursuant to Rule 415 under the Act or any similar rule
that may be adopted by the Commission.

            (b) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective under the Act as
promptly as practicable (but in no event more than 240 days after the Closing
Date).

            (c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to keep the
Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective, supplemented and amended as
required by the Act, in order to permit the Prospectus forming part thereof to
be usable by Holders for a period (the "Shelf Registration Period") from the
date the Shelf Registration Statement is declared effective by the Commission
until the earlier of (i) the date upon which there are no Registrable Securities
outstanding, (ii) the date as of which all the Registrable Securities have been
sold either under Rule 144 under the Act (or any similar provision then in
force) or pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, or (iii) the date on
which all Registrable Securities held by non-Affiliates are eligible to be sold
to the public pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the Act or any successor provision.

            (d) The Company shall cause the Shelf Registration Statement and the
related Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, as of the effective
date of the Shelf Registration Statement or such amendment or supplement, (i) to
comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of the Act; and
(ii) not to contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the
statements therein (in the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the
circumstances under which they were made) not misleading.

            (e) At the time the Shelf Registration Statement is declared to be
effective, each Holder that became a Notice Holder on or prior to the tenth
Business Day prior to such time of effectiveness shall be named as a selling
securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus in
such a manner as to permit such Holder to deliver such Prospectus to purchasers
of Registrable Securities in accordance with applicable law, subject to the
terms and conditions hereof. Following the date that the Shelf Registration
Statement is declared effective, each Holder that is not a Notice Holder wishing
to sell Registrable Securities pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and
related Prospectus agrees to deliver a Notice and Questionnaire (and such other
information as is required by Section 3(l)) to the Company prior to any intended
distribution by it of Registrable Securities under the Shelf Registration
Statement. From and after the date the Shelf Registration Statement is declared
effective and during the


                                       4
<PAGE>

Shelf Registration Period (but excluding any Deferral Period), the Company shall
as promptly as is reasonably practicable after the date a Notice and
Questionnaire (and such other information as is required by Section 3(l)) is
delivered, and in any event within the later of (x) 15 Business Days after such
date or (y) 15 Business Days after the expiration of any Deferral Period in
effect when the Notice and Questionnaire (and such other information as is
required by Section 3(l)) is delivered, file a supplement to the Shelf
Registration Statement and related Prospectus as is necessary and permitted to
name such Holder as a selling securityholder or if not permitted to name such
Holder as a selling securityholder by supplement, file any necessary
post-effective amendments to the Shelf Registration Statement or prepare and, if
required by applicable law, file an amendment or supplement to any document
incorporated by reference or file any other required document so that such
Holder is named as selling securityholder, and use its reasonable best efforts
to cause such post-effective amendment to be declared effective under the Act as
promptly as practicable, but in no event later than the date (the "Amendment
Effectiveness Deadline Date") that is 45 days after the date such post-effective
amendment is required to be filed; provided that the Company shall not be
obligated to file more than one post-effective amendment in any 60-day period.
In connection with such filing, the Company agrees to:

                  (i) provide such Holder copies of any documents filed pursuant
            to Section 2(e) hereof; and

                  (ii) notify such Holder as promptly as reasonably practicable
            after the effectiveness under the Act of any post-effective
            amendment filed pursuant to Section 2(e) hereof.

Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, the Company shall be
under no obligation to name any Holder that is not a Notice Holder as a selling
securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or related Prospectus;
provided, however, that any Holder that becomes a Notice Holder pursuant to the
provisions of this Section 2(e) (whether or not such Holder was a Notice Holder
at the time the Shelf Registration Statement was declared effective) shall be
named as a selling securityholder in the Shelf Registration Statement or related
Prospectus in accordance with the requirements of this Section 2(e).

            3. Registration Procedures. The following provisions shall apply in
connection with the Shelf Registration Statement.

            (a) The Company shall:

                  (i) furnish to the Representatives and to the Special Counsel,
            not less than five Business Days (or three Business Days for
            documents to be filed pursuant to Section 2(e) hereof) prior to the
            filing with the Commission a copy of the Shelf Registration
            Statement and each amendment thereof and each amendment or
            supplement, if any, to the Prospectus included therein (excluding
            all documents incorporated by reference therein after the initial
            filing, unless specifically requested in writing) and shall use its
            reasonable best efforts to reflect in each such document, when so
            filed with the Commission, such comments as the Representatives
            reasonably propose; and


                                       5
<PAGE>

                  (ii) include information regarding the Notice Holders and the
            methods of distribution they have elected for their Registrable
            Securities provided to the Company in Notices and Questionnaires as
            necessary to permit such distribution by the methods specified
            therein.

            (b) The Company shall give notice to the Representatives, the Notice
Holders and, subject to Section 6 hereof, any underwriter that has provided in
writing to the Company a telephone or facsimile number and address for notices,
and confirm such advice by notice in writing (which notice pursuant to clauses
(ii)-(v) hereof shall be accompanied by an instruction to suspend the use of the
Prospectus until the Company shall have remedied the basis for such suspension):

                  (i) when the Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment
            thereto has been filed with the Commission and when the Shelf
            Registration Statement or any post-effective amendment thereto has
            become effective;

                  (ii) of any request by the Commission for any amendment or
            supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus or
            for additional information;

                  (iii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order
            suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement or
            the institution of any proceeding for that purpose;

                  (iv) of the receipt by the Company of any notification with
            respect to the suspension of the qualification of the Registrable
            Securities included therein for sale in any jurisdiction or the
            institution of any proceeding for such purpose; and

                  (v) of the happening of any event that requires any change in
            the Shelf Registration Statement or the Prospectus so that, as of
            such date, they (A) do not contain any untrue statement of a
            material fact and (B) do not omit to state a material fact required
            to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein (in
            the case of the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under
            which they were made) not misleading.

      (c) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to prevent the
issuance of any order suspending the effectiveness of the Shelf Registration
Statement or the qualification of the securities therein for sale in any
jurisdiction, and if issued, to obtain as soon as reasonably possible the
withdrawal thereof.

      (d) The Company shall furnish to each Notice Holder, without charge, at
least one copy of the Shelf Registration Statement and any post-effective
amendment thereto, and, if a Notice Holder so requests in writing, all material
incorporated therein by reference and all exhibits thereto (including exhibits
incorporated by reference therein).

      (e) During the Shelf Registration Period, the Company shall promptly
deliver to each Initial Purchaser, each Notice Holder, and, subject to Section 6
hereof, any sales or placement agents or underwriters acting on their behalf,
without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus (including the preliminary
Prospectus) included in the Shelf Registration Statement and any amendment or
supplement thereto as any such person may reasonably request. The Company
consents to the use of the Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto by
each of the foregoing in connection with the offering and sale of the
Registrable Securities in the manner set forth therein (except during any
Deferral Period, as defined below).


                                       6
<PAGE>

      (f) Prior to any offering of Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement, the Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to
arrange for the qualification of the Registrable Securities for sale under the
laws of such jurisdictions as any Notice Holder shall reasonably request and
shall use its reasonable best efforts to maintain such qualification in effect
for so long as required; provided that in no event shall the Company be
obligated to qualify to do business in any jurisdiction where it is not then so
qualified or to take any action in connection therewith that would subject it to
taxation or service of process in suits, other than those arising out of the
Initial Placement, in any jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.

      (g) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by subsections (b)(ii)
through (v) above, the Company shall as promptly as reasonably practicable (or
within the time period provided for by Section 3(h) hereof, if applicable)
prepare a post-effective amendment to the Shelf Registration Statement or an
amendment or supplement to the related Prospectus or file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of the securities
included therein, the Prospectus will not include an untrue statement of a
material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made, not misleading.

      (h) The Company may suspend each Holder's use of the Shelf Registration
and any Prospectus for a maximum of 45 days in any 90-day period, and not to
exceed an aggregate of 90 days in any 12 month period, if (i) the Company, in
its reasonable judgment, believes it may possess material non-public information
the disclosure of which would be seriously detrimental to the Company and its
subsidiaries taken as a whole or (ii) the Shelf Registration Statement and any
Prospectus would, in the Company's judgment, contain a material misstatement or
omission as a result of an event that has occurred or is continuing. However, if
the disclosure relates to a proposed or pending material business transaction,
the disclosure of which the Company determines in good faith would be reasonably
likely to impede its ability to consummate such transaction, or would otherwise
be seriously detrimental to the Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole,
the Company may extend the suspension period from 45 days to 60 days. Any
suspension period described in this Section 3(h) shall be referred to herein as
the "Deferral Period." The Company shall give notice to the Notice Holders that
the availability of the Shelf Registration is suspended and upon notice duly
given pursuant to Section 10 hereof, each Notice Holder agrees not to sell any
Registrable Securities pursuant to the Shelf Registration until such Notice
Holder's receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided
for in Section 3(h) hereof, or until it is advised in writing by the Company
that the Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in such Prospectus. The Company need not specify the nature of the event giving
rise to a suspension in any notice to holders of the Securities of the existence
of such a suspension.


                                       7
<PAGE>

      (i) Not later than the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement,
the Company shall provide a CUSIP number for the Registrable Securities
registered under the Shelf Registration Statement and, if required, provide the
Trustee with printed certificates for such Securities, free of any restrictive
legends, in a form eligible for deposit with The Depository Trust Company.

      (j) The Company shall comply with all applicable rules and regulations of
the Commission and shall make generally available to its security holders an
earnings statement satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act as soon
as practicable after the effective date of the Shelf Registration Statement and
in any event no later than 45 days after the end of a 12-month period (or 90
days, if such period is a fiscal year) beginning with the first month of the
Company's first fiscal quarter commencing after the effective date of the Shelf
Registration Statement.

      (k) The Company shall cause the Indenture to be qualified under the Trust
Indenture Act in a timely manner.

      (l) The Company may require each Holder of Registrable Securities to be
sold pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement to deliver to the Company a
completed and executed Notice and Questionnaire and to furnish to the Company
such other information regarding the Holder and the distribution of such
Registrable Securities as the Company may from time to time reasonably require
for inclusion in the Shelf Registration Statement. The Company may exclude (i)
from the initial Shelf Registration Statement the Registrable Securities of any
Holder that fails to return a completed and executed Notice and Questionnaire
and fails to furnish such other information no later than ten Business Days
before the initial effectiveness of the Shelf Registration Statement and (ii)
from any post-effective amendment or supplement the Registrable Securities of
any Holder that fails to return a completed and executed Notice and
Questionnaire and fails to furnish such other information no later than 15
Business Days before the date of filing any post-effective amendment or
supplement to the Shelf Registration Statement contemplated by Section 2(e)(i),
as applicable.

      (m) Subject to the provisions of Section 6 hereof, the Company shall enter
into customary agreements (including, if requested, an underwriting agreement in
customary form, including customary indemnification provisions and procedures)
and take all other appropriate actions as reasonably requested by the Notice
Holders in order to expedite or facilitate the registration or the disposition
of the Registrable Securities.

      (n) The Company shall (subject to reasonable confidentiality restrictions
as may be requested by the Company):

                  (i) make reasonably available for inspection during normal
            business hours by the Notice Holders of Registrable Securities to be
            registered thereunder, any underwriter participating in any
            disposition pursuant to the Shelf Registration Statement, and any
            attorney, accountant or other agent retained by the Holders or any
            such underwriter all relevant financial and other records and
            pertinent corporate documents of the Company and its subsidiaries;


                                       8
<PAGE>

                  (ii) cause the Company's officers, directors, employees,
            accountants and auditors to supply all relevant information
            reasonably requested by the Notice Holders or any such underwriter,
            attorney, accountant or agent in connection with any the Shelf
            Registration Statement as is customary for similar due diligence
            examinations; provided that the inspection and information gathering
            pursuant to clause (i) and (ii) shall be coordinated by a single
            party (or a single counsel (which shall be the Special Counsel) on
            behalf of the parties so inspecting and gathering);

                  (iii) make such representations and warranties to the Holders
            of Registrable Securities registered thereunder and the underwriters
            in form, substance and scope as are customarily made by issuers to
            underwriters in primary underwritten offerings;

                  (iv) obtain opinions of counsel to the Company and updates
            thereof (which counsel and opinions (in form, scope and substance)
            shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Managing Underwriters, if
            any) addressed to each selling Holder, if reasonably requested, and
            the underwriters, if any, covering such matters as are customarily
            covered in opinions requested in underwritten offerings and such
            other matters as may be reasonably requested by such Holders and
            underwriters;

                  (v) obtain "comfort" letters and updates thereof from the
            independent certified public accountants of the Company (and, if
            necessary, any other independent certified public accountants of any
            subsidiary of the Company or of any business acquired by the Company
            for which financial statements and financial data are, or are
            required to be, included in the Shelf Registration Statement),
            addressed to the underwriters, if any, in customary form and
            covering matters of the type customarily covered in "comfort"
            letters in connection with primary underwritten offerings; and

                  (vi) deliver such documents and certificates as may be
            reasonably requested by the Majority Holders or the Managing
            Underwriters, if any, including those to evidence compliance with
            any customary conditions contained in the underwriting agreement or
            other agreement entered into by the Company.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the actions set forth in clauses (iii), (iv), (v)
and (vi) of this paragraph (n) shall only be performed in connection with an
underwritten offering pursuant to Section 6 hereof and only if requested by the
underwriters thereof.

            (o) The Company shall cooperate and assist in any filings required
to be made with the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. (the
"NASD") and in the performance of any due diligence investigation by any
underwriter that is required to be retained in accordance with the rules and
regulations of the NASD.

            (p) The Company shall upon (i) the filing of the initial Shelf
Registration Statement and (ii) the effectiveness of the initial Shelf
Registration Statement, announce the same, in each case by release to the PR
Newswire. Notwithstanding Section 10 hereof, the making of the announcement as
set forth in this Section 3(p) shall be deemed to satisfy the notice
requirements of Section 3(b)(i) hereof with respect to the filing or
effectiveness of the initial Shelf Registration Statement.


                                       9
<PAGE>

            (q) The Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such
other steps as are necessary to effect the registration of the Registrable
Securities for resales under the Act.

            4. Registration Expenses. The Company shall bear all expenses
incurred in connection with the performance of its obligations under Sections 2
and 3 hereof and shall reimburse the Holders for the reasonable fees and
disbursements of one firm or counsel (which shall be the Special Counsel) to act
as counsel for the Holders in connection therewith. The Holders will bear their
individual selling expenses, including commissions and discounts and transfer
taxes.

            5. Indemnification and Contribution. (a) The Company agrees to
indemnify and hold harmless each Holder of Registrable Securities covered by the
Shelf Registration Statement, each Initial Purchaser, the directors, officers,
employees, Affiliates and agents of each such Holder or Initial Purchaser and
each person who controls any such Holder or Initial Purchaser within the meaning
of either the Act or the Exchange Act against any and all losses, claims,
damages or liabilities, joint or several, to which they or any of them may
become subject under the Act, the Exchange Act or other federal or state
statutory law or regulation, at common law or otherwise, insofar as such losses,
claims, damages or liabilities (or actions in respect thereof) arise out of or
are based upon any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of a material
fact contained in the Shelf Registration Statement or in any amendment thereof,
in each case at the time such became effective under the Act, or in any
preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any amendment thereof or
supplement thereto, or arise out of or are based upon the omission or alleged
omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein (in the case of any preliminary
Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made) not misleading, and agrees to reimburse each such indemnified party,
as incurred, for any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by it in
connection with investigating or defending any such loss, claim, damage,
liability or action; provided, however, that the Company will not be liable in
any such case to the extent that any such loss, claim, damage or liability
arises out of or is based upon any such untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission made therein in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by or on behalf of
the party claiming indemnification specifically for inclusion therein. This
indemnity agreement shall be in addition to any liability that the Company may
otherwise have.

            (b) Each Holder of securities covered by the Shelf Registration
Statement (including each Initial Purchaser that is a Holder, in such capacity)
severally and not jointly agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Company,
each of its directors, each of its officers who signs the Shelf Registration
Statement and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either
the Act or the Exchange Act, to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from
the Company to each such Holder, but only with reference to written information
relating to such Holder furnished to the Company by or on behalf of such Holder
specifically for inclusion in the documents referred to in the foregoing
indemnity. This indemnity agreement shall be acknowledged by each Notice Holder
that is not an Initial Purchaser in such Notice Holder's Notice and
Questionnaire and shall be in addition to any liability that any such Notice
Holder may otherwise have.


                                       10
<PAGE>

            (c) Promptly after receipt by an indemnified party under this
Section 5 or notice of the commencement of any action, such indemnified party
will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against the indemnifying party
under this Section 5, notify the indemnifying party in writing of the
commencement thereof; but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party (i)
will not relieve it from liability under paragraph (a) or (b) above unless and
to the extent it did not otherwise learn of such action and such failure results
in the forfeiture by the indemnifying party of substantial rights and defenses;
and (ii) will not, in any event, relieve the indemnifying party from any
obligations to any indemnified party other than the indemnification obligation
provided in paragraph (a) or (b) above. The indemnifying party shall be entitled
to appoint counsel (including local counsel) of the indemnifying party's choice
at the indemnifying party's expense to represent the indemnified party in any
action for which indemnification is sought (in which case the indemnifying party
shall not thereafter be responsible for the fees and expenses of any separate
counsel, other than local counsel if not appointed by the indemnifying party,
retained by the indemnified party or parties except as set forth below);
provided, however, that such counsel shall be satisfactory to the indemnified
party. Notwithstanding the indemnifying party's election to appoint counsel
(including local counsel) to represent the indemnified party in an action, the
indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate counsel (including
local counsel), and the indemnifying party shall bear the reasonable fees, costs
and expenses of such separate counsel if (i) the use of counsel chosen by the
indemnifying party to represent the indemnified party would present such counsel
with a conflict of interest; (ii) the actual or potential defendants in, or
targets of, any such action include both the indemnified party and the
indemnifying party and the indemnified party shall have reasonably concluded
that there may be legal defenses available to it and/or other indemnified
parties that are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party; (iii) the indemnifying party shall not have employed counsel
satisfactory to the indemnified party to represent the indemnified party within
a reasonable time after notice of the institution of such action; or (iv) the
indemnifying party shall authorize the indemnified party to employ separate
counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party. An indemnifying party will
not, without the prior written consent of the indemnified parties, settle or
compromise or consent to the entry of any judgment with respect to any pending
or threatened claim, action, suit or proceeding in respect of which
indemnification or contribution may be sought hereunder (whether or not the
indemnified parties are actual or potential parties to such claim or action)
unless such settlement, compromise or consent includes an unconditional release
of each indemnified party from all liability arising out of such claim, action,
suit or proceeding.

            (d) In the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph (a) or (b)
of this Section 5 is unavailable to or insufficient to hold harmless an
indemnified party for any reason, then each applicable indemnifying party shall
have a joint and several obligation to contribute to the aggregate losses,
claims, damages and liabilities (including legal or other expenses reasonably
incurred in connection with investigating or defending loss, claim, liability,
damage or action) (collectively "Losses") to which such indemnified party may be
subject in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits
received by such indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified
party, on the other hand, from the Initial Placement and


                                       11
<PAGE>

the Shelf Registration Statement which resulted in such Losses; provided,
however, that in no case shall any Initial Purchaser be responsible, in the
aggregate, for any amount in excess of the purchase discount or commission
applicable to such Security received by such Initial Purchaser in connection
with the Initial Placement, nor shall any underwriter be responsible for any
amount in excess of the underwriting discount or commission applicable to the
securities purchased by such underwriter under the Shelf Registration Statement
which resulted in such Losses. If the allocation provided by the immediately
preceding sentence is unavailable for any reason, the indemnifying party and the
indemnified party shall contribute in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only such relative benefits but also the relative fault of such
indemnifying party, on the one hand, and such indemnified party, on the other
hand, in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such
Losses as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. Benefits received
by the Company shall be deemed to be equal to the total net proceeds from the
Initial Placement (before deducting expenses) as set forth in the Final
Memorandum. Benefits received by the Initial Purchasers shall be deemed to be
equal to the total purchase discounts and commissions received in connection
with the Initial Placement, and benefits received by any other Holders shall be
deemed to be equal to the value of receiving Securities registered under the
Act. Benefits received by any underwriter shall be deemed to be equal to the
total underwriting discounts and commissions, as set forth on the cover page of
the Prospectus forming a part of the Shelf Registration Statement which resulted
in such Losses. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to, among other
things, whether any untrue or any alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information
provided by the indemnifying party, on the one hand, or by the indemnified
party, on the other hand, the intent of the parties and their relative
knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such
untrue statement or omission. The parties agree that it would not be just and
equitable if contribution were determined by pro rata allocation (even if the
Holders were treated as one entity for such purpose) or any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred
to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph (d), no person guilty
of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the Act)
shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty of such
fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section 5, each person who
controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act and
each director, officer, employee and agent of such Holder shall have the same
rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company
within the meaning of either the Act or the Exchange Act, each officer of the
Company who shall have signed the Shelf Registration Statement and each director
of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company,
subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph
(d).

            (e) The provisions of this Section 5 shall remain in full force and
effect, regardless of any investigation made by or on behalf of any Holder or
the Company or any of the indemnified persons referred to in this Section 5, and
shall survive the sale by a Holder of Registrable Securities covered by the
Shelf Registration Statement.

            6. Underwritten Registrations. (a) Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary in this Agreement, the Registrable Securities may be sold in an
underwritten offering only with the consent of the Company, and, in such event,
the Managing Underwriters shall be selected by the Majority Holders and shall be
reasonably acceptable to the Company.


                                       12

            (b) No person may participate in any underwritten offering pursuant
to the Shelf Registration Statement unless such person (i) agrees to sell such
person's Registrable Securities on the basis reasonably provided in any
underwriting arrangements approved by the persons entitled hereunder to approve
such arrangements; (ii) completes and executes all questionnaires, powers of
attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other documents reasonably
required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements; and (iii) agrees to
be responsible for their individual selling expenses, including commissions and
discounts and transfer taxes.

            7. Registration Defaults. (a) If:

                  (i) the Shelf Registration Statement is not filed with the
            Commission on or prior to the 100th day following the Closing Date;
            or

                  (ii) the Shelf Registration Statement is not declared
            effective by the Commission on or prior to the 240th day following
            the Closing Date; or

                  (iii) the Company has failed to perform its obligations set
            forth in Section 2(e) within the time required therein; or

                  (iv) any post-effective amendment to a Shelf Registration
            Statement filed pursuant to Section 2(e) has not become effective
            under the Securities Act on or prior to the Amendment Effectiveness
            Deadline Date; or

                  (v) the aggregate duration of Deferral Periods in any period
            exceeds the number of days permitted in respect of such period
            pursuant to Section 3(i) hereof (in each case except as the result
            of filing a post-effective amendment solely to add additional
            selling securityholders);

(each such event referred to in the foregoing clauses (i) through (v), a
"Registration Default"), the Company hereby agrees to pay liquidated damages
("Liquidated Damages") with respect to the Registrable Securities that are
Securities from and including the day following the Registration Default to but
excluding the earlier of (1) the day after the end of the Shelf Registration
Period and (2) the day on which the Registration Default has been cured:

                        (A) with respect to the first 90-day period during which
                  a Registration Default shall have occurred and be continuing,
                  in an amount per year equal to an additional 0.25% of the
                  principal amount of the Registrable Securities; and

                        (B) with respect to the period commencing on the 91st
                  day following the day the Registration Default shall have
                  occurred and be continuing, in an amount per year equal to an
                  additional 0.50% of the principal amount of the Registrable
                  Securities;

provided, however, that in no event shall Liquidated Damages accrue at a rate
per year exceeding 0.50% of the principal amount of the Securities. For the
avoidance of doubt, Holders of Registrable Securities that are shares of Common
Stock shall not be entitled to Liquidated Damages.


                                       13
<PAGE>

            (b) All accrued Liquidated Damages shall be paid in arrears to
Record Holders by the Company on each Damages Payment Date by wire transfer of
immediately available funds or by federal funds check. Following the cure of all
Registration Defaults relating to any particular Registrable Securities, the
accrual of Liquidated Damages with respect to such Registrable Securities will
cease.

      All obligations of the Company set forth in this Section 7 that are
outstanding with respect to any Registrable Securities at the time such security
ceases to be a Registrable Security shall survive until such time as all such
obligations with respect to such Registrable Security shall have been satisfied
in full.

      The parties hereto agree that the Liquidated Damages provided for in this
Section 7 constitute a reasonable estimate of the damages that may be incurred
by Holders of Registrable Securities by reason of a Registration Default and
that such Liquidated Damages are the only monetary damages available to such
Holders with respect to a Registration Default.

            8. No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company has not entered into, and
agrees not to enter into, any agreement with respect to its securities that is
inconsistent with the rights granted to the Holders herein or that otherwise
conflicts with the provisions hereof.

            9. Amendments and Waivers. The provisions of this Agreement may not
be amended, qualified, modified or supplemented, and waivers or consents to
departures from the provisions hereof may not be given, unless the Company has
obtained the written consent of the Holders of a majority of the then
outstanding shares of Common Stock constituting Registrable Securities (with
Holders of Securities deemed to be Holders, for purposes of this Section, of the
number of outstanding shares of Common Stock into which such Securities would be
convertible as of the date on which such consent is requested); provided that,
with respect to any matter that adversely affects the rights of any Initial
Purchaser hereunder, the Company shall obtain the written consent of each such
Initial Purchaser against which such amendment, qualification, supplement,
waiver or consent is to be effective; provided, further, that no amendment,
qualification, supplement, waiver or consent with respect to Section 7 hereof
shall be effective as against any Holder of Registered Securities unless
consented to in writing by such Holder; and provided, further, that the
provisions of this Article 9 may not be amended, qualified, modified or
supplemented, and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions hereof
may not be given, unless the Company has obtained the written consent of the
Initial Purchasers and each Holder.

            10. Notices. All notices, requests and other communications provided
for or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing by hand-delivery,
first-class mail, telex, facsimile or air courier guaranteeing overnight
delivery:

            (a) if to a Holder, at the most current address given by such holder
to the Company in accordance with the provisions of the Notice and
Questionnaire, which address initially is, with respect to each Holder, the
address of such Holder maintained by the Registrar under the Indenture;


                                       14
<PAGE>

            (b) if to the Initial Purchasers or the Representatives, initially
at the address or addresses set forth in the Purchase Agreement; and

            (c) if to the Company, initially at its address set forth in the
Purchase Agreement.

            All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been
duly given on the earliest of (i) at the time delivered, if delivered by
hand-delivery; (ii) three business days after being deposited in the mail,
postage prepaid, if mailed by first-class mail; (iii) when receipt is
acknowledged and confirmed as sent by sender's telex or facsimile machine, if
sent by telex or facsimile transmission; and (iv) on the day delivered, if sent
by overnight air courier guaranteeing next day delivery.

            The Initial Purchasers or the Company by notice to the other parties
may designate additional or different addresses for subsequent notices or
communications.

            11. Remedies. Each party, in addition to being entitled to exercise
all rights provided to it herein, in the Indenture or in the Purchase Agreement
or granted by law, including recovery of liquidated or other damages, will be
entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. Each party
agrees that monetary damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss
incurred by reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Agreement and
hereby agrees to waive in any action for specific performance the defense that a
remedy at law would be adequate.

            12. Successors. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit of and be
binding upon the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns,
including, without the need for an express assignment or any consent by the
Company thereto, subsequent Holders of Registrable Securities, and the
indemnified persons referred to in Section 5 hereof. The Company hereby agrees
to extend the benefits of this Agreement to any Holder of Registrable
Securities, and any such Holder may specifically enforce the provisions of this
Agreement as if an original party hereto.

            13. Counterparts. This Agreement may be signed in one or more
counterparts, each of which shall constitute an original and all of which
together shall constitute one and the same agreement.

            14. Headings. The section headings used herein are for convenience
only and shall not affect the construction hereof.

            15. Applicable Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York applicable to
contracts made and to be performed in the State of New York. The parties hereto
each hereby waive any right to trial by jury in any action, proceeding or
counterclaim arising out of or relating to this Agreement.

            16. Severability. In the event that any one of more of the
provisions contained herein, or the application thereof in any circumstances, is
held invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the
validity, legality and enforceability of any such provision in every other
respect and of the remaining provisions hereof shall not be in any way impaired
or affected thereby, it being intended that all of the rights and privileges of
the parties shall be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by law.

            17. Securities Held by the Company, etc. Whenever the consent or
approval of Holders of a specified percentage of Registrable Securities is
required hereunder, Registrable Securities held by the Company or its Affiliates
(other than subsequent Holders of Securities if such subsequent Holders are
deemed to be Affiliates solely by reason of their holdings of such Registrable
Securities) shall not be counted in determining whether such consent or approval
was given by the Holders of such required percentage.

            18. Termination This Agreement and the obligations of the parties
hereunder shall terminate upon the end of the Shelf Registration Period, except
for any liabilities or obligations under Section 4 or Section 5 hereof and the
obligations to make payments of and provide for Liquidated Damages under Section
7 hereof to the extent such Liquidated Damages accrue prior to the end of the
Shelf Registration Period, each of which shall remain in effect in accordance
with its terms.
