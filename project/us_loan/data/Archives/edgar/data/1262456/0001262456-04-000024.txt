Item 4.01 Change in Registrant's  Certifying Account.

On  December 3, 2004, after the board of directors approval,
the  registrant  engaged the Certified  Accounting  firm  of
Kahn,  Boyd & Levychin, LLP of 48 Wall St., 11th Floor,  New
York,  NY  10005  to re-audit its financial  statements  for
2003.   The  previous certifying auditor Norman  Ross,  P.C.
will  remain  active with the company until further  notice.
There were no prior disagreements with Norman Ross, P.C. and
the company prior to the engagement of the new auditor.




Item 8. OTHER ITEMS

Silver Screen Studios, Inc. amends its internal corporate
transfer records to reflect 75,882,685 shares outstanding on
August 22, 2003.


Silver Screen Studios, Inc. is amending Form 10KSB/A for the
period  ending  on December 31, 2003 to reflect  the  actual
number  of  shares  outstanding according  to  its  transfer
agent.   The Form 10KSB/A for the period ending on  December
31,  2003 should reflect a total outstanding share total  of
116,883,385.


The  corrections are due to a clerical error in the  listing
of the total number of shares outstanding.

 Exchange Act of 1934, the registrant has caused this report
