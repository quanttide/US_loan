ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.


     On December 21, 2004, El Paso Natural Gas Company (EPNG) entered into a
Precedent Agreement with its largest customer, Southern California Gas Company
(SoCalGas). Under the terms of the Precedent Agreement, SoCalGas has agreed to
re-contract, effective September 1, 2006, for an annual average of approximately
750 MMcf/d of capacity on EPNG's pipeline system to serve SoCalGas' "core"
(residential and small commercial) customers -- which is nearly all the core
capacity SoCalGas currently holds on EPNG. Following the satisfaction of
specified conditions, the Precedent Agreement provides for the parties to
execute new service agreements having a primary term of three to five years
at rates that are, on average, less than EPNG's current maximum rates. Such
conditions include SoCalGas' receipt of approval from the California Public
Utilities Commission (CPUC) and the successful awarding of the capacity to
SoCalGas following the post and bid process required by EPNG's tariff.

     As reported in EPNG's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ending
December 31, 2003, the main contract between EPNG and SoCalGas, for
approximately 1.2 Bcf/d of capacity on EPNG's system, expires in 2006. The
remaining capacity from the expiring contracts historically has been used by
SoCalGas to serve "non-core" (large commercial, industrial) customers. The CPUC
is considering whether the California utilities should be required in the future
to hold capacity to serve their non-core customers. EPNG is continuing its
efforts to re-contract this capacity directly with such non-core customers, or
with other parties, depending on the CPUC's decision. Whether that capacity will
be re-contracted by EPNG is unknown at this time.
