EXHIBIT 99.1


                 CHARTERMAC COMPLETES FOURTH HOUSING TAX CREDIT
                     BENEFIT GUARANTEE TRANSACTION THIS YEAR

  -- ANNOUNCES NEW STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIP WITH IXIS FINANCIAL PRODUCTS INC. --


NEW YORK, NY - DECEMBER 17, 2004 - CharterMac (the "Company")  (AMEX: CHC) today
announced that its subsidiary has closed a transaction to guarantee tax benefits
to an investor in Related Capital Credit Enhanced Partners LP - Series A, Number
1 ("RCCEP"),  a partnership  designed to generate federal low-income housing tax
credits  ("LIHTCs").  IXIS  Financial  Products  Inc.  ("IXIS"),  a highly rated
financial institution, has credit enhanced the obligation of RCCEP to provide to
the investor a minimum  internal  rate of return.  CharterMac  Corporation  ("CM
Corp."),  CharterMac's  wholly  owned  subsidiary,  has agreed to back-up  IXIS'
obligations, and CM Corp. and IXIS will each be paid a credit enhancement fee by
RCCEP.

"This  transaction  is extremely  significant to CharterMac in that it marks the
establishment  of a promising new  relationship  with IXIS," commented Stuart J.
Boesky,  Chief  Executive  Officer of  CharterMac.  "In  addition to the current
transaction,  CharterMac  and IXIS are exploring  other ways to work together to
provide  better  products and services to  CharterMac's  investor and  developer
clients."

"IXIS  is  delighted  to  associate  itself  with  such a highly  respected  and
established  player  in the  real  estate  industry,"  added  Nicholas  Mumford,
Managing  Director  of IXIS.  "We look  forward to  growing  and  expanding  our
relationship with CharterMac and to working closely together."

RCCEP  is a fund  sponsored  by  Related  Capital  Company,  also  a  CharterMac
subsidiary, and represents the fourth guaranteed fund closed by the Company this
year.  The investor in RCCEP will be allocated  LIHTCs and other tax benefits in
return for investing  approximately  $61.4 million in RCCEP to finance a portion
of the development and ownership of nine multifamily properties.  The properties
were  also  financed  with the  proceeds  of  approximately  $107.0  million  of
tax-exempt  and  taxable  debt,  which was  provided by  CharterMac,  as well as
additional third-party financing totaling approximately $4.0 million.

"CharterMac is very pleased to close its fourth  guaranteed  transaction of this
year," stated Marc D.  Schnitzer,  President of CharterMac.  "This business line
represents a tremendous growth area for the Company,  as illustrated by the fact
that this fund brings our year-to-date  guaranteed  transactions total to $230.6
million,  which is 49.9% ahead of CharterMac's credit enhancement  activity last
year."
