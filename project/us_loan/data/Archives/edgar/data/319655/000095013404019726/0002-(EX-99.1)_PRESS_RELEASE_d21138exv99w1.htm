<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>San Juan Basin Royalty Trust<BR>
Declares Monthly Cash Distribution</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">FORT WORTH, Texas, December&nbsp;20, 2004  &#151;  TexasBank, as Trustee of the San Juan Basin Royalty
Trust, today declared a monthly cash distribution to the holders of its units of beneficial
interest of $10,025,186.28 or $0.215092 per unit, based principally upon production during the
month of October&nbsp;2004. The distribution is payable January&nbsp;14, 2005, to unit holders of record as
of December&nbsp;31, 2004. Gas production for the properties from which the royalty was carved (the
&#147;Underlying Properties&#148;) totaled approximately 3,689,203 Mcf (3,976,902 MMBtu). Dividing revenues
by production volume yielded an average gas price for October&nbsp;2004 of $4.67 per Mcf ($4.33 per
MMBtu) as compared to $4.49 per Mcf ($4.31 per MMBtu) for September&nbsp;2004. The average gas price may
vary significantly from the posted index price for the San Juan Basin. The index price is a gross
sales price, and the revenues used in the calculation of average gas prices are net of
transportation, processing and gathering costs. Furthermore, the distribution to the Trust in any
given month may include significant volume adjustments for sales in prior months that reflect
pricing for those prior months. Capital costs for the month were $1,253,523.36. Lease operating
expense was $1,492,583.12 and taxes were $1,562,291.07.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Trustee has been in ongoing negotiations with Burlington Resources Oil &#038; Gas Company LP,
the owner of the Underlying Properties, concerning a number of revenue and expense audit issues.
This month&#146;s distribution includes $307,641 allocated to the Trust as part of the ongoing
negotiation of joint interest audit exceptions.
