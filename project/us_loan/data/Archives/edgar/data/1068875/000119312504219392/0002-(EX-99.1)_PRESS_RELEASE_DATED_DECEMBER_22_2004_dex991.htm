(Nasdaq:INSP) today announced that a combined Settlement Agreement has been reached in the <I>Dreiling v. Jain, et al.</I> derivative lawsuit pending in King County Superior Court (Washington), the <I>Dreiling v. Jain, et. al. </I>Section 16(b) case
pending on appeal before the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, and certain other lawsuits involving the Company. The Settlement Agreement, if approved, contemplates (among other consideration) a cash payment to the Company, net
of plaintiff&#146;s counsel&#146;s fee and certain costs, of approximately $83 million, including insurance proceeds. The Settlement Agreement, if approved, also contemplates dismissal of the derivative and Section 16(b) lawsuits with prejudice,

STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The derivative lawsuit was brought against a number of current and former directors and officers of the Company and other defendants by a private party shareholder on
behalf of InfoSpace. The Section 16(b) lawsuit was brought against a former officer and director of the Company and other defendants by the same private party shareholder on behalf of InfoSpace. As such, the derivative and Section 16(b) lawsuits did
not seek monetary damages from, or the imposition of remedies on, the Company. Subject to final approval by the King County Superior Court and the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington for the derivative lawsuit and the
Section 16(b) lawsuit, respectively, settlement proceeds, net of plaintiff&#146;s counsel&#146;s fee and certain costs, will be paid to the Company pursuant to the terms of the Settlement Agreement. </FONT></P> <P

determined that the proposed settlement is in the best interests of the Company and its stockholders. The Settlement Agreement and related paperwork will be on file with the King County Superior Court and the United States District Court for the
