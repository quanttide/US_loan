Item 3.01      Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy Continued
               Listing Rule or Standards; Transfer of Listing


Odyssey Pictures  Corporation  (OTCBB:OPIXE - OPIX) (the "Company") has received
notice of a Nasdaq Staff Determination dated December 22, 2004,  indicating that
the common  stock of the Company  will be  delisted  from the  quotation  of its
securities on the OTC Bulletin Board (the "OTCBB")  effective December 27, 2004,
because  the Company did not timely file the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004 and is Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 with the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the  "Reports").  On November  15th,  the
Company requested a hearing,  which stayed the action,  and attended the hearing
on December 21, 2004  pursuant to the NASD Rule 9700 Series.  The Company  cited
its  reasons  for late  filing  due to a number of issues,  including  change of
accountants  (as  reported in April of 2004) and recent  comments  from the SEC,
which the new auditor wishes to incorporate into the 10-K. The Company is making
every  effort to  complete  and file the  Reports.  Such  filing  would cure the
noncompliance  by the Company with the listing  standards  cited by the Staff as
the reason for its  recommendation  for delisting.  We are intending to complete
the required  filings as early as feasible and seek relisting to the OTCBB.  The
Company intends to file a request for an appeal before Nasdaq Listing Counsel to
review the  Nasdaq  Hearings  Panel's  determination.  The  common  stock of the
Company  will  continue to trade on the Pink  Sheets.  There can be no assurance
that the Panel will grant the Company's appeal for continued quotation on OTCBB.

RE: Odyssey Pictures Corporation (OTCBB Symbol: OPIXE) Hearings Panel
        Decision; Docket 4661B-04

 Dear Mr. Foster:

This is to inform you that,  pursuant  to the  December  21,  2004 oral  hearing
before a Hearings Panel designated by the NASD Board of Governors (the "Panel"),
a  determination  has been made in the matter of. Odyssey  Pictures  Corporation
(the  "Company")  and the Company's  request for the continued  quotation of its
securities on the OTC Bulletin Board (the "OTCBB"). ) The Company was previously
notified  that  quotation  of its  securities  would cease due to the  Company's
failure to timely file its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 and
its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended  September 30, 2004 with the  Securities and
Exchange  Commission.  On November  15, 2004,  the Company  requested a hearing,
which stayed the action.

The Company has not yet filed its Form 10-K or Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the Panel
determined  that  the  Company's  securities  are  not  eligible  for  continued
quotation  on the OTCBB  and,  based on the  filing  delinquency,  to delete all
quotations of the Company's  securities on the OTCBB  effective with the open of
business on Monday, December 27, 2004. The hearing file has been closed.2

The Company  should be aware that the Listing and Hearing  Review  Council  (the
"Listing  Council")  may,  on its own  motion,  determine  to  review  any Panel
decision within 45 calendar days after issuance of the written decision.  If the
Listing  Council  determines  to review this  decision,  it may affirm,  modify,
reverse, dismiss, or remand the decision to the Panel. The Company will be

     in this decision, which is based solely upon the facts and circumstances of
     this matter and should not be interpreted as precedent.

immediately  notified  in the event the  Listing  Council  determines  that this
matter will be called for review.
