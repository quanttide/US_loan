RE: Odyssey Pictures Corporation (OTCBB Symbol: OPIXE) Hearings Panel
        Decision; Docket 4661B-04

 Dear Mr. Foster:

This is to inform you that,  pursuant  to the  December  21,  2004 oral  hearing
before a Hearings Panel designated by the NASD Board of Governors (the "Panel"),
a  determination  has been made in the matter of. Odyssey  Pictures  Corporation
(the  "Company")  and the Company's  request for the continued  quotation of its
securities on the OTC Bulletin Board (the "OTCBB"). ) The Company was previously
notified  that  quotation  of its  securities  would cease due to the  Company's
failure to timely file its Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended June 30, 2004 and
its Form 10-Q for the quarter ended  September 30, 2004 with the  Securities and
Exchange  Commission.  On November  15, 2004,  the Company  requested a hearing,
which stayed the action.

The Company has not yet filed its Form 10-K or Form 10-Q. Accordingly, the Panel
determined  that  the  Company's  securities  are  not  eligible  for  continued
quotation  on the OTCBB  and,  based on the  filing  delinquency,  to delete all
quotations of the Company's  securities on the OTCBB  effective with the open of
business on Monday, December 27, 2004. The hearing file has been closed.2
