Section 3      Securities and Trading Markets

Item 3.01      Notice of Delisting or Failure to Satisfy Continued
               Listing Rule or Standards; Transfer of Listing


Odyssey Pictures  Corporation  (OTCBB:OPIXE - OPIX) (the "Company") has received
notice of a Nasdaq Staff Determination dated December 22, 2004,  indicating that
the common  stock of the Company  will be  delisted  from the  quotation  of its
securities on the OTC Bulletin Board (the "OTCBB")  effective December 27, 2004,
because  the Company did not timely file the Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended
June 30, 2004 and is Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 with the
Securities  and Exchange  Commission  (the  "Reports").  On November  15th,  the
Company requested a hearing,  which stayed the action,  and attended the hearing
on December 21, 2004  pursuant to the NASD Rule 9700 Series.  The Company  cited
its  reasons  for late  filing  due to a number of issues,  including  change of
accountants  (as  reported in April of 2004) and recent  comments  from the SEC,
which the new auditor wishes to incorporate into the 10-K. The Company is making
every  effort to  complete  and file the  Reports.  Such  filing  would cure the
noncompliance  by the Company with the listing  standards  cited by the Staff as
the reason for its  recommendation  for delisting.  We are intending to complete
the required  filings as early as feasible and seek relisting to the OTCBB.  The
Company intends to file a request for an appeal before Nasdaq Listing Counsel to
review the  Nasdaq  Hearings  Panel's  determination.  The  common  stock of the
Company  will  continue to trade on the Pink  Sheets.  There can be no assurance
that the Panel will grant the Company's appeal for continued quotation on OTCBB.
