<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December 13, 2004, we learned of a fourth offer by CMG Partners, LLC to purchase your
shares in NTS Mortgage Income Fund for $2.20 per share in cash. This offer, known as a
&#147;mini-tender,&#148; is structured to avoid the filing, disclosure and procedural
requirements designed to protect investors such as yourself. As management of NTS Mortgage
Income Fund, we are responsible for ensuring that you receive the material facts necessary
for you to make an informed investment decision. We believe that CMG&#146;s offer fails to
comply with the rules and guidelines applicable to these offers and that its price is
inadequate. We recommend that you reject the offer. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We
base our recommendation on two reasons. First, we believe the value offered by CMG is
inadequate. Second, CMG has failed to provide you with the important procedural safeguards
associated with tender offers for which filings are required by the SEC. Specifically, if
you tender to CMG, you will only have the right to withdraw your shares for a period of
ten (10) days. Under SEC rules, you would be able to withdraw at any time up until closing
of the tender. Also, CMG&#146;s offer is structured to make you decide quickly without
potentially adequate time to consider all of the facts because it does not have any
provision requiring pro rata treatment if shareholders tender more interests than CMG
desires to purchase. Under SEC rules, CMG would be required to accept tenders on a pro
rata basis. Finally, CMG&#146;s offer fails to adequately disclose important matters
required under the SEC&#146;s guidelines. For example: </FONT></P>

          <B><I>Method of Determining the Offer Price</I></B><I></I>: CMG fails to clearly
          summarize how it determined its offer price. The only reference is a vague
          statement that CMG applied a discount to the book value of NTS Mortgage Income
          Fund&#146;s shares. </FONT></P>

          <B><I>Identity of Bidder</I></B><I></I>: CMG fails to completely and accurately

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Importantly,
please note that CMG&#146;s offer can be revoked at any time in its sole discretion. The
SEC has stated that offers that may be revoked for any reason may be considered a
&#147;fraudulent, deceptive or manipulative practice&#148; under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934. Also, CMG&#146;s &#147;Agreement of Assignment and Transfer&#148; included</FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>with the tender offer contains qualifications and contingencies that you should carefully
read before you make any decision. For these and other reasons, we recommend that you not
accept CMG&#146;s offer. You should also consult a publication of the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission entitled &#147;Mini-Tender Offers: Tips for Investors,&#148; which is
available on the SEC&#146;s website at <U>www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/minitend.htm</U>. If
you decide to tender and CMG accepts, we will only accept a request for a transfer as long
as SEC rules and regulations, including the above guidelines, are followed and the
transfer complies with our bylaws. </FONT></P>
