Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition


On December 15, 2004, Harris & Harris Group, Inc. (the
"Company") announced that the Board of Directors had
declared a designated undistributed capital gain dividend
(also known as a deemed dividend) for 2004.  The Board of Directors'
resolution was subject to the Company having taxable net long-
term capital gain income by year-end.  It also announced
that it anticipated having an amount of such gain sufficient to pay
a deemed dividend of approximately $520,000.  On December
16, 2004, the Company announced that owing to the
availability for tax purposes of a prior year's net capital
loss carryover, the Company has determined that it will not
have taxable net long-term capital gain income for 2004.
Accordingly, the Company has determined that it will not
have to pay taxes on this long-term capital gain and
therefore will not declare a deemed dividend for 2004.
Both press releases are included as an exhibit to this Form
8-K.

The Company currently estimates that it will have
approximately $775,000 net long-term capital gains for book
purposes for all of calendar year 2004, subject to the year-end audit.
