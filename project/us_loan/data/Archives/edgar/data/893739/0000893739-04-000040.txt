Item 2.02.  Results of Operations and Financial Condition


On December 15, 2004, Harris & Harris Group, Inc. (the
"Company") announced that the Board of Directors had
declared a designated undistributed capital gain dividend
(also known as a deemed dividend) for 2004.  The Board of Directors'
resolution was subject to the Company having taxable net long-
term capital gain income by year-end.  It also announced
that it anticipated having an amount of such gain sufficient to pay
a deemed dividend of approximately $520,000.  On December
16, 2004, the Company announced that owing to the
availability for tax purposes of a prior year's net capital
loss carryover, the Company has determined that it will not
have taxable net long-term capital gain income for 2004.
Accordingly, the Company has determined that it will not
have to pay taxes on this long-term capital gain and
therefore will not declare a deemed dividend for 2004.
Both press releases are included as an exhibit to this Form
8-K.

The Company currently estimates that it will have
approximately $775,000 net long-term capital gains for book
purposes for all of calendar year 2004, subject to the year-end audit.

PRESS RELEASE					FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

HARRIS & HARRIS GROUP, INC.			DECEMBER 15, 2004

NEW YORK, NEW YORK 10019			CONTACT: CHARLES E. HARRIS

NASDAQ/NMS SYMBOL: TINY 			TEL. NO. (212) 582-0900


           HARRIS & HARRIS GROUP DECLARES DEEMED DIVIDEND


Harris & Harris Group, Inc. announced today that its Board of Directors,
in accordance with rules governing a Regulated Investment Company
("RIC") under Sub-Chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code, has declared a
designated undistributed capital gain dividend (also known as a deemed
dividend) for 2004.

This deemed dividend will be an amount equal to $520,246.35 or
$0.030161228 per share.  It is payable to shareholders of record as of
December 31, 2004.  Shareholders of record on the record date will be
provided with the exact amount of the deemed dividend attributable to
their shares by their stock broker if their shares are held in
electronic format or by The Bank of New York if their shares are held
directly.  This information will be reported on IRS Form 2439.

The following simplified example illustrates the tax treatment under
Sub-Chapter M of the Internal Revenue Code for the Company and its
shareholders with regard to the $520,246.35 or $0.030161228 per share
net long-term capital gain retained by the Company and designated as an
undistributed capital gain or deemed dividend:

   1.  The Company will pay a corporate-level federal income tax of 35% or
       $182,086.22 on the undistributed capital gain, or approximately
       $0.010556429 per share.

   2.  Shareholders will increase their cost basis in their stock by
approximately $0.01960548 per share.  Individual shareholders who are
taxable at the highest marginal rate will pay a 15 percent federal
capital gains tax on 100 percent of the undistributed capital gain of
$0.030161228 per share (or approximately $0.00452 per share in tax).
Other taxable shareholders will pay tax on the undistributed capital
gain at their appropriate rates.

   3.  All shareholders will receive a federal tax credit equal to 35
percent of the undistributed capital gain, or $0.0105564 per share.
Taxable shareholders can use that credit to offset their federal tax
liabilities for 2004 and can claim a refund to the extent of any unused
credit.  Shareholders which hold their shares in tax-deferred accounts
can receive a refund from the IRS of the taxes paid by the Company on
the deemed dividend by having their custodians file IRS Form 990T with
the IRS.  (It typically takes several months for the custodian to
receive the refund and deposit it in individual shareholders? accounts.)
Other tax exempt shareholders can also receive a refund of the taxes
paid on the deemed dividend by filing IRS Form 990T.

For more complete information about the Company?s tax status and the
implications for the Company?s shareholders, please see the Company?s
2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Harris & Harris Group is a publicly traded venture capital company that
now makes initial investments exclusively in tiny technology, including

The Company's last 20 initial private equity investments have been in

shares outstanding.

uncertainties associated with the Company's business, including but not

HARRIS & HARRIS GROUP WILL NOT DECLARE A DEEMED DIVIDEND FOR 2004


Harris & Harris Group, Inc., announced today that owing to the
availability for tax purposes of a prior year's net capital loss
carryover, the Company has determined that it will not have
taxable net long-term capital gain income for 2004.  The Company
will have $520,246.35 net long-term capital gains for book
purposes for 2004, which we will retain for working capital and
new and follow-on investments.  Thus, contrary to yesterday's
press release, the Company has determined that it will not have
to pay taxes on this long-term capital gain and therefore will
not declare an undistributed capital gain dividend  (also known
as a deemed dividend) for 2004.

Harris & Harris Group is a publicly traded venture capital
company that now makes initial investments exclusively in tiny
