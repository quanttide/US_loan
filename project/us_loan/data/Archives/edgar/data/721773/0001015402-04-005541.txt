                   ELECTRONIC CLEARING HOUSE (ECHO) ANNOUNCES
                         FOURTH QUARTER FY 2004 RESULTS

                - ANNUAL REVENUE INCREASES 17% TO $47.6 MILLION
              - ANNUAL OPERATING INCOME RISES 43% TO $3.5 MILLION

CAMARILLO,  CALIF.,  DECEMBER  21,  2004  -  Electronic  Clearing  House,  Inc.
(Nasdaq:ECHO),  a  leading  provider  of  electronic  payment  and  transaction
processing  services,  today  reported  financial  and operating results for the
three  months  and  fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2004.

FISCAL  YEAR  2004  HIGHLIGHTS:

     -    Total revenue increased 17.1% to $47.6 million
     -    Check-related revenue advanced by 39.4% to $11.4 million
     -    Bankcard  and  transaction  processing  revenue  rose  11.5%  to $36.2
          million
     -    ACH transactions processed jumped 128.4% to 25.8 million transactions
     -    Gross margin from processing and transaction revenue improved to 37.4%
          from 33.9%
     -    Operating  income  grew to $3.5 million, up 42.6% from $2.4 million in
          FY  2003
     -    Diluted  earnings  per  share  before  cumulative effect of accounting
          change  increased  to  $0.41  from  $0.22  per  share

"We  are  pleased  to  end  the  year  with  robust  revenue growth and enhanced
profitability, which continue to be energized by sustained organic growth in our
bankcard  processing  business  and  the  increasing  contribution of our higher
margin check services to our overall results," said Joel Barry, Chairman and CEO
of  ECHO.

"To  support  sustained  expansion  in  these  segments,  we are implementing an
aggressive  marketing  campaign  in  San  Diego,  California, that will actively
promote  our  MerchantAmerica  service to local merchants via direct mail, radio
and television advertisements. We have also set up a free, on-line directory for
San Diego merchants  (http://sandiego.merchantamerica.com/directory), which will
give  us  an  unprecedented,  direct  relationship  with merchants that is truly
unique  to  our  industry."

"In  the  fourth quarter, we saw further traction in our Visa POS Check program.
We are currently working with over 90% of the Visa member banks that have signed
up  to participate in this Visa program.  One of the Visa acquiring banks, using
us  as its third-party processor, rolled out this program to a national clothing
retailer in June 2003, and following the bank's negotiations with this retailer,
the  bank  has advised us that this relationship has been extended through 2005.
We believe that the Visa program will continue to enlist national merchants that
will  utilize  our  check services and provide us with numerous


<PAGE>
opportunities  to develop strategic relationships with the banks who have chosen
us  to  be  their  third-party  processor  and acquirer processor under the Visa
program,"  said  Mr.  Barry.

Total  revenue  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  fiscal  2004  reached  a  record
$12,311,000,  an increase of 12.0%, as compared to $10,990,000 in the prior year
quarter.  The  increase is primarily attributable to 7.0% growth in the bankcard
and  transaction processing revenue and 29.4% growth in check services revenues.
This  growth  occurred  organically  from  our  existing  merchants and from the
implementation  of new marketing initiatives during the quarter, as well as from
our  continued  participation  in  the  Visa  POS  Check  program.

Operating  income  was  $656,000  in  the fourth quarter of 2004, as compared to
$869,000  in  the year-ago quarter. This decrease is primarily attributable to a
$300,000  litigation  accrual  during  the  fourth  quarter.

The  Company  reported  net  income  of  $403,000, or $0.06 per share on a fully
diluted  basis,  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, versus $518,000, or $0.08
per  share  in  the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003, before any adjustment for the
cumulative  effect  of  an  accounting  change.

For the fiscal year ended September 30, 2004, the Company earned $0.41 per fully
diluted  share  on  revenue of $47,584,000. This compares to a loss of $0.56 per
fully  diluted  share  on  revenue  of  $40,636,000  for  the  fiscal year ended
September  30,  2003.  Excluding  the cumulative effect of an accounting change,
the  Company  earned  $0.22  per  share  in  fiscal  2003.

Bankcard  processing and transaction revenue increased 7.0% to $9,112,000 in the
fourth  quarter  of  fiscal 2004 from $8,517,000 in the prior year quarter. This
increase  was  primarily attributable to the Company's continuous organic growth
in  bankcard  processing  volume  from  existing  merchants  and  new  merchants
generated  as  a  result  of  other  marketing  programs.

Check-related  revenues increased 29.4% to $3,199,000 for the three months ended
September  30,  2004,  compared with $2,473,000 in the prior year quarter.  This
was  primarily  due to ongoing growth in ACH processing revenue, which increased
as  a  result  of  a  17.2%  increase in total ACH transactions processed and an
increase of check conversion revenue as a result of growing acceptance of ECHO's
Visa  POS  Check  Service  program.

Gross margin from processing and transaction services remained constant at 37.3%
in the fourth quarter of 2004 from 37.2% in the year-ago quarter. However, gross
margin  for  the full fiscal year improved from 33.9% in fiscal 2003 to 37.4% in
fiscal  2004.  This  improvement  in  gross  margin  was  primarily  due  to: 1)
higher-margin  check-related revenue which made up 24.0% of the total revenue in
fiscal 2004, as compared to 20.2% of the total revenue in fiscal 2003; 2) a rate
adjustment which was applied to a broad base of bankcard merchants during fiscal
2004  to  offset  increases  in  direct  bankcard  processing  expenses;  and 3)
continuing  low  chargeback  losses.

Other  operating  costs  increased  18.5%,  from  $4,373,000  in  fiscal 2003 to
$5,182,000  in  fiscal  2004,  primarily  due  to  increases  in  the  volume of
transactions  processed.  For  the  three months ended September 30, 2004, other
operating  costs  decreased  3.4%  from  $1,324,000  in  prior  year  quarter to
$1,279,000  in  the  current  year  quarter.  Research  and development expenses
remained  relatively  constant,  from $1,464,000 in fiscal 2003 to $1,465,000 in
fiscal 2004. Almost all of our major development projects were in the coding and
testing  phases  in  fiscal  2004.  Several major development projects should be
completed  during  fiscal  year  2005.  However,  given  the  rapid  changes  in
technology  occurring in this industry, we plan to continue to invest in product
developments  in  both  the  bankcard  processing  business  segment  and  the
check-related products segment in order to remain competitive in these financial
services  markets.


<PAGE>
Selling,  general  and  administrative  (SG&A)  expenses  increased  37.3%  from
$5,714,000  in  fiscal  2003  to  $7,846,000  in  fiscal 2004. This increase was
primarily  attributable  to:  1)  greater  personnel costs due to cost of living
adjustments  and  greater  employee benefits costs, such as health insurance and
worker's  compensation  insurance;  2) growth in sales and marketing expenses to
implement  our  sales  and  marketing  strategies;  3)  increased  legal  and
professional expenses to defend several lawsuits; 4) an increase in rent expense
due to our new corporate relocation in October 2003; and 5) the Company recorded
a  $300,000  litigation  accrual  related to an ordinary course contract dispute
with  one  of  its  independent  sales  organizations. The dispute is subject to
binding  arbitration,  the  award  from  which  is  expected  between the end of
calendar  2004  and  the  beginning  of  calendar  2005.  The accrual represents
management's good faith evaluation after consultation with its legal counsel. As
a percentage of total revenue, SG&A expenses increased from 14.1% in fiscal 2003
to  16.5%  in  fiscal  2004.

During  fiscal  2004,  the  Company  sold  a  building,  which formerly held the
Company's corporate offices. The gain on the sale of the building was $1,319,000
on  a  pre-tax  basis.

The  Company  generated  $5,325,000  of  cash  from operating activities for the
fiscal  year  ended  September  30,  2004, as compared to $4,549,000 in the same
period  last  year.  The  upsurge  in  cash  flow  from  operations is primarily
attributable  to  a  significant increase in net income for fiscal year 2004, as
compared  to  the  prior  year.

Mr. Barry emphasized that, "ECHO's balance sheet remains strong, with $7,576,000
in  cash  and  cash equivalents, $8,004,000 in working capital, only $704,000 in
long-term  debt,  and  $16,240,000  in  stockholders' equity as of September 30,
2004.  The  balance  of  the  merchant  settlement  deposits  was  increased  to
$18,282,000  at  September  30, 2004, as compared to $2,733,000 at September 30,
2003, as a result of the increase in our ACH activities during this fiscal year.
We  have  classified  this  balance as a separate line item on the balance sheet
instead  of  combining  it with cash and cash equivalents as we have done in the
prior  periods.  Our  current  financial position provides us with the resources
for  continued  organic growth in our core bankcard processing business, and the
ability to implement key marketing initiatives in our check services business to
support  continued  growth  in  fiscal  year  2005."

BUSINESS  OUTLOOK

"Looking  ahead  to  fiscal  2005,  we  anticipate continued growth in our check
services  program and bankcard and transaction processing services.  We are also
optimistic  that  we  will  have  double-digit revenue growth and stronger gross
margin  performance,"  stated  Mr.  Barry.
