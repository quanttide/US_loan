ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.


         On December 27, 2004, Callisto Pharmaceuticals, Inc., a Delaware
corporation (the "Company") entered into a consulting agreement (the
"Agreement") with Gabriele M. Cerrone, the Company's Chairman of the Board (the
"Consultant"). The duties of the Consultant and the obligations of the Company
to pay compensation will not commence until the Consultant has notified the
Company that he has terminated his present employment (the "Start Date"), so
long as the Consultant assumes his duties under the Agreement prior to
February 15, 2005.

         The duties of the Consultant pursuant to the Agreement will consist of
business development, strategic planning, capital markets and corporate
financing consulting advice. The term of the Agreement will commence upon the
date that Consultant assumes his responsibilities under the Agreement and
continue until December 31, 2006 with automatic renewal for successive one year
periods unless either party gives notice to the other not to renew the
Agreement.

         The Company will pay Consultant the sum of $205,000 (the "Base
Compensation") at the rate of $17,083.33 per month commencing on the Start Date.
In addition, Consultant will receive a grant of 375,000 ten year non-qualified
stock options pursuant to the Company's Stock Option Plan at an exercise price
of $1.70 per share. One half of such options vest on each of the first two
anniversaries of the date of the Agreement.

         In the event the Agreement is terminated without cause or for good
reason, the Consultant will receive a cash payment equal to the aggregate amount
of Base Compensation for the then remaining term of the Agreement and all
unvested stock options will immediately vest and the exercise period of such
options will be extended to the later of the longest period permitted by the
Company's stock option plans or ten years following termination. In the event a
change of control of the Company occurs, Consultant shall be entitled to such
compensation upon the subsequent termination of the Agreement within two years
of the change in control unless such termination is the result of the
Consultant's death, disability or retirement or the Consultant's termination for
cause.
