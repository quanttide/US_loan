                  AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY FORECASTS OVER $4 MILLION
                IN REVENUES FOR QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004

               COMPANY ALSO REPORTS RECORD REVENUE FOR FISCAL 2004

(SAN DIEGO, CA, DECEMBER 29, 2004) - AMERICAN TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION (ATC)
(NASDAQ: ATCO), an innovator of proprietary sound reproduction technologies,
today forecast record quarterly revenues in excess of $4 million for the quarter
ending December 31, 2004. The company also reported record revenues for its
fiscal year 2004, ended September 30, 2004. Revenues for fiscal 2004 were $5.8
million compared to $1.3 million in fiscal 2003, an increase of 337%. The
company's Government/Force Protection Group and Business Group generated
revenues of $4.8 million and $0.9 million, respectively, in the fiscal year.

The company reported a gross profit of $2.3 million for the fiscal year compared
to a gross loss of $0.2 million for fiscal 2003. The company also reported a net
loss of $6 million for fiscal 2004 reduced from a net loss of $8.2 million in
fiscal 2003. Net loss attributable to common stockholders after deducting
non-cash dividends on preferred stock was $(0.37) per share compared to $(0.67)
per share last fiscal year.

MANAGEMENT COMMENTARY
"In fiscal 2004 we established the markets and organizational foundation to
position our proprietary sound reproduction technologies at the forefront of
audio industry innovation with products primed to produce rapid revenue growth,"
said Elwood G. Norris, chairman of American Technology Corporation. "Our
LRAD(TM) devices are becoming The Sound of Force Protection(TM) for an
increasing number of military, government and commercial applications. And,
after several years of development, we believe our HSS(R) technology is ready to
realize its commercial promise as the most revolutionary audio development since
the invention of the loudspeaker."

"This year, we augmented the ATC team, successfully introduced new products,
focused our sales and marketing efforts, outsourced manufacturing to enable
rapid response to anticipated volume orders, and achieved record revenues,"
remarked Kalani Jones, president and COO of ATC. "We have made substantial
progress on our digital signage business programs and we are pleased with the
responses we are receiving from our HSS Gen III deliveries to digital signage
customers in Asia, Europe and North America. As we have previously stated, the
structure of the larger digital signage programs in which we are engaged are
complex, involve several partners, and generally require in-depth trials through
multiple test installations. With the digital signage market expected to grow to
over $5 billion in the next three to four years, we believe HSS is well
positioned to be the audio solution for a number of major near-term programs.
The programs contemplated each have the potential to generate $1 - $14 million
dollars in revenue to ATC over the next three to twenty-four months."

Commenting on the increasing success of ATC's proprietary LRAD devices, Carl
Gruenler, vice president of ATC's government and force protection systems, said,
"This year, through intense marketing efforts, successful product deployments in
Operation Iraqi Freedom and the expansion of our product line to address the
challenge of protecting infrastructure, our LRAD made great progress in becoming
The Sound of Force Protection(TM). LRAD systems are currently being deployed in
maritime, checkpoint, vehicular, airborne, and integrated system applications by
the U.S. Army (click http://www.atcsd.com/PressReleases/12_15_04A.html to read
our December 15 press release announcing our $4.9 million U.S. Army order), U.S.
Marine Corps, U.S. Navy, U.S. Coast Guard, and other agencies for waterside
force protection, area denial, crowd control, clearing buildings, and
psychological ops missions. Operational feedback from deployment in Iraq and
other parts of the world has been highly favorable. LRAD also supports
applications for the Department of Homeland Security, law enforcement agencies
and customers who need to protect critical high-value infrastructure such as
buildings, bridges, tunnels, dams, power plants, pipelines, airports, seaports,
communications towers, and oil platforms.

Gruenler continued, "We believe we are becoming the pre-eminent acoustic
provider for force and commercial asset protection, and next generation
intelligibility sound systems by providing governments, agencies, and companies
with our LRAD, NeoPlanar(R), and SoundCluster(TM) technologies. Based on market
response, product acceptance, and increasing business opportunities, we expect
continued growth in fiscal 2005. Our early research indicates a global market
potential of well over $1 billion for hailing and warning systems, acoustic
non-lethal weapons capabilities, indoor and outdoor public address/emergency
response systems and custom engineered sound solutions for acoustic challenges
for both government and industry, both at home and abroad. We intend to be a
major force in these emerging markets this year and for years to come."

Commenting on ATC's financial resources, Kalani Jones said, "The $25 million
committed equity financing facility (CEFF) from Kingsbridge Capital announced
December 15 (click http://www.atcsd.com/PressReleases/12_15_04B.html for the
release) and the recent closing of a $2 million two-year note financing, provide
ATC the financial flexibility to accept and fill further expected large military
and commercial LRAD orders."

Jones concluded, "We are very excited about our business and technology
prospects in the coming year. In fiscal 2005, we will continue to build on the
foundation of 2004 with our aggressive strategy of Shaping the Future of
Sound(R)."
