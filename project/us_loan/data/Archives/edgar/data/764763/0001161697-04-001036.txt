ITEM 4.01 CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT

(a) On September 10, 2004, the Registrant's client-auditor relationship ceased
with its principal accountant Sweeney Gates & Co.

          (i) Sweeney Gates & Co. ("Sweeney Gates") disengaged itself as the
Registrant's principal independent accountant effective September 10, 2004.

          (ii) The Registrant engaged Sweeney Gates as the principal accountant
to audit the Registrant's financial statements effective as of July 24, 2003.
Since that time, Sweeney Gates has reviewed the Registrant's financial
statements for the periods ended December 31, 2001 (audited), March 31, 2002
(unaudited), December 31, 2002 (audited) and March 31, 2003 (unaudited), but has
not issued a report on the financial statements of the Registrant.

          (iii) The decision to change accountants was approved by the Board of
Directors of the Registrant.

          (iv) During the Registrant's two most recent fiscal years and the
subsequent interim periods through the date of disengagement on September 10,
2004, there were no disagreements with Sweeney Gates on any matter of accounting
principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or
procedure, which, if not resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction, would
have caused it to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in
connection with its report.

(b) No one has been engaged as the principal accountant to audit the
Registrant's financial statements effective as of December 31, 2003.


ITEM 9.01 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND EXHIBITS

          None.

(b) Pro forma financial information.

                    regarding change in certifying accountant.
