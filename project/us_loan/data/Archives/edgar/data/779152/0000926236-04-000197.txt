   FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
   ---------------------

    JACK HENRY & ASSOCIATES ANNOUNCES THE ACQUISITION OF TWS SYSTEMS, INC.

 Monett, MO  -  December 20, 2004 - Jack  Henry &  Associates, Inc.  (Nasdaq:
 JKHY), a  leading  provider of  integrated  computer systems  and  ATM/debit
 card/ACH  transaction  processing,  today  announced  its  purchase  of  TWS
 Systems, Inc.  The Florida-based company  is the leading provider of  image-
 based item processing solutions for credit unions, and the leading  provider
 of ATM deposit processing solutions for  banks and credit unions.  Terms  of
 the transaction were not disclosed.

 IMAGECENTER, TWS'  turnkey image-based  item  processing platform  that  was
 designed to support the unique requirements of credit unions, has  dominated
 the industry  for  more  than  16  years  and  has  been  implemented  by  a
 significant majority  of  the credit  unions  that have  migrated  to  check
 imaging.  The company has sold more image-based item processing systems than
 all competitive alternatives combined, and more  than 50 of the largest  100
 credit unions in the U.S. have implemented the platform.  The system,  which
 is available for in-house installation or through strategically located item
 processing centers, supports all forms of  checks; counter, ATM, and  mailed
 deposits; and all forms of remittance payments.

 "This  acquisition   provides  the   opportunity  to   integrate  the   core
 competencies of  two industry  leaders,"  said  Jack F. Prim, CEO  of  JKHY.
 "Integrating Episys[R], the core processing solution offered by Jack Henry's
 Symitar subsidiary and used by more credit unions with assets exceeding  $25
 million than any other system, with IMAGECENTER, the dominant  image-enabled
 item processing solution, will provide a competitively distinct  enterprise-
 wide  solution,  will  generate  growth opportunities  for  both  platforms,
 and will support  our  collective  clients  with  a  value-added  solution."
 Approximately 30 credits unions are currently using Episys and IMAGECENTER.

 TWS Systems  also  leveraged  IMAGECENTER  to  provide  a  first-of-its-kind
 solution that automates the historically time-consuming, error-prone  manual
 processing of  ATM  deposits.  This  innovative system  is now  the  market-
 leading solution with a growing client base that includes 20 of the  leading
 U.S. and Canadian banks  that  have automated ATM  deposit processing.  This
 industry-leading, Internet-enabled  system  supports  both  cash  and  check
 deposits, envelope and image-based ATM  deposits, and daily volumes  ranging
 from  500  to  200,000  deposits.   The  system's  end-to-end  functionality
 includes image  capture and  processing at  the  ATM, courier  tracking  and
 monitoring,  fraud  detection   and  prevention,   automated  balancing,   a
 comprehensive audit trail, and more.

 According to  Tony  L.  Wormington, president  of  JKHY,  "This  acquisition
 expands  our  product  and  service  offering  with  IMAGECENTER,  generates
 inherent cross-sale opportunities, and provides the opportunity to introduce
 Jack Henry's growing  suite of  solutions for  the mid-tier  bank market  by
 leveraging TWS' successful  client relationships with  some of the  nation's
 leading  banks.  Acquiring TWS Systems  clearly supports  our objectives  to
 continually  add larger  financial institutions  to  our client  roster,  to
 further differentiate and broaden our integrated solutions, and to add value
 for our clients."

 "In addition to the cross-sales and new sales opportunities the  IMAGECENTER
 platform  generates,  we believe  acquiring  TWS Systems  can  generate  new
 market opportunities by  adapting  its industry-leading solution  to support
 remittance check and cash  payment processing for  credit  card and mortgage
 companies, government entities that collect taxes,  and utilities.  We  also
 expect this  acquisition  to  have a  slightly  accretive  impact  on  EPS,"
 concluded Kevin D. Williams, CFO of JKHY.
