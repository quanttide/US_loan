Company  on  another  form  appropriate  for  such  registration  in  accordance
herewith) (which shall include a Plan of Distribution  substantially in the form
of Exhibit A attached  hereto),  and cause the Registration  Statement to become
effective and remain effective as provided herein;  provided,  however, that not
less than  three  (3)  Business  Days  prior to the  filing of the  Registration
Statement or any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement thereto,  the
Company shall (i) furnish to the Special  Counsel,  copies of all such documents
proposed  to be  filed,  which  documents  (other  than  those  incorporated  by
reference)  will be subject to the review of such Special  Counsel,  and (ii) at
the  request  of any  Holder  cause its  officers  and  directors,  counsel  and
independent  certified public  accountants to respond to such inquiries as shall
be necessary, in the reasonable opinion of counsel to such Holders, to conduct a
reasonable  investigation  within the meaning of the Securities Act. The Company
shall  not  file  the  Registration  Statement  or any  such  Prospectus  or any
amendments  or  supplements  thereto to which the  Holders of a majority  of the
Registrable Securities or the Special Counsel shall reasonably object in writing
within three (3) Business Days after their receipt  thereof,  unless  counsel to
the Company determines in writing that such objection is without merit.

      (b) (i) Prepare and file with the Commission  such  amendments,  including
post-effective  amendments, to the Registration Statement as may be necessary to
keep the  Registration  Statement  continuously  effective as to the  applicable
Registrable  Securities  for the  Effectiveness  Period  and to the  extent  any
Registrable  Securities  are not  included in such  Registration  Statement  for
reasons other than the failure of the Holder to comply with Section 3(m) hereof,
shall  prepare  and  file  with  the  Commission  such  additional  Registration
Statements  in order  to  register  for  resale  under  the  Securities  Act all
Registrable  Securities;  (ii)  cause the  related  Prospectus  to be amended or
supplemented by any required  Prospectus  supplement,  and as so supplemented or
amended to be filed  pursuant  to Rule 424 (or any  similar  provisions  then in
force)  promulgated  under the  Securities  Act;  (iii)  respond as  promptly as
possible,  and in no event later than 10 Business Days, to any comments received
from the Commission with respect to the Registration  Statement or any amendment
thereto and as promptly as possible provide the Holders true and complete copies
of all  correspondence  from and to the Commission  relating to the Registration
Statement;  and (iv) comply in all material  respects with the provisions of the
Securities  Act and the  Exchange  Act with  respect to the  disposition  of all
Registrable   Securities  covered  by  the  Registration  Statement  during  the
applicable  period in accordance with the intended methods of disposition by the
Holders thereof set forth in the Registration Statement as so amended or in such
Prospectus as so supplemented.


                                       4
<PAGE>

      (c)  Notify  the  Holders  of  Registrable  Securities  to be sold and the
Special  Counsel as promptly as possible (A) when a Prospectus or any Prospectus
supplement or post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement is proposed
to be filed  (but in no event in the case of this  subparagraph  (A),  less than
three (3) Business Days prior to date of such filing);  (B) when the  Commission
notifies  the  Company  whether  there will be a "review"  of such  Registration
Statement and whenever the Commission  comments in writing on such  Registration
Statement;   and  (C)  with  respect  to  the  Registration   Statement  or  any
post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective (which notice shall
be  delivered to the Lead  Investor and Special  Counsel on the same day as such
effectiveness),  and after the effectiveness  thereof: (i) of any request by the
Commission or any other Federal or state  governmental  authority for amendments
or  supplements  to the  Registration  Statement or Prospectus or for additional
information; (ii) of the issuance by the Commission of any stop order suspending
the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement  covering  any or all of the
Registrable  Securities or the initiation of any  Proceedings  for that purpose;
(iii) of the  receipt by the  Company of any  notification  with  respect to the
suspension of the  qualification  or exemption from  qualification of any of the
Registrable  Securities  for  sale in any  jurisdiction,  or the  initiation  or
threatening  of any  Proceeding  for such  purpose;  and  (iv) if the  financial
statements  included  in  the  Registration   Statement  become  ineligible  for
inclusion  therein or of the  occurrence  of any event that makes any  statement
made in the Registration Statement or Prospectus or any document incorporated or
deemed to be incorporated therein by reference untrue in any material respect or
that requires any revisions to the Registration  Statement,  Prospectus or other
documents so that, in the case of the Registration  Statement or the Prospectus,
as the case may be, it will not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make the statements  therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made,  not  misleading.  Without  limitation  to any  remedies to which the
Holders may be entitled under this Agreement,  if any of the events described in
Sections 3(c)(C)(i), 3(c)(C)(ii), 3(c)(C)(iii) or 3(c)(C)(iv) occur, the Company
shall use its best efforts to respond to and correct the event.

      (d) Use its best efforts to avoid the issuance of, or, if issued, use best
efforts to obtain the withdrawal of, (i) any order suspending the  effectiveness
of the Registration  Statement or (ii) any suspension of the  qualification  (or
exemption from  qualification) of any of the Registrable  Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment.

      (e) If requested  by any Holder of  Registrable  Securities,  (i) promptly
incorporate  in a  Prospectus  supplement  or  post-effective  amendment  to the
Registration  Statement such information as the Company reasonably agrees should
be  included  therein  and (ii) make all  required  filings  of such  Prospectus
supplement or such  post-effective  amendment as soon as  practicable  after the
Company has  received  notification  of the matters to be  incorporated  in such
Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment;  provided,  however, that the
Company  shall not be required to take any action  pursuant to this Section 3(e)
that would, in the written opinion of counsel for the Company  (addressed to the
Special  Counsel),  violate  applicable  law.


                                       5
<PAGE>

      (f) Furnish to each Holder and the Special  Counsel,  without  charge,  at
least one  conformed  copy of each  Registration  Statement  and each  amendment
thereto,  including financial statements and schedules,  and all exhibits to the
extent  requested  by such  Person  (including  those  previously  furnished  or
incorporated by reference)  promptly after the filing of such documents with the
Commission.

      (g)  Promptly  deliver to each  Holder and the  Special  Counsel,  without
charge, as many copies of the Prospectus or Prospectuses (including each form of
prospectus)  and each  amendment  or  supplement  thereto  as such  Persons  may
reasonably  request;  and  the  Company  hereby  consents  to the  use  of  such
Prospectus  and each  amendment  or  supplement  thereto by each of the  selling
Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the  Registrable  Securities
covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto.

      (h) Prior to any public offering of Registrable  Securities,  use its best
efforts to register  or qualify or  cooperate  with the selling  Holders and the
Special  Counsel  in  connection  with the  registration  or  qualification  (or
exemption  from  such   registration  or   qualification)  of  such  Registrable
Securities  for offer and sale  under  the  securities  or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions  within the United  States as any Holder  requests in writing,  to
keep each such registration or qualification (or exemption  therefrom) effective
during  the  Effectiveness  Period  and to do any and all  other  acts or things
necessary or advisable to enable the  disposition in such  jurisdictions  of the
Registrable Securities covered by a Registration Statement;  provided,  however,
that the Company  shall not be required to qualify  generally  to do business in
any  jurisdiction  where it is not then so  qualified or to take any action that
would subject it to general service of process in any  jurisdiction  where it is
not then so subject  or subject  the  Company  to any  material  tax in any such
jurisdiction where it is not then so subject.

      (i) Cooperate  with the Holders to facilitate the timely  preparation  and
delivery of certificates representing Registrable Securities to be sold pursuant
to a Registration  Statement,  which  certificates  shall be free, to the extent
permitted by  applicable  law and the  Purchase  Agreement,  of all  restrictive
legends,  and to enable such Registrable  Securities to be in such denominations
and registered in such names as any Holder may request at least two (2) Business
Days prior to any sale of Registrable Securities.  In connection therewith,  the
Company shall promptly after the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement
(but no later  than  one day  thereafter)  cause an  opinion  of  counsel  to be
delivered to and  maintained  with its transfer  agent,  together with any other
authorizations,  certificates  and  directions  required by the transfer  agent,
which  authorize  and  direct  the  transfer  agent  to issue  such  Registrable
Securities  without legend upon sale by the Holder of such shares of Registrable
Securities under the Registration Statement.

      (j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by Section  3(c)(C)(iv),
as  promptly  as  possible,  prepare a  supplement  or  amendment,  including  a
post-effective  amendment,  to the Registration Statement or a supplement to the
related  Prospectus or any document  incorporated  or deemed to be  incorporated
therein  by  reference,  and file  any  other  required  document  so  that,  as
thereafter  delivered,  neither the  Registration  Statement nor such Prospectus
will contain an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements  therein,
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.


                                       6
<PAGE>

      (k)  Cause  all  Registrable  Securities  relating  to  such  Registration
Statement  to be  listed  on  NASDAQ  and any  other  United  States  securities
exchange,  quotation system, market or over-the-counter  bulletin board, if any,
on which similar securities issued by the Company are then listed.

      (l)  Comply  in all  material  respects  with  all  applicable  rules  and
regulations  of the  Commission  and make  generally  available  to its security
holders  earnings  statements  satisfying the provisions of Section 11(a) of the
Securities  Act and Rule 158 not later than 45 days after the end of any 3-month
period  (or 90 days  after the end of any  12-month  period if such  period is a
fiscal  year)  commencing  on the first day of the first  fiscal  quarter of the
Company after the effective date of the Registration Statement,  which statement
shall conform to the requirements of Rule 158.

      (m) Request  each  selling  Holder to furnish to the  Company  information
regarding such Holder and the distribution of such Registrable  Securities as is
required by law or the Commission to be disclosed in the Registration  Statement
by sending to each selling Holder a Selling Shareholder Questionnaire,  the form
of which is  attached  as  Exhibit  B, and the  Company  may  exclude  from such
registration  the  Registrable  Securities  of any such  Holder who fails (i) to
furnish  such  information  or (ii) to  agree to  furnish,  upon  request,  such
additional  information regarding such Holder as may later be required by law to
be disclosed, in each case, within a reasonable time prior to the filing of each
Registration  Statement,  supplemented  Prospectus  and/or amended  Registration
Statement.

      If the Registration Statement refers to any Holder by name or otherwise as
the holder of any  securities  of the  Company,  then such Holder shall have the
right to require (if such  reference  to such Holder by name or otherwise is not
required by the Securities Act or any similar federal statute then in force) the
deletion of the  reference to such Holder in any  amendment or supplement to the
Registration  Statement  filed or  prepared  subsequent  to the time  that  such
reference ceases to be required.

      Each Holder agrees by its acquisition of such Registrable Securities that,
upon receipt of a notice from the Company of the  occurrence of any event of the
kind described in Section 3(c)(C)(i), 3(c)(C)(ii),  3(c)(C)(iii), 3(c)(C)(iv) or
3(n),  such Holder will forthwith  discontinue  disposition of such  Registrable
Securities under the  Registration  Statement until such Holder's receipt of the
copies of the  supplemented  Prospectus  and/or amended  Registration  Statement
contemplated  by Section 3(j), or until it is advised in writing (the  "Advice")
by the Company that the use of the applicable Prospectus may be resumed, and, in
either case, has received copies of any additional or supplemental  filings that
are incorporated or deemed to be incorporated by reference in such Prospectus or
Registration Statement.

      (n) If (i) there is material non-public  information regarding the Company
which the Company's Board of Directors (the "Board")  reasonably  determines not
to be in the  Company's  best  interest to disclose and which the Company is not
otherwise  required  to  disclose,  or  (ii)  there  is a  significant  business
opportunity  (including,  but not limited to, the  acquisition or disposition of
assets  (other  than  in  the  ordinary  course  of  business)  or  any  merger,
consolidation,  tender  offer or other  similar  transaction)  available  to the
Company which the Board  reasonably  determines  not to be in the Company's best
interest to disclose and which the Company  would be required to disclose  under
the Registration  Statement,  then the Company may postpone or suspend filing or
effectiveness  of a  registration  statement  for a  period  not  to  exceed  30
consecutive  days,  provided  that the Company  may not  postpone or suspend its
obligation under this Section 3(n) for more than 45 days in the aggregate during
any 12 month period (each, a "Blackout Period").

reasonably  relied on by the  Company for use therein or to the extent that such
information  relates to (x) such Holder and was reviewed and expressly  approved

or (y) such Holder's  proposed method of distribution of Registrable  Securities
as set forth in Exhibit A (or as such  Holder  otherwise  informs the Company in

The Company  shall  notify the Holders  promptly of the  institution,  threat or
assertion of any Proceeding of which the Company is aware in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement. Such indemnity shall remain in full
force and  effect  regardless  of any  investigation  made by or on behalf of an
Indemnified  Party (as  defined in  Section  5(c) to this  Agreement)  and shall
survive the transfer of the Registrable Securities by the Holders.

      (b)  Indemnification  by Holders.  Each Holder  shall,  severally  and not
jointly,  indemnify  and hold  harmless the Company,  its  directors,  officers,
agents and employees,  each Person who controls the Company  (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the
directors,  officers,  agents and employees of such controlling  Persons, to the
fullest  extent  permitted by applicable  law,  from and against all Losses,  as
incurred,  arising solely out of or based solely upon any untrue  statement of a
material fact contained in the Registration  Statement,  any Prospectus,  or any
form of prospectus, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or arising solely
out of or based  solely  upon any  omission  of a material  fact  required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the  statements  therein (in the case of any
Prospectus  or form of prospectus  or  supplement  thereto,  in the light of the
circumstances  under which they were made) not  misleading,  to the extent,  but
only to the extent,  that (i) such untrue  statement or omission is contained in
or omitted  from any  information  so furnished in writing by such Holder to the


                                       9
<PAGE>

Company  specifically  for  inclusion  in the  Registration  Statement  or  such
Prospectus and that such  information was reasonably  relied upon by the Company
for use in the Registration Statement,  such Prospectus,  or in any amendment or
supplement  thereto,  or to the extent that such information relates to (x) such
Holder and was  reviewed  and  expressly  approved  in  writing  by such  Holder
expressly for use in the Registration Statement,  such Prospectus,  or such form
of prospectus  or in any  amendment or  supplement  thereto or (y) such Holder's
proposed  method  of  distribution  of  Registrable  Securities  as set forth in
Exhibit A (or as such Holder  otherwise  informs the Company in writing) or (ii)
in the  case of an  occurrence  of an event of the  type  described  in  Section
3(c)(C)(ii),  3(c)(C)(iii),  3(c)(C)(iv)  or  3(n),  the use by a  Holder  of an
outdated or  defective  Prospectus  after the  delivery to the Holder of written
notice from the Company that the  Prospectus  is outdated or defective and prior
to the  receipt by such  Holder of the  Advice  contemplated  in  Section  3(m);
provided,  however,  that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 5(b)
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement  of any Losses if such  settlement
is effected without the prior written consent of the Holder, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein,  the Holder shall be liable under this Section 5(b) for only that amount
as does not exceed the net  proceeds  to such  Holder as a result of the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.

      (c) Conduct of  Indemnification  Proceedings.  If any Proceeding  shall be
brought or asserted  against  any Person  entitled to  indemnity  hereunder  (an
"Indemnified  Party"),  such Indemnified  Party promptly shall notify the Person
from whom  indemnity is sought (the  "Indemnifying  Party") in writing,  and the
Indemnifying Party shall assume the defense thereof, including the employment of
counsel reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and the payment of all
reasonable  fees and  expenses  incurred in  connection  with  defense  thereof;
provided,  that the failure of any  Indemnified  Party to give such notice shall
not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its obligations or liabilities pursuant to
this  Agreement,  except  (and  only) to the  extent  that it  shall be  finally
determined  by a court of competent  jurisdiction  (which  determination  is not
subject to appeal or further  review) that such failure  shall have  proximately
and materially adversely prejudiced the Indemnifying Party.

      An Indemnified  Party shall have the right to employ  separate  counsel in
any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof,  but the fees and
expenses of such counsel  shall be at the expense of such  Indemnified  Party or
Parties  unless:  (1) the  Indemnifying  Party has agreed in writing to pay such
fees and expenses;  or (2) the Indemnifying  Party shall have failed promptly to
assume  the  defense  of  such  Proceeding  and  to  employ  counsel  reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding;  or (3) the named
parties to any such Proceeding  (including any impleaded  parties)  include both
such Indemnified  Party and the Indemnifying  Party, and such Indemnified  Party
shall have been advised by counsel in writing  (with a copy to the  Indemnifying
Party) that a conflict of interest is likely to exist if the same  counsel  were
to represent such Indemnified  Party and the Indemnifying  Party (in which case,
if such  Indemnified  Party notifies the  Indemnifying  Party in writing that it
elects to employ separate counsel at the expense of the Indemnifying  Party, the

                                       10
<PAGE>

Indemnifying  Party shall not have the right to assume the  defense  thereof and
such counsel shall be at the reasonable expense of the Indemnifying  Party). The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding
effected  without its written  consent,  which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of
which any  Indemnified  Party is a party,  unless  such  settlement  includes an
unconditional  release of such  Indemnified  Party from all  liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such  Proceeding and does not impose any monetary
or other obligation or restriction on the Indemnified Party.

      All  reasonable  fees and  expenses of the  Indemnified  Party  (including
reasonable  fees  and  expenses  to  the  extent  incurred  in  connection  with
investigating   or  preparing  to  defend  such   Proceeding  in  a  manner  not
inconsistent  with this  Section)  shall be paid to the  Indemnified  Party,  as
incurred,  within  ten (10)  Business  Days of  written  notice  thereof  to the
Indemnifying Party, which notice shall be delivered no more frequently than on a
monthly  basis  (regardless  of  whether  it is  ultimately  determined  that an
Indemnified Party is not entitled to indemnification  hereunder;  provided, that
the  Indemnifying  Party may require  such  Indemnified  Party to  undertake  to
reimburse  all such fees and  expenses  to the extent it is  finally  judicially
determined  that  such  Indemnified  Party is not  entitled  to  indemnification
hereunder).

      (d)  Contribution.  If a claim for  indemnification  under Section 5(a) or
5(b) is unavailable to an Indemnified Party because of a failure or refusal of a
governmental  authority to enforce such  indemnification  in accordance with its
terms (by reason of public policy or otherwise),  then each Indemnifying  Party,
in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified  Party,  shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by such  Indemnified  Party as a result of such Losses,  in such
proportion as is appropriate  to reflect the relative fault of the  Indemnifying
Party and  Indemnified  Party in  connection  with the  actions,  statements  or
omissions that resulted in such Losses as well as any other  relevant  equitable
considerations.  The relative fault of such  Indemnifying  Party and Indemnified
Party shall be  determined  by  reference  to, among other  things,  whether any
action in  question,  including  any untrue or  alleged  untrue  statement  of a
material fact or omission or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken
or made by, or relates to information  supplied by, such  Indemnifying  Party or
Indemnified  Party,  and the  parties'  relative  intent,  knowledge,  access to
information  and  opportunity  to correct or prevent such  action,  statement or
omission.  The amount paid or payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall
be deemed to include,  subject to the limitations set forth in Section 5(c), any
reasonable  attorneys'  or other  reasonable  fees or expenses  incurred by such
party in connection with any Proceeding to the extent such party would have been
indemnified  for such fees or expenses if the  indemnification  provided  for in
this  Section  was  available  to such  party  in  accordance  with  its  terms.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary  contained herein, the Holder shall be
required to contribute  under this Section 5(d) for only that amount as does not
exceed the net  proceeds to such  Holder as a result of the sale of  Registrable
Securities pursuant to such Registration Statement.


                                       11
<PAGE>

      The  parties  hereto  agree  that it would  not be just and  equitable  if
contribution  pursuant  to  this  Section  5(d)  were  determined  by  pro  rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation  that does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
No Person guilty of fraudulent  misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to  contribution  from any Person
who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

      The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in
addition  to any  liability  that  the  Indemnifying  Parties  may  have  to the
Indemnified  Parties.  The indemnity and contribution  agreements  herein are in
addition  to  and  not  in  diminution  or  limitation  of  any  indemnification
provisions under the Purchase Agreement.

      6. Rule 144.

      As long as any Holder owns any Shares,  Warrants  or Warrant  Shares,  the
Company  covenants to timely file (or obtain  extensions in respect  thereof and
file within the applicable grace period) all reports required to be filed by the
Company after the date hereof pursuant to Section 13(a) or 15(d) of the Exchange
Act. As long as any Holder owns any Shares,  Warrants or Warrant Shares,  if the
Company is not  required to file reports  pursuant to Section  13(a) or 15(d) of
the Exchange  Act, it will prepare and furnish to the Holders and make  publicly
available in accordance  with Rule 144(c)  promulgated  under the Securities Act
annual and  quarterly  financial  statements,  together  with a  discussion  and
analysis  of such  financial  statements  in form  and  substance  substantially
similar to those that would  otherwise  be  required  to be  included in reports
required  by Section  13(a) or 15(d) of the  Exchange  Act, as well as any other
information  required  thereby,  in the time period that such filings would have
been  required to have been made under the  Exchange  Act.  The Company  further
covenants  that it will take such  further  action as any Holder may  reasonably
request,  all to the extent  required from time to time to enable such Person to
sell Shares and Warrant  Shares  without  registration  under the Securities Act
within the limitation of the exemptions  provided by Rule 144 promulgated  under
the Securities  Act,  including  compliance  with the provisions of the Purchase
Agreement  relating to the transfer of the Shares and Warrant  Shares.  Upon the
request of any  Holder,  the  Company  shall  deliver  to such  Holder a written
certification  of a duly  authorized  officer as to whether it has complied with
such requirements.

      7. Covenants of Purchasers.

      In connection  with the  Registration  Statement,  each of the  Purchasers
covenants as follows:

      (a) Unless and until such  Purchaser  has provided  written  notice to the
Company to the contrary,  all sales of Registrable  Securities by such Purchaser
shall be made without  payment of underwriting  discounts or commissions  except
for the usual and customary commission paid to brokers or dealers.

      (b) Such  Purchaser  shall  advise the Company of any  arrangement  with a
broker or dealer for the sale of such Purchaser's Registrable Securities through
a block  trade,  special  offering,  exchange  or  secondary  distribution  or a
principal purchase by a broker or dealer, and the details of such transaction.


                                       12
<PAGE>

      (c) Such Purchaser shall comply with all prospectus delivery  requirements
with respect to sales of the  Registrable  Securities to the extent  required by
the Securities Act and other applicable law.

      (d) Such Purchaser  shall report to the Company,  upon written  request of
the Company, whether all Registrable Securities held by such Purchaser have been
sold or otherwise transferred.

      8. Miscellaneous.

      (a) Remedies.  In the event of a breach by the Company or by a Holder,  of
any of their  obligations under this Agreement,  each Holder or the Company,  as
the case may be, in addition to being entitled to exercise all rights granted by
law and under this Agreement, including recovery of damages, will be entitled to
specific  performance of its rights under this  Agreement.  The Company and each
Holder agree that monetary damages would not provide  adequate  compensation for
any losses incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the provisions of this
Agreement  and  hereby  further  agrees  that,  in the event of any  action  for
specific  performance in respect of such breach, it shall waive the defense that
a remedy at law would be adequate.

      (b) No  Inconsistent  Agreements.  Except as  otherwise  disclosed  in the
Purchase  Agreement,  neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is a party
to an  agreement  currently  in  effect,  nor  shall the  Company  or any of its
subsidiaries,  on or after the date of this Agreement,  enter into any agreement
with respect to its securities that is  inconsistent  with the rights granted to
the Holders in this Agreement or otherwise conflicts with the provisions hereof.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, without the written consent of
the Holders of a majority of the then outstanding  Registrable  Securities,  the
Company  shall not grant to any  Person  the right to  request  the  Company  to
register  any  securities  of the Company  under the  Securities  Act unless the
rights so granted are subject in all respects to the prior rights in full of the
Holders set forth herein,  and are not otherwise in conflict with the provisions
of this Agreement.

      (c)  Notice of  Effectiveness.  Within  two (2)  Business  Days  after the
Registration  Statement  which  includes the  Registrable  Securities is ordered
effective by the  Commission,  the Company shall deliver,  and shall cause legal
counsel for the Company to deliver,  to the transfer agent for such  Registrable
Securities (with copies to the Holders whose Registrable Securities are included
in such Registration Statement) confirmation that the Registration Statement has
been declared effective by the Commission in the form attached hereto as Exhibit
C. On the day that  such  Registration  Statement  is  declared  effective,  the
Company   shall  furnish  to  the   Investors   for   completion   the  investor
representation letter attached as Annex I to Exhibit C.


                                       13
<PAGE>

      (d)  Piggy-Back  Registrations.  If at  any  time  when  there  is  not an
effective Registration Statement covering all of the Registrable Securities, the
Company shall  determine to prepare and file with the  Commission a registration
statement  relating to an offering  for its own account or the account of others
under the Securities Act of any of its equity securities, other than on Form S-4
or Form  S-8  (each  as  promulgated  under  the  Securities  Act)  or its  then
equivalents relating to equity securities to be issued solely in connection with
any  acquisition  of any entity or  business  or equity  securities  issuable in
connection with stock option or other employee  benefit plans, the Company shall
send  to  each  Holder  of  Registrable   Securities   written  notice  of  such
determination  and,  if within  seven (7)  Business  Days after  receipt of such
notice, any such Holder shall so request in writing (which request shall specify
the  Registrable  Securities  intended  to be disposed  of by the  Holder),  the
Company will cause the registration  under the Securities Act of all Registrable
Securities which the Company has been so requested to register by the Holder, to
the extent required to permit the  disposition of the Registrable  Securities so
to be  registered,  provided that if at any time after giving  written notice of
its intention to register any  securities and prior to the effective date of the
registration  statement filed in connection with such registration,  the Company
shall determine for any reason not to register or to delay  registration of such
securities,  the  Company  may, at its  election,  give  written  notice of such
determination to such Holder and, thereupon,  (i) in the case of a determination
not to register, shall be relieved of its obligation to register any Registrable
Securities in connection with such  registration (but not from its obligation to
pay expenses in  accordance  with  Section 4 hereof),  and (ii) in the case of a
determination to delay registering,  shall be permitted to delay registering any
Registrable  Securities being  registered  pursuant to this Section 8(d) for the
same period as the delay in registering such other securities. The Company shall
include  in such  registration  statement  all or any  part of such  Registrable
Securities such Holder requests to be registered;  provided,  however,  that the
Company shall not be required to register any Registrable Securities pursuant to
this  Section  8(d) that are  eligible  for sale  pursuant to Rule 144(k) of the
Securities Act. In the case of an underwritten public offering,  if the managing
underwriter(s)  or  underwriter(s)  should reasonably object to the inclusion of
the Registrable Securities in such registration  statement,  then if the Company
after  consultation with the managing  underwriter  should reasonably  determine
that the inclusion of such Registrable  Securities,  would materially  adversely
affect the offering  contemplated in such registration  statement,  and based on
such determination  recommends inclusion in such registration statement of fewer
or none of the  Registrable  Securities  of the Holders,  then (x) the number of
Registrable  Securities of the Holders included in such  registration  statement
shall  be  reduced  pro-rata  among  such  Holders  (based  upon the  number  of
Registrable  Securities  requested to be included in the  registration),  if the
Company after consultation with the  underwriter(s)  recommends the inclusion of
fewer Registrable  Securities,  or (y) none of the Registrable Securities of the
Holders shall be included in such registration  statement,  if the Company after
consultation  with the  underwriter(s)  recommends the inclusion of none of such
Registrable Securities;  provided, however, that if securities are being offered
for the  account  of other  persons or  entities  as well as the  Company,  such
reduction  shall not represent a greater  fraction of the number of  Registrable
Securities  intended to be offered by the Holders  than the  fraction of similar
reductions imposed on such other persons or entities (other than the Company).


                                       14
<PAGE>

      (e) Failure to File Registration  Statement and Other Events.  The Company
and the Holders agree that the Holders will suffer  damages if the  Registration
Statement is not filed on or prior to the thirty-fifth  (35th) day following the
Closing  Date and  maintained  in the  manner  contemplated  herein  during  the
Effectiveness  Period.  The Company and the Holders  further agree that it would
not be  feasible  to  ascertain  the  extent  of such  damages  with  precision.
Accordingly,  if (i) the Registration  Statement is not filed on or prior to the
thirty-fifth (35th) day following the Closing Date, or (ii) the Company fails to
file with the Commission a request for  acceleration in accordance with Rule 461
promulgated  under the  Securities Act within five (5) Business Days of the date
that the Company is notified (orally or in writing, whichever is earlier) by the
Commission that a Registration  Statement will not be "reviewed," or not subject
to  further  review,  or (iii)  the  Registration  Statement  is filed  with and
declared effective by the Commission but thereafter ceases to be effective as to
all  Registrable  Securities  at  any  time  prior  to  the  expiration  of  the
Effectiveness   Period,   without  being  succeeded  promptly  by  a  subsequent
Registration Statement filed with the Commission,  except as otherwise permitted
by this  Agreement,  including  pursuant to Section 3(n), or (iv) trading in the
Common Stock shall be  suspended or if the Common Stock is delisted  from Nasdaq
or any other securities exchange,  quotation system,  market or over-the-counter
bulletin  board on which  Registrable  Securities  are required  hereunder to be
listed  (each an  "Exchange"),  without  immediately  being  listed on any other
Exchange, for any reason for more than one (1) Business Day, other than pursuant
to Section  3(n),  or (v) the exercise  rights of the Holders under the Warrants
are suspended for any reason  without the consent of the particular  Holder,  or
(vi) the Company has breached  Section 3(n) of this  Agreement (any such failure
or breach  being  referred to as an "Event"),  the Company  shall pay in cash as
liquidated  damages  for such  failure  and not as a penalty  to each  Holder an
amount equal to two percent (2%) of such Holder's pro rata share of the purchase
price paid by all Holders for the Shares purchased and then outstanding pursuant
to the  Purchase  Agreement  for the initial  thirty  (30) day period  until the
applicable Event has been cured,  which shall be pro rated for such periods less
than thirty (30) days and two percent  (2%) of such  Holder's  pro rata share of
the purchase price paid by all Holders for Shares purchased and then outstanding
pursuant to the Purchase  Agreement for each  subsequent  thirty (30) day period
until the  applicable  Event has been  cured  which  shall be pro rated for such
periods  less than  thirty  days (the  "Periodic  Amount").  Payments to be made
pursuant to this Section 8(e) shall be due and payable  immediately  upon demand
in immediately  available cash funds. The parties agree that the Periodic Amount
represents a reasonable  estimate on the part of the parties,  as of the date of
this Agreement,  of the amount of damages that may be incurred by the Holders if
the Registration  Statement is not filed on or prior to the thirty-fifth  (35th)
day following the Closing Date and maintained in the manner  contemplated herein
during the  Effectiveness  Period or if any other Event as described  herein has
occurred.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the Company shall remain obligated to
cure the breach or correct the condition  that caused the Event,  and the Holder
shall have the right to take any action  necessary  or desirable to enforce such
obligation.

      (f) Specific Enforcement, Consent to Jurisdiction.

            (i)  The  Company  and  the  Holders   acknowledge  and  agree  that
irreparable  damage would occur in the event that any of the  provisions of this
Agreement  were not performed in accordance  with their  specific  terms or were
otherwise breached.  It is accordingly agreed that the parties shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent or cure breaches of the provisions of
this Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provisions hereof, this
being in  addition  to any other  remedy to which any of them may be entitled by
law or equity.


                                       15
<PAGE>

            (ii) Each of the  Company  and the  Holders  (i) hereby  irrevocably
      submits to the  exclusive  jurisdiction  of the state and  federal  courts
      located in New York City, New York for the purposes of any suit, action or
      proceeding  arising out of or relating to this  Agreement  and (ii) hereby
      waives,  and agrees not to assert in any such suit,  action or proceeding,
      any claim that it is not personally  subject to the  jurisdiction  of such
      court,  that the suit,  action or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient
      forum or that the venue of the suit,  action or  proceeding  is  improper.
      Each of the Company and the Holders  consents to process  being  served in
      any such suit,  action or  proceeding  by  mailing a copy  thereof to such
      party at the address in effect for notices to it under this  Agreement and
      agrees that such service shall  constitute good and sufficient  service of
      process and notice  thereof.  Nothing in this Section 8(f) shall affect or
      limit any right to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

      (g) Amendments and Waivers.  The provisions of this  Agreement,  including
the provisions of this sentence,  may not be amended,  modified or supplemented,
and waivers or  consents to  departures  from the  provisions  hereof may not be
given,  unless the same shall be in writing  and signed by the  Company  and the
Holders of 75% of the Registrable  Securities.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, a
waiver or consent to depart from the provisions  hereof with respect to a matter
that relates  exclusively to the rights of Holders and that does not directly or
indirectly  affect  the rights of other  Holders  may be given by Holders of the
Registrable  Securities  to which  such  waiver or  consent  relates;  provided,
however,  that the provisions of this sentence may not be amended,  modified, or
supplemented  except  in  accordance  with  the  provisions  of the  immediately
preceding sentence.

      (h) Notices.  Any and all notices or other  communications  or  deliveries
required or permitted to be provided  hereunder shall be in writing and shall be
deemed given and  effective on the earlier of (i) the date of  transmission,  if
such  notice or  communication  is  delivered  via  facsimile  at the  facsimile
telephone number specified for notice prior to 5:00 p.m., New York City time, on
a Business Day, (ii) the next  Business Day after the date of  transmission,  if
such notice or  communication is delivered via facsimile at the facsimile number
specified in this Section on a day that is not a Business Day or later than 5:00
p.m., New York City time, on any date and earlier than 11:59 p.m., New York City
time, on such date,  (iii) the Business Day  following  the date of mailing,  if
sent by nationally  recognized overnight courier service such as Federal Express
or (iv) actual receipt by the party to whom such notice is required to be given.
The  addresses for such  communications  shall be with respect to each Holder at
its  address set forth  under its name on  Schedule 1 attached  hereto,  or with
respect to the Company, addressed to:

                                    NexMed, Inc.

or to such other address or addresses or facsimile number or numbers as any such
party may most recently have  designated in writing to the other parties  hereto
by such notice.  Copies of notices to the Company shall be sent to Katten Muchin

Facsimile No. (212)  940-8776.  Copies of notices to any Holder shall be sent to
the addresses, if any, listed on Schedule 1 attached hereto.

      (i) Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties and their  successors  and  permitted  assigns and
shall  inure to the  benefit of each  Holder  and its  successors  and  assigns;
provided, that the Company may not assign this Agreement or any of its rights or
obligations  hereunder  without the prior  written  consent of each Holder;  and
provided,  further,  that each  Holder may assign  its rights  hereunder  in the
manner and to the Persons as permitted under the Purchase Agreement.

      (j)  Assignment  of  Registration   Rights.  The  rights  of  each  Holder
hereunder,  including  the  right  to  have  the  Company  register  for  resale
Registrable Securities in accordance with the terms of this Agreement,  shall be
automatically  assignable by each Holder to any transferee of such Holder of all
or a portion of the Shares,  the Warrants or the Registrable  Securities if: (i)
the Holder  agrees in writing  with the  transferee  or  assignee to assign such
rights,  and a copy of such  agreement  is  furnished  to the  Company  within a
reasonable time after such assignment,  (ii) the Company is, within a reasonable
time after such transfer or assignment, furnished with written notice of (a) the
name and address of such  transferee or assignee,  and (b) the  securities  with
respect to which such  registration  rights are being  transferred  or assigned,
(iii)  following  such transfer or assignment  the further  disposition  of such
securities by the transferee or assignees is restricted under the Securities Act
and applicable  state  securities  laws,  (iv) at or before the time the Company
receives the written  notice  contemplated  by clause (ii) of this Section 8(j),
the transferee or assignee agrees in writing with the Company to be bound by all
of the provisions of this Agreement,  and (v) such transfer shall have been made
in accordance with the applicable  requirements of the Purchase  Agreement.  The
rights to assignment  shall apply to the Holders (and to subsequent)  successors
and assigns.

      The Company may require,  as a condition of allowing  such  assignment  in
connection  with a transfer of Shares,  Warrants or  Registrable  Securities (i)
that the Holder or transferee of all or a portion of the Shares, the Warrants or
the Registrable  Securities as the case may be, furnish to the Company a written
opinion of counsel that is  reasonably  acceptable  to the Company to the effect
that such transfer may be made without  registration  under the Securities  Act,
(ii) that the  Holder or  transferee  execute  and  deliver  to the  Company  an
investment letter in form and substance acceptable to the Company and (iii) that
the transferee be an "accredited investor" as defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated
under the Securities Act.


                                       17

      (k) Counterparts;  Facsimile. This Agreement may be executed in any number
of  counterparts,  each of  which  when so  executed  shall be  deemed  to be an
original  and, all of which taken  together  shall  constitute  one and the same
Agreement.  In the event that any signature is delivered by electronic  image or
facsimile  transmission,  such signature shall create a valid binding obligation
of the party  executing (or on whose behalf such signature is executed) the same
with the  same  force  and  effect  as if such  electronic  image  or  facsimile
signature were the original thereof.

      (l) Governing  Law. This  Agreement  shall be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of New York,  without regard to principles
of conflicts of law thereof.

      (m) Cumulative  Remedies.  The remedies provided herein are cumulative and
not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

      (n) Severability.  If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of this
Agreement is held by a court of competent  jurisdiction to be invalid,  illegal,
void or  unenforceable in any respect,  the remainder of the terms,  provisions,
covenants  and  restrictions  set forth  herein  shall  remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties
hereto  shall use their  reasonable  efforts to find and  employ an  alternative
means to achieve the same or substantially  the same result as that contemplated
by such term,  provision,  covenant or restriction.  It is hereby stipulated and
declared to be the  intention of the parties  that they would have  executed the
remaining terms, provisions, covenants and restrictions without including any of
such that may be hereafter declared invalid, illegal, void or unenforceable.

      (o)  Headings.  The  headings  herein  are for  convenience  only,  do not
constitute a part of this  Agreement  and shall not be deemed to limit or affect
any of the provisions hereof.

      (p)  Registrable  Securities  Held  by the  Company  and  its  Affiliates.
Whenever  the  consent  or  approval  of Holders of a  specified  percentage  of
Registrable Securities is required hereunder, Registrable Securities held by the
Company or its Affiliates (other than any Holder or transferees or successors or
assigns thereof if such Holder is deemed to be an Affiliate  solely by reason of
its holdings of such Registrable Securities) shall not be counted in determining
whether  such  consent or  approval  was given by the  Holders of such  required
percentage.

      (q)  Obligations  of  Purchasers.   The  Company   acknowledges  that  the
obligations of each Purchaser  under this  Agreement,  are several and not joint
with  the  obligations  of any  other  Purchaser,  and  no  Purchaser  shall  be
responsible  in any way for the  performance  of the  obligations  of any  other
Purchaser under this Agreement.  The decision of each Purchaser to enter into to
this  Agreement  has been  made by such  Purchaser  independently  of any  other
Purchaser.  The Company  further  acknowledges  that  nothing  contained in this
Agreement, and no action taken by any Purchaser pursuant hereto, shall be deemed
to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership,  an association,  a joint venture
or any other kind of entity,  or create a presumption that the Purchasers are in
any way acting in concert or as a group with respect to such  obligations or the
transactions   contemplated   hereby.   Each  Purchaser  shall  be  entitled  to
independently protect and enforce its rights, including without limitation,  the
rights  arising out of this  Agreement,  and it shall not be  necessary  for any
other  Purchaser to be joined as an additional  party in any proceeding for such
purpose.


                                       18

      Each Purchaser acknowledges and agrees that it has been represented by its
own separate legal counsel in their review and negotiation of this Agreement and
with  respect  to  the  transactions   contemplated   hereby.   For  reasons  of
administrative  convenience  only,  this  Agreement has been prepared by Special
Counsel  (counsel for The Tail Wind Fund Ltd.  ("TWF")) and the Special  Counsel
will  perform  certain  duties  under  this  Agreement.  Such  counsel  does not
represent all of the  Purchasers  but only TWF and Solomon  Strategic  Holdings,
Inc. The Company has elected to provide all  Purchasers  with the same terms and
Agreement for the  convenience of the Company and not because it was required or
requested  to do so by  the  Purchasers.  The  Company  acknowledges  that  such
procedure  with respect to this  Agreement in no way creates a presumption  that
the  Purchasers  are in any way acting in concert or as a group with  respect to
this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby.

                              PLAN OF DISTRIBUTION

      We are  registering  the shares of common  stock on behalf of the  selling
security  holders.  Sales of shares  may be made by  selling  security  holders,
including   their   respective   donees,   transferees,    pledgees   or   other
successors-in-interest  directly to  purchasers  or to or through  underwriters,
broker-dealers  or  through  agents.  Sales may be made from time to time on the
Nasdaq National  Market,  any other exchange or market upon which our shares may
trade in the future,  in the  over-the-counter  market or  otherwise,  at market
prices prevailing at the time of sale, at prices related to market prices, or at
negotiated  or fixed  prices.  The  shares  may be sold by one or more of,  or a
combination of, the following:

- -     a block trade in which the  broker-dealer  so engaged will attempt to sell
      the shares as agent but may  position and resell a portion of the block as
      principal to facilitate the  transaction  (including  crosses in which the
      same broker acts as agent for both sides of the transaction);

- -     purchases   by  a   broker-dealer   as   principal   and  resale  by  such
      broker-dealer,  including  resales  for  its  account,  pursuant  to  this
      prospectus;

- -     ordinary  brokerage  transactions  and  transactions  in which the  broker
      solicits purchases;

- -     through options, swaps or derivatives;

- -     in privately negotiated transactions;

- -     in making short sales or in transactions to cover short sales; and

- -     put or call option transactions relating to the shares.

      The  selling  security  holders  may effect  these  transactions  by
selling shares directly to purchasers or to or through broker-dealers, which may
act as agents or principals.  These  broker-dealers may receive  compensation in
the form of discounts,  concessions  or  commissions  from the selling  security
holders and/or the purchasers of shares for whom such  broker-dealers may act as
agents or to whom they sell as principals,  or both (which  compensation as to a
particular  broker-dealer  might be in excess  of  customary  commissions).  The
selling  security  holders  have  advised us that they have not entered into any
agreements,   understandings   or   arrangements   with  any   underwriters   or
broker-dealers regarding the sale of their securities.

      The selling  security  holders may enter into  hedging  transactions  with
broker-dealers  or  other  financial  institutions.  In  connection  with  those
transactions,  the broker-dealers or other financial  institutions may engage in
short sales of the shares or of securities  convertible into or exchangeable for
the shares in the course of  hedging  positions  they  assume  with the  selling
security  holders.  The selling  security holders may also enter into options or
other  transactions with  broker-dealers or other financial  institutions  which
require  the   delivery  of  shares   offered  by  this   prospectus   to  those
broker-dealers  or other  financial  institutions.  The  broker-dealer  or other
financial institution may then resell the shares pursuant to this prospectus (as
amended or  supplemented,  if  required  by  applicable  law,  to reflect  those
transactions).

      The selling security holders and any broker-dealers that act in connection
with the sale of shares may be deemed to be "underwriters" within the meaning of
Section 2(11) of the  Securities Act of 1933,  and any  commissions  received by
broker-dealers  or any  profit on the  resale of the  shares  sold by them while
acting as principals may be deemed to be  underwriting  discounts or commissions
under the Securities  Act. The selling  security  holders may agree to indemnify
any agent,  dealer or broker-dealer that participates in transactions  involving
sales of the shares against liabilities, including liabilities arising under the
Securities Act. We have agreed to indemnify each of the selling security holders
and each selling  security  holder has agreed,  severally  and not  jointly,  to
indemnify us against some  liabilities  in  connection  with the offering of the
shares, including liabilities arising under the Securities Act.

      The selling  security  holders will be subject to the prospectus  delivery
requirements  of the  Securities  Act. We have  informed  the  selling  security
holders that the anti-manipulative  provisions of Regulation M promulgated under
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 may apply to their sales in the market.

      Selling security holders also may resell all or a portion of the shares in
open market  transactions  in reliance upon Rule 144 under the  Securities  Act,
provided they meet the criteria and conform to the requirements of Rule 144.

      Upon  being  notified  by  a  selling  security  holder  that  a  material
arrangement  has been entered into with a  broker-dealer  for the sale of shares
through a block trade,  special  offering,  exchange  distribution  or secondary
distribution  or a purchase by a broker or dealer,  we will file a supplement to
this prospectus,  if required  pursuant to Rule 424(b) under the Securities Act,
disclosing:

- -     the name of each such  selling  security  holder and of the  participating
      broker-dealer(s);

- -     the number of shares involved;

- -     the initial price at which the shares were sold;

- -     the  commissions   paid  or  discounts  or  concessions   allowed  to  the
      broker-dealer(s), where applicable;

- -     that such broker-dealer(s) did not conduct any investigation to verify the
      information set out or incorporated by reference in this prospectus; and

- -     other facts material to the transactions.


                                       55

      In addition,  if required under applicable law or the rules or regulations
of the  Commission,  we will file a supplement to this prospectus when a selling
security  holder  notifies us that a donee or pledgee  intends to sell more than
500 shares of common stock.

      We are paying all expenses and fees in connection with the registration of
the shares. The selling security holders will bear all brokerage or underwriting
discounts or commissions paid to  broker-dealers  in connection with the sale of
the shares.

Re: NexMed, Inc.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

We are  counsel to NexMed,  Inc.  (the  "Company")  and have been  requested  to
furnish you with an opinion with  respect to (a) the removal of the  restrictive
legend from  certificates  representing  shares of the  Company's  common stock,
$0.001  par  value  per  share  (the  "Common  Shares")  currently  held  by the
individuals  and/or  entities who are listed,  and in the amounts set forth,  in
Column  A  on  Schedule  A  attached  hereto   (individually,   a  "Holder"  and
collectively, the "Holders") and (b) certain issuances of the Common Shares upon
exercise  of the  Company's  warrants  listed in Column B on Schedule A attached
hereto (the  "Warrants") in each case held by the Holders and in the amounts set
forth in Column B on Schedule A.

Please be advised that the Common Shares  referred to above have been registered
for resale by the  Holders  under the  Securities  Act of 1933 (the "1933  Act")
pursuant to a Registration  Statement on Form S-3 (File No.  333-_______)  filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission ____________, and declared effective
on _____________ (the "Registration Statement").

For the purposes of rendering the opinions  expressed  herein,  we have examined
and relied upon such  documents as we have deemed  relevant and necessary as the
basis for said opinions.  In such examination we have assumed the genuineness of
all signatures,  the authenticity of all documents  submitted to us as certified
or photostatic  copies, and the authenticity of the originals of such documents.
As to  questions  of fact  material to the opinions  expressed  herein,  we have
relied, without independent  investigation or verification,  upon the statements
of fact  contained  in the  documents  which  we  have  examined.  Based  on the
foregoing,  and with due regard to such legal  considerations  as we have deemed
relevant,  we are of the opinion that for so long as the Company remains current
in its filings  under the  Securities  Exchange Act of 1934 (the "1934 Act") and
the Registration Statement remains effective under the 1933 Act:


                                       60
<PAGE>

1.    upon  your  receipt  of (a) a  legended  certificate  and/or  certificates
      representing  a number of Common Shares set forth opposite a Holder's name
      in  Column  A  of  Schedule  A  attached  hereto,   together  with  (b)  a
      representation  from such  Holder in the form of Annex I  attached  hereto
      stating that it has sold or intends to resell such Common Shares solely in
      accordance with the Registration Statement, certificates representing such
      Common Shares may be issued to such Holder free of any restrictive legend;
      and

2.    upon your receipt of (a) written  instructions  from the  Secretary of the
      Company  stating  that  any  Warrants  held by a  Holder  have  been  duly
      exercised,  and the  number  of  Common  Shares  to be  issued  upon  such
      exercise,  together with (b) a representation from such Holder identifying
      the Warrants that it is exercising  into Common Shares and stating that it
      has  current  plans to resell such Common  Shares in  accordance  with the
      Registration  Statement  in the form of the  representation  contained  in
      Annex I (which  representation  may be contained in the Subscription  Form
      delivered upon exercise of such Warrants),  certificates representing such
      Common Shares, in an amount up to the number of unissued Common Shares set
      forth  opposite  such  Holder's  name in Column B of  Schedule  A attached
      hereto,  may be issued to such  Holder in  accordance  with the  Company's
      instructions, free of any restrictive legend.

This is to  advise  you  that,  to the  extent  a  Holder  does  not  furnish  a
representation  letter as set forth in  paragraphs  1 or 2 above for any  Common
Shares,  then  certificates  for those  Common  Shares  should be issued  with a
restrictive legend.

This opinion  letter being  provided to you as of the date hereof in  connection
with the issuance of certificates representing up to the number of Common Shares
set forth  opposite the names of the Holders listed on Schedule A, is solely for
your benefit and may not be used, circulated, quoted or otherwise referred to or
relied  upon  by you for any  other  purpose,  or by any  other  person  for any
purpose, without our prior written consent.

Very truly yours.
