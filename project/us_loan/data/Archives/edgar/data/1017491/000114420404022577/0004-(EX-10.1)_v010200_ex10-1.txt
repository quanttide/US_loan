Exhibit 10 1 - Purchase Agreement (2).DOC

      COMMON STOCK AND WARRANT PURCHASE  AGREEMENT (the "Agreement") dated as of
December  17,  2004,  by and  among  NexMed,  Inc.,  a Nevada  corporation  (the
"Seller"),  and  each of the  persons  listed  on  Schedule  1  hereto  (each is
individually referred to as a "Purchaser" and collectively, the "Purchasers").

                                 W I T N E S S:

      WHEREAS,  each of the  Purchasers  is willing to purchase from the Seller,
and the Seller desires to sell to the Purchasers,  shares of the Seller's common
stock, $0.001 par value (the "Common Stock"), and Common Stock Purchase Warrants
in the form of Exhibit A hereto (the "A  Warrants")  and Common  Stock  Purchase
Warrants in the form of Exhibit B hereto (the "B  Warrants",  and together  with
the A Warrants,  the "Warrants")  each entitling the holders thereof to purchase
additional  shares  of  Common  Stock  pursuant  to the  terms  thereof,  for an
aggregate purchase price up to $7.1 million, as more fully set forth herein.

      NOW   THEREFORE,   in   consideration   of   the   mutual   promises   and
representations,  warranties,  covenants and  agreements  set forth herein,  the
parties hereto, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree as follows:

                          ARTICLE I - PURCHASE AND SALE

      1.1 Purchase and Sale.

      (a) On the  terms  and  subject  to  the  conditions  set  forth  in  this
Agreement,  at the Closing (as defined in Section 2.2), the Seller will sell and
each of the  Purchasers  will  purchase the number of shares of Common Stock set
forth on  Schedule 1 hereto at a price per share  equal to $1.28.  In  addition,
each  Purchaser  shall  receive at the Closing  (i) A Warrants  to purchase  the
number of shares of Common Stock equal to 40% of the number of Shares  purchased
by such  Purchaser  at Closing  hereunder  as set forth on Schedule 1 hereto and
(ii) B Warrants to purchase the number of shares of Common Stock equal to 10% of
the number of Shares  purchased by such  Purchaser  at Closing  hereunder as set
forth on Schedule 1 hereto.

      (b) The shares of Common  Stock to be issued upon  Closing  hereunder  are
referred to herein as the "Shares," and the shares of Common Stock issuable upon
exercise of the Warrants are referred to herein as the "Warrant Shares."

      1.2 Terms of the Warrants.  The terms and provisions of the A Warrants are
more  fully set  forth in the form of Common  Stock  Purchase  Warrant  attached
hereto as Exhibit  A, and the terms and  provisions  of the B Warrants  are more
fully set forth in the form of Common Stock Purchase  Warrant attached hereto as
Exhibit B.

      1.3 Transfers; Legends.

      (a) Except as required by federal  securities  laws and the securities law
of any  state or other  jurisdiction  within  the  United  States,  the  Shares,
Warrants and Warrant Shares (collectively, the "Securities") may be transferred,
in whole or in part,  by any of the  Purchasers  at any time.  Any such transfer
shall be made by a Purchaser in accordance  with  applicable  law. In connection
with any transfer of Securities other than pursuant to an effective registration
statement under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities  Act"),

                                       1
<PAGE>

or to the Seller,  the Seller may require the  transferor  thereof to furnish to
the Seller an opinion of counsel  selected by the  transferor,  such counsel and
the form and substance of which opinion shall be reasonably  satisfactory to the
Seller and Seller's  counsel,  to the effect that such transfer does not require
registration under the Securities Act; provided,  that in the case of a transfer
pursuant to Rule 144 under the  Securities  Act, no opinion shall be required if
the  transferor  provides  the Seller with a customary  seller's  representation
letter,  and if such sale is not  pursuant  to  subsection  (k) of Rule  144,  a
customary  broker's  representation  letter  and Form 144.  Notwithstanding  the
foregoing,  the Seller hereby consents to and agrees to register on the books of
the Seller and with any transfer agent for the securities of the Seller, without
any such  legal  opinion,  any  transfer  of  Securities  by a  Purchaser  to an
Affiliate  of such  Purchaser,  provided  that the  transferee  certifies to the
Seller that it is an Affiliate of such Purchaser and an "accredited investor" as
defined in Rule 501(a) under the  Securities  Act and that it is  acquiring  the
Securities solely for investment purposes (subject to the qualifications hereof)
and not  with a view  to,  or for,  resale,  distribution  or  fractionalization
thereof in whole or in part in violation of the  Securities  Act. Any transferee
shall agree to be bound by the terms of the Investor  Rights  Agreement and this
Agreement.  The Seller shall reissue certificates evidencing the Securities upon
surrender  of  certificates  evidencing  the  Securities  being  transferred  in
accordance with this Section 1.3(a). In connection with any transfer of Warrants
after the Registration  Statement (as defined in the Investor Rights  Agreement)
is declared  effective under the Securities Act, the transferor of such Warrants
shall  reimburse the Seller for its reasonable out of pocket costs in connection
with such transfer  (including without limitation the reasonable  attorneys fees
for preparing and filing a prospectus  supplement with the SEC and/or delivering
an updated opinion letter to the Seller's  transfer agent). An "Affiliate" means
any Person (as such term is defined below) that,  directly or indirectly through
one or more  intermediaries,  controls or is  controlled  by or is under  common
control with a Person,  as such terms are used in and  construed  under Rule 144
under the Securities  Act. With respect to a Purchaser,  any investment  fund or
managed account that is managed on a discretionary  basis by the same investment
manager as such Purchaser will be deemed to be an Affiliate of such Purchaser. A
"Person" means any individual or corporation,  partnership,  trust, incorporated
or unincorporated  association,  joint venture, limited liability company, joint
stock company,  government (or an agency or subdivision of any thereof) or other
entity of any kind.

      (b) The  certificates  representing  the  Shares,  unless  such Shares are
eligible for resale without registration pursuant to Rule 144(k) under the t 6 0
Exchange Act, shall bear the following legend:

"THE SHARES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE
SECURITIES  ACT OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED,  AND MAY NOT BE  OFFERED  OR SOLD IN THE
ABSENCE OF AN EFFECTIVE  REGISTRATION  STATEMENT  UNDER SAID ACT UNLESS,  IN THE
OPINION OF COUNSEL REASONABLY  SATISFACTORY TO THE SELLER,  SUCH REGISTRATION IS
NOT REQUIRED."

"THE  SALE,  TRANSFER  OR  ASSIGNMENT  OF THE  SECURITIES  REPRESENTED  BY  THIS
CERTIFICATE IS SUBJECT TO THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF A CERTAIN  INVESTOR RIGHTS
AGREEMENT DATED AS OF DECEMBER 17, 2004, AS AMENDED FROM TIME TO TIME, AMONG THE
COMPANY  AND  CERTAIN  HOLDERS  OF ITS  OUTSTANDING  SECURITIES.  COPIES OF SUCH
AGREEMENT  MAY BE OBTAINED AT NO COST BY WRITTEN  REQUEST  MADE BY THE HOLDER OF
RECORD OF THIS CERTIFICATE TO THE SECRETARY OF THE COMPANY."

                                       2
<PAGE>

                     ARTICLE II - PURCHASE PRICE AND CLOSING

      2.1 Purchase Price. The aggregate purchase price (the "Purchase Price") to
be paid by the Purchasers to the Seller to acquire the Shares and the applicable
Warrants shall be the total amounts set forth on Schedule 1 hereto.

      2.2 The Closing.  The closing of the transactions  contemplated under this
Agreement (the  "Closing")  will take place as promptly as  practicable,  but no
later  than  five (5)  business  days  following  satisfaction  or waiver of the
conditions set forth in Article  6.1(a) and 6.2(a) (other than those  conditions
which by their terms are not to be satisfied or waived  until the  Closing),  at
the offices of Peter J. Weisman, P.C., 335 Madison Avenue, Suite 1702, New York,
NY 10017. The date on which the Closing occurs is the "Closing Date."

      ARTICLE III - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE SELLER

      The Seller represents and warrants to the Purchasers as follows:

      3.1  Corporate  Existence  and  Power;  Subsidiaries.  The  Seller and its
Subsidiaries are corporations  duly  incorporated,  validly existing and in good
standing  under the laws of the state in which they are  incorporated,  and have
all corporate  powers required to carry on their business as now conducted.  The
Seller and its  Subsidiaries  are duly  qualified  to do  business  as a foreign
corporation and are in good standing in each jurisdiction where the character of
the  property  owned or leased by them or the nature of their  activities  makes
such qualification  necessary,  except for those jurisdictions where the failure
to be so qualified would not have a Material Adverse Effect on the Seller or any
of its Subsidiaries.  For purposes of this Agreement, the term "Material Adverse
Effect" means,  with respect to any person or entity,  a material adverse effect
on its and its  Subsidiaries'  condition  (financial  or  otherwise),  business,
properties,  assets, liabilities (including contingent liabilities),  results of
operations or current  prospects,  taken as a whole. True and complete copies of
the Seller's Articles of Incorporation,  as amended,  and Bylaws, as amended, as
currently in effect and as will be in effect on the Closing Date  (collectively,
the "Articles and Bylaws"), have previously been provided to the Purchasers. For
purposes of this Agreement,  the term "Subsidiary" or "Subsidiaries" means, with
respect to any entity, any corporation or other organization of which securities
or other ownership interests having ordinary voting power to elect a majority of
the  board of  directors  or other  persons  performing  similar  functions  are
directly or indirectly owned by such entity or of which such entity is a partner
or is, directly or indirectly,  the beneficial owner of 50% or more of any class
of equity securities or equivalent profit  participation  interests.  The Seller
has no Subsidiaries  other than the following,  each of which,  unless otherwise
indicated, is wholly-owned by the Seller:

            (a) NexMed Holdings, Inc., a Delaware corporation,

            (b) NexMed (U.S.A.), Inc., a Delaware corporation,


                                       3

            (c) NexMed  International  Limited,  organized  under British Virgin
Islands law,

                  (1)   NexMed (Americas)  Limited,  organized under Nova Scotia
                        law   and   a   wholly-owned    subsidiary   of   NexMed
                        International Limited, and

                  (2)   NexMed  International  (Hong Kong) Ltd.  organized under
                        Hong Kong law and a  wholly-owned  subsidiary  of NexMed
                        International Limited.

      3.2 Corporate  Authorization.  The execution,  delivery and performance by
the Seller of this Agreement,  the Warrants, the Investor Rights Agreement,  the
Closing Escrow  Agreement (as defined  below),  and each of the other  documents
executed  pursuant to and in connection with this Agreement  (collectively,  the
"Related  Documents"),  and the  consummation of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby and thereby (including,  but not limited to, the sale and delivery of the
Shares and the Warrants,  and the subsequent issuance of the Warrant Shares upon
exercise of the Warrants) have been duly authorized, and no additional corporate
or  stockholder  action is  required  for the  approval of this  Agreement.  The
Warrant  Shares  have  been duly  reserved  for  issuance  by the  Seller.  This
Agreement  and the Related  Documents  have been or, to the extent  contemplated
hereby or by the Related  Documents,  will be duly  executed and  delivered  and
constitute  the legal,  valid and binding  agreement of the Seller,  enforceable
against the Seller in accordance  with their terms,  except as may be limited by
bankruptcy,  reorganization,  insolvency, moratorium and similar laws of general
application relating to or affecting the enforcement of rights of creditors, and
except as  enforceability  of its  obligations  hereunder are subject to general
principles of equity (regardless of whether such enforceability is considered in
a proceeding in equity or at law).

      3.3 Charter,  Bylaws and Corporate Records. The minute books of the Seller
and its  Subsidiaries  contain complete and accurate records of all meetings and
other  corporate  actions of the board of directors,  committees of the board of
directors,  incorporators  and  stockholders of the Seller and its  Subsidiaries
from September 15, 1995 to the date hereof. All material corporate decisions and
actions have been validly made or taken. All corporate books,  including without
limitation  the  share  transfer  register,  comply  with  applicable  laws  and
regulations  and have been  regularly  updated.  Such books fully and  correctly
reflect all the decisions of the stockholders.

the  filing  of  the  Registration  Statement  with  the  Commission;  (iv)  the

Warrant  Shares for trading  thereon;  and (v) any filings  required under state
securities  laws  that are  permitted  to be made  after  the date  hereof,  the
execution,  delivery and  performance  by the Seller of this  Agreement  and the
Related Documents, and the consummation of the transactions  contemplated hereby
and thereby (including,  but not limited to, the sale and delivery of the Shares
and Warrants and the subsequent  issuance of the Warrant Shares upon exercise of
the Warrants,  as  applicable)  by the Seller require no action by or in respect
of, or filing with, any governmental  body, agency,  official or authority.  The
Seller has disclosed the terms and  conditions  and other  relevant facts of the
transactions  contemplated  hereby to Nasdaq and obtained from Nasdaq its verbal
assurance that such  transactions will not be integrated with any prior issuance
or offering of the Seller for purposes of the Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder
approval of the issuance of 20% or more of an issuer's outstanding common stock.


                                       4
<PAGE>

      3.5  Non-Contravention.  The  execution,  delivery and  performance by the
Seller of this Agreement and the Related Documents,  and the consummation by the
Seller of the  transactions  contemplated  hereby  and  thereby  (including  the
issuance of the Shares and Warrant Shares) do not and will not (a) contravene or
conflict with the Articles and Bylaws of the Seller and its  Subsidiaries or any
material  agreement to which the Seller is a party or by which it is bound;  (b)
contravene  or conflict  with or  constitute a violation of any provision of any
law,  regulation,   judgment,  injunction,  order  or  decree  binding  upon  or
applicable to the Seller or its Subsidiaries; (c) constitute a default (or would
constitute a default with notice or lapse of time or both) under or give rise to
a right of  termination,  cancellation  or  acceleration  or loss of any benefit
under any  material  agreement,  contract or other  instrument  binding upon the
Seller or its Subsidiaries or under any material license,  franchise,  permit or
other  similar  authorization  held by the  Seller or its  Subsidiaries;  or (d)
result in the creation or imposition of any Lien (as defined below) on any asset
of the Seller or its  Subsidiaries.  For  purposes of this  Agreement,  the term
"Lien" means,  with respect to any asset, any mortgage,  lien,  pledge,  charge,
security interest, claim or encumbrance of any kind in respect of such asset.

      3.6 SEC Documents.  The Seller is obligated under the Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934,  as  amended  (the  "Exchange  Act") to file  reports  pursuant  to
Sections 13 or 15(d)  thereof (all such reports filed or required to be filed by
the Seller, including all exhibits thereto or incorporated therein by reference,
and all  documents  filed by the Seller  under the  Securities  Act  hereinafter
called the "SEC Documents"). The Seller has filed all reports or other documents
required to be filed under the  Exchange  Act.  All SEC  Documents  filed by the
Seller as of or for any period  beginning on or after January 1, 2002,  (i) were
prepared in all material  respects in accordance  with the  requirements  of the
Exchange  Act and (ii) did not at the time they were  filed  (or,  if amended or
superseded  by a  filing  prior  to the  date  hereof,  then on the date of such
filing)  contain  any untrue  statement  of a  material  fact or omit to state a
material  fact  required to be stated  therein or necessary in order to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not misleading.  The Seller has previously  delivered to the Purchaser a correct
and complete copy of each report (including,  without limitation, the 2004 Proxy
Statement)  which the Seller filed with the Securities  and Exchange  Commission
(the "SEC" or the "Commission")  under the Exchange Act for any period ending on
or after December 31, 2003 (the "Recent Reports"). None of the information about
the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries which has been disclosed to the Purchasers
herein or in the course of  discussions  and  negotiations  with respect  hereto
which  is not  disclosed  in the  Recent  Reports  is or was  required  to be so
disclosed,  and no material  non-public  information  has been  disclosed to the
Purchasers.

      3.7  Financial  Statements.  Each  of the  Seller's  audited  consolidated
balance  sheet and related  consolidated  statements  of income,  cash flows and
changes in stockholders'  equity (including the related notes) as of and for the
years ended  December 31, 2003 and December 31, 2002, as contained in the Recent
Reports  (collectively,  the "Seller's  Financial  Statements" or the "Financial
Statements") (x) present fairly in all material respects the financial  position
of the  Seller  and its  Subsidiaries  on a  consolidated  basis as of the dates
thereof and the results of operations, cash flows and stockholders' equity as of
and for each of the periods then ended, and (y) were prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting  principals ("GAAP") applied on a consistent basis
throughout the periods involved,  in each case, except as otherwise indicated in
the notes thereto.


                                       5
<PAGE>

      3.8 Compliance with Law. The Seller and its Subsidiaries are in compliance
and have  conducted  their  business  so as to comply  with all laws,  rules and
regulations,  judgments,  decrees or orders of any court, administrative agency,
commission,   regulatory   authority   or  other   governmental   authority   or
instrumentality,  domestic  or  foreign,  applicable  to their  operations,  the
violation of which would cause a Material Adverse Affect. There are no judgments
or orders, injunctions,  decrees,  stipulations or awards (whether rendered by a
court or  administrative  agency or by arbitration),  including any such actions
relating to affirmative action claims or claims of  discrimination,  against the
Seller or its Subsidiaries or against any of their properties or businesses.

      3.9 No Defaults.  The Seller and its  Subsidiaries  are not, nor have they
received  notice that they would be with the passage of time,  giving of notice,
or both,  (i) in violation of any provision of their Articles and Bylaws (ii) in
default or  violation of any term,  condition or provision of (A) any  judgment,
decree,  order,  injunction  or  stipulation  applicable  to the  Seller  or its
Subsidiaries or (B) any material agreement, note, mortgage, indenture, contract,
lease or  instrument,  permit,  concession,  franchise  or  license to which the
Seller  or  its  Subsidiaries  are a  party  or  by  which  the  Seller  or  its
Subsidiaries or their  properties or assets may be bound,  and no  circumstances
exist which would entitle any party to any material agreement,  note,  mortgage,
indenture,   contract,   lease  or  instrument  to  which  such  Seller  or  its
Subsidiaries  are a party,  to terminate  such as a result of such Seller or its
Subsidiaries,  having failed to meet any material  provision thereof  including,
but not  limited  to,  meeting  any  applicable  milestone  under  any  material
agreement or contract.

      3.10 Litigation.  Except as disclosed in the Recent Reports or on Schedule
3.10, there is no action,  suit,  proceeding,  judgment,  claim or investigation
pending or, to the best knowledge of the Seller,  threatened  against the Seller
and its Subsidiaries which could,  individually or in the aggregate,  reasonably
be expected to have a Material  Adverse Effect on the Seller or its Subsidiaries
or  which  in any  manner  challenges  or seeks  to  prevent,  enjoin,  alter or
materially delay any of the transactions  contemplated  hereby,  and there is no
basis for the assertion of any of the foregoing.

      There are no claims or  complaints  existing  or, to the  knowledge of the
Seller or its  Subsidiaries,  threatened for product liability in respect of any
product of the Seller or its  Subsidiaries,  and the Seller and its Subsidiaries
are not aware of any basis for the assertion of any such claim.

      3.11 Absence of Certain  Changes.  Since December 31, 2003, the Seller has
conducted its business  only in the ordinary  course and there has not occurred,
except as set forth in the Recent Reports or any exhibit thereto or incorporated

credit set forth on  Schedule  3.11(e))  or any  making of any loan,  advance or

      (f)  Any  entry  into,  amendment  of,   relinquishment,   termination  or

Seller and its Subsidiaries do not have any material  liabilities or obligations
(absolute,  accrued, contingent or otherwise) which, and (ii) there has not been
any aspect of the prior or current  conduct of the business of the Seller or its
Subsidiaries  which may form the basis for any material claim by any third party
which if asserted  could result in any such material  liabilities or obligations
which,  are not fully  reflected,  reserved  against or disclosed in the balance
sheet of the Seller as at December 31, 2003.

      3.13 Taxes.  All tax  returns  and tax  reports  required to be filed with
respect  to the  income,  operations,  business  or assets of the Seller and its
Subsidiaries  have  been  timely  filed  (or  appropriate  extensions  have been
obtained) with the appropriate  governmental  agencies in all  jurisdictions  in
which  such  returns  and  reports  are  required  to be  filed,  and all of the
foregoing  as filed are correct and  complete  and,  in all  material  respects,
reflect  accurately  all liability for taxes of the Seller and its  Subsidiaries
for the periods to which such  returns  relate,  and all amounts  shown as owing
thereon have been paid. All income, profits, franchise, sales, use, value added,
occupancy,  property, excise, payroll,  withholding,  FICA, FUTA and other taxes
(including interest and penalties), if any, collectible or payable by the Seller
and its  Subsidiaries  or relating to or chargeable  against any of its material
assets, revenues or income or relating to any employee,  independent contractor,
creditor,  stockholder or other third party through the Closing Date, were fully
collected  and paid by such date if due by such date or provided for by adequate
reserves in the Financial  Statements  as of and for the periods ended  December
31, 2003 (other than taxes  accruing  after such date) and all similar items due
through the Closing  Date will have been fully paid by that date or provided for
by adequate  reserves,  whether or not any such taxes were reported or reflected
in any tax returns or filings.  No  taxation  authority  has sought to audit the
records of the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries for the purpose of verifying or
disputing  any tax  returns,  reports or  related  information  and  disclosures
provided  to  such  taxation  authority,  or  for  the  Seller's  or  any of its
Subsidiaries'  alleged  failure  to  provide  any such tax  returns,  reports or
related information and disclosure. No material claims or deficiencies have been
asserted  against or inquiries raised with the Seller or any of its Subsidiaries
with respect to any taxes or other governmental charges or levies which have not
been paid or otherwise  satisfied,  including claims that, or inquiries whether,
the Seller or any of its  Subsidiaries  has not filed a tax  return  that it was
required to file,  and, to the best of the Seller's  knowledge,  there exists no
reasonable  basis for the making of any such  claims or  inquiries.  Neither the
Seller nor any of its  Subsidiaries has waived any restrictions on assessment or
collection of taxes or consented to the extension of any statute of  limitations
relating to taxation.

      3.24 Products and  Services.  To the knowledge of the Seller and except as
disclosed  in the Recent  Reports,  there exists no set of facts (i) which could
furnish  a  basis  for  the  withdrawal,   suspension  or  cancellation  of  any

governmental  or  regulatory  agency  with  respect  to any  product  or service
developed  or  provided  by the Seller or its  Subsidiaries,  (ii)  which  could
furnish a basis for the  withdrawal,  suspension or cancellation by order of any
state, federal or foreign court of law of any product or service, or (iii) which

of the Seller or its  Subsidiaries  or which could otherwise cause the Seller or
its Subsidiaries to withdraw, suspend or cancel any such product or service from
the  market or to change the  marketing  classification  of any such  product or
service. Each product or service provided by Seller or its Subsidiaries has been
provided in accordance in all material  respects with the  specifications  under
which  such  product  or  service  normally  is and has  been  provided  and the
provisions of all applicable laws or regulations.

      3.25 Environmental  Matters. None of the premises or any properties owned,
occupied or leased by the Seller or its  Subsidiaries  (the "Premises") has been

been designated to be a "hazardous  substance"  under  applicable  Environmental
Laws  (hereinafter  defined)  ("Hazardous   Substances")  in  violation  of  any
applicable Environmental Laws. To its knowledge, the Seller has not disposed of,
discharged,  emitted or released any Hazardous  Substances  which would require,
under  applicable  Environmental  Laws,  remediation,  investigation  or similar
response  activity.  No  Hazardous  Substances  are  present  as a result of the
actions of the Seller or, to the Seller's knowledge, any other Person, in, on or
under  the  Premises  which  would  give  rise  to  any  liability  or  clean-up
obligations of the Seller under applicable  Environmental  Laws. The Seller and,
to the  Seller's  knowledge,  any  other  Person  for  whose  conduct  it may be
responsible  pursuant to an agreement or by operation of law, are in  compliance
with all  laws,  regulations  and  other  federal,  state or local  governmental
requirements,  and all applicable judgments,  orders,  writs, notices,  decrees,
permits, licenses,  approvals,  consents or injunctions in effect on the date of
this Agreement relating to the generation, management, handling, transportation,
treatment,  disposal, storage, delivery,  discharge,  release or emission of any
Hazardous Substance (the "Environmental  Laws").  Neither the Seller nor, to the
Seller's  knowledge,  any other Person for whose  conduct it may be  responsible
pursuant  to an  agreement  or by  operation  of law has  received  any  written
complaint,  notice,  order,  or citation of any  actual,  threatened  or alleged
noncompliance  with any of the  Environmental  Laws, and there is no proceeding,
suit or investigation pending or, to the Seller's knowledge,  threatened against
the Seller or, to the  Seller's  knowledge,  any such Person with respect to any
violation or alleged violation of the Environmental  Laws, and, to the knowledge
of the Seller,  there is no basis for the  institution  of any such  proceeding,
suit or investigation.

"Governmental  Authorizations").  All the Governmental  Authorizations have been
duly issued or obtained and are in full force and effect, and the Seller and its
Subsidiaries  are in material  compliance with the terms of all the Governmental
Authorizations. The Seller and its Subsidiaries have not engaged in any activity

Governmental  Authorizations will not be renewed by the appropriate governmental
authorities  in  the  ordinary  course.  Neither  the  execution,  delivery  nor
performance of this Agreement  shall  adversely  affect the status of any of the
Governmental Authorizations.

      3.28  Securities  Laws.  Neither the Seller nor its  Subsidiaries  nor any

          ARTICLE IV - REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE PURCHASERS

      Each  Purchaser,  for  itself  only,  hereby  severally  and not  jointly,
represents and warrants to the Seller as follows:

      4.1 Existence and Power. The Purchaser is duly organized, validly existing
and in good  standing  under the laws of the  jurisdiction  of such  Purchaser's
organization. The Purchaser has all powers required to carry on such Purchaser's
business as now conducted.

      4.2  Authorization.   The  execution,  delivery  and  performance  by  the
Purchaser of this Agreement,  the Related Documents to which such Purchaser is a
party, and the  consummation by the Purchaser of the  transactions  contemplated
hereby  and  thereby  have been duly  authorized,  and no  additional  action is
required  for the  approval of this  Agreement  or the Related  Documents.  This
Agreement and the Related  Documents to which the Purchaser is a party have been
or, to the extent  contemplated  hereby, will be duly executed and delivered and
constitute valid and binding  agreements of the Purchaser,  enforceable  against
such  Purchaser  in  accordance  with their  terms,  except as may be limited by
bankruptcy,  reorganization,  insolvency, moratorium and similar laws of general
application  relating to or affecting the enforcement of rights of creditors and
except  that  enforceability  of their  obligations  thereunder  are  subject to
general  principles  of equity  (regardless  of whether such  enforceability  is
considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

      4.3 Investment. The Purchaser is acquiring the securities described herein
for its own account and not with a view to, or for sale in connection  with, any
distribution  thereof,  nor with the intention of  distributing or reselling the
same, provided, however, that by making the representation herein, the Purchaser
does not agree to hold any of the  securities  for any minimum or other specific
term  and  reserves  the  right  to  dispose  of the  securities  at any time in
accordance  with or pursuant to a registration  statement or an exemption  under
the Securities  Act. The Purchaser is aware that none of the securities has been
registered under the Securities Act or under applicable state securities or blue
sky laws. The Purchaser is an  "Accredited  Investor" as such term is defined in
Rule 501 of Regulation D, as  promulgated  under the  Securities  Act (including
without  limitation,  if the  Purchaser  is an employee  benefit plan within the
meaning  of  the  Employee   Retirement  Income  Security  Act  of  1974  and  a
self-directed  plan, then  investment  decisions are made solely by persons that
are "Accredited Investors").

      4.4 Reliance on Exemptions.  The Purchaser understands that the Shares and
Warrants are being offered and sold to such  Purchaser in reliance upon specific
exemptions from the registration requirements of United States federal and state
securities  laws and that the Seller is relying  upon the truth and accuracy of,
and  such  Purchaser's   compliance  with,  the   representations,   warranties,
agreements,  acknowledgments  and  understandings  of such  Purchaser  set forth
herein  in  order to  determine  the  availability  of such  exemptions  and the
eligibility of such Purchaser to acquire the securities.

      4.5 Experience of the Purchaser.  The Purchaser,  either alone or together
with its representatives,  has such knowledge,  sophistication and experience in
business and financial  matters so as to be capable of evaluating the merits and
risks of the prospective investment in the Securities,  and has so evaluated the
merits and risks of such investment.  The Purchaser is able to bear the economic
risk of an  investment  in the  securities  and, at the present time, is able to
afford a complete loss of such investment.


                                       14
<PAGE>

      4.6 General  Solicitation.  The Purchaser is not purchasing the Securities
as a  result  of any  advertisement,  article,  notice  or  other  communication
regarding the securities  published in any newspaper,  magazine or similar media
or broadcast  over  television or radio or presented at any seminar or any other
general solicitation or general advertisement.

               ARTICLE V - COVENANTS OF THE SELLER AND PURCHASERS

      5.1 Insurance.  The Seller and its Subsidiaries  shall,  from time to time
upon the  written  request of the  Purchasers,  promptly  furnish or cause to be

to the Securities Act relating to the issuance or registration of the Shares and
the Warrant Shares and filed by the Seller with the Commission or any securities

however,  that the Seller shall have no obligation to deliver  periodic  reports
(pursuant to the Exchange Act) under this Section 5.2 to the extent such reports
are publicly available.

      The  Purchasers  are hereby  authorized to deliver a copy of any financial
statement  or any other  information  relating to the  business,  operations  or
financial  condition  of  the  Seller  which  may  have  been  furnished  to the

to succeed to all or any part of the Purchasers'  interest in the Seller or this
Agreement.

      5.3  Investigation.   The  representations,   warranties,   covenants  and
agreements  set forth in this  Agreement  shall not be affected or diminished in
any way by any  investigation  (or failure to  investigate) at any time by or on
behalf  of  the  party  for  whose  benefit  such  representations,  warranties,
covenants  and  agreements  were made.  Without  limiting the  generality of the
foregoing,  the  inability or failure of the  Purchasers to discover any breach,
default or  misrepresentation  by the Seller under this Agreement or the Related
Documents   (including  under  any  certificate   furnished   pursuant  to  this
Agreement),  notwithstanding  the exercise by the Purchasers or other holders of
the Shares of their rights  hereunder to conduct an  investigation  shall not in
any way diminish any liability hereunder.

      5.4 Further  Assurances.  The Seller shall, at its cost and expense,  upon
written request of the Purchasers, duly execute and deliver, or cause to be duly
executed and delivered,  to the Purchasers  such further  instruments and do and
cause to be done such further acts as may be necessary,  advisable or proper, at
the reasonable  request of the  Purchasers,  to carry out more  effectually  the
provisions  and  purposes of this  Agreement.  The parties  shall use their best
efforts to timely satisfy each of the conditions described in Article VI of this
Agreement.

      5.5 Use of Proceeds.  The Seller covenants and agrees that the proceeds of
the Purchase  Price shall be used by the Seller for working  capital and general
corporate purposes;  under no circumstances shall any portion of the proceeds be
applied to:

            (i) accelerated repayment of debt existing on the date hereof;

            (ii) the payment of dividends or other  distributions on any capital
stock of the Seller;

            (iii)  increased  executive   compensation  or  loans  to  officers,

including the Seller and its Subsidiaries,  except in connection with investment

maturities of one year or less; or

            (v) any  expenditure  not  directly  related to the  business of the
Seller.

      5.6 Corporate Existence.  So long as a Purchaser owns Shares,  Warrants or
Warrant   Shares,   the  Seller  shall  preserve  and  maintain  and  cause  its
Subsidiaries  to  preserve  and  maintain  their  corporate  existence  and good
standing in the jurisdiction of their  incorporation and the rights,  privileges
and franchises of the Seller and its Subsidiaries  (except, in each case, in the
event of a merger or consolidation in which the Seller or its  Subsidiaries,  as
applicable,  is not the  surviving  entity)  in each case  where  failure  to so
preserve  or  maintain  could have a Material  Adverse  Effect on the  financial
condition,  business or operations of the Seller and its Subsidiaries taken as a
whole.

      5.7  Licenses.  The Seller  shall,  and shall cause its  Subsidiaries  to,
maintain at all times all material  licenses or permits necessary to the conduct
of its business and as required by any  governmental  agency or  instrumentality
thereof, including without limitation all FDA clearances and approvals.

      5.8 Taxes and Claims.  The Seller and its Subsidiaries  shall duly pay and
discharge (a) all material taxes,  assessments and governmental  charges upon or
against  the  Seller  or its  properties  or  assets  prior to the date on which
penalties  attach  thereto,  unless and to the extent  that such taxes are being
diligently  contested  in  good  faith  and  by  appropriate  proceedings,   and
appropriate reserves therefor have been established, and (b) all material lawful
claims, whether for labor, materials,  supplies, services or anything else which
might or could, if unpaid, become a lien or charge upon the properties or assets
of the Seller or its  Subsidiaries  unless and to the extent  only that the same
are being diligently contested in good faith and by appropriate  proceedings and
appropriate reserves therefor have been established.


                                       16

      5.9 Perform Covenants. The Seller shall duly comply with all the terms and
covenants contained herein and in each of the instruments and documents given to
the  Purchasers in  connection  with or pursuant to this  Agreement,  all at the
times and places and in the manner set forth herein or therein.

      5.10 Additional Covenants.

      (a) Except for  transactions  approved by a majority of the  disinterested
directors  of  the  Board  of  Directors,  neither  the  Seller  nor  any of its
Subsidiaries  shall  enter  into any  transaction  with any  director,  officer,
employee or holder of more than 5% of the outstanding capital stock of any class
or series of capital stock of the Seller or any of its  Subsidiaries,  member of
the family of any such person, or any corporation,  partnership,  trust or other
entity in which any such person,  or member of the family of any such person, is
a  director,  officer,  trustee,  partner  or  holder  of  more  than  5% of the
outstanding capital stock thereof,  with the exception of transactions which are
consummated  upon terms that are no less  favorable  than would be  available if
such transaction had been effected at arms-length, in the reasonable judgment of
the Board of Directors.

      (b) The Seller  shall  timely  prepare  and file with the  Securities  and
Exchange Commission the form of notice of the sale of securities pursuant to the
requirements of Regulation D regarding the sale of the Shares and Warrants under
this Agreement.

      (c) The Seller shall timely prepare and file such  applications,  consents
to  service  of  process  (but not  including  a general  consent  to service of
process)  and  similar  documents  and take such other  steps and  perform  such
further acts as shall be required by the state  securities law  requirements  of
each  jurisdiction  where a Purchaser  resides as  indicated  on Schedule 1 with
respect to the sale of the Shares and Warrants under this Agreement.

      (d) Neither the Seller nor any of its Affiliates, nor any Person acting on
its or their behalf,  shall  directly or indirectly  make any offers or sales of
any securities or solicit any offers to buy any securities  under  circumstances
that would cause the loss of the 4(2) exemption under the Securities Act for the
transactions  contemplated hereby.  Subject to any consent or approval rights of
the Purchasers  hereunder,  in the event the Seller  contemplates an offering of
its equity or debt securities  within six months following the Closing Date, the
Seller  agrees that it shall notify the  Purchasers  of such  offering  (without
providing any material non-public information to any Purchaser without its prior
approval), and upon the reasonable request of Purchasers purchasing at least 75%
of the  Shares  hereunder,  the  Seller  shall  first  disclose  the  terms  and
conditions and other  relevant facts of such proposed  transaction to Nasdaq and


                                       17
<PAGE>

obtain from Nasdaq its assurance  that such  transaction  will not be integrated
with the  offering  which is the subject of this  Agreement  for purposes of the
Nasdaq rules requiring shareholder approval of the issuance of 20% or more of an
issuer's  outstanding common stock. In the event the Seller fails to obtain such
assurance,  then the Seller shall not issue or sell any such securities  without
the prior written  consent of  Purchasers  purchasing at least 75% of the Shares
hereunder,  provided that the Seller may sell or issue  securities  without such
consent if (i) it obtains prior  shareholder  approval for such sale or issuance
in  compliance  with  NASD  rules  or  (ii)  such  sale  or  issuance  is  to  a
pharmaceutical  company  in  connection  with a  strategic  transaction  and not
primarily  as a  capital  raising  transaction,  so long as the  Seller  has not
affirmatively  been  notified  (orally  or in  writing)  by  Nasdaq  that  it is
reasonably  likely to treat such sale or issuance as being  integrated  with the
transactions   contemplated  under  this  Agreement.   In  the  event  that  the
transactions  contemplated  under this Agreement are deemed  integrated with any
other transaction(s) by the NASD, then the Seller shall as soon as possible seek
the approval of its  stockholders  and take such other  action to authorize  the
issuance of the full number of Shares and Warrant  Shares and the full amount of
securities issued and/or to be issued in such other transaction.

      5.11 Securities  Laws  Disclosure;  Publicity.  The Seller shall (i) on or
promptly  after the Closing Date,  issue a press release  acceptable to The Tail
Wind Fund Ltd. disclosing the transactions  contemplated  hereby, and (ii) after
the Closing Date,  file with the  Commission a Report on Form 8-K disclosing the
transactions  contemplated hereby. Except as provided in the preceding sentence,
neither  the Seller  nor the  Purchasers  shall make any press  release or other
publicity  about the terms of this  Agreement or the  transactions  contemplated
hereby without the prior approval of the other unless otherwise  required by law
or the rules of the Commission or Nasdaq.

      5.12 Like Treatment of Purchasers and Holders.  Neither the Seller nor any
of its affiliates  shall,  directly or  indirectly,  pay or cause to be paid any
consideration  (immediate  or  contingent),  whether  by way of  interest,  fee,
payment for redemption,  conversion or exercise of the Securities, or otherwise,
to any  Purchaser or holder of  Securities,  for or as an  inducement  to, or in
connection  with the  solicitation  of, any consent,  waiver or amendment to any
terms or  provisions  of this  Agreement or the Related  Documents,  unless such
consideration  is required to be paid to all Purchasers or holders of Securities
bound by such consent,  waiver or amendment.  The Seller shall not,  directly or
indirectly,  redeem any  Securities  unless such offer of redemption is made pro
rata to all  Purchasers  or  holders  of  Securities,  as the  case  may be,  on
identical terms.

      5.13  Independent  Nature  of  Purchasers'  Obligations  and  Rights.  The
obligations of each Purchaser under this Agreement or any Related  Documents are
several  and not  joint  with the  obligations  of any other  Purchaser,  and no
Purchaser shall be responsible in any way for the performance of the obligations
of any other Purchaser under any such agreement.  Nothing contained herein or in
any Related  Documents,  and no action taken by any Purchaser  pursuant thereto,
shall be deemed to constitute the Purchasers as a partnership, an association, a
joint  venture  or any other kind of entity,  or create a  presumption  that the
Purchasers  are in any way acting in concert or as a group with  respect to such
obligations or the transactions  contemplated by such agreement.  Each Purchaser
shall be entitled  to  independently  protect and enforce its rights,  including
without limitation, the rights arising out of this Agreement or out of the other
Related  Documents,  and it shall not be necessary for any other Purchaser to be
joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose. Each Purchaser
represents that it has been represented by its own separate legal counsel in its
review and negotiation of this Agreement and the Related Documents.  For reasons
of administrative  convenience  only, the Purchasers  acknowledge and agree that
they and their  respective  counsel have chosen to  communicate  with the Seller
through Peter J. Weisman,  P.C.,  but Peter J. Weisman,  P.C. does not represent
any of the  Purchasers  in this  transaction  other than The Tail Wind Fund Ltd.
(the "Lead Investor") and Solomon Strategic Holdings, Inc.

             ARTICLE VII - INDEMNIFICATION, TERMINATION AND DAMAGES

      7.1 Survival of Representations.  Except as otherwise provided herein, the
representations and warranties of the Seller and the Purchasers  contained in or
made pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement and the Closing Date and shall continue in full force and effect for a
period of three (3) years from the Closing  Date;  provided,  however,  that the
Seller's  warranties  and  representations  under  Sections 3.13  (Taxes),  3.19
(Subsidiaries  and  Investments),  3.20  (Capitalization),  and  3.21  (Options,
Warrants, Rights), shall survive the Closing Date and continue in full force and
effect  until the  expiration  of all  applicable  statutes of  limitation;  and
further provided that the Seller's warranties and representations  under Section
3.25 (Environmental Matters) shall survive the Closing Date and continue in full
force and  effect  for a period  of six (6) years  from the  Closing  Date.  The
Seller's and the Purchasers'  warranties and representations  shall in no way be
affected by any investigation of the subject matter thereof made by or on behalf
of the Seller or the Purchasers.

      7.2 Indemnification.

      (a) The Seller agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Purchasers, their
Affiliates,  each of their officers,  directors,  employees and agents and their
respective  successors  and assigns,  from and against any losses,  damages,  or
expenses  which are  caused by or arise out of (i) any  breach or default in the
performance  by the Seller of any  covenant or  agreement  made by the Seller in
this Agreement or in any of the Related  Documents;  (ii) any breach of warranty
or representation  made by the Seller in this Agreement or in any of the Related
Documents  (iii) any and all third party actions,  suits,  proceedings,  claims,
demands,  judgments,  costs and expenses  (including  reasonable  legal fees and
expenses) incident to any of the foregoing.

      (b) Each  Purchaser,  severally  and not  jointly  and as to itself  only,
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Seller, its Affiliates,  each of their
officers,  directors,  employees and agents and their respective  successors and
assigns,  from and against any losses,  damages, or expenses which are caused by
or arise out of (A) any breach or default in the  performance  by such Purchaser
of any covenant or agreement  made by such Purchaser in this Agreement or in any
of the Related Documents;  (B) any breach of warranty or representation  made by
such Purchaser in this Agreement or in any of the Related Documents; and (C) any
and all third party actions, suits,  proceedings,  claims,  demands,  judgments,
costs and expenses  (including  reasonable legal fees and expenses)  incident to
any of the foregoing;  provided,  however, that such Purchaser's liability under
this Section  7.2(b) shall not exceed the Purchase  Price paid by such Purchaser
hereunder.

      7.3  Indemnity  Procedure.  A  party  or  parties  hereto  agreeing  to be
responsible for or to indemnify against any matter pursuant to this Agreement is
referred  to herein as the  "Indemnifying  Party" and the other party or parties
claiming  indemnity is referred to as the  "Indemnified  Party".  An Indemnified
Party under this Agreement  shall,  with respect to claims asserted against such
party by any third party,  give written notice to the Indemnifying  Party of any
liability  which might give rise to a claim for indemnity  under this  Agreement
within  sixty (60)  business  days of the receipt of any written  claim from any
such  third  party,  but not later than  twenty  (20) days prior to the date any
answer or  responsive  pleading is due,  and with  respect to other  matters for
which the Indemnified Party may seek indemnification, give prompt written notice
to the Indemnifying  Party of any liability which might give rise to a claim for
indemnity;  provided,  however,  that any  failure to give such  notice will not
waive any rights of the Indemnified Party except to the extent the rights of the
Indemnifying Party are materially prejudiced.


                                       21
<PAGE>

      The Indemnifying Party shall have the right, at its election, to take over
the  defense  or  settlement  of such  claim by  giving  written  notice  to the
Indemnified Party at least fifteen (15) days prior to the time when an answer or
other  responsive  pleading or notice with respect  thereto is required.  If the
Indemnifying Party makes such election, it may conduct the defense of such claim
through counsel of its choosing (subject to the Indemnified  Party's approval of
such counsel,  which  approval  shall not be  unreasonably  withheld),  shall be
solely  responsible  for the  expenses of such defense and shall be bound by the
results of its defense or settlement of the claim. The Indemnifying  Party shall
not settle any such claim  without  prior  notice to and  consultation  with the
Indemnified  Party,  and no such  settlement  involving any equitable  relief or
which  might have an adverse  effect on the  Indemnified  Party may be agreed to
without the written consent of the Indemnified Party (which consent shall not be
unreasonably  withheld).  So  long  as  the  Indemnifying  Party  is  diligently
contesting any such claim in good faith, the Indemnified Party may pay or settle
such  claim  only at its own  expense  and the  Indemnifying  Party  will not be
responsible  for the fees of separate  legal counsel to the  Indemnified  Party,
unless  the  named   parties  to  any   proceeding   include   both  parties  or
representation of both parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to
conflicts of interest or otherwise. If the Indemnifying Party does not make such
election,  or having made such election does not, in the  reasonable  opinion of
the  Indemnified  Party  proceed  diligently  to  defend  such  claim,  then the
Indemnified  Party may (after written notice to the Indemnifying  Party), at the
expense of the Indemnifying Party, elect to take over the defense of and proceed
to handle such claim in its discretion and the Indemnifying Party shall be bound
by any defense or settlement that the  Indemnified  Party may make in good faith
with respect to such claim. In connection therewith, the Indemnifying Party will
fully cooperate with the Indemnified Party should the Indemnified Party elect to
take over the  defense of any such  claim.  The parties  agree to  cooperate  in
defending such third party claims and the  Indemnified  Party shall provide such
cooperation  and  such  access  to its  books,  records  and  properties  as the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably request with respect to any matter for which
indemnification  is sought hereunder;  and the parties hereto agree to cooperate
with each other in order to ensure the proper and adequate defense thereof.

      With  regard to  claims of third  parties  for  which  indemnification  is
payable hereunder,  such indemnification shall be paid by the Indemnifying Party
upon  the  earlier  to  occur  of:  (i) the  entry  of a  judgment  against  the
Indemnified  Party and the  expiration of any applicable  appeal  period,  or if
earlier,  five (5) days  prior to the date that the  judgment  creditor  has the
right to execute the  judgment;  (ii) the entry of an  unappealable  judgment or
final appellate decision against the Indemnified Party; or (iii) a settlement of
the claim.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the reasonable expenses of counsel to
the Indemnified Party shall be reimbursed on a current basis by the Indemnifying
Party.  With  regard  to other  claims  for  which  indemnification  is  payable
hereunder, such indemnification shall be paid promptly by the Indemnifying Party
upon demand by the Indemnified Party.

                          ARTICLE VIII - MISCELLANEOUS

      8.1 Further  Assurances.  Each party  agrees to  cooperate  fully with the
other parties and to execute such further instruments,  documents and agreements
and to give such further  written  assurances as may be reasonably  requested by
any other party to better evidence and reflect the transactions described herein
and  contemplated  hereby and to carry into effect the  intents and  purposes of
this Agreement,  and further agrees to take promptly,  or cause to be taken, all
actions, and to do promptly,  or cause to be done, all things necessary,  proper
or  advisable  under  applicable  law  to  consummate  and  make  effective  the
transactions  contemplated hereby, to obtain all necessary waivers, consents and
approvals,  to effect all necessary registrations and filings, and to remove any
injunctions  or other  impediments  or delays,  legal or otherwise,  in order to
consummate and make effective the  transactions  contemplated  by this Agreement
for the purpose of securing to the parties hereto the benefits  contemplated  by
this Agreement.

      8.2 Fees and  Expenses.  The parties  hereto shall pay their own costs and

      8.10 Amendment and Waivers. Subject to Section 5.12, any term or provision
of this  Agreement  may be  amended,  and  the  observance  of any  term of this
Agreement may be waived (either generally or in a particular instance and either
retroactively or  prospectively)  only by a writing signed by the Seller and the
Purchasers  purchasing at least 75% of the Shares hereunder,  and such waiver or
amendment, as the case may be, shall be binding upon all Purchasers.  The waiver
by a party of any breach hereof or default in the  performance  hereof shall not
be deemed to constitute a waiver of any other default or any  succeeding  breach
or  default.  This  Agreement  may not be amended or  supplemented  by any party
hereto  except  pursuant to a written  amendment  executed by the Seller and the
Purchasers  purchasing at least 75% of the Shares hereunder.  No amendment shall
be effected to impact a holder of  Securities  in a  disproportionately  adverse
fashion without the consent of such individual holder.

      8.11 No Waiver.  The failure of any party to enforce any of the provisions
hereof  shall  not be  construed  to be a  waiver  of the  right  of such  party
thereafter to enforce such provisions.

the  term  "knowledge,"  when  used in  reference  to a  corporation  means  the

(including, if applicable, any person designated as a chief scientific,  medical
or technical  officer)  assuming  such  persons  shall have made inquiry that is
customary and appropriate  under the  circumstances  to which reference is made,
and  when  used in  reference  to an  individual  means  the  knowledge  of such
individual assuming the individual shall have made inquiry that is customary and
appropriate under the circumstances to which reference is made.

      8.13  Counterparts.  This  Agreement  may be  executed  in any  number  of
counterparts,  each of which  shall be an  original  as against  any party whose
signature appears thereon and all of which together shall constitute one and the
same  instrument.   This  Agreement  shall  become  binding  when  one  or  more
counterparts hereof,  individually or taken together,  shall bear the signatures
of all of the parties  reflected  hereon as  signatories.  In the event that any
signature is delivered by facsimile transmission,  such signature shall create a
valid and binding  obligation  of the party  executing  (or on whose behalf such
signature  is  executed)  with the same  force and  effect as if such  facsimile
signature page were an original thereof.

      8.14 No Third  Party  Beneficiary.  Nothing  expressed  or implied in this
Agreement is intended, or shall be construed,  to confer upon or give any person
other  than  the   parties   hereto  and  their   respective   heirs,   personal
representatives,  legal  representatives,  successors and permitted assigns, any
rights or remedies under or by reason of this Agreement.

      8.15 Waiver of Trial by Jury. THE PARTIES HERETO  IRREVOCABLY  WAIVE TRIAL
BY JURY IN ANY SUIT,  ACTION OR  PROCEEDING  RELATING TO THIS  AGREEMENT  OR THE
TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY.
