Agreement further states that, subject to the approval of a specific level of
foreign ownership in us by the Federal Communications Commission

evidenced by promissory notes. Thus, under the Agreement and subject to prior

resulting in the issuance of 40,000,000 new shares of our common voting stock,
TowerGate, subject to prior FCC approval, will convert $800,000 owed to it for
financial services at $0.04 per share resulting in the issuance of 20,000,000
new shares of our common voting stock and Larry E. Becker, subject to FCC
approval will convert $36,175 at $0.001 per share for 36,175,000 shares of

we and Tracy have agreed to issue a new promissory note to Mr. Tracy for a loan
he made to us of $467,000. The Note shall be due and payable in 24 months from

invest $200,000 into our common stock at $.02 per share, for 10,000,000 newly
issued shares, and Nyssen has agreed to invest $100,000 into our common voting
stock at $0.02 per share for 200,000,000 shares of our newly shares and $100,000

prior FCC approval is obtained for the proposed conversions by Larry E. Becker,
