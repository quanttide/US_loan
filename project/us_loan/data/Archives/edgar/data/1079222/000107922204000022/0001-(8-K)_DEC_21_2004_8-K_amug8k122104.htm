</B><FONT COLOR="#808080"><P>&nbsp;</P>
</FONT><P>          On December 17, 2004, the Registrant entered into a formal agreement to acquire 100% of Anderson Gold (China) Inc ("Anderson Gold"), a British Columbia incorporated company. Anderson Gold, via a Joint Venture Agreement with Guizhou Gold Corporation ("GGC"), a Chinese corporation, has the rights to earn an 85% interest in the Daguan gold exploration property located in Guizhou, China. Anderson Gold can earn up to an 85% interest in this gold target with an expenditure of up to $1,880,000 towards exploration and development work on the property and payments totaling up to $600,000 to Guizhou Gold Corporation ("GGC") over a four year period. American United will issue 10,000,000 of its common shares to be held in escrow and released to the shareholders of Anderson Gold in exchange for 100% of the common shares of Anderson Gold. The release will be made in stages determined by the completion of certain milestones in exploration and development spending and the completion of required payments 
to GGC.</P>
<P>Two members of the Board of Directors of the Issuer, William Anderson and Chand Jagpal are beneficial shareholders via Rocky Trust, Anderson Gold Trust and Griffith Trust of a majority interest in the common shares of Anderson Gold. The Anderson Gold Trust and the Griffith Trust includes Mr. Anderson's immediate family members as beneficiaries. The Rocky Trust includes Mr. Jagpal as well as other family members as beneficiaries.  </P>
<P>The Daguan Property covers an area of 19 km2 of a Carlin-style gold target. Local miners operating approximately 500 meters from the northern border of the Daguan Property on a property immediately adjacent to the Daguan property have been extracting approximately 2000 tonnes of ore a day from the main mineralized fault which runs directly through the Dagaun Exploration Property and which will be the target of our exploration work. A small artisanal mining operation on the Daguan Exploration Property has been extracting unknown quantities of ore. </P>
