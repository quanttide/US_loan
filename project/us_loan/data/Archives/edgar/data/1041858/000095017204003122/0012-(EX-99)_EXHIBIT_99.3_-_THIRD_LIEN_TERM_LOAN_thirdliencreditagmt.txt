        (e)     Any Lender may request that Term Loans made by it be evidenced
by a promissory note. In such event, the Company shall prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note payable to such Lender (or, if
requested by such Lender, to such Lender or its registered assigns) and in the
form of Exhibit F hereto (each a "Term Note" and, collectively, the "Term
Notes"). Thereafter, the Term Loans evidenced by such Term Note and interest
thereon shall at all times (including after assignment pursuant to Section 9.04)
be represented by one or more Term Notes in such form payable to the payee named
therein (or, if such Term Note is a registered note, to such payee and its
registered assigns).

        2.09    Repayment of Term Loans. The Company shall repay the outstanding
principal balance of the Term Loans plus all accrued and unpaid interest
thereon, on the Maturity Date.

        2.10    Prepayment of Term Loans.

        (a)     The Company may prepay any of the Term Loans under this Section
2.10(a), in whole or in part, to the extent permitted by the Senior Credit
Agreements and subject to the requirements of this Section, provided that the
Company shall at the time of such prepayment pay to the Agent, for the pro rata
account of each Lender, the following amounts:

                (i)     if such prepayment is made after the Effective Date but
    before the second anniversary thereof, 100% of the then principal amount of
    the Term Loan, plus all accrued and unpaid interest;

                (ii)    if such prepayment is made on or after the second
    anniversary of the Effective Date but before the third anniversary thereof,
    103% of the then principal amount of the Term Loan, plus all accrued and
    unpaid interest;

                (iii)   if such prepayment is made on or after the third
    anniversary of the Effective Date but before the fourth anniversary thereof,
    102% of the then principal amount of the Term Loan, plus all accrued and
    unpaid interest;

                (iv)    if such prepayment is made on or after the fourth
    anniversary of the Effective Date but before the fifth anniversary thereof,
    101% of the principal amount of the Term Loan, plus all accrued and unpaid
    interest; or

                (v)     if such prepayment is made on or after the fifth
    anniversary of the Effective Date but before the Maturity Date, 100% of the
    then principal amount of the Term Loan, plus all accrued and unpaid
    interest.

        (b)     Following the end of each fiscal year of the Company, commencing
at the end of the fiscal year in which all amounts outstanding under the Senior
Credit Agreements have been paid in full, the Company shall prepay Term Loans in
an aggregate amount equal to 50% of Excess Cash Flow for such fiscal year;
provided that any Lender may waive the right to receive the amount of such
mandatory prepayment and such amount shall be applied to the other Term Loans
being repaid pro rata. Each prepayment pursuant to this paragraph shall be made
without any premium or penalty of any kind and shall be made on or before the
date on which financial statements are delivered pursuant to Section 5.01 with
respect to the fiscal year for which Excess Cash Flow is being calculated (and
in any event within 90 days after the end of such fiscal year).

        (c)     In the event of the receipt by the Company of Excess Proceeds
that are not used to repay the First-Lien Obligations and/or the Second-Lien
Obligations, the Company shall prepay the Term Loans on the next Business Day in
an amount equal to such proceeds not so used, to the extent permitted by the
Senior Credit Agreements and subject to the requirements of this Section.

        (d)     Prior to any optional or mandatory prepayment of Term Loans
pursuant to this Section, the Company shall select the Term Loans to be prepaid
and shall specify such selection in the notice of such prepayment pursuant to
paragraph (e) of this Section provided that all Term Loans shall be paid pro
rata.

                                     - 34 -
<PAGE>

        (e)     The Company shall notify the Agent in writing of any prepayment
hereunder not later than 11:00 a.m., New York City time, one Business Day before
the date of prepayment. Each such notice shall be irrevocable and shall specify
the prepayment date, the principal amount of the Term Loans or portion thereof
to be prepaid and, in the case of a mandatory prepayment, a reasonably detailed
calculation of the amount of such prepayment. Promptly following receipt of any
such notice, the Agent shall advise the Lenders of the contents thereof. Each
prepayment of the Term Loans shall be applied ratably to the Term Loans.
Prepayments shall be accompanied by accrued interest to the extent required by
Section 2.13 and provided further that no prepayment of Term Loans need be made
under this paragraph (e) until the aggregate amount of Net Cash Proceeds
received in respect of which prepayments are otherwise required to be made
equals or exceeds $5,000,000, at which time a prepayment shall be made in an
aggregate amount equal to all such Net Cash Proceeds in respect of which no such
prepayment has yet been made.

        2.11    [Reserved].

        2.12    Fees.

        (a)     The Company agrees to pay to the Agent and each Lender, in each
case for such Person's own account, fees and other consideration payable in the
amounts and at the times separately agreed upon between the Company and the
Agent or such Lender, respectively.

        (b)     Except as set forth in any agreement referred to in clause (a)
above, all fees payable hereunder shall be paid on the dates due, in immediately
available funds, to the Agent for distribution, in the case of participation
fees, to the Lenders entitled thereto. Fees paid shall not be refundable under
any circumstances unless paid in the absence of an obligation to pay such fee.

        2.13    Interest.

        (a)     The Term Loans shall accrue interest at the FX Rate.

        (b)     (i) From the Effective Date through and including March 31,
2006, the interest accrued to any Interest Payment Date shall be capitalized and
added to the principal amount of the Term Loans (such accrued interest, the "PIK
Amount") and no interest for such period shall be paid in cash. From and after
each Interest Payment Date, the principal amount of Term Loan shall, without
further action on the part of the Company or the Lenders, be deemed to be
increased by the PIK Amount so capitalized and added to the principal in
accordance with the provisions hereof.

                (ii) From and after April 1, 2006 through the Maturity Date,
accrued interest shall be payable on each Interest Payment Date as follows: (i)
interest at a rate of 6.25% per annum shall be paid in cash, and (ii) interest
at a rate of 6.95% per annum shall be capitalized as a PIK Amount and the
principal amount of the Term Loan shall, without further action on the part of
the Company or the Lenders, be deemed to be increased by the PIK Amount so
capitalized and added to the principal in accordance with the provisions hereof;
provided, that, for any Interest Payment Date, the Company may elect to pay in
cash the full amount of the

                                     - 35 -
<PAGE>

interest accrued for that interest period, in which case interest shall be
deemed to have accrued at a rate per annum of 12.5% for such period.

        (c)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, if any principal of or interest
on any Term Loan or any fee or other amount payable by the Company hereunder is
not paid when due, whether at stated maturity, upon acceleration or otherwise,
such overdue amount shall bear interest, after as well as before judgment, at a
rate per annum equal to 2% plus the applicable FX Rate.

        (d)     Accrued interest on each Term Loan shall be payable in arrears
on each Interest Payment Date for such Term Loan; provided that, (i) in
accordance with Section 2.13(b)(i), the Term Loans will not accrue cash interest
prior to April 1, 2006, (ii) interest accrued pursuant to paragraph (c) of this
Section shall be payable on demand, and (iii) in the event of any repayment or
prepayment of any Term Loan, accrued interest on the principal amount repaid or
prepaid shall be payable on the date of such repayment or prepayment.

        (e)     All interest hereunder shall be computed on the basis of a year
of 360 days, and shall be payable for the actual number of days elapsed
(including the first day but excluding the last day).

        2.14    [Reserved].

        2.15    Increased Costs.

        (a)     If any Lender determines that any Change in Law regarding
capital requirements has or would have the effect of reducing the rate of return
on such Lender's capital or on the capital of such Lender's holding company, as
a consequence of this Agreement or the Term Loans made by such Lender, to a
level below that which such Lender or such Lender's holding company could have
achieved but for such Change in Law (taking into consideration such Lender's
policies and the policies of such Lender's holding company with respect to
capital adequacy), then from time to time the Company will pay to such Lender
such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Lender or such
Lender's holding company for any such reduction suffered.

        (b)     A certificate of a Lender setting forth in reasonable detail the
amount or amounts necessary to compensate such Lender or its holding company, as
the case may be, as specified in paragraph (a) of this Section and the
determination thereof shall be delivered to the Company and shall be conclusive
absent demonstrable error. The Company shall pay such Lender the amount shown as
due on any such certificate within 10 days after receipt thereof.

        (c)     Failure or delay on the part of any Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that the Company shall not
be required to compensate a Lender pursuant to this Section for any increased
costs or reductions incurred more than 270 days prior to the date that such
Lender notifies the Company of the Change in Law giving rise to such increased
costs or reductions and of such Lender's intention to claim compensation
therefor; provided further that, if the Change in Law giving rise to such
increased costs or reductions is retroactive, then the

                                     - 36 -
<PAGE>

270-day period referred to above shall be extended to include the period of
retroactive effect thereof.

        2.16    [Reserved].

        2.17    Taxes.

        (a)     Any and all payments by or on account of any obligation of the
Company or any Subsidiary hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall be
made free and clear of and without deduction for any Indemnified Taxes or Other
Taxes; provided that if the Company or any Subsidiary shall be required by law
or regulation to deduct any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes from such payments,
then (i) the sum payable shall be increased as necessary so that after making
all required deductions (including deductions applicable to additional sums
payable under this Section) the Agent or Lender(as the case may be) receives an
amount equal to the sum it would have received had no such deductions been made,
(ii) the Company or such Subsidiary shall make such deductions and (iii) the
Company or any Subsidiary, as the case may be, shall pay the full amount
deducted to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable
law.

        (b)     In addition, the Company and any Subsidiary shall pay any Other
Taxes to the relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

        (c)     The Company and any Subsidiary Credit Party shall, jointly and
severally, indemnify the Agent and each Lender within 15 days after written
demand therefor, for the full amount of any Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes
required to be paid by the Agent or such Lender, as the case may be, on or with
respect to any payment by or on account of any obligation of the Company or any
Subsidiary hereunder or under any other Credit Document (including Indemnified
Taxes or Other Taxes imposed or asserted on or attributable to amounts payable
under this Section), and any penalties, interest and reasonable expenses arising
therefrom or with respect thereto, whether or not such Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes were correctly or legally imposed or asserted by the relevant
Governmental Authority. After the Agent or such Lender learns of the imposition
of such Indemnified Taxes or Other Taxes, such party will act in good faith to
promptly notify the Company of its obligations thereunder. A certificate setting
forth in reasonable detail the amount of such payment or liability and the
determination thereof delivered to the Company by a Lender or by the Agent on
its own behalf or on behalf of a Lender, shall be conclusive absent demonstrable
error.

        (d)     As soon as practicable after any payment of Indemnified Taxes or
Other Taxes by the Company or any Subsidiary to a Governmental Authority, the
Company shall deliver to the Agent the original or a certified copy of a receipt
issued by such Governmental Authority evidencing such payment, a copy of the
return reporting such payment or other evidence of such payment reasonably
satisfactory to the Agent and the Required Lenders.

        (e)     Each Lender that is a Foreign Person and that is entitled to an
exemption from or reduction of withholding tax with respect to payments under
any Credit Document shall deliver to the Company (with a copy to the Agent, as
applicable), at the time(s) prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested
by the Company (or the Agent, as applicable), such

                                     - 37 -
<PAGE>

properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law or
reasonably requested by the Company as will permit such payments to be made
without withholding or at a reduced rate of withholding. Each Lender and Agent
that is a United States person, as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code
(other than a Person that the Company may treat as an "exempt recipient"
pursuant to Treasury Regulations section 1.6049-4(c)), shall deliver at the
time(s) and in the manner(s) prescribed by applicable law or reasonably
requested by the Company (or the Agent, as applicable), properly completed and
duly executed United States Internal Revenue Form W-9 or any successor form,
certifying that such Person is exempt from United States backup withholding tax
on payments made under the Credit Documents. Notwithstanding any other provision
of this Section 2.17(e), each such Lender shall not be required to deliver any
form pursuant to this Section 2.17(e) that such Lender is not legally able to
deliver (i) at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement or (ii) to
the extent that such failure is due to a change in treaty, law, regulation or
any action by the Company occurring subsequent to the date on which such form
originally was required to be provided pursuant to this Section 2.17(e).

        (f)     If any Foreign Lender or Participant receives a refund of any
Taxes or Other Taxes as to which it has been indemnified by the Company or with
respect to which the Company has paid additional amounts pursuant to this
Section 2.17, it shall pay over such refund to the Company (but only to the
extent of indemnity payments made, or additional amounts paid, by the Company
under this Section 2.17 with respect to the Taxes or Other Taxes giving rise to
such refund), net of all out-of-pocket expenses of the Foreign Lender without
interest (other than any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority
with respect to such refund); provided, however, that the Company, upon the
request of such Foreign Lender, agrees to repay the amount paid over to the
Company pursuant to this Section 2.17(f) (plus any penalties, interest or other
charges imposed by the relevant Governmental Authority) to the Foreign Lender in
the event such Foreign Lender is required to repay such refund to such
Governmental Authority. Nothing contained in this Section 2.17(f) shall require
any Lender to make available its tax returns (or any other information relating
to its taxes which it deems confidential) to the Company or any other Person.

        2.18    Payments Generally; Pro Rata Treatment; Sharing of Set-offs.

        (a)     The Company shall make each payment required to be made by it
hereunder or under any other Credit Document (whether of principal, interest, or
fees, or of amounts payable under Section 2.15 or 2.17, or otherwise) prior to
the time expressly required hereunder or under such other Credit Document for
such payment (or, if no such time is expressly required, prior to 1:00 p.m., New
York City time), on the date when due, in immediately available funds, without
set-off or counterclaim. Any amounts received after such time on any date shall
be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day for purposes
of calculating interest thereon. All such payments shall be made to the Agent,
except that payments pursuant to Sections 2.15, 2.17 and 9.03 shall be made
directly to the Persons entitled thereto and payments pursuant to other Credit
Documents shall be made to the Persons specified therein. The Agent shall
distribute any such payments received by it for the account of any other Person
to the appropriate recipient promptly following receipt thereof. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, in no event shall the issuance of any warrants or other right to
acquire any such Capital Stock of the Company to any Lender or any payment or
proceeds resulting from such issuance constitute a payment which shall be
subject to distribution amongst

                                     - 38 -
<PAGE>

any other Lenders pursuant to this Section 2.18(a). If any payment under any
Credit Document shall be due on a day that is not a Business Day, the date for
payment shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day, and, in the case
of any payment accruing interest, interest thereon shall be payable for the
period of such extension. All payments under each Credit Document shall be made
in dollars.

        (b)     If at any time insufficient funds are received by and available
to the Agent to pay fully all amounts of principal, interest and fees then due
hereunder, such funds shall be applied (i) first, towards payment of interest
and fees then due hereunder, ratably among the parties entitled thereto in
accordance with the amounts of interest and fees then due to such parties, and
(ii) second, towards payment of principal then due hereunder, ratably among the
parties entitled thereto in accordance with the amounts of principal then due to
such parties.

        (c)     If any Lender shall, by exercising any right of set-off or
counterclaim or otherwise, obtain payment in respect of any principal of or
interest on any of its Term Loans resulting in such Lender receiving payment of
a greater proportion of the aggregate amount of its Term Loans and accrued
interest thereon than the proportion received by any other Lender, then the
Lender receiving such greater proportion shall purchase (for cash at face value)
participations in the Term Loans of other Lenders to the extent necessary so
that the benefit of all such payments shall be shared by the Lenders ratably in
accordance with the aggregate amount of principal of and accrued interest on
their respective Term Loans; provided that (i) if any such participations are
purchased and all or any portion of the payment giving rise thereto is
recovered, such participations shall be rescinded and the purchase price
restored to the extent of such recovery, without interest, and (ii) the
provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to apply to any payment made
by the Company pursuant to and in accordance with the express terms of this
Agreement or any payment obtained by a Lender as consideration for the
assignment of or sale of a participation in any of its Term Loans to any
assignee or participant, other than to the Company or any Subsidiary or
Affiliate thereof (as to which the provisions of this paragraph shall apply).
The Company consents to the foregoing and agrees, to the extent they may
effectively do so under applicable law, that any Lender acquiring a
participation pursuant to the foregoing arrangements may exercise against the
Company's rights of set-off and counterclaim with respect to such participation
as fully as if such Lender were a direct creditor of the Company in the amount
of such participation.

        (d)     Unless the Agent shall have received written notice from the
Company prior to the date on which any payment is due to the Agent for the
account of the Lenders hereunder that the Company will not make such payment,
the Agent may assume that the Company has made such payment on such date in
accordance herewith and may, in reliance upon such assumption, distribute to the
Lenders the amount due. In such event, if the Company has not in fact made such
payment, then each of the Lenders severally agrees to repay to the Agent
forthwith on demand the amount so distributed to such Lender with interest
thereon, for each day from and including the date such amount is distributed to
it to but excluding the date of payment to the Agent, at the Federal Funds
Effective Rate.

        (e)     If any Lender shall fail to make any payment required to be made
by it pursuant to Section 2.18(d) or 9.03(c), then the Agent shall
(notwithstanding any contrary provision hereof) apply any amounts thereafter
received by the Agent for the account of such

                                     - 39 -
<PAGE>

Lender to satisfy such Lender's obligations under such Sections until all such
unsatisfied obligations are fully paid.

        2.19    Mitigation Obligations; Replacement of Lenders.

        (a)     If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if
the Company is required to pay any additional amount to (or for the benefit of)
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant
to Section 2.17, then such Lender shall use reasonable efforts to designate a
different lending office for booking its Term Loans hereunder or to assign its
rights and obligations hereunder to another of its offices, branches or
affiliates, if, in the reasonable judgment of such Lender, such designation or
assignment (i) would eliminate or reduce amounts payable pursuant to Section
2.15 or 2.17, as the case may be, in the future and (ii) would not subject such
Lender to any unreimbursed cost or expense and would not otherwise be
disadvantageous to such Lender. The Company hereby agrees to pay all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred by any Lender in connection with any such
designation or assignment.

        (b)     If any Lender requests compensation under Section 2.15, or if
the Company is required to pay any additional amount to (or for the benefit of)
any Lender or any Governmental Authority for the account of any Lender pursuant
to Section 2.17, then the Company may, at its sole expense and effort, upon
notice to such Lender and the Agent, require such Lender to assign and delegate,
without recourse (in accordance with and subject to the restrictions contained
in Section 9.04), all its interests, rights and obligations under this Agreement
to an assignee that shall assume such obligations (which assignee may be another
Lender, if a Lender accepts such assignment); provided that such Lender shall
have received payment of an amount equal to the outstanding principal of its
Term Loans, accrued interest thereon, accrued fees and all other amounts payable
to it hereunder or pursuant to any other Credit Document, from the assignee (to
the extent of such outstanding principal and accrued interest and fees) or the
Company (in the case of all other amounts). A Lender shall not be required to
make any such assignment and delegation if, prior thereto, as a result of a
waiver by such Lender or otherwise, the circumstances entitling the Company to
require such assignment and delegation cease to apply.

                                  ARTICLE III

                         Representations and Warranties

        In order to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make
the Term Loans, the Company makes the following representations, warranties and
agreements, in each case after giving effect to the Transaction, all of which
shall survive the execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Term Notes
and the making of the Term Loans on or after the Effective Date being deemed to
constitute a representation and warranty that the matters specified in this
Article III are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the
Effective Date (it being understood and agreed that any representation or
warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified date shall be required to
be true and correct in all material respects only as of such specified date).

aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries. As of the Effective Date, the Company knows of no basis for
the assertion against it or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability or
obligation of any nature whatsoever that is not fully disclosed in the financial
statements made available pursuant to Section 3.05(a) or referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence which, either individually or in the aggregate,

as a whole) hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Company in writing to the
Agent or any Lender will be, true and accurate in all material respects on the

taxing authority all federal income tax and other material returns, statements,
forms and reports for taxes (the "Returns") required to be filed by, or with

and fully provided for on the financial statements of the Company and its

to the extent due in accordance with the Plan of Reorganization, have been paid
in all material respects in accordance with the terms of the Plan of
Reorganization). Except as set forth on Schedule 3.09, there is no action, suit,
proceeding, investigation, audit or claim now pending or, to the best knowledge
of the Company, threatened by any authority regarding any taxes relating to the

the Company or any of its Subsidiaries not to be subject to the normally
applicable statute of limitations. Neither the Company nor any of its
Subsidiaries has incurred, nor will any of them incur, any material tax
liability in connection with the Transaction or any other transactions
contemplated hereby (it being understood that the representation contained in

its Subsidiaries arising as a result of the operation of their businesses in the
ordinary course of business).

rights.

        3.15    Compliance with Statutes. The Company and each of its

bodies, domestic or foreign, in respect of the conduct of its business, the

without any known conflict with the rights of others arising from the Company's

        3.24    FCC Licenses and Other Governmental Authorizations.

        (a)     The Company and its Subsidiaries hold all FCC licenses,
registrations and authorizations as are necessary to the Company's and its
Subsidiaries' businesses (collectively, the "FCC Licenses"). Each of the FCC
Licenses that is material to the business of the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries has been validly issued and is in full force and effect. All FCC
Licenses in effect on the Effective Date and their respective expiration dates
are listed and described on Schedule 3.24. The Company has no knowledge of any
condition imposed by the FCC as part of any FCC License which is neither set
forth on the face thereof as issued by the FCC nor contained in the policies,
rules and regulations of the FCC applicable generally to business of the type,
nature, class or location of the Company and its Subsidiaries. The Company and
its Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms and
conditions of the FCC Licenses applicable to it and with applicable policies,
rules and regulations of the FCC and the Communications Act, except to the
extent that any failure to comply would not result in a Material Adverse Effect.
No proceedings are pending or are, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened
which may reasonably be expected to result in the revocation, rescission,
modification, non-renewal or suspension of any FCC License that is material to
the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the denial of any
pending applications, the issuance of any cease and desist order or the
imposition of any fines, forfeitures or other administrative actions by the FCC
with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries that would, if such
proceedings were decided adversely to the Company or the Subsidiaries, have a
Material Adverse Effect. All material reports, applications, tariffs and other
documents required to be filed by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as
appropriate, with the FCC have in all material respects been timely filed and
all such reports, applications, tariffs and documents are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
unsatisfied or otherwise outstanding citations, complaint proceedings, notices
of liability or notices of forfeiture issued by the FCC and received by the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary thereof with respect to the Company or any of
its Subsidiaries or any of their respective operations.

        (b)     In addition to the FCC Licenses issued by the FCC, the Company
and its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates, registrations and
authorizations issued by any other governmental entity (domestic and foreign)
necessary to operate their respective businesses for each line of business of
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries requiring such authorization and in each
jurisdiction in which Company or any of its Subsidiaries may be deemed to be
conducting their respective businesses under applicable law (collectively, the
"Governmental Authorizations"). Each of the Governmental Authorizations has been
validly issued and is in full force and effect. The Governmental Authorizations
as of the Effective Date are listed on Schedule 3.24, with any expiration date
for any such authorization identified on Schedule 3.24, with authorizations
issued by state public service or utility commissions (or analogous state
authorities) listed on Schedule 3.24 and other Governmental Authorizations
listed on Schedule 3.24. None of the Governmental Authorizations contain any
conditions or limitations outside the normal course that would materially and
adversely restrict the operations of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. The
Company and its Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance in all respects
with the terms and conditions of the Governmental Authorizations applicable to
them, except to the extent that any failure to comply would not result in a
Material Adverse Effect. Other than the proceedings of a general nature, no
proceedings are pending or are, to the knowledge of the Company, threatened,
and, to the Company's knowledge, no event has occurred, which may reasonably be
expected to result in the revocation, rescission, adverse

                                     - 48 -
<PAGE>

modification, non-renewal or suspension of any Governmental Authorization that
is material to the business of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries, the
denial of any pending applications therefor, the issuance of any cease and
desist order, or the imposition of any material fines, forfeitures, or other
administrative actions by a governmental entity. All material reports,
applications, tariffs and other documents required to be filed by the Company or
any of its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, with the governmental entity issuing a
Government Authorization have in all material respects been timely filed, and
all such reports, applications, tariffs and documents are true, correct and
complete in all material respects. To the knowledge of the Company, there are no
material unsatisfied or otherwise outstanding citations issued by any
governmental entity and received by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary
thereof with respect to the Company or any of its Subsidiaries. Schedule 3.24
separately lists all pending applications for certificates or other
authorizations from any state public service or utility commission (or analogous
state authority).

        (c)     The transactions contemplated herein, under applicable law
(including the Communications Act) and the applicable policies, rules,
regulations and practices of the FCC and other governmental entities, would not
disqualify the Company or any of its Subsidiaries as an assignee or transferee
of the FCC Licenses or the Governmental Authorizations or result in the
imposition of any materially adverse condition on or modification of the FCC
Licenses or the Governmental Authorizations.

        3.25    Intercreditor Agreement. Assuming that the Intercreditor
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties
thereto (other than the Company and its Subsidiaries), the Intercreditor
Agreement is enforceable against the parties thereto (and the Creditors as
defined therein) in accordance with its terms.

        3.26    Certain Agreements.

        (a)     Neither the Company nor any of its Subsidiaries is a party to

Material Adverse Effect.

any manner under any provision of any indenture or other agreement or instrument
evidencing Indebtedness, or any other material agreement or instrument to which
it is a party or by which it or any of its properties or assets are or may be
bound, if such default, either individually or in the aggregate, could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

        3.27    Event of Default. No event has occurred or is continuing which
constitutes, or with notice or lapse of time could constitute, an Event of
Default.

7.01 of this Agreement (in each case on a prospective basis only); provided that
if at the time the Covenant Triggering Event occurs, the Senior Credit
Agreements contain a financial covenant (such covenant, the "Senior financial
covenant") that measures the same financial information as one of the financial
covenants listed on Annex I (such covenant, the "Annex I financial covenant")
and the Annex I financial covenant is more restrictive to the Company than the
Senior financial covenant as adjusted to be more favorable to the Company by 15%
(such covenant, the "Adjusted Senior financial covenant"), then the Annex I
financial covenant shall be amended so that it is equal to the Adjusted Senior
financial covenant.

                               Negative Covenants

        Until the principal of and interest on each Term Loan and all fees
payable hereunder have been paid in full the Company covenants and agrees with
the Lenders that:

        6.01    Limitation on Additional Indebtedness. The Company shall not,
and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume, issue,

                                     - 59 -
<PAGE>

guarantee or in any manner become directly or indirectly liable for or with
respect to, contingently or otherwise, the payment of (collectively to "incur")
any Indebtedness (including any Acquired Indebtedness), except for Permitted
Indebtedness; provided, that the Company and any Restricted Subsidiary will be
permitted to incur Indebtedness (including Acquired Indebtedness) if,
immediately after giving pro forma effect to such incurrence (including the
application of the net cash proceeds therefrom), the Consolidated Interest
Coverage Ratio for the most recent four full fiscal quarters for which internal
financial statements are available immediately preceding the date on which such
additional Indebtedness is incurred would be at least (a) 2.00:1.00 if such
Indebtedness is incurred by the Company or (b) 2.15:1.00 if such Indebtedness is
incurred by any Restricted Subsidiary, in each case determined on a pro forma
basis (including a pro forma application of the net cash proceeds therefrom), as
if the additional Indebtedness had been issued and the application of proceeds
therefrom had occurred at the beginning of such four-quarter period. The Company
and any Restricted Subsidiary shall not be entitled to incur any Indebtedness
(other than Permitted Indebtedness) under the Consolidated Interest Coverage
Ratio test in this paragraph prior to the date on which internal financial
statements for the three full fiscal quarters ended September 30, 2005 are
available.

        For purposes of determining compliance with this Section 6.01, in the
event that an item of Indebtedness meets the criteria of more than one of the
types of Indebtedness permitted in the definition of Permitted Indebtedness
permitted by this covenant, the Company in its sole discretion shall classify
(and may reclassify) such item of Indebtedness and only be required to include
the amount of such Indebtedness as one of such types. Acquired Indebtedness
shall be deemed to have been incurred at the time of the acquisition (by merger
or otherwise) of the Person or asset subject to such Acquired Indebtedness.

        6.02    Limitation on Liens. The Company shall not, and shall not permit
any Restricted Subsidiary to, create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Liens
of any kind against or upon any property or assets of the Company or any
Restricted Subsidiary, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, or any proceeds
therefrom, other than Permitted Liens.

        6.03    Fundamental Changes.

        (a)     The Company shall not, directly or indirectly, consolidate with
or merge with or into any other Person or sell, lease, convey or transfer all or
substantially all its assets, whether in a single transaction or a series of
related transactions, to any Person or group of affiliated Persons (other than
any of the foregoing involving solely the Company and a Restricted Subsidiary in
which the Company is the survivor or the purchaser) unless:

                (i)     either (i) the Company is the surviving entity or (ii)
    in case the Company shall consolidate with or merge into another Person or
    sell, lease, convey or transfer all or substantially all of its properties
    and assets, whether in a single transaction or a series of related
    transactions, to any Person, the Person formed by such consolidation or into
    which the Company is merged, or the Person which acquires by sale,
    conveyance or transfer, or which leases the properties and assets of the
    Company substantially as an entirety, shall be a corporation, limited
    liability company, partnership or trust, shall be organized and validly
    existing under the laws of the United States of America, any state thereof
    or the District of Columbia and shall expressly assume the due and punctual

                                     - 60 -
<PAGE>

    payment of the principal and interest on all of the Term Loans, as
    applicable, and the performance or observance of every covenant of this
    Agreement and the Security Documents on the part of the Company to be
    performed or observed;

                (ii)    immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a
    pro forma basis (including, without limitation, any Indebtedness incurred or
    anticipated to be incurred in connection with or in respect of such
    transaction immediately after giving effect to such transaction) no Default
    or Event of Default shall have happened and be continuing; and

                (iii)   immediately after giving effect to such transaction on a
    pro forma basis (including, without limitation, any Indebtedness incurred or
    anticipated to be incurred in connection with or in respect of such
    transaction), the Company or the surviving entity (assuming such surviving
    entity's assumption of the Company's obligations under the Term Loans and
    this Agreement), as the case may be, would be able to incur $1.00 of
    Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) under Section 6.01.

        (b)     The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, engage in any business other than the businesses engaged in by
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date and
reasonable extensions thereof and businesses ancillary or complementary thereto
(a "Permitted Business").

        6.04    Disposition of Proceeds of Asset Sales. The Company shall not,
and shall not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, make any Asset Sale unless
(a) the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, receives
consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least equal to the Fair Market
Value of the shares or assets sold or otherwise disposed of and (b) at least 75%
of such consideration consists of cash or Cash Equivalents; provided that the
amount of any liabilities (other than Subordinated Indebtedness or Indebtedness
of a Restricted Subsidiary that would not constitute Restricted Subsidiary
Indebtedness) that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets pursuant to
an agreement that unconditionally releases the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, from further liability shall be treated as cash
for purposes of this Section 6.04. The Company or the applicable Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be, may (i) apply the Net Cash Proceeds from any
such Asset Sale by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary within 365 days of the
receipt thereof (x) to repay an amount of Indebtedness (other than Subordinated
Indebtedness, First-Lien Obligations and Second-Lien Obligations) of the Company
in an amount not exceeding the Other Senior Debt Pro Rata Share (computed after
giving effect to any amount of Net Cash Proceeds used to repay First-Lien
Obligations and Second-Lien Obligations pursuant to clause (y) below) and elect
to permanently reduce the amount of the commitments thereunder by the amount of
the Indebtedness so repaid or (y) to repay First-Lien Obligations and/or the
Second-Lien Obligations, (ii) apply the Net Cash Proceeds from such Asset Sale
by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary to repay any Restricted Subsidiary
Indebtedness and elect to permanently reduce the commitments thereunder by the
amount of the Indebtedness so repaid or (iii) apply the Net Cash Proceeds from
any Asset Sale by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary within 365 days
thereof, to an investment in properties and assets that will be used in a
Permitted Business (or in Capital Stock and other securities of any Person that
will become a Restricted

                                     - 61 -
<PAGE>

Subsidiary as a result of such investment to the extent such Person owns
properties and assets that will be used in a Permitted Business) of the Company
or any Restricted Subsidiary ("Replacement Assets"). Any Net Cash Proceeds from
any Asset Sale that are neither used as described in clause (i)(x) of the
preceding sentence or to repay, and permanently reduce the commitments under,
any Restricted Subsidiary Indebtedness as set forth in clause (ii) of the
preceding sentence or invested in Replacement Assets within the 365-day period
as set forth in clause (iii) shall constitute "Excess Proceeds." Any Excess
Proceeds not used as set forth in clause (i)(y) of the second proceeding
sentence shall be subject to disposition as provided in Section 2.10(c).

        Notwithstanding the immediately preceding paragraph, the Company and the
Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate an Asset Sale without
complying with such paragraph to the extent (i) at least 75% of the
consideration of such Asset Sale constitutes Replacement Assets, cash or Cash
Equivalents (including obligations deemed to be cash under this covenant) and
(ii) such Asset Sale is for Fair Market Value; provided that any consideration
constituting (or deemed to constitute) cash or Cash Equivalents received by the
Company or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any Asset Sale
permitted to be consummated under this paragraph shall constitute Net Cash
Proceeds subject to the provisions of the preceding paragraph.

        6.05    Limitation on Restricted Payments. The Company shall not, and
shall not permit any of the Restricted Subsidiaries to, make, directly or
indirectly, any Restricted Payment unless:

                (i)     no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the
    time of or upon giving effect to such Restricted Payment;

                (ii)    immediately after giving effect to such Restricted
    Payment, the Company would be able to incur $1.00 of Indebtedness (other
    than Permitted Indebtedness) under Section 6.01 hereof; and

                (iii)   immediately after giving effect to such Restricted
    Payment, the aggregate amount of all Restricted Payments declared or made on
    or after the Effective Date and all Designation Amounts does not exceed an
    amount equal to the sum of, without duplication, (a) 50% of the cumulative
    Consolidated Net Income accrued on a cumulative basis during the period
    beginning on the first day of the first fiscal quarter commencing after the
    Effective Date (being January 1, 2005) and ending on the last day of the
    fiscal quarter of the Company immediately preceding the date of such
    proposed Restricted Payment (or, if such cumulative Consolidated Net Income
    for such period is a deficit, minus 100% of such deficit), plus (b) the
    aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issue or sale
    (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) of its Capital Stock
    (other than Disqualified Stock) after the Effective Date (including, without
    duplication, upon exercise of warrants, options or rights), plus (c) the
    aggregate net cash proceeds received by the Company from the issuance (other
    than to a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company) after the Effective Date of
    its Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) upon the conversion of, or
    exchange for, Indebtedness of the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary, plus
    (d) in the case of the disposition or repayment

                                     - 62 -
<PAGE>

    of any Investment constituting a Restricted Payment (other than an
    Investment made pursuant to clause (d), (e) or (f) of the following
    paragraph) made after the Effective Date, an amount equal to the lesser of
    the return of capital with respect to such Investment and the cost of such
    Investment, in either case, less the cost of the disposition of such
    Investment to the extent such cost is in excess of any gain in respect of
    the disposition, plus (e) in the case of any Revocation of the Designation
    of a Subsidiary as an Unrestricted Subsidiary, an amount equal to the
    consolidated net Investment in such Subsidiary on the date of Revocation but
    not in an amount exceeding the net amount of any Investments constituting
    Restricted Payments made (or deemed made) in such Subsidiary after the
    Effective Date. For purposes of the preceding clauses (b) and (c) and
    without duplication, the value of the aggregate net cash proceeds received
    by the Company upon the issuance of Capital Stock either upon the conversion
    of convertible Indebtedness or in exchange for outstanding Indebtedness or
    upon the exercise of options, warrants or rights will be the net cash
    proceeds received upon the issuance of such Indebtedness, options, warrants
    or rights plus the incremental amount received by the Company upon the
    conversion, exchange or exercise thereof.

        For purposes of determining the amount expended for Restricted Payments,
cash distributed shall be valued at the face amount thereof and property other
than cash shall be valued at its Fair Market Value.

        The provisions of this Section 6.05 shall not prohibit (each of which
shall be given independent effect):

        (a)     the payment of any dividend or other distribution within 60 days
after the date of declaration thereof, if at such date of declaration such
payment would comply with the provisions of this Agreement;

        (b)     so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
purchase, redemption, retirement or other acquisition of any shares of Capital
Stock of the Company (A) in exchange for or conversion into or (B) out of the
net cash proceeds of the substantially concurrent issue and sale (other than to
a Restricted Subsidiary) of shares of Capital Stock of the Company (other than
Disqualified Stock); provided that any such net cash proceeds pursuant to the
immediately preceding subclause (B) are excluded from clause (iii)(b) of the
preceding paragraph;

        (c)     so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
purchase, redemption, defeasance or other acquisition or retirement for value of
Subordinated Indebtedness made by exchange for (including any such exchange
pursuant to the exercise of a conversion right or privilege in which cash is
paid in lieu of fractional shares or scrip), or out of the net cash proceeds of,
a substantially concurrent issue or sale (other than to a Restricted Subsidiary)
of (A) Capital Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company; provided
that any such net cash proceeds, to the extent so used, are excluded from clause
(iii)(b) of the preceding paragraph, and/or (B) other Subordinated Indebtedness,
having an Average Life to Stated Maturity that is equal to or greater than the
Average Life to Stated Maturity of the Subordinated Indebtedness being
purchased, redeemed, defeased or otherwise acquired or retired;

                                     - 63 -
<PAGE>

        (d)     so long as no Special Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Investments constituting a Restricted Payment made by the Company or
any Restricted Subsidiary in any Person (including any Unrestricted Subsidiary)
in an amount not to exceed $15,000,000 million;

        (e)     so long as no Default shall have occurred and be continuing, the
making of a direct or indirect Investment constituting a Restricted Payment out
of the proceeds of the issue or sale (other than to a Subsidiary) of Capital
Stock (other than Disqualified Stock) of the Company; provided that any such net
cash proceeds are excluded from clause (iii)(b) of the preceding paragraph;

        (f)     so long as no Default or Event of Default exists at the time of
the respective Restricted Payment or would exist immediately after giving effect
thereto, Restricted Payments by the Company consisting of a redemption or
repurchase of Capital Stock of the Company from officers, employees and
directors of the Company or its Subsidiaries (or their estates) after the death,
disability, retirement or termination of employment or service as a director of
any such Person, or otherwise in accordance with any stock option plan or any
employee stock ownership plan that has been approved by the Board of Directors
of the Company; provided that the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made
by the Company pursuant to this clause (f), and the aggregate amount paid shall
not (net of any proceeds received by the Company from issuances of its Capital
Stock and contributed to the Company in connection with such redemption or
repurchase) exceed either (x) during any fiscal year of the Company, $10,500,000
or (y) for all periods after the Effective Date (taken as a single period),
$12,500,000; or

        (g)     distributions or payments by a Subsidiary to its direct or
indirect parent to enable such parent to pay taxes.

        Restricted Payments of the type set forth in the preceding clause (d)
and (f) shall be included in making the determination of available amounts under
clause (iii) of the preceding paragraph to the extent they are outstanding.

        In no event shall a Restricted Payment made on the basis of consolidated
financial statements prepared in good faith in accordance with GAAP be subject
to rescission or constitute a Default by reason of any requisite subsequent
restatement of such financial statements which would have made such Restricted
Payment prohibited at the time that it was made.

        6.06    Limitation on Transactions with Affiliates. The Company shall
not, and shall not permit, cause or suffer any Restricted Subsidiary to, conduct
any business or enter into any transaction (or series of related transactions
which are similar or part of a common plan) with or for the benefit of any of
their respective Affiliates or any beneficial holder of 10% or more of the
Common Stock of the Company or any officer or director of the Company (each, an
"Affiliate Transaction"), unless the terms of the Affiliate Transaction are set
forth in writing, and are fair and reasonable to the Company or such Restricted
Subsidiary, as the case may be. Each Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate
payments or other Fair Market Value in excess of $5,000,000 must be approved by
a majority of the Disinterested Directors or by the Board of Directors, such
approval to be evidenced by a Board Resolution stating that the Board of

                                     - 64 -
<PAGE>

Directors has determined that such transaction or transactions comply with the
foregoing provisions provided that, in lieu of such approval by the
Disinterested Directors, the Company may obtain a written opinion from an
Independent Financial Advisor stating that the terms of such Affiliate
Transaction to the Company or the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, are
fair from a financial point of view. In addition to the foregoing, the Company
shall obtain, with respect to each Affiliate Transaction involving aggregate
consideration of $25,000,000 a written opinion from an Independent Financial
Advisor stating that the terms of such Affiliate Transaction to the Company or
the Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be, are fair from a financial point
of view. For purposes of this covenant but without limiting the requirements of
the two preceding sentences, when any Affiliate Transaction approved by a
majority of the Disinterested Directors or as to which a written opinion has
been obtained from an Independent Financial Advisor, on the basis set forth in
the preceding sentences, such Affiliate Transaction shall be deemed to be on
terms that are fair and reasonable to the Company and the Restricted
Subsidiaries, as the case may be, and therefore shall be permitted under this
covenant.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the restrictions set forth in this
covenant shall not apply to (i) transactions with or among, or solely for the
benefit of, the Company and/or any of the Restricted Subsidiaries, (ii)
transactions under the First-Lien Credit Documents (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement) or the Second-Lien Note Documents (as defined in the
Intercreditor Agreement), (iii) dividends paid by the Company pursuant to and in
compliance with this Section 6.06, (iv) customary directors' fees,
indemnification and similar arrangements, consulting fees, employee salaries
bonuses, employment agreements and arrangements, compensation or employee
benefit arrangements or legal fees, (v) grants of customary registration rights
with respect to securities of the Company, and (vi) Restricted Payments
permitted under Section 6.04 provided that any Investments and purchases
constituting Restricted Payments must be fair and reasonable to the Company or
such Restricted Subsidiary, as the case may be.

        6.07    Limitation on Issuances and Sales of Preferred Stock by
Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company (i) shall not permit any Restricted
Subsidiary to issue any Preferred Stock (other than to the Company or a
Restricted Subsidiary) and (ii) shall not permit any Person (other than the
Company or a Restricted Subsidiary) to own any Preferred Stock of any Restricted
Subsidiary.

        6.08    Limitation on Dividends and Other Payment Restrictions Affecting
Restricted Subsidiaries. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise enter into
or cause to become effective any consensual encumbrance or consensual
restriction of any kind on the ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to (a) pay
dividends, in cash or otherwise, or make any other distributions on its Capital
Stock or any other interest or participation in, or measured by, its profits to
the extent owned by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (b) pay any
Indebtedness owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, (c) make any
Investment in the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary or (d) transfer any
of its properties or assets to the Company or to any Restricted Subsidiary,
except for (i) any encumbrance or restriction in existence on the Effective Date
and set forth on Schedule 6.08, (ii) any encumbrance or restriction set forth in
any First-Lien Credit Document, any Second-Lien Note Document and any other
Indebtedness of the type described in clauses, (ii) or (vii) of the definition
of the term "Indebtedness" so long as such

                                     - 65 -
<PAGE>

encumbrances and restrictions are not materially less favorable to the Holders
than those under the First-Lien Credit Documents, (iii) customary non-assignment
provisions, (iv) any encumbrance or restriction pertaining to an asset subject
to a Lien to the extent set forth in the security documentation governing such
Lien, (v) any encumbrance or restriction applicable to a Restricted Subsidiary
at the time that it becomes a Restricted Subsidiary that is not created in
contemplation thereof, (vi) any encumbrance or restriction existing under any
agreement that refinances or replaces an agreement containing a restriction
permitted by clause (iv) above; provided that the terms and conditions of any
such encumbrance or restriction are not materially less favorable to the Holders
than those under or pursuant to the agreement being replaced or the agreement
evidencing the Indebtedness refinanced, (vii) any encumbrance or restriction
imposed upon a Restricted Subsidiary pursuant to an agreement which has been
entered into for the sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the
Capital Stock or assets of such Restricted Subsidiary or any Asset Sale to the
extent limited to the Capital Stock or assets in question, and (viii) any
customary encumbrance or restriction applicable to a Restricted Subsidiary that
is contained in an agreement or instrument governing or relating to Indebtedness
permitted to be incurred by one or more Restricted Subsidiaries hereunder;
provided that (subject to customary net worth, leverage, invested capital and
other financial covenants) the provisions of such agreement permit the payment
of interest and principal and mandatory repurchases pursuant to the terms of
this Agreement and other indebtedness that is solely an obligation of the
Company; provided further that such agreement may contain customary covenants
regarding the merger of or sale of all or any substantial part of the assets of
the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary, customary restrictions on transactions
with affiliates, and customary subordination provisions governing indebtedness
owed to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary.

        6.09    Designation of Unrestricted Subsidiaries. The Company shall not
designate any Subsidiary of the Company (other than a newly created Subsidiary
in which no Investment has previously been made) as an "Unrestricted Subsidiary"
under this Agreement (a "Designation") unless:

        (a)     no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of
or after giving effect to such Designation;

        (b)     the Company would be able to incur $1.00 of Indebtedness (other
than Permitted Indebtedness) under Section 6.01; and

        (c)     the Company would not be prohibited under this Agreement from
making an Investment at the time of Designation (assuming the effectiveness of
such Designation) in an amount (the "Designation Amount") equal to the Fair
Market Value of the net Investment of the Company or any other Restricted
Subsidiary in such Restricted Subsidiary on such date.

        In the event of any such Designation, the Company shall be deemed to
have made an Investment constituting a Restricted Payment pursuant to Section
6.05 hereof for all purposes of this Agreement in the Designation Amount.
Neither the Company nor any Restricted Subsidiary shall at any time (x) provide
a guarantee of, or similar credit support to, any Indebtedness of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary (including any undertaking, agreement or instrument
evidencing such Indebtedness); provided that the Company may pledge Capital
Stock or Indebtedness of any Unrestricted Subsidiary on a nonrecourse basis such
that the pledgee has

                                     - 66 -
<PAGE>

no claim whatsoever against the Company other than to obtain such pledged
property, (y) be directly or indirectly liable for any Indebtedness of any
Unrestricted Subsidiary or (z) be directly or indirectly liable for any other
Indebtedness which provides that the holder thereof may (upon notice, lapse of
time or both) declare a default thereon (or cause the payment thereof to be
accelerated or payable prior to its final scheduled maturity) upon the
occurrence of a default with respect to any other Indebtedness that is
Indebtedness of an Unrestricted Subsidiary, including any corresponding right to
take enforcement action against such Unrestricted Subsidiary, except in the case
of clause (x) or (y) to the extent permitted under Section 6.05 and Section 6.06
hereof.

        The Company will not revoke any Designation of a Subsidiary as an
Unrestricted Subsidiary (a "Revocation") unless:

        (a)     no Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of
and after giving effect to such Revocation; and

        (b)     all Liens and Indebtedness of such Unrestricted Subsidiary
outstanding immediately following such Revocation would, if incurred at such
time, have been permitted to be incurred for all purposes of this Agreement.

        All Designations and Revocations must be evidenced by Board Resolutions
delivered to the Agent certifying compliance with the foregoing provisions.

        6.10    Limitations on Layering. Notwithstanding the provisions of
Section 6.01, the Company shall not incur any Indebtedness that is subordinate
or junior in lien priority to the Indebtedness evidenced by the Senior Credit
Agreements and senior in lien priority to any Indebtedness arising under this
Agreement.

        6.11    Trigger Dates. The Company shall not, and shall not permit any
Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into, or amend or otherwise modify, any
agreement relating to Indebtedness that would have the effect of restricting or
otherwise limiting the ability of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary to
perform its obligations under Section 5.08 on the Collateral Trigger Date or
Section 5.09 on the Covenant Trigger Date; provided that this Section 6.11 shall
not apply to (i) any First-Lien Credit Agreement or any other First-Lien Credit
Document or any amendment, modification or supplement thereof, or any
transaction effected in accordance with the terms thereof or (ii) any
Second-Lien Note Indenture or any other Second-Lien Note Document or any
amendment, modification or supplement thereof, or any transaction effected in
accordance with the terms thereof.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                    Events of Default; Limitation on Remedies

        7.01    Events of Default. "Event of Default," wherever used herein,
means any one of the following events (whatever the reason for such Event of
Default and whether it shall be voluntary or involuntary or be effected by
operation of law or pursuant to any judgment, decree or order of any court or
any order, rule or regulation of any administrative or governmental body):

                                     - 67 -
<PAGE>

        (a)     Default in the payment of interest on any Term Loan when it
becomes due and payable and continuance of such Default for a period of fifteen
(15) Business Days or more; or

        (b)     Default in the payment of the principal of any Term Loan when
due; or

        (c)     Default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant described
under Section 6.03 or Section 6.04; or

        (d)     Default in the performance, or breach, of any covenant in this
Agreement (other than Defaults specified elsewhere in this Section 7.01) or the
other Credit Documents, and continuance of such default or breach for a period
of forty-five (45) days or more after written notice is given to the Company by
the Agent (at the request of the Required Lenders) specifying such default or
breach and requiring it to be remedied and stating that such notice is a "Notice
of Default" hereunder; or

        (e)     failure to perform any term, covenant, condition or provision of
one or more classes or issues of Indebtedness in an aggregate principal amount
outstanding of $25,000,000 or more under which the Company or a Significant
Restricted Subsidiary is obligated, and either (a) such Indebtedness is already
due and payable in full or (b) such failure results in the acceleration of the
maturity of such Indebtedness; or

        (f)     one or more non-appealable judgments, orders or decrees for the
payment of money of $25,000,000 or more, either individually or in the

Significant Restricted Subsidiaries makes a general assignment for the benefit
of creditors; or any corporate, limited liability company or similar action is
taken by the Company or any of its Significant Restricted Subsidiaries for the
purpose of effecting any of the foregoing;

        (h)     the representations or warranties made by the Company herein or
in the Credit Documents shall be false or misleading in any material respect at
the time made and the same shall be reasonably likely to adversely affect either
(i) the ability of the Company to make payments required hereunder or the other
Credit Documents when due or (ii) the validity or enforceability of any Credit
Document or the rights or remedies of the Lenders or the Agent or Collateral
Agent hereunder or under any other Credit Document; or

        (i)     unless all the Collateral has been released from the Third
Priority Liens in accordance with the provisions of the Security Documents,
default by the Company or any Credit Party in the performance of the Security
Documents, or the occurrence of any event, which adversely affects the
enforceability, validity, perfection or priority of the Third Priority Liens on
a material portion of the Collateral granted to the Collateral Agent for the
benefit of the Agent and the Lenders, the repudiation or disaffirmation by the
Company or any Credit Party of any of its material obligations under the
Security Documents or the determination in a judicial proceeding that the
Security Documents are unenforceable or invalid against the Company or any
Credit Party for any reason with respect to a material portion of the Collateral
(which default, repudiation, disaffirmation or determination is not rescinded,
stayed or waived by the Persons having such authority pursuant to the Security
Documents or otherwise cured within thirty (30) days or more after written
notice is given to the Company by the Agent (at the request of the Required
Lenders) specifying such default or breach and requiring it to be remedied and
stating that such notice is a "Notice of Default" hereunder when such notice is
deemed received in accordance with this Agreement;

        (j)     a Change of Control shall occur;

then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of Default specified
in Section 7.01(g) with respect to the Company), so long as the respective Event
of Default has occurred and is continuing, unless the principal of all of the
Term Loans shall have already become due and payable, and unless the Event of
Default shall have been waived in writing in accordance with the provisions of
Section 9.02, the Agent shall, at the discretion of the Required Lenders, by
notice in writing to the Company, declare the principal of all the Term Loans
and the interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, and upon any
such declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable,
anything in this Agreement or in the Notes contained to the contrary
notwithstanding. If an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(g) occurs and
is continuing with respect to the Company, the principal of all the Term Loans
and the interest accrued thereon shall be immediately due and payable.
Notwithstanding the foregoing if, at any time after the principal of the Term
Loans shall have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or
decree for the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as
hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Agent a
sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of interest upon all Term Loans
and the principal of any and all Term Loans which shall have become due
otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue installments of
interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is enforceable under
applicable law) and on such principal at the rate borne by the Term

                                     - 69 -
<PAGE>

Loans, to the date of such payment or deposit), and if any and all Defaults
under this Agreement, other than the nonpayment of principal and accrued
interest on Term Loans which shall have become due by acceleration, shall have
been cured or waived pursuant to Section 9.02, then and in every such case the
Required Lenders, by written notice to the Company and to the Agent, may waive
all Defaults or Events of Default and rescind and annul such acceleration and
its consequences; but no such waiver or rescission and annulment shall extend to
or shall affect any subsequent Default or Event of Default, or shall impair any
right consequent thereon.

        In case the Agent shall have proceeded to enforce any right under this
Agreement and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or abandoned because
of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other reason or shall have
been determined adversely to the Agent, then and in every such case the Company,
the Lenders, and the Agent shall be restored respectively to their several
positions and rights hereunder, and all rights, remedies and powers of the
Company, the Lenders, and the Agent shall continue as though no such proceeding
had been instituted.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                    The Agent

        Each of the Lenders hereby irrevocably appoints the Agent as its
administrative agent and collateral agent and authorizes the Agent to take such
actions on its behalf and to exercise such powers as are delegated to the Agent
by the terms of the Credit Documents, together with such actions and powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. All references to the Agent in this Article
VIII shall be deemed to include both the Agent and the Collateral Agent, as the
context so requires.

        The financial institution serving as the Agent hereunder and under the
other Credit Documents shall have the same rights and powers in its capacity as
a Lender as any other Lender and may exercise the same as though it were not the
Agent, and such financial institution and its Affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to and generally engage in any kind of business with the
Company or any Subsidiary or other Affiliate thereof as if it were not the Agent
hereunder.

        The Agent shall not have any duties or obligations except those
expressly set forth in the Credit Documents. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, (a) the Agent shall not be subject to any fiduciary or other
implied duties, regardless of whether a Default has occurred and is
continuing, (b) the Agent shall not have any duty to take any discretionary
action or exercise any discretionary powers, except discretionary rights and
powers expressly contemplated by the Credit Documents that the Agent is
required to exercise in writing by the Required Lenders (or such other number
or percentage of the Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as
provided in Section 9.02), and (c) except as expressly set forth in the Credit
Documents, the Agent shall not have any duty to disclose, and shall not be
liable for the failure to disclose, any information relating to the Company or
any of the Subsidiaries that is communicated to or obtained by the financial
institution serving as Agent or any of its Affiliates in any capacity. The
Agent shall not be liable for any action taken or not taken by it with the
consent or at the request of the Required Lenders (or such other number or
percentage of the

                                     - 70 -
<PAGE>

Lenders as shall be necessary under the circumstances as provided in Section
9.02) or in the absence of its own gross negligence or wilful misconduct. The
Agent shall not be deemed to have knowledge of any Default unless and until
written notice thereof is given to the Agent by the Company or a Lender, and
the Agent shall not be responsible for or have any duty to ascertain or
inquire into (i) any statement, warranty or representation made in or in
connection with any Credit Document, (ii) the contents of any certificate,
report or other document delivered thereunder or in connection therewith,
(iii) the performance or observance of any of the covenants, agreements or
other terms or conditions set forth in any Credit Document, (iv) the validity,
enforceability, effectiveness or genuineness of any Credit Document or any
other agreement, instrument or document, or (v) the satisfaction of any
condition set forth in Article IV or elsewhere in any Credit Document, other
than to confirm receipt of items expressly required to be delivered to the
Agent.

        The Agent shall be entitled to rely upon, and shall not incur any
liability for relying upon, any notice, request, direction, certificate,
consent, statement, instrument, document, opinion, report, order or other
writing believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or sent by the
proper Person; and the Agent shall not be bound to make any investigation into
the facts or matters stated in any such document, but the Agent, in its
discretion, may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or
matters as it may see fit. The Agent also may rely upon any statement made to it
orally or by telephone and believed by it to be made by the proper Person, and
shall not incur any liability for relying thereon. The Agent may consult with
legal counsel (who may be counsel for the Company), independent accountants and
other experts selected by it, and shall not be liable for any action taken or
not taken by it in accordance with the advice of any such counsel, accountants
or experts. Whenever in the administration of this Agreement the Agent shall
deem it desirable that a matter be proved or established prior to taking,
suffering or omitting any action hereunder, the Agent (unless other evidence be
herein specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith on its part,
rely upon an officer's certificate relating thereto. The Agent may refuse to
perform any duty or exercise any right or power unless it receives indemnity
satisfactory to it against any loss, liability or expense. The Agent shall not
be liable for any error of judgment made in good faith by an officer thereof,
unless it is proved that the Agent was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent
facts.

        The Agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its rights and
powers by or through any one or more sub-agents appointed by the Agent. The
Agent and any such sub-agent may perform any and all its duties and exercise its
rights and powers through their respective Related Parties. The exculpatory
provisions of the preceding paragraphs shall apply to any such sub-agent and to
the Related Parties of each Agent and any such sub-agent, and shall apply to
their respective activities in connection with the syndication of the credit
facilities provided for herein as well as activities as Agent.

        Subject to the appointment and acceptance of a successor Agent as
provided in this paragraph, the Agent may resign at any time by notifying the
Lenders and the Company in writing. Upon any such resignation, the Required
Lenders shall have the right, with the consent of the Company (which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall not be required if a
Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing) in
consultation with the Company, to appoint a successor. If no successor shall
have been so appointed by the Required Lenders and shall have accepted such
appointment within 30 days

                                     - 71 -
<PAGE>

after the retiring Agent gives notice of its resignation, then the retiring
Agent may, on behalf of the Lenders, appoint a successor Agent approved by the
Company (which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed and shall
not be required if a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing) which shall be a financial institution with an office in New York,
New York, or an Affiliate of any such financial institution. Upon the acceptance
of its appointment as Agent hereunder by a successor, such successor shall
succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers, privileges and duties
of the retiring Agent, and the retiring Agent shall be discharged from its
duties and obligations hereunder. The fees payable by the Company to a successor
Agent shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise
agreed between the Company and such successor. After the Agent's resignation
hereunder, the provisions of this Article and Section 9.03 shall continue in
effect for the benefit of such retiring Agent, its sub-agents and their
respective Related Parties in respect of any actions taken or omitted to be
taken by any of them while it was acting as Agent. Any successor to the Agent
must be a "United States person," as defined in section 7701(a)(30) of the Code.

        Each Lender (other than Evergreen Investments solely with respect to the
Company) acknowledges that it has, independently and without reliance upon the
Company, the Agent or any other Lender and based on such documents and
information as it has deemed appropriate, made its own credit analysis and
decision to enter into this Agreement. Each Lender (other than Evergreen
Investments solely with respect to the Company) also acknowledges that it will,
independently and without reliance upon the Company, the Agent or any other
Lender and based on such documents and information as it shall from time to time
deem appropriate, continue to make its own decisions in taking or not taking
action under or based upon this Agreement, any other Credit Document or related
agreement or any document furnished hereunder or thereunder.

        In connection with the performance of its duties under the Intercreditor
Agreement, the Agent shall be entitled to the benefits of this Article VIII.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                  Miscellaneous

        9.01    Notices. Except in the case of notices and other communications
expressly permitted to be given by telephone, all notices and other
communications provided for herein shall be in writing and shall be delivered by
hand or overnight courier service, mailed by certified or registered mail or

        (c)     if to any other Lender, to it at its address (or telecopy
number) set forth on the signature pages hereto or in the applicable Assignment
and Acceptance.

Any party hereto may change its address or telecopy number for notices and other
communications hereunder by notice to the other parties hereto. All notices and
other communications given to any party hereto in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement shall be deemed to have been given on the date of delivery.
Each Company hereby irrevocably authorizes and appoints the Company as its agent
to give and receive any notices on its behalf under this Agreement and each
other Credit Document, and any such notice given or received by the Company on
behalf of any Company shall be fully effective as if given or received by such
Company at such time, regardless of such Company's actual knowledge thereof.

        9.02    Waivers; Amendments.

        (a)     No failure or delay by the Agent or any Lender in exercising any
right or power hereunder or under any other Credit Document shall operate as a
waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right or
power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right or
power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Agent and the Lenders
hereunder and under the other Credit Documents are cumulative and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies that they would otherwise have. No waiver of
any provision of any Credit Document or consent to any departure by the Company
therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the same shall be permitted by
paragraph (b) of this Section, and then such waiver or consent shall be
effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Term Loan
shall not be construed as a waiver of any Default, regardless of whether the
Agent or any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the
time.

        (b)     Neither this Agreement nor any other Credit Document nor any
provision hereof or thereof may be waived, amended or modified except, in the
case of this Agreement, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing
entered into by the Company and the Required Lenders or, in the case of any
other Credit Document, pursuant to an agreement or agreements in writing entered
into by the Agent and the Company, in each case with the consent of the Required
Lenders; provided that no such agreement shall (i) reduce the principal amount
of any Term Loan or reduce the rate of interest thereon, or reduce any fees
payable hereunder, without the written consent of each Lender affected thereby,
(ii) postpone the maturity of any Term Loan, or any scheduled date of payment of
the principal amount of any Term Loan under Section 2.09, or any date for the
payment of any interest or fees payable hereunder, without the written consent
of each Lender affected thereby, (iv) change Section 2.18(b) or (c) in a manner
that would alter the pro rata sharing of payments required thereby, without the
written consent of each Lender, (v) change any of the provisions of this Section
or the percentage set forth in the definition of "Required Lenders" or any other
provision of any Credit Document specifying the number or percentage of Lenders
required to waive, amend or modify any rights thereunder or make any
determination or grant any consent thereunder, without the written consent of
each Lender,(vi) release any Credit Party from any of its obligations under any
Credit Document or limit its liability thereunder or release all or
substantially all of the Collateral from the Liens of the Security Documents (in
each case other than to the extent such Credit Party or Collateral has

                                     - 73 -
<PAGE>

been released under the Senior Credit Agreements), without the written consent
of each Lender or (vii) amend or modify Section 2.10(a); provided, further that
(A) no such agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the rights or
duties of the Agent without the prior written consent of the Agent, (B) no such
agreement shall amend, modify or otherwise affect the terms and provisions of
Section 9.13(b) of this Agreement without the prior written consent of DBCI (or
any successor agent), in its capacity as agent for the lenders under the
First-Lien Credit Agreement, (C) this Agreement may be amended pursuant to
Section 2.01(b) to add Lenders as provided therein with the consent of the
Company and the relevant Lenders provided that such amendment does not have an
adverse effect on the existing Lenders, (D) no such agreement shall amend or
consent to any assignment by the Company pursuant to Section 9.04 hereof without
each Lender's consent and (E) this Agreement may be amended pursuant to 5.12(a)
to incorporate the Subsidiary Credit Parties with the consent of the Agent or
the Required Lenders. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this
Agreement may be amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Company,
the Required Lenders and the Agent if at the time such amendment becomes
effective, each Lender not consenting thereto receives payment in full of the
principal of and interest accrued on each Term Loan made by it and all other
amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under this Agreement, in each
case in accordance with the terms hereof.

        9.03    Expenses; Indemnity; Damage Waiver.

        (a)     The Company shall pay (i) all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses
incurred by the Agent, the Lenders and their Affiliates, including the
reasonable out-of-pocket fees, charges and disbursements of counsel and
financial advisors for the Agent and the Lenders, in connection with any
amendments, modifications or waivers of the provisions thereof (whether or not
the transactions contemplated hereby or thereby shall be consummated) and (ii)
upon the occurrence and during the continuation of an Event of Default, all
out-of-pocket expenses incurred by the Agent or any Lender, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for the Agent or any Lender, in
connection with the enforcement or protection of its rights in connection with
the Credit Documents, including its rights under this Section, or in connection
with the Term Loans made hereunder, including all such out-of-pocket expenses
incurred during any workout, restructuring or negotiations in respect of such
Term Loans.

        (b)     The Company shall indemnify the Agent and each Lender, and each
Related Party of any of the foregoing Persons (each such Person being called an
"Indemnitee") against, and hold each Indemnitee harmless from, any and all
losses, claims, damages, liabilities and related expenses, including the fees,
charges and disbursements of any counsel for any Indemnitee, incurred by or
asserted against any Indemnitee arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of any actual or prospective claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding relating to (i) the execution or delivery of any Credit Document or
any other agreement or instrument contemplated hereby, the performance by the
parties to the Credit Documents of their respective obligations thereunder or
the consummation of the Transaction or any other transactions contemplated
hereby, (ii) any Term Loan or the use of the proceeds therefrom, (iii) any
actual or alleged presence or release of Hazardous Materials on or from any
property currently or formerly owned or operated by the Company or any of its
Subsidiaries, or any Environmental Liability related in any way to the Company
or any of its Subsidiaries, whether such claim, litigation, investigation or
proceeding is based on contract, tort or any other theory and regardless of

                                     - 74 -
<PAGE>

whether any Indemnitee is a party thereto; provided that such indemnity shall
not, as to any Indemnitee, be available to the extent that such losses, claims,
damages, liabilities or related expenses are determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction by final and nonappealable judgment to have resulted from the gross
negligence or wilful misconduct of such Indemnitee.

        (c)     To the extent that the Company fails to pay any amount required
to be paid by it to the Agent under paragraph (a) or (b) of this Section each
Lender severally agrees to pay to the Agent such Lender's pro rata share
(determined as of the time that the applicable unreimbursed expense or indemnity
payment is sought) of such unpaid amount; provided that the unreimbursed expense
or indemnified loss, claim, damage, liability or related expense, as the case
may be, was incurred by or asserted against the Agent in its capacity as such
and the Agent shall be entitled to deduct amounts owing to it under Sections
9.03(a) and (b) from all property and funds held or collected by the Agent as
such, prior to making payments to the Lenders thereon (and the Lenders agree
that the Agent shall be entitled to receipt of any such amounts prior to payment
to the Lenders of amounts owed to them). For purposes hereof, a Lender's "pro
rata share" shall be determined based upon its share of the sum of the
outstanding Term Loans at the time.

        (d)     To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company shall not
assert, and each hereby waives, any claim against any Indemnitee, on any theory
of liability, for special, indirect, consequential or punitive damages (as
opposed to direct or actual damages) arising out of, in connection with, or as a
result of, this Agreement or any agreement or instrument contemplated hereby,
any Term Loan or the use of the proceeds thereof.

        (e)     All amounts due under this Section shall be payable promptly
after written demand therefor.

        9.04    Successors and Assigns.

        (a)     The provisions of this Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the parties hereto and their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby, except that the Company may not assign or otherwise transfer
any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the prior written consent of
each Lender (and any attempted assignment or transfer by the Company without
such consent shall be null and void). Nothing in this Agreement, expressed or
implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person (other than the parties
hereto, their respective successors and assigns permitted hereby and, to the
extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties of each of the Agent
and the Lenders) any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by
reason of this Agreement. If the Agent consolidates, merges or converts into, or
transfers all or substantially all of its corporate trust business to, another
corporation, the successor corporation without any further act shall be the
successor Agent.

        (b)     Any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion
of its rights and obligations under this Agreement (including all or a portion
of the Term Loans at the time owing to it); provided that (i) except in the case
of an assignment to an existing Lender, the Company must give its prior written
consent to such assignment (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed); provided that the consent of the Company shall not be

                                     - 75 -
<PAGE>

required for any assignment that occurs at any time when an Event of Default
pursuant to paragraphs (h) and (i) of Article VII hereof shall have occurred and
be continuing, (ii) except in the case of an assignment to an existing Lender or
an assignment of the entire remaining amount of the assigning Lender's Term
Loans, the amount of the Term Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each such
assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Acceptance with respect
to such assignment is delivered to the Agent) shall not be less than $1,000,000
unless the Company otherwise consents, (iii) each partial assignment shall be
made as an assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement and (iv) the parties to each
assignment shall execute and deliver to the Agent an Assignment and Acceptance,
together with a processing and recordation fee of $3,500. Subject to acceptance
and recording thereof pursuant to paragraph (d) of this Section, from and after
the effective date specified in each Assignment and Acceptance the assignee
thereunder shall be a party hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned
by such Assignment and Acceptance, have the rights and obligations of a Lender
under this Agreement, and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent
of the interest assigned by such Assignment and Acceptance, be released from its
obligations under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and
Acceptance covering all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under
this Agreement, such Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue
to be entitled to the benefits of Sections 2.15, 2.17 and 9.03). Any assignment
or transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does
not comply with this paragraph shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement
as a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (e) of this Section.

        (c)     The Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent of the Company,
shall maintain at its Issuer Services office in The City of New York a copy of
each Assignment and Acceptance delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and principal amount of,
and stated interest on, the Term Loans of each Lender pursuant to the terms
hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in the Register shall be
conclusive, and the Company, the Agent and the Lenders may treat each Person
whose name is recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender
hereunder for all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the
contrary. The Register shall be available for inspection by the Company and any
Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable prior
notice.

        (d)     Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Acceptance
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the processing and recordation
fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written consent to such
assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the Agent shall accept
such Assignment and Acceptance and record the information contained therein in
the Register. No assignment shall be effective for purposes of this Agreement
unless it has been recorded in the Register as provided in this paragraph.

        (e)     Any Lender may, without the consent of the Company or the Agent,
sell participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in
all or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of the Term Loans owing to it); provided that (i)
such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain unchanged, (ii) such
Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties hereto for

                                     - 76 -
<PAGE>

the performance of such obligations and (iii) the Company, the Agent and the
other Lenders shall continue to deal solely and directly with such Lender in
connection with such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any
agreement or instrument pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation
shall provide that such Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Credit
Documents and to approve any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision
of the Credit Documents; provided that such agreement or instrument may provide
that such Lender will not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any
amendment, modification or waiver described in the first proviso to Section
9.02(b) that affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (f) of this Section,
the Company agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the benefits of
Sections 2.15 and 2.17 to the same extent as if it were a Lender and had
acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (b) of this Section.
To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be entitled to the
benefits of Section 9.08 as though it were a Lender, provided such Participant
agrees to be subject to Section 2.18(c) as though it were a Lender.

        (f)     A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 2.15 or 2.17 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
Company's prior written consent referring to Section 2.17. A Participant that
would be a Foreign Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the
benefits of Section 2.17 unless the Company is notified of the participation
sold to such Participant and such Participant complies, for the benefit of the
Company, with Section 2.17(e) as though it were a Lender.

        (g)     Without notice to or consent from the Agent or the Company, any
Lender may at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or any
portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such Lender,
including, without limitation, any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to
a Federal Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or
assignment of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of
a security interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder
or substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.

        9.05    Survival. All covenants, agreements, representations and
warranties made by the Company in the Credit Documents and in the certificates
or other instruments delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement
or any other Credit Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the
other parties hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Credit
Documents and the making of any Term Loans, regardless of any investigation made
by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding that the Agent or
any Lender may have had notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect
representation or warranty at the time any credit is extended hereunder, and
shall continue in full force and effect as long as the principal of or any
accrued interest on any Term Loan or any fee or any other amount payable under
this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid. The provisions of Sections 2.15, 2.17
and 9.03 and Article VIII shall survive and remain in full force and effect
regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Term Loans or the termination of this Agreement or any
provision hereof.

        9.06    Counterparts; Integration; Effectiveness. This Agreement may be
executed in counterparts (and by different parties hereto on different
counterparts), each of which shall constitute an original, but all of which when
taken together shall constitute a single

                                     - 77 -
<PAGE>

contract. This Agreement, the other Credit Documents and any separate letter
agreements with respect to fees payable to the Agent constitute the entire
contract among the parties relating to the subject matter hereof and supersede
any and all previous agreements and understandings, oral or written, relating to
the subject matter hereof. Except as provided in Section 4.01, this Agreement
shall become effective when it shall have been executed by all parties hereto
and when the Agent shall have received counterparts hereof which, when taken
together, bear the signatures of each of the other parties hereto, and
thereafter shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and assigns. Delivery of an executed counterpart
of a signature page of this Agreement by telecopy shall be effective as delivery
of a manually executed counterpart of this Agreement.

        9.07    Severability. Any provision of this Agreement held to be
invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such invalidity, illegality or
unenforceability without affecting the validity, legality and enforceability of
the remaining provisions hereof; and the invalidity of a particular provision in
a particular jurisdiction shall not invalidate such provision in any other
jurisdiction.

        9.08    Right of Setoff. If an Event of Default shall have occurred and
be continuing, each Lender and each of its Affiliates is hereby authorized at
any time and from time to time, to the fullest extent permitted by law, to set
off and apply any and all deposits (general or special, time or demand,
provisional or final) at any time held and other obligations at any time owing
by such Lender or Affiliate to or for the credit or the account of the Company
against any of and all the obligations of the Company now or hereafter existing
under this Agreement held by such Lender, irrespective of whether or not such
Lender shall have made any demand under this Agreement and although such
deposits may be unmatured. The rights of each Lender under this Section are in
addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff) which
such Lender may have.

        9.09    Governing Law; Jurisdiction; Consent to Service of Process.

        (a)     This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with and
governed by the law of the State of New York.

        (b)     The Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally submits, for
itself and its property, to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the Supreme Court
of the State of New York sitting in New York County and of the United States
District Court of the Southern District of New York, and any appellate court
from any thereof, in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to any
Credit Document, or for recognition or enforcement of any judgment, and each of
the parties hereto hereby irrevocably and unconditionally agrees that all claims
in respect of any such action or proceeding may be heard and determined in such
New York State or, to the extent permitted by law, in such Federal court. Each
of the parties hereto agrees that a final judgment in any such action or
proceeding shall be conclusive and may be enforced in other jurisdictions by
suit on the judgment or in any other manner provided by law. Nothing in this
Agreement or any other Credit Document shall affect any right that the Agent or
any Lender may otherwise have to bring any action or proceeding relating to this
Agreement or any other Credit Document against the Company or its properties in
the courts of any jurisdiction.

                                     - 78 -
<PAGE>

        (c)     The Company hereby irrevocably and unconditionally waives, to
the fullest extent it may legally and effectively do so, any objection which it
may now or hereafter have to the laying of venue of any suit, action or
proceeding arising out of or relating to this Agreement or any other Credit
Document in any court referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section. Each of the
parties hereto hereby irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by
law, the defense of an inconvenient forum to the maintenance of such action or
proceeding in any such court.

        (d)     Each party to this Agreement irrevocably consents to service of
process by registered or certified mail, return receipt requested. Nothing in
this Agreement or any other Credit Document will affect the right of any party
to this Agreement to serve process in any other manner permitted by law.

        9.10    WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE
FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW, ANY RIGHT IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY
JURY IN ANY LEGAL PROCEEDING DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY ARISING OUT OF OR RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT, ANY OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENT OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED
HEREBY (WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT OR ANY OTHER THEORY). EACH PARTY HERETO
(A) CERTIFIES THAT NO REPRESENTATIVE, AGENT OR ATTORNEY OF ANY OTHER PARTY HAS
REPRESENTED, EXPRESSLY OR OTHERWISE, THAT SUCH OTHER PARTY WOULD NOT, IN THE
EVENT OF LITIGATION, SEEK TO ENFORCE THE FOREGOING WAIVER AND (B) ACKNOWLEDGES
THAT IT AND THE OTHER PARTIES HERETO HAVE BEEN INDUCED TO ENTER INTO THIS
AGREEMENT BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE MUTUAL WAIVERS AND CERTIFICATIONS IN THIS
SECTION.

        9.11    Headings. Article and Section headings and the Table of Contents
used herein are for convenience of reference only, are not part of this
Agreement and shall not affect the construction of, or be taken into
consideration in interpreting, this Agreement.

        9.12    Confidentiality. Each of the Agent and the Lenders agrees to
maintain the confidentiality of the Information (as defined below), except that
Information may be disclosed (a) to its and its Affiliates' and its Related
Funds' directors, officers, employees and agents, including accountants, legal
counsel and other advisors (other than securities analysts) or to any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty in swap agreements or such contractual
counterparty's professional advisors (so long as such contractual counterparty
or professional advisor to such contractual counterparty agrees in writing to be
bound by the provisions of this Section 9.12) (it being understood that the
Persons to whom such disclosure is made will be informed of the confidential
nature of such Information and instructed to keep such Information
confidential), (b) to the extent requested by any regulatory authority, (c) to
the extent required by applicable laws or regulations or by any subpoena or
similar legal process, (d) to any other party to this Agreement, (e) in
connection with the exercise of any remedies hereunder or any suit, action or
proceeding relating to this Agreement or any other Credit Document or the
enforcement of rights hereunder or thereunder, (f) provided that such assignee
or Participant, or such prospective assignee or Participant agrees in writing to
be bound by the confidentiality provisions of this Section 9.12, to any assignee
of or Participant in, or any prospective assignee of or Participant in,

                                     - 79 -

any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement, (g) with the consent of
the Company or (h) to the extent such Information (i) becomes publicly available
other than as a result of a breach of this Section or (ii) becomes available to
the Agent or any Lender on a nonconfidential basis from a source other than the
Company. For the purposes of this Section, "Information" means all information
received from the Company or relating to the Company or their business, other
than any such information that is available to the Agent or any Lender on a
nonconfidential basis prior to disclosure by the Company or; provided that, in
the case of information received from the Company after the date hereof, such
information is clearly identified at the time of delivery as confidential. Any
Person required to maintain the confidentiality of Information as provided in
this Section shall be considered to have complied with its obligation to do so
if such Person has exercised the same degree of care to maintain the
confidentiality of such Information as such Person would accord to its own
confidential information.

        Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties (and each Related Party,
representative, or other agent of the parties) may disclose to any and all
Persons, without limitation of any kind, the tax treatment and tax structure of
the transaction, provided, however, that this sentence shall not permit any
party (or any Related Party, representative, or other agent thereof) to disclose
any information that is not necessary to understanding the tax treatment and tax
structure of the transaction (including the identity of the parties, any
information that could lead another to determine the identity of the parties, or
any other information to the extent that such disclosure could result in a
violation of any federal or state securities law).

        9.13    Interest Rate Limitation. Notwithstanding anything herein to the
contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together with
all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such Term
Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by the Lender holding such Term Loan in accordance with
applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such Term Loan
hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Term Loan but were not payable
as a result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest
and Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Term Loans or periods
shall be increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such
cumulated amount, together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective
Rate to the date of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

        9.14    Release of Subsidiaries; Collateral.

        (a)     If (i) the Agent receives a certificate from the chief executive
officer, the chief financial officer or treasurer of the Company certifying as
of the date of that certificate that, after the consummation of the transaction
or series of transactions described in reasonable detail satisfactory to the
Agent in such certificate on such date, the Subsidiary Credit Party identified
in such certificate will no longer be a Subsidiary of the Company and (ii) such
transactions are consummated on such date in accordance with and without
violating the provisions of this Agreement or any other Credit Document, then
such Subsidiary's guarantee of the Company's obligations under this Agreement
shall automatically terminate and such Subsidiary shall cease to be a party to
any Credit Document.

                                     - 80 -
<PAGE>

        (b)     If (i) any Subsidiary Credit Party is released from its
guarantee with respect to the Senior Credit Agreements or (ii) any collateral is
released from the Lien securing the Senior Credit Agreements, then, to the
extent such Subsidiary Credit Party has guaranteed the Company's obligations
hereunder, or such collateral has been pledged to secure the Company's
obligations hereunder or under any guarantee executed by a Subsidiary Credit
Party with respect hereto, then such Subsidiary's guarantee of the Company's or
a Subsidiary Credit Party's obligations under this Agreement shall automatically
terminate and such Subsidiary shall cease to be a party to any Credit Document
and/or such collateral shall automatically be released from the Liens in favor
of the Agent hereunder, in each case without any further action on the part of
any Person.

        (c)     No such termination or cessation shall release, reduce, or
otherwise adversely affect the obligations of any other Credit Party under this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, all of which obligations continue to
remain in full force and effect.

        9.15    Intercreditor Agreement Controls. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the Liens and security interests granted at any time to
the Agent pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document (or to secure
any obligation hereunder or thereunder) and the exercise of any right or remedy
by the Agent hereunder or thereunder are subject to the provisions of the
Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any conflict between the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement or any other Document, the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement will govern and the Lenders are subject to the
agreements made by the Agent on their behalf in the Intercreditor Agreement, but
no such agreement shall obligate any Lender to make additional Term Loans.

I.      Financial Covenants

(a)     Maximum Capital Expenditures. The Company will
not, and will not permit any of its Subsidiaries to, make any Capital
Expenditures, except that during any fiscal year of the Company set forth below
(taken as one accounting period) (it being understood and agreed that for
purposes of this clause (a) only, the period from September 30, 2004 through
December 31, 2004 shall be deemed to be part of the fiscal year ending on
December 31, 2005), the Company and its Subsidiaries may make Capital
Expenditures so long as the aggregate amount of all such Capital Expenditures
does not exceed in any fiscal year of the Company set forth below the amount set
forth opposite such fiscal year below:

        Fiscal Year Ending On              Amount
        ---------------------              -------------
        December 31, 2005                  $ 115,000,000
        December 31, 2006                  $  97,750,000
        December 31, 2007 and thereafter   $  86,250,000

                (i)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the
                        amount of Capital Expenditures permitted to be made by
                        the Company and its Subsidiaries pursuant to clause (a)
                        above in any fiscal year of the Company (before giving
                        effect to any increase in such permitted expenditure
                        amount pursuant to this clause (i)) is greater than the

                        forward and utilized to make Capital Expenditures in the
                        immediately succeeding fiscal year (it being understood
                        and agreed that such succeeding fiscal year Capital
                        Expenditures shall be deemed to have been made first
                        from the amount permitted for such year pursuant to
                        clause (a) above and second from the Rollover Amount).

                (ii)    In addition to the foregoing, the Company and its
                        Subsidiaries may make Capital Expenditures with the
                        amount of Excess Proceeds received by the Company or any
                        of its Subsidiaries from any Asset Sale so long as such
                        Excess Proceeds are reinvested within 365 days following
                        the date of such Asset Sale, but only to the extent that
                        such Excess Proceeds are not otherwise required to be
                        applied to repay Term Loans pursuant to Section 2.10(c).
