                         sentence) (all of the above, the "Collateral").

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above, in no event shall the
Collateral include, and no Assignor shall be deemed to have granted a security
interest (unless and until as further provided below) in (a) any lease,
license, contract, property rights or agreement to which any Assignor is a
party or any of its rights or interests thereunder or property subject thereto
if and for so long as the grant of such security interest shall constitute or
result in (i) the abandonment, invalidation or unenforceability of same or (ii)
in a breach or termination pursuant to the terms of, or a default under, any
such lease, license, contract, property rights or agreement (other than to the

9-408 or 9-409 of the UCC (or any successor provision or provisions) of any
relevant jurisdiction or any other applicable law (including the Bankruptcy
Code) or principles of equity), provided, however, that (x) the security

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

interests hereunder, shall attach immediately to any portion of such lease,
license, contact, property rights or agreement that does not result in any of
the consequences specified in (i) or (ii) and (y) to any property or assets
described above in this clause (a) on the first date upon which the
circumstances described in preceding clauses (i) and/or (ii) (as relevant) no
longer exist with respect thereto, (b) any property or asset of Starpower
Communications, LLC for so long as the organizational documents of such entity

provided that a security interest shall attach immediately upon (and the
exclusion to this clause (b) shall no longer apply at any time after) the
consummation of the Starpower Acquisition, or (c) the equity interests of (x)
Megacable, S.A. de C.V., MCM Holdings, S.A. de C.V. and Megacable
Telecommunicaciones, S.A. de C.V. for so long as the organizational documents
of such entities prohibits the granting of a security interest in such equity
interests; provided that such security interest shall attach immediately when
such prohibition is no longer in effect or (y) more than 65% of the Voting
Equity Interests of any Foreign Corporation; provided that each Assignor shall
be required to pledge hereunder 100% of any Non-Voting Equity Interests at any
time and from time to time acquired by such Assignor of any Foreign
Corporation.

         (b)    The security interest of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent under
this Agreement extends to all Collateral which any Assignor may acquire, or with
respect to which any Assignor may obtain rights, at any time during the term of
this Agreement.

rights and remedies of Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall be subject to and
governed by the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement at any time the
Intercreditor Agreement is in effect. In the event of any inconsistency between
the terms hereof and the Intercreditor Agreement, the Intercreditor Agreement
shall control at any time the Intercreditor Agreement is in effect.

         1.2    Power of Attorney. Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor
Agreement, each Assignor hereby constitutes and appoints the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent its true and lawful attorney, irrevocably, with full power
after the occurrence of and during the continuance of an Event of Default (in
the name of such Assignor or otherwise) to act, require, demand, receive,
compound and give acquittance for any and all moneys and claims for moneys due
or to become due to such Assignor under or arising out of the Collateral, to
endorse any checks or other instruments or orders in connection therewith and to
file any claims or take any action or institute any proceedings which the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent may deem to be necessary or advisable to protect
the interests of the Secured Creditors, which appointment as attorney is coupled
with an interest.

                                   ARTICLE II

                GENERAL REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND COVENANTS

Each Assignor represents, warrants and covenants, which representations,
warranties and covenants shall survive execution and delivery of this
Agreement, as follows:

         2.1    Necessary Filings. All filings, registrations, recordings and
other actions necessary or appropriate to create, preserve and perfect the
security interest granted by such Assignor to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent

accomplished within 5 days after the date of this Agreement or, with respect to
Marks, Patents and Copyrights, within 30 days of the date of this Agreement) and
the security interest granted to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent pursuant to
this Agreement in and to the Collateral creates a valid and, together with all
such filings, registrations, recordings and other actions, a perfected security
interest therein prior to the rights of all other Persons therein and subject to
no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens) and is entitled to all the rights,
priorities and benefits afforded by the Uniform Commercial Code or other
relevant law as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction to perfected security
interests, in each case to the extent that the Collateral consists of the type
of property in which a security interest may be perfected by possession or
control (within the meaning of the UCC as in effect on the date hereof in the
State of New York), by filing a financing statement under the Uniform Commercial
Code as enacted in any relevant jurisdiction or by a filing of a Grant of
Security Interest in the respective form attached hereto in the United States
Patent and Trademark Office or in the United States Copyright Office. Each
Assignor hereby authorizes the Second-Lien Collateral Agent to make duplicate
filings as if such Assignor is a Transmitting Utility, or alternatively, as if
such Assignor is a Person which is not a Transmitting Utility.

         2.2    No Liens. Such Assignor is, and as to all Collateral acquired by
it from time to time after the date hereof such Assignor will be, the owner of
all Collateral free from any Lien, security interest, encumbrance or other
right, title or interest of any Person (other than Permitted Liens), and such
Assignor shall defend the Collateral against all claims and demands of all
Persons at any time claiming the same or any interest therein adverse to the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent.

         2.3    Other Financing Statements. As of the date hereof, there is no
financing statement (or similar statement or instrument of registration under
the law of any jurisdiction) covering or purporting to cover any interest of any
kind in the Collateral (other than financing statements filed in respect of
Permitted Liens), and so long as the Termination Date has not occurred, such
Assignor will not execute or authorize to be filed in any public office any
financing statement (or similar statement or instrument of registration under
the law of any jurisdiction) or statements relating to the Collateral, except
financing statements filed or to be filed in respect of and covering the
security interests granted hereby by such Assignor or in connection with
Permitted Liens.

         2.4    Chief Executive Office, Record Locations. The chief executive
office of such Assignor is, on the date of this Agreement, located at the
address indicated on Annex A hereto for such Assignor. During the period of the
four calendar months preceding the date of this Agreement, the chief executive
office of such Assignor has not been located at any address other than that
indicated on Annex A in accordance with the immediately preceding sentence, in
each case unless each such other address is also indicated on Annex A hereto for
such Assignor.

         2.5    Location of Inventory and Equipment. All Inventory and Equipment
held on the date hereof, or held at any time during the four calendar months
prior to the date hereof, by each Assignor is located at one of the locations

Organization); Jurisdiction of Organization; Location; Organizational
Identification Numbers; Changes Thereto; etc. The exact legal name of each
Assignor, the type of organization of such Assignor, whether or not such
Assignor is a Registered Organization, the jurisdiction of organization of such
Assignor, such Assignor's Location, the organizational identification number (if
any) of such Assignor is listed on Annex C hereto for such Assignor. Such
Assignor shall not change its legal name, its type of organization, its status
as a Registered Organization (in the case of a Registered Organization), its
jurisdiction of organization, its Location, or its organizational identification
number (if any) from that used on Annex C hereto, except that any such changes
shall be permitted (so long as not in violation of the applicable requirements
of the Secured Debt Agreements and so long as same do not involve (x) a
Registered Organization ceasing to constitute same or (y) such Assignor changing
its jurisdiction of organization or Location from the United States or a State
thereof to a jurisdiction of organization or Location, as the case may be,
outside the United States or a State thereof) if (i) it shall have given to the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent not less than 15 days' prior written notice of each
change to the information listed on Annex C (as adjusted for any subsequent
changes thereto previously made in accordance with this sentence), together with
a supplement to Annex C which shall correct all information contained therein
for such Assignor, and (ii) in connection with the respective such change or
changes, it shall have taken all action reasonably necessary to maintain the
security interests of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent in the Collateral
intended to be granted hereby at all times fully perfected and in full force and
effect; provided that such actions shall not violate the lien priority or any
other provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement. In addition, to the
extent that such Assignor does not have an organizational identification number
on the date hereof and later obtains one, such Assignor shall promptly
thereafter notify the Second-Lien Collateral Agent of such organizational
identification number and shall take all actions reasonably necessary to
maintain the security interest of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent in the
Collateral intended to be granted hereby fully perfected and in full force and
effect; provided that such actions shall not violate the lien priority or any
other provisions contained in the Intercreditor Agreement.

         2.7    Trade Names; Etc. Such Assignor has or operates in any
jurisdiction under, or in the preceding five years has had or has operated in
any jurisdiction under, no trade names, fictitious names or other names except
its legal name as specified in Annex C and such other trade or fictitious names
as are listed on Annex D hereto for such Assignor. Such Assignor shall not
assume or operate in any jurisdiction under any new trade, fictitious or other
name until (i) it shall have given to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent not less
than 15 days' written notice of its intention so to do, clearly describing such
new name and the jurisdictions in which such new name will be used and providing
such other information in connection therewith as the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent may reasonably request and (ii) with respect to such new name, it shall
have taken all action reasonably necessary to maintain the security interest of
the Second-Lien Collateral Agent in the Collateral intended to be granted hereby
at all times fully perfected and in full force and effect.

         2.8    Certain Significant Transactions. During the one year period
preceding the date of this Agreement, no Person shall have merged or
consolidated with or into any Assignor, and no Person shall have liquidated
into, or transferred all or substantially all of its assets to, any Assignor, in
each case except as described in Annex E hereto. With respect to any
transactions so described in Annex E hereto, the respective Assignor shall have

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

furnished such information with respect to the Person (and the assets of the
Person and locations thereof) which merged with or into or consolidated with
such Assignor, or was liquidated into or transferred all or substantially all of
its assets to such Assignor, and shall have furnished to the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent such UCC lien searches as may have been requested with respect
to such Person and its assets, to establish that no security interest (excluding
Permitted Liens) continues perfected on the date hereof with respect to any
Person described above (or the assets transferred to the respective Assignor by
such Person), including without limitation pursuant to Section 9-316(a)(3) of
the UCC.

         2.9    Non-UCC Property. At any time and from time to time, promptly
(and in any event within 15 days) following the request of the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent or the Majority Noteholders, the Assignors shall provide the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent a reasonably detailed list (which includes
reasonable estimates of the fair market value (as determined by the Assignors in
good faith)) of all property owned by all of the Assignors of the types
described in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of Section 9-311(a) of the UCC. At any
time that the fair market value (as determined by the Borrower in good faith or
as shown in any list delivered pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence)
of the property owned by all of the Assignors of the types described in clauses
(1), (2) and (3) of Section 9-311(a) of the UCC exceeds $2,000,000, the
Assignors shall, but only upon the written request of the Majority Noteholders
or the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, within 60 days of such request (or such
longer period as the Majority Noteholders or the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
may agree to in writing) take such actions (at their own cost and expense) as
may be required under the respective United States, State or other laws
referenced in Section 9-311(a) of the UCC to perfect the security interests
granted herein in any Collateral where the filing of a financing statement does
not perfect the security interest in such property in accordance with the
provisions of Section 9-311(a) of the UCC.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall
not request any information from any Assignor or require any Assignor to take
any action, in each case, pursuant to this Section 2.9 until such time as the
Discharge of First-Lien Obligations has occurred. The Second-Lien Collateral
Agent shall not have any obligation, nor any liability to any Person (including
the Noteholders), at any time for failing or omitting to request the list of the
fair market value of the property described in this Section 2.9.

         2.10   As-Extracted Collateral; Timber-to-be-Cut. On the date hereof,
such Assignor does not own, or expect to acquire, any property which
constitutes, or would constitute, As-Extracted Collateral or Timber-to-be-Cut.
If at any time after the date of this Agreement such Assignor owns, acquires or
obtains rights to any As-Extracted Collateral or Timber-to-be-Cut, such Assignor
shall furnish the Second-Lien Collateral Agent with prompt written notice
thereof (which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the As-Extracted
Collateral and/or Timber-to-be-Cut and the locations thereof) and shall take all
actions as may be deemed reasonably necessary or desirable by the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent to perfect the security interest of the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent therein.

         2.11   Collateral in the Possession of a Bailee. If any Inventory or
other Goods are at any time in the possession of a bailee (other than the
First-Lien Collateral Agent), such Assignor shall promptly notify the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent thereof and, if requested by the Second-Lien

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

Collateral Agent, shall use its commercially reasonable efforts to promptly
obtain an acknowledgment from such bailee, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, that the bailee holds such
Collateral for the benefit of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and shall act
upon the instructions of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, without the further
consent of such Assignor. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent agrees with such
Assignor that the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall not give any such
instructions unless an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing or would
occur after taking into account any action by the respective Assignor with
respect to any such bailee.

         2.12   Recourse. This Agreement is made with full recourse to each
Assignor and pursuant to and upon all the warranties, representations, covenants
and agreements on the part of such Assignor contained herein, in the Secured
Debt Agreements and otherwise in writing in connection herewith or therewith.

                                   ARTICLE III

            SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING ACCOUNTS; CONTRACT RIGHTS;
             INSTRUMENTS; CHATTEL PAPER AND CERTAIN OTHER COLLATERAL

         3.1    Additional Representations and Warranties. As of the time when
each of its Accounts arises, each Assignor shall be deemed to have represented
and warranted that each such Account, and all records, papers and documents
relating thereto (if any) are genuine and what they purport to be, and that all
papers and documents (if any) relating thereto (i) will, to the knowledge of
such Assignor, represent the genuine, legal, valid and binding obligation of the
account debtor evidencing indebtedness unpaid and owed by the respective account
debtor arising out of the performance of labor or services or the sale or lease
and delivery of the merchandise listed therein, or both, (ii) will be the only
original writings evidencing and embodying such obligation of the account debtor
named therein (other than copies created for general accounting purposes), (iii)
will, to the knowledge of such Assignor, evidence true and valid obligations,
enforceable in accordance with their respective terms, and (iv) will be in
compliance and will conform in all material respects with all applicable
federal, state and local laws and applicable laws of any relevant foreign
jurisdiction.

         3.2    Maintenance of Records. Each Assignor will keep and maintain at
its own cost and expense accurate records of its Accounts and Contracts,
including, but not limited to, originals of all documentation (including each
Contract) with respect thereto, records of all payments received, all credits
granted thereon, all merchandise returned and all other dealings therewith, and
such Assignor will make the same available on such Assignor's premises to the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent for inspection, at such Assignor's own cost and
expense, at any and all reasonable times upon prior notice to such Assignor and
otherwise in accordance with the Second-Lien Note Indenture. Upon the occurrence
and during the continuance of an Event of Default and at the request of the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent, such Assignor shall, at its own cost and expense,
deliver all tangible evidence of its Accounts and Contract Rights (including,
without limitation, all documents evidencing the Accounts and all Contracts) and
such books and records to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent or to its
representatives (copies of which evidence and books and records may be retained
by such Assignor). Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of

legend, in form and manner satisfactory to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, the
Accounts and the Contracts, as well as books, records and documents (if any) of
such Assignor evidencing or pertaining to such Accounts and Contracts with an
appropriate reference to the fact that such Accounts and Contracts have been
assigned to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and that the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent has a security interest therein.

         3.3    Direction to Account Debtors; Contracting Parties; etc. Upon the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, if the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent so directs any Assignor, such Assignor agrees (x) to cause all
payments on account of the Accounts and Contracts to be made directly to the
Cash Collateral Account, (y) that the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may, at its
option, directly notify the obligors with respect to any Accounts and/or under
any Contracts to make payments with respect thereto as provided in the preceding
clause (x), and (z) that the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may enforce collection
of any such Accounts and Contracts and may adjust, settle or compromise the
amount of payment thereof, in the same manner and to the same extent as such
Assignor. Without notice to or assent by any Assignor, the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent may, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event
of Default, apply any or all amounts then in, or thereafter deposited in, the
Cash Collateral Account toward the payment of the Obligations in the manner
provided in Section 7.4 of this Agreement. The reasonable costs and expenses of
collection (including reasonable attorneys' fees), whether incurred by an
Assignor or the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, shall be borne by the relevant
Assignor. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall deliver a copy of each notice
referred to in the preceding clause (y) to the relevant Assignor, provided that
(x) the failure by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent to so notify such Assignor
shall not affect the effectiveness of such notice or the other rights of the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent created by this Section 3.3 and (y) no such notice
shall be required if an Event of Default of the type described in Section 7.1(g)
of the Second-Lien Note Indenture has occurred and is continuing.

         3.4    Modification of Terms; etc. Except in accordance with such
Assignor's ordinary course of business and consistent with reasonable business
judgment or as permitted by Section 3.5, no Assignor shall rescind or cancel any
indebtedness evidenced by any Account or under any Contract, or modify any
material term thereof or make any material adjustment with respect thereto, or
extend or renew the same, or compromise or settle any material dispute, claim,
suit or legal proceeding relating thereto, or sell any Account or Contract, or
interest therein, without the prior written consent of the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent. No Assignor will do anything to impair the rights of the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent in the Accounts or Contracts.

         3.5    Collection. Each Assignor shall endeavor in accordance with
reasonable business practices to cause to be collected from the account debtor
named in each of its Accounts or obligor under any Contract, as and when due
(including, without limitation, amounts which are delinquent, such amounts to be
collected in accordance with generally accepted lawful collection procedures)
any and all amounts owing under or on account of such Account or Contract, and
apply forthwith upon receipt thereof all such amounts as are so collected to the
outstanding balance of such Account or under such Contract. Except as otherwise
directed by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent after the occurrence and during the
continuation of an Event of Default, any Assignor may allow in the ordinary
course of business as adjustments to amounts owing under its Accounts and
Contracts (i) an extension or renewal of the time or times of payment, or
settlement for less than the total unpaid balance, which such Assignor finds

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

appropriate in accordance with reasonable business judgment and (ii) a refund or
credit due as a result of returned or damaged merchandise or improperly
performed services or for other reasons which such Assignor finds appropriate in
accordance with reasonable business judgment. The reasonable costs and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees) of collection,
whether incurred by an Assignor or the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, shall be
borne by the relevant Assignor.

         3.6    Instruments. If any Assignor owns or acquires any Instrument in
excess of $100,000 constituting Collateral (other than checks and other payment
instruments received and collected in the ordinary course of business), such
Assignor will within 10 Business Days notify the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
thereof, and after the Discharge of First-Lien Obligations will promptly deliver
such Instrument to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent appropriately endorsed to
the order of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent.

         3.7    Assignors Remain Liable Under Accounts. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Assignors shall remain liable under each of the
Accounts to observe and perform all of the conditions and obligations to be
observed and performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any
agreement giving rise to such Accounts. Neither the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
nor any other Secured Creditor shall have any obligation or liability under any
Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or arising out of
this Agreement or the receipt by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent or any other
Secured Creditor of any payment relating to such Account pursuant hereto, nor
shall the Second-Lien Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor be
obligated in any manner to perform any of the obligations of any Assignor under
or pursuant to any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any
payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment
received by them or as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party under
any Account (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to present or file any
claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment
of any amounts which may have been assigned to them or to which they may be
entitled at any time or times.

         3.8    Assignors Remain Liable Under Contracts. Anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, the Assignors shall remain liable under each of the
Contracts to observe and perform all of the conditions and obligations to be
observed and performed by them thereunder, all in accordance with and pursuant
to the terms and provisions of each Contract. Neither the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent nor any other Secured Creditor shall have any obligation or liability
under any Contract by reason of or arising out of this Agreement or the receipt
by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent or any other Secured Creditor of any payment
relating to such Contract pursuant hereto, nor shall the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent or any other Secured Creditor be obligated in any manner to perform any of
the obligations of any Assignor under or pursuant to any Contract, to make any
payment, to make any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any
performance by any party under any Contract, to present or file any claim, to
take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the payment of any
amounts which may have been assigned to them or to which they may be entitled at
any time or times.

         3.9    Deposit Accounts; Etc. (a) No Assignor maintains, or at any time
after the date of this Agreement shall establish or maintain, any demand, time,
savings, passbook or similar account, except for such accounts maintained with a
bank (as defined in Section 9-102 of the UCC) whose jurisdiction (determined in

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

accordance with Section 9-304 of the UCC) is within a State of the United
States. Annex F hereto accurately sets forth, as of the date of this Agreement,
for each Assignor, each Deposit Account maintained by such Assignor (including a
description thereof and the respective account number), the name of the
respective bank with which such Deposit Account is maintained, and the
jurisdiction of the respective bank with respect to such Deposit Account. For
each Deposit Account (other than the Cash Collateral Account or any other
Deposit Account maintained with the Second-Lien Collateral Agent), the
respective Assignor shall cause the bank with which the Deposit Account is
maintained to execute and deliver to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, within 45
days after the date of this Agreement (as such date may be extended by the
First-Lien Collateral Agent) or, if later, at the time of the establishment of
the respective Deposit Account, a "control agreement" in the form of Annex G
hereto (appropriately completed), with such changes thereto as may be acceptable
to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent. If any bank with which a Deposit Account is
maintained refuses to, or does not, enter into such a "control agreement", then
the respective Assignor shall promptly (and in any event within 45 days after
the date of this Agreement or, if later, 30 days after the establishment of such
account) close the respective Deposit Account and transfer all balances therein
to the Cash Collateral Account or another Deposit Account meeting the
requirements of this Section 3.9. If any bank with which a Deposit Account is
maintained refuses to subordinate all its claims, subject to customary
exceptions, with respect to such Deposit Account to the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent's security interest therein on terms satisfactory to the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent, then the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, at its option, may (x)
require that such Deposit Account be terminated in accordance with the
immediately preceding sentence or (y) agree to a "control agreement" without
such subordination, provided that in such event the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
may at any time, at its option, subsequently require that such Deposit Account
be terminated (within 30 days after notice from the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent) (as such date may be extended by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent) in
accordance with the requirements of the immediately preceding sentence.

         (b)    After the date of this Agreement, no Assignor shall establish
any new demand, time, savings, passbook or similar account, except for Deposit
Accounts established and maintained with banks and meeting the requirements of
preceding clause (a). At the time any such Deposit Account is established, the
appropriate "control agreement" shall be entered into in accordance with the
requirements of preceding clause (a) and the respective Assignor shall furnish
to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent a supplement to Annex F hereto containing
the relevant information with respect to the respective Deposit Account and the
bank with which same is established.

         3.10   Letter-of-Credit Rights. If any Assignor is at any time a
beneficiary under a letter of credit with a stated amount of $1,000,000 or more,
such Assignor shall promptly notify the Second-Lien Collateral Agent thereof
and, at the request of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, such Assignor shall,
pursuant to an agreement in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent, use its reasonable best efforts to (i) arrange for
the issuer and any confirmer of such letter of credit to consent to an
assignment to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent of the proceeds of any drawing

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

under such letter of credit or (ii) arrange for the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
to become the transferee beneficiary of such letter of credit, with the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent agreeing, in each case, that the proceeds of any
drawing under the letter of credit are (subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) to be applied as provided in this Agreement after the
occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default.

         3.11   Commercial Tort Claims. All Commercial Tort Claims of each
Assignor in existence on the date of this Agreement are described in Annex H
hereto. If any Assignor shall at any time after the date of this Agreement
acquire a Commercial Tort Claim in an amount (taking the greater of the
aggregate claimed damages thereunder or the reasonably estimated value thereof)
of $1,000,000 or more, such Assignor shall promptly notify the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent thereof in a writing signed by such Assignor and describing the
details thereof and shall grant to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent in such
writing a security interest therein and in the proceeds thereof, all upon the
terms of this Agreement, with such writing to be in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent.

         3.12   Chattel Paper. Upon the request of the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent made at any time or from time to time, each Assignor shall promptly
furnish to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent a list of all Electronic Chattel
Paper held or owned by such Assignor. Furthermore, if requested by the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent, each Assignor shall promptly take all actions
which are reasonably practicable so that the Second-Lien Collateral Agent has
"control" of all Electronic Chattel Paper in accordance with the requirements of
Section 9-105 of the UCC. Each Assignor will promptly (and in any event within
10 days) following any request by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, deliver all
of its Tangible Chattel Paper to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent.

         3.13   Further Actions. Subject to the exceptions set forth in Article
II and Article III, each Assignor will, at its own expense, make, execute,
endorse, acknowledge, file and/or deliver to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
from time to time such vouchers, invoices, schedules, confirmatory assignments,
conveyances, financing statements, transfer endorsements, certificates, reports
and other assurances or instruments and take such further steps, including any
and all actions as may be necessary or required under the Federal Assignment of
Claims Act, relating to its Accounts, Contracts, Instruments and other property
or rights covered by the security interest hereby granted, is necessary to

actions shall not violate the lien priority or any other provisions contained in
the Intercreditor Agreement.

Material Adverse Effect. Each Assignor hereby grants to the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent an absolute power of attorney to sign, upon the occurrence and
during the continuance of an Event of Default, any document which may be

infringing or diluting or otherwise violating any of such Assignor's rights in
and to any Mark or Domain Name in any manner that could reasonably be expected
to have a Material Adverse Effect, or with respect to any party claiming that
such Assignor's use of any Mark or Domain Name material to such Assignor's
business violates in any material respect any property right of that party. Each
Assignor further agrees to prosecute diligently in accordance with reasonable

that could reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

         4.5    Maintenance of Registration. Each Assignor shall, at its own
expense, diligently process all documents reasonably required to maintain all
Mark and/or Domain Name registrations, including but not limited to affidavits

registration is issued hereafter to any Assignor as a result of any application
now or hereafter pending before the United States Patent and Trademark Office or
any Domain Name is registered by Assignor, within 60 days of receipt of such
certificate or similar indicia of ownership, such Assignor shall deliver to the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent a copy of such registration certificate or similar
indicia of ownership, and a grant of a security interest in such Mark and/or
Domain Name, to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and at the expense of such
Assignor, confirming the grant of a security interest in such Mark and/or Domain
Name to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent hereunder, the form of such security to

Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, and the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent shall be entitled to exercise the power of attorney referred to in Section
4.1 hereof to execute, cause to be acknowledged and notarized and record said
absolute assignment with the applicable agency or registrar; (ii) take and use
or sell the Marks or Domain Names and the goodwill of such Assignor's business

registrations and any pending trademark applications in the United States Patent
and Trademark Office or applicable Domain Name registrar to the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent.

Agent may, by written notice to the relevant Assignor, take any or all of the

such Collateral may be lost, destroyed, stolen, damaged or for any reason
whatsoever unavailable to such Assignor.

         6.2    Warehouse Receipts Non-Negotiable. To the extent practicable,
each Assignor agrees that if any warehouse receipt or receipt in the nature of a

with respect to the Collateral (including the identity of the Collateral or such
components thereof as may have been requested by the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent, the value and location of such Collateral, etc.) as may be requested by
the Second-Lien Collateral Agent. Without limiting the forgoing, each Assignor
agrees that it shall promptly (and in any event within 10 days after its receipt
of the respective request) furnish to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent such
updated Annexes hereto as may from time to time be reasonably requested by the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent.

security interest in the Collateral (subject to the first-priority lien of the
First-Lien Collateral Agent in and in accordance with the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement) as provided herein and the other rights and security
contemplated hereby. Each Assignor will pay any applicable filing fees,
recordation taxes and related expenses relating to its Collateral. Each Assignor
hereby authorizes the Second-Lien Collateral Agent to file any such financing
statements without the signature of such Assignor where permitted by law (and
such authorization includes describing the Collateral as "all assets" of such
Assignor).

                                   ARTICLE VII

Agreement, shall have all rights as a secured creditor under any UCC, and such
additional rights and remedies to which a secured creditor is entitled under the
laws in effect in all relevant jurisdictions and may:

         (i)    personally, or by agents or attorneys, immediately take
     possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, from such Assignor or any
     other Person who then has possession of any part thereof with or without
     notice or process of law, and for that purpose may enter upon such
     Assignor's premises where any of the Collateral is located and remove the
     same and use in connection with such removal any and all services,
     supplies, aids and other facilities of such Assignor;

         (ii)   instruct the obligor or obligors on any agreement, instrument or
     other obligation (including, without limitation, the Accounts and the
     Contracts) constituting the Collateral to make any payment required by the
     terms of such agreement, instrument or other obligation directly to the
     Second-Lien Collateral Agent and may exercise any and all remedies of such
     Assignor in respect of such Collateral;

         (iii)  instruct all banks which have entered into a control agreement
     with the Second-Lien Collateral Agent to transfer all monies, securities
     and instruments held by such depositary bank to the Cash Collateral
     Account;

         (iv)   sell, assign or otherwise liquidate any or all of the Collateral
     or any part thereof in accordance with Section 7.2 hereof, or direct such
     Assignor to sell, assign or otherwise liquidate any or all of the

     proceeds of any such sale or liquidation;

         (v)    take possession of the Collateral or any part thereof, by
     directing such Assignor in writing to deliver the same to the Second-Lien
     Collateral Agent at any reasonable place or places designated by the
     Second-Lien Collateral Agent, in which event such Assignor shall at its own
     expense:

                (x)  forthwith cause the same to be moved to the place or places
         so designated by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and there delivered
         to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent;

                (y)   store and keep any Collateral so delivered to the
         Second-Lien Collateral Agent at such place or places pending further
         action by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent as provided in Section 7.2
         hereof; and

                (z)   while the Collateral shall be so stored and kept, provide
         such security and maintenance services as shall be reasonably necessary
         to protect the same and to preserve and maintain it in good condition;

         (vi)   subject to any exclusive license issued prior to the Event of
     Default, license or sublicense, whether on an exclusive or nonexclusive
     basis, any Marks, Domain Names, Patents or Copyrights included in the
     Collateral for such term and on such conditions and in such manner as the
     Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall in its sole judgment determine; provided
     in the case of Marks to the maintenance of quality standards, not less than
     comparable to the standards in place at the time of the Event of Default;

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

         (vii)  apply any monies constituting Collateral or proceeds thereof in
     accordance with the provisions of Section 7.4; and \

         (viii) take any other action as specified in clauses (1) through (5),
     inclusive, of Section 9-607 of the UCC;

it being understood that each Assignor's obligation so to deliver the
Collateral is of the essence of this Agreement and that, accordingly, upon
application to a court of equity having jurisdiction, the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to a decree requiring specific performance
by such Assignor of said obligation. By accepting the benefits of this
Agreement and each other Security Document, the Secured Creditors expressly
acknowledge and agree that any action taken by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
under this Agreement and each other Security Document may be enforced only by
the action of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent acting upon the instructions of
the Majority Noteholders and that no other Secured Creditor shall have any
right individually to seek to enforce or to enforce this Agreement or to
realize upon the security to be granted hereby, it being understood and agreed
that such rights and remedies may be exercised by the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors upon the terms of this Agreement
and the other Security Documents. Furthermore, each Assignor agrees to upon the
occurrence and continuance of an Event of Default, use its commercially
reasonable efforts to assist the Second-Lien Collateral Agent in obtaining any
approvals or assignments or licenses from any relevant Governmental Authority
that may be necessary for the exercise of the rights and remedies of the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent with respect to the Collateral.

         7.2    Remedies; Disposition of the Collateral. Subject to the terms of
the Intercreditor Agreement, if any Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, then any Collateral repossessed by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
under or pursuant to Section 7.1 hereof and any other Collateral whether or not
so repossessed by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, may be sold, assigned,
leased or otherwise disposed of under one or more contracts or as an entirety,
and without the necessity of gathering at the place of sale the property to be
sold, and in general in such manner, at such time or times, at such place or
places and on such terms as the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may, in compliance
with any mandatory requirements of applicable law, determine to be commercially
reasonable. Any of the Collateral may be sold, leased or otherwise disposed of,
in the condition in which the same existed when taken by the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent or after any overhaul or repair at the expense of the relevant
Assignor which the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall determine to be
commercially reasonable. Any such sale, lease or other disposition may be
effected by means of a public disposition or private disposition, effected in
accordance with the applicable requirements (in each case if and to the extent
applicable) of Sections 9-610 through 9-613 of the UCC and/or such other
mandatory requirements of applicable law as may apply to the respective
disposition. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent may, without notice or
publication, adjourn any public or private disposition or cause the same to be
adjourned from time to time by announcement at the time and place fixed for the
disposition, and such disposition may be made at any time or place to which the
disposition may be so adjourned. To the extent permitted by any such requirement
of law, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may bid for and become the purchaser
(and may pay all or any portion of the purchase price by crediting Obligations
against the purchase price) of the Collateral or any item thereof, offered for
disposition in accordance with this Section 7.2 without accountability to the
relevant Assignor. If, under applicable law, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

shall be permitted to make disposition of the Collateral within a period of time
which does not permit the giving of notice to the relevant Assignor as
hereinabove specified, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent need give such Assignor
only such notice of disposition as shall be required by such applicable law.
Each Assignor agrees to do or cause to be done all such other acts and things as
may be reasonably necessary to make such disposition or dispositions of all or
any portion of the Collateral valid and binding and in compliance with any and
all applicable laws, regulations, orders, writs, injunctions, decrees or awards
of any and all courts, arbitrators or governmental instrumentalities, domestic
or foreign, having jurisdiction over any such sale or sales, all at such
Assignor's expense.

         7.3    Waiver of Claims. Except as otherwise provided in this
Agreement, EACH ASSIGNOR HEREBY WAIVES, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE
LAW, NOTICE AND JUDICIAL HEARING IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRST-LIEN COLLATERAL
AGENT'S TAKING POSSESSION OR THE FIRST-LIEN COLLATERAL AGENT'S DISPOSITION OF
ANY OF THE COLLATERAL, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, ANY AND ALL PRIOR NOTICE
AND HEARING FOR ANY PREJUDGMENT REMEDY OR REMEDIES, and each Assignor hereby
further waives, to the extent permitted by law:

                (i)   all damages occasioned by such taking of possession or any
         such disposition except any damages which are the direct result of the
         Second-Lien Collateral Agent's gross negligence or willful misconduct
         (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
         non-appealable decision);

                (ii)  all other requirements as to the time, place and terms of
         sale or other requirements with respect to the enforcement of the
         Second-Lien Collateral Agent's rights hereunder; and

                (iii) all rights of redemption, appraisement, valuation, stay,
         extension or moratorium now or hereafter in force under any applicable
         law in order to prevent or delay the enforcement of this Agreement or
         the absolute sale of the Collateral or any portion thereof, and each
         Assignor, for itself and all who may claim under it, insofar as it or
         they now or hereafter lawfully may, hereby waives the benefit of all
         such laws.

Any sale of, or the grant of options to purchase, or any other realization
upon, any Collateral shall operate to divest all right, title, interest, claim
and demand, either at law or in equity, of the relevant Assignor therein and
thereto, and shall be a perpetual bar both at law and in equity against such
Assignor and against any and all Persons claiming or attempting to claim the
Collateral so sold, optioned or realized upon, or any part thereof, from,
through and under such Assignor.

         7.4    Application of Proceeds. (a) Subject to the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement, all moneys collected by the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent (or, to the extent the Second-Lien Pledge Agreement or any other Security
Document requires proceeds of collateral under such other Security Document to
be applied in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, the Pledgee or
Second-Lien Collateral Agent under such other Security Document) upon any sale
or other disposition of the Collateral, together with all other moneys received
by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent hereunder, shall be applied as follows:

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

                (i)   first, to the payment of all amounts owing the Second-Lien
         Collateral Agent of the type described in clauses (iii), (iv) and (v)
         of the definition of "Obligations";

                (ii)  second, to the extent proceeds remain after the

         application pursuant to the preceding clause (i), to the payment of all
         amounts owing to any Agent of the type described in clauses (v) and
         (vi) of the definition of "Obligations";

                (iii) third, to the extent proceeds remain after the application
         pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) and (ii), an amount equal to the
         outstanding Primary Obligations shall be paid to the Secured Creditors
         as provided in Section 7.4(e) hereof, with each Secured Creditor
         receiving an amount equal to its outstanding Primary Obligations or, if
         the proceeds are insufficient to pay in full all such Primary
         Obligations, its Pro Rata Share of the amount remaining to be
         distributed;

                (iv)  fourth, to the extent proceeds remain after the
         application pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) through (iii),
         inclusive, an amount equal to the outstanding Secondary Obligations
         shall be paid to the Secured Creditors as provided in Section 7.4(e)
         hereof, with each Secured Creditor receiving an amount equal to its
         outstanding Secondary Obligations or, if the proceeds are insufficient
         to pay in full all such Secondary Obligations, its Pro Rata Share of
         the amount remaining to be distributed; and

                (v)   fifth, to the extent proceeds remain after the application
         pursuant to the preceding clauses (i) through (iv), inclusive, and
         following the termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 10.8(a)
         hereof, to the relevant Assignor or to whomever may be lawfully
         entitled to receive such surplus.

         (b)    For purposes of this Agreement, (x) "Pro Rata Share" shall mean,
when calculating a Secured Creditor's portion of any distribution or amount,
that amount (expressed as a percentage) equal to a fraction the numerator of
which is the then unpaid amount of such Secured Creditor's Primary Obligations
or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, and the denominator of which is
the then outstanding amount of all Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations,
as the case may be, (y) "Primary Obligations" shall mean all principal of,
premium, fees and interest on, all Second-Lien Notes and (z) "Secondary
Obligations" shall mean all Obligations other than Primary Obligations.

         (c)    When payments to Secured Creditors (other than the Second-Lien
Trustee or the Second-Lien Collateral Agent) are based upon their respective Pro
Rata Shares, the amounts received by such Secured Creditors hereunder shall be
applied (for purposes of making determinations under this Section 7.4 only) (i)
first, to their Primary Obligations and (ii) second, to their Secondary
Obligations. If any payment to any Secured Creditor of its Pro Rata Share of any
distribution would result in overpayment to such Secured Creditor, such excess
amount shall instead be distributed in respect of the unpaid Primary Obligations
or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, of the other Secured Creditors,
with each Secured Creditor whose Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations,
as the case may be, have not been paid in full to receive an amount equal to
such excess amount multiplied by a fraction the numerator of which is the unpaid
Primary Obligations or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, of such

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

Secured Creditor and the denominator of which is the unpaid Primary Obligations
or Secondary Obligations, as the case may be, of all Secured Creditors entitled
to such distribution.

         (d)    Subject to the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement, all
payments required to be made hereunder shall be made to the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured Creditors.

         (e)    For purposes of applying payments received in accordance with
this Section 7.4, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall be entitled to rely
upon the Second-Lien Trustee for a determination (which the Second-Lien Trustee
agrees (or shall agree) to provide upon request of the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent) of the outstanding Primary Obligations and Secondary Obligations owed to
the Secured Creditors. Unless it has received written notice from a Secured
Creditor to the contrary, the Second-Lien Trustee, in furnishing information
pursuant to the preceding sentence, and the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, in
acting hereunder, shall be entitled to assume that no Secondary Obligations are
outstanding.

         (f)    It is understood that the Assignors shall remain jointly and
severally liable to the extent of any deficiency between the amount of the
proceeds of the Collateral and the aggregate amount of the Obligations.

         7.5    Remedies Cumulative. Subject to the terms of (and to the extent
not inconsistent with) the Intercreditor Agreement, each and every right, power
and remedy hereby specifically given to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall
be in addition to every other right, power and remedy specifically given to the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent under this Agreement, the other Secured Debt
Agreements or now or hereafter existing at law, in equity or by statute and each
and every right, power and remedy whether specifically herein given or otherwise
existing may be exercised from time to time or simultaneously and as often and
in such order as may be deemed expedient by the Majority Noteholders. All such
rights, powers and remedies shall be cumulative and the exercise or the
beginning of the exercise of one shall not be deemed a waiver of the right to
exercise any other or others. No delay or omission of the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent in the exercise of any such right, power or remedy and no renewal or
extension of any of the Obligations shall impair any such right, power or remedy
or shall be construed to be a waiver of any Default or Event of Default or an
acquiescence thereof. No notice to or demand on any Assignor in any case shall
entitle it to any other or further notice or demand in similar or other
circumstances or constitute a waiver of any of the rights of the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent to any other or further action in any circumstances without
notice or demand. In the event that the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall bring
any suit to enforce any of its rights hereunder and shall be entitled to
judgment, then in such suit the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may recover
reasonable expenses, including reasonable attorneys' fees, and the amounts
thereof shall be included in such judgment.

         7.6    Discontinuance of Proceedings. In case the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent shall have instituted any proceeding to enforce any right,
power or remedy under this Agreement by foreclosure, sale, entry or otherwise,
and such proceeding shall have been discontinued or abandoned for any reason or
shall have been determined adversely to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, then
and in every such case the relevant Assignor, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent
and each holder of any of the Obligations shall be restored to their former
positions and rights hereunder with respect to the Collateral subject to the

                                      -22-
<PAGE>

security interest created under this Agreement, and all rights, remedies and
powers of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall continue as if no such
proceeding had been instituted.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

"Indemnitee," and collectively as "Indemnitees") harmless from any and all
liabilities, obligations, damages, injuries, penalties, claims, demands,
actions, suits, judgments and any and all costs, expenses or disbursements
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) (for the purposes of this
Section 8.1 the foregoing are collectively called "expenses") of whatsoever kind
and nature imposed on, asserted against or incurred by any of the Indemnitees in
any way relating to or arising out of this Agreement, any other Secured Debt
Agreement or any other document executed in connection herewith or therewith or
in any other way connected with the administration of the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or the enforcement of any of the terms of, or the
preservation of any rights under any thereof, or in any way relating to or
arising out of the manufacture, ownership, ordering, purchase, delivery,
control, acceptance, lease, financing, possession, operation, condition, sale,
return or other disposition, or use of the Collateral (including, without
limitation, latent or other defects, whether or not discoverable), the violation
of the laws of any country, state or other governmental body or unit, any tort
(including, without limitation, claims arising or imposed under the doctrine of
strict liability, or for or on account of injury to or the death of any Person
(including any Indemnitee), or property damage), or contract claim; provided
that no Indemnitee shall be indemnified pursuant to this Section 8.1(a) for
losses, damages or liabilities to the extent caused by the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of such Indemnitee (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). Each Assignor agrees that
upon written notice by any Indemnitee of the assertion of such a liability,
obligation, damage, injury, penalty, claim, demand, action, suit or judgment,
the relevant Assignor shall assume full responsibility for the defense thereof.
Each Indemnitee agrees to use its best efforts to promptly notify the relevant
Assignor of any such assertion of which such Indemnitee has knowledge.

         (b)    Without limiting the application of Section 8.1(a) hereof, each
Assignor agrees, jointly and severally, to pay or reimburse the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent for any and all reasonable fees, costs and expenses of whatever
kind or nature incurred in connection with the creation, preservation or
protection of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent's Liens on, and security interest
in, the Collateral, including, without limitation, all fees and taxes in
connection with the recording or filing of instruments and documents in public
offices, payment or discharge of any taxes or Liens upon or in respect of the
Collateral, premiums for insurance with respect to the Collateral and all other
fees, costs and expenses in connection with protecting, maintaining or
preserving the Collateral and the Second-Lien Collateral Agent's interest
therein, whether through judicial proceedings or otherwise, or in defending or
prosecuting any actions, suits or proceedings arising out of or relating to the
Collateral.

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

         (c)    Without limiting the application of Section 8.1(a) or (b)
hereof, each Assignor agrees, jointly and severally, to pay, indemnify and hold
each Indemnitee harmless from and against any loss, costs, damages and expenses
which such Indemnitee may suffer, expend or incur in consequence of or growing
out of any misrepresentation by any Assignor in this Agreement, any other
Secured Debt Agreement or in any writing contemplated by or made or delivered
pursuant to or in connection with this Agreement or any other Secured Debt
Agreement.

         (d)    If and to the extent that the obligations of any Assignor under
this Section 8.1 are unenforceable for any reason, such Assignor hereby agrees
to make the maximum contribution to the payment and satisfaction of such
obligations which is permissible under applicable law.

         8.2    Indemnity Obligations Secured by Collateral; Survival. Any
amounts paid by any Indemnitee as to which such Indemnitee has the right to
reimbursement shall constitute Obligations secured by the Collateral. The
indemnity obligations of each Assignor contained in this Article VIII shall
continue in full force and effect notwithstanding the full payment of all of the
other Obligations and notwithstanding the full payment of all the Notes issued,
and Loans made, under the Second-Lien Note Indenture and the payment of all
other Obligations and notwithstanding the discharge thereof and the occurrence
of the Termination Date and the resignation or removal of the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent.

the part of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and the Second-Lien Trustee shall
be read into this Agreement or otherwise exist against the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent and the Second-Lien Trustee. The provisions of this Section
10.13 are solely for the benefit of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, the
Second-Lien Trustee and the Noteholders, and the Assignors shall not have any
rights as a third party beneficiary or otherwise under any of the provisions
hereof. In performing their respective functions and duties hereunder and under
the other Security Documents to which the Second-Lien Collateral Agent is a
party, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall act solely as an agent of the
Second-Lien Trustee and the Noteholders and does not assume nor shall be deemed
to have assumed any obligation or relationship of trust or agency with or for
the Assignors or any of their successors and assigns.

         (b)    Delegation of Duties. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent may
execute any of its duties under this Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the
other Security Documents to which the Second-Lien Collateral Agent is a party by

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

or through receivers, agents or attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to
advice of counsel concerning all matters pertaining to such duties. The
Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall not be responsible for the negligence or
misconduct of any receivers, agents or attorneys-in-fact selected by it with
reasonable care.

         (c)    Exculpatory Provisions. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall
not be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or omitted to be taken by it or
any Person described in Section 11 of the Second-Lien Pledge Agreement under or
in connection with this Agreement, or any other Transaction Document or any
other document or instrument referred to or provided for herein or therein
(except for its or such Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct if
such Person was not selected with reasonable care), or (ii) responsible in any
manner to any of the Noteholders, the Second-Lien Trustee or any other Person
for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by any Assignor
contained in this Agreement or any other Transaction Document or in any
certificate, report, statement or other document referred to or provided for in,
or received under or in connection with, this Agreement or any other Transaction
Document or for the value, validity, effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability
or sufficiency of this Agreement, or any other Transaction Document or for any
failure of any Assignor to perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The
Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall not be required to initiate or conduct any
litigation or collection or other proceeding under this Agreement or any other
Transaction Document. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall not be under any
obligation to the Second-Lien Trustee or to any Noteholder to ascertain or to
inquire as to the observance or performance of any of the agreements contained
in, or conditions of, this Agreement or any other Transaction Document, or to
inspect the properties, books or records of any Assignor. The Second-Lien
Collateral Agent shall have the right at any time to seek instructions from the
Noteholders with respect to the administration of this Agreement, the Guarantee
Agreement or the other Security Documents. Anything to the contrary
notwithstanding, in no event shall the Second-Lien Collateral Agent be liable to
any Person, under this Agreement or any other Transaction Document for special,
punitive, indirect, consequential or incidental loss or damage of any kind
whatsoever (including but not limited to lost profits), even if the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage.

         (d)    Reliance by Second-Lien Collateral Agent. The Second-Lien
Collateral Agent shall be entitled to conclusively rely, and shall be fully
protected in relying, upon any Note, writing, resolution, notice, consent,
certificate, affidavit, letter, cablegram, telegram, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including, without
limitation, counsel to any Assignor or Noteholder), independent accountants and
other experts selected by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent with reasonable due
care. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall not be bound to make any
investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate,
statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent,
order, bond, debenture or other paper or document, delivered to the Second-Lien
Collateral Agent hereunder or under the Transaction Documents. The Second-Lien
Collateral Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner thereof
for all purposes unless the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall have received an
executed transfer instrument in respect thereof. The Second-Lien Collateral
Agent shall have no liability for failing or refusing to take any action under

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

this Agreement or any other Transaction Document unless it shall first receive
such advice, direction, instruction or concurrence of the Majority Noteholders
or the Noteholders as is required hereunder or it shall first be indemnified to
its satisfaction by the Noteholders against any and all liability and expense
which may be incurred by it by reason of taking or continuing to take any such
action; and the Second-Lien Collateral Agent has the right to seek instructions
from the Majority Noteholders before acting or electing not to act under this
Agreement or any other Transaction Document. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent
shall in all cases have no liability in acting, or in refraining from acting,
under this Agreement and the other Transaction Documents in accordance with a
direction or instruction of the Majority Noteholders, and such direction or
instruction and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be
binding upon all of the Noteholders and all future holders of the Notes. This
Section does not govern the relationship of the Assignors and the Noteholders.

         (e)    Non-Reliance on Second-Lien Collateral Agent. Each Assignor and
Noteholder expressly acknowledges that the Second-Lien Collateral Agent, or any
of its officers, directors, employees, agents, attorneys-in-fact or Affiliates
has not made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent hereafter taken, including, without limitation, any
review of the affairs of any Assignor or Noteholder, shall be deemed to
constitute any representation or warranty by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent.

         (f)    Second-Lien Collateral Agent in its Individual Capacity. The
Second-Lien Collateral Agent and its Affiliates may make loans to, accept
deposits from and generally engage in any kind of business with the Assignors
and Noteholders as though the Second-Lien Collateral Agent were not the
collateral agent hereunder.

         (g)    Successor Second-Lien Collateral Agent. The Second-Lien
Collateral Agent may resign as collateral agent upon thirty (30) days notice to
the Borrower and the Noteholders and the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may be
removed from its position as collateral agent at any time by the Noteholders. If
the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall resign as collateral agent under this
Agreement or be removed pursuant to the preceding sentence, then the Majority
Noteholders during such 30-day period shall appoint a successor collateral
agent, and upon the acceptance by such successor collateral agent, the successor
collateral agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent and the term "Second-Lien Collateral Agent" shall
mean such successor collateral agent, effective upon its appointment and
acceptance, and the former Second-Lien Collateral Agent's rights, powers and
duties as collateral agent shall then be terminated, without any other or
further act or deed on the part of such former Second-Lien Collateral Agent or
any of the parties to this Agreement or any Noteholders. After any retiring
Second-Lien Collateral Agent's resignation hereunder as collateral agent, the
provisions of this Section 10.13 shall inure to its benefit as to any actions
taken or omitted to be taken by it while it was Second-Lien Collateral Agent
under this Agreement. If the Second-Lien Collateral Agent consolidates with,
merges with or converts into, or transfers all or substantially all of its
assets (including the administration of this Agreement and the other Transaction
Documents) to, another Person, the resulting, surviving or transferee Person,
without any further act, shall be the successor Second-Lien Collateral Agent.

         (h)    Actions by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent. In each case that
the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may or is required hereunder, the Guarantee
Agreement or any other Security Document to take any action (a "Collateral Agent

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

Action"), including without limitation to make any determination or judgment, to
give consents, to exercise rights, powers or remedies, to release or sell
collateral or otherwise to act hereunder, under the Guarantee Agreement or under
any other Security Document, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent may seek direction
from the Majority Noteholders. The Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall not be
liable with respect to any Collateral Agent Action taken or omitted to be taken
by it in good faith in accordance with the direction from the Majority
Noteholders. If the Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall request direction from
the Majority Noteholders with respect to any Collateral Agent Action, the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall be entitled to refrain from such Collateral
Agent Action unless and until such Second-Lien Collateral Agent shall have
received direction from the Majority Noteholders and the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent shall not incur liability to any Person by reason of so refraining.

                (i)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement
         or any other Transaction Document, in no event shall the Second-Lien
         Collateral Agent be responsible for, or have any duty or obligation
         with respect to, the recording, filing, registering, perfection,
         protection or maintenance of the security interests or Liens intended
         to be created by this Agreement or the other Security Documents
         (including without limitation any UCC financing or continuation
         statements or similar documents or instruments), nor shall the
         Second-Lien Collateral Agent be responsible for, and the Second-Lien
         Collateral Agent makes no representation regarding, the validity,
         effectiveness or priority of any of this Agreement, the Guarantee
         Agreement or the Security Documents or the security interests or Liens
         intended to be created hereby or thereby.

                (ii)  The Second-Lien Collateral Agent is hereby directed by the
         Noteholders to execute this Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement and the
         Security Documents as contemplated herein.

                (iii) Whenever in the administration of this Agreement, the
         Guarantee Agreement or any Security Document, the Second-Lien
         Collateral Agent shall deem it necessary that a matter with respect to
         the Assignors be provided or established prior to taking or suffering
         or omitting to take any act hereunder or thereunder, such matter
         (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein or therein
         specifically prescribed) may, in the absence of gross negligence, bad
         faith or willful misconduct on the part of the Second-Lien Collateral
         Agent be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an
         officers' certificate delivered by the applicable Assignor to the
         Second-Lien Collateral Agent, and such certificate, in the absence of
         gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct on the part of the
         Second-Lien Collateral Agent, shall be full warrant to the Second-Lien
         Collateral Agent for any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken
         by it under the provisions of this Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement
         or any Security Document upon the faith thereof.

                (iv)  Any direction, request, notice, consent or other action
         provided or permitted by this Agreement, the Guarantee Agreement or the
         Security Documents to be given, made or taken by the Noteholders may be
         embodied in or evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially

                                      -38-
<PAGE>

         similar tenor signed by the Noteholders in person or by and agent
         thereof duly appointed in writing; and such action, except as otherwise
         expressly provided herein, shall become effective when such instrument
         or instruments are delivered to the Second-Lien Collateral Agent. The
         fact and date of the execution of any such instrument or writing may be
         proved in any manner that the Second-Lien Collateral Agent deems
         sufficient. The holding of Notes shall be proved by the Note Register.
         (v) Acceptance of Terms of Noteholders. Each Noteholder, by accepting a
         Note, agrees to all the terms and provisions set forth herein and in
         the Guarantee Agreement and the other Security Documents.

Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein or in any other Secured Debt
Agreement, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and Second-Lien Trustee shall have
no liability whatsoever to any Person party to any Secured Debt Agreement or to
any other Person (including, without limitation, the Noteholders) for failing
to perfect or failing to maintain perfection on any of the security interests
granted hereby (including without limitation, filing any financing statements
or continuation statements).

         10.14  Compliance with Laws. Each Assignor agrees to use commercially
reasonable efforts, including taking any action which the Second-Lien Collateral
Agent and the Secured Creditors may reasonably request, to assist in obtaining
any required consent or approval of the Federal Communications Commission (the
"FCC") or any other governmental or other authority for any sale or transfer of
control of the Collateral contemplated by the security documents pursuant to the
exercise of the rights and remedies of the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and the
Secured Creditors thereunder, including, upon request, to prepare, sign and file
with the FCC the assignor's or transferor's and licensee's portions of any
applications required under the rules of the FCC for consent to the assignment
or transfer of control of any FCC construction permit, license or other
authorization.

         Each Assignor further consents, subject to obtaining any necessary
approvals, to the assignment or transfer of control of any FCC or other
governmental construction permit, license, or other authorization to operate, to
a receiver, trustee, or similar official or to any purchaser of the Collateral
pursuant to any public or private sale, judicial sale, foreclosure, or exercise
of other remedies available to Second-Lien Collateral Agent and the Secured
Creditors as permitted by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything herein which
may be construed to the contrary, no action shall be taken by any of the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent and the Secured Creditors with respect to any
license of the FCC unless and until any applicable rules and regulations
thereunder, requiring the consent to or approval of such action by the FCC or
any governmental or other authority, have been satisfied.

         10.15  Conflicts; Intercreditor Agreement. Notwithstanding anything
herein to the contrary, the lien and security interest granted to the
Second-Lien Collateral Agent pursuant to this Agreement and the exercise of any
right or remedy by the Second-Lien Collateral Agent hereunder are subject to the
provisions of the Intercreditor Agreement. In the event of any conflict between
the terms of the Intercreditor Agreement and this Agreement, the terms of the
Intercreditor Agreement shall govern and control.
