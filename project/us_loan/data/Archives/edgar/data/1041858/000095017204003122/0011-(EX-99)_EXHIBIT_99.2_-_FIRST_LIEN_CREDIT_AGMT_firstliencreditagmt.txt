                FIRST-LIEN CREDIT AGREEMENT, dated as of December 21, 2004,
among RCN CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the "Borrower"), the Lenders
party hereto from time to time, and DEUTSCHE BANK AG CAYMAN ISLANDS BRANCH, as
Administrative Agent (in such capacity, the "Administrative Agent"). All
capitalized terms used herein and defined in Section 11 are used herein as
therein defined.

                              W I T N E S S E T H:

                WHEREAS, subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, the Lenders are willing to make available to the Borrower the respective
credit facilities provided for herein;

                NOW, THEREFORE, IT IS AGREED:

                SECTION 1. Amount and Terms of Credit.

                1.01    The Commitments. Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment severally
agrees to make a term loan or term loans (each a "Term Loan" and, collectively,
the "Term Loans") to the Borrower in an amount equal to such Lender's Term Loan
Percentage, which Term Loans (i) shall be incurred pursuant to a single drawing
on the Initial Borrowing Date, (ii) shall be denominated in Dollars, (iii)
except as hereinafter provided, shall, at the option of the Borrower, be
incurred and maintained as, and/or converted into, Base Rate Loans or Eurodollar
Loans, provided that (A) except as otherwise specifically provided in Section
1.10(b), all Term Loans comprising the same Borrowing shall at all times be of
the same Type, and (B) unless either the Administrative Agent otherwise agrees
in its sole discretion or has determined that the Syndication Date has occurred
(at which time this clause (B) shall no longer be applicable), prior to the 90th
day following the Initial Borrowing Date, Term Loans may only be incurred and
maintained as, and/or converted into, Eurodollar Loans so long as all such
outstanding Eurodollar Loans are subject to an Interest Period of one month
which begins and ends on the same day with the first such Interest Period to
begin no sooner than three Business Days after the Initial Borrowing Date, and
(iv) shall be made by each such Lender in that aggregate principal amount which
does not exceed the Term Loan Commitment of such Lender on the Initial Borrowing
Date. Once repaid, Term Loans incurred hereunder may not be reborrowed.

                1.02    Minimum Amount of Borrowing. The aggregate principal
amount of each Borrowing of Term Loans shall not be less than the Minimum
Borrowing Amount. More than one Borrowing may occur on the same date, but at no
time shall there be outstanding more than ten Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans.

                1.03    Notice of Borrowing. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires
to incur (x) Eurodollar Loans hereunder, it shall give the Administrative Agent
at the Notice Office at least three Business Days' prior notice of each
Eurodollar Loan to be incurred hereunder and (y) Base Rate Loans hereunder, it
shall give the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office at least one Business
Day's prior notice of each Base Rate Loan to be incurred hereunder, provided
that (in each case) any such notice shall be deemed to have been given on a
certain day only if given before 12:00 Noon (New York time) on such day. Each
such notice (each a "Notice of Borrowing"),

<PAGE>

except as otherwise expressly provided in Section 1.10, shall be irrevocable and
shall be in writing, or by telephone promptly confirmed in writing, in the form
of Exhibit A-1, appropriately completed to specify: (i) the aggregate principal
amount of the Term Loans to be incurred pursuant to such Borrowing, (ii) the
date of such Borrowing (which shall be a Business Day), and (iii) whether the
Term Loans being incurred pursuant to such Borrowing are to be initially
maintained as Base Rate Loans or, to the extent permitted hereunder, Eurodollar
Loans and, if Eurodollar Loans, the initial Interest Period to be applicable
thereto. The Administrative Agent shall promptly give each Lender which is
required to make Term Loans notice of such proposed Borrowing, of such Lender's
proportionate share thereof and of the other matters required by the immediately
preceding sentence to be specified in the Notice of Borrowing.

                (b)     Without in any way limiting the obligation of the
Borrower to confirm in writing any telephonic notice of any Borrowing or
prepayment of Term Loans, the Administrative Agent may act without liability
upon the basis of telephonic notice of such Borrowing or prepayment, as the case
may be, believed by the Administrative Agent in good faith to be from an
Authorized Representative of the Borrower. In each such case, the Borrower
hereby waives the right to dispute the Administrative Agent's record of the
terms of such telephonic notice of such Borrowing or prepayment of Term Loans,
as the case may be, absent manifest error.

                1.04    Disbursement of Funds. On the Initial Borrowing Date,
each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment will make available its pro rata portion
(determined in accordance with Section 1.07) of the Total Term Loan Commitment.
All such amounts will be made available in Dollars and in immediately available
funds at the Payment Office, and the Administrative Agent will make available to
the Borrower at the Payment Office the aggregate of the amounts so made
available by the Lenders. Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been
notified by any Lender prior to the Initial Borrowing Date that such Lender does
not intend to make available to the Administrative Agent such Lender's portion
of any Borrowing to be made on the Initial Borrowing Date, the Administrative
Agent may assume that such Lender has made such amount available to the
Administrative Agent on the Initial Borrowing Date and the Administrative Agent
may (but shall not be obligated to), in reliance upon such assumption, make
available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such corresponding amount
is not in fact made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender, the
Administrative Agent shall be entitled to recover such corresponding amount on
demand from such Lender. If such Lender does not pay such corresponding amount
forthwith upon the Administrative Agent's demand therefor, the Administrative
Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower and the Borrower shall immediately pay
such corresponding amount to the Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent
also shall be entitled to recover on demand from such Lender or the Borrower, as
the case may be, interest on such corresponding amount in respect of each day
from the date such corresponding amount was made available by the Administrative
Agent to the Borrower until the date such corresponding amount is recovered by
the Administrative Agent, at a rate per annum equal to (i) if recovered from
such Lender, the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first three days and at
the interest rate otherwise applicable to such Term Loans for each day
thereafter and (ii) if recovered from the Borrower, the rate of interest
applicable to the respective Borrowing, as determined pursuant to Section 1.08.
Nothing in this Section 1.04 shall be deemed to relieve any Lender from its
obligation to make Term Loans hereunder or to prejudice any rights which the

                                       -2-
<PAGE>

Borrower may have against any Lender as a result of any failure by such Lender
to make Term Loans hereunder.

                1.05    Term Notes. (a) The Borrower's obligation to pay the
principal of, and interest on, the Term Loans made by each Lender shall be
evidenced in the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent pursuant to
Section 13.15 and shall, if requested by such Lender, also be evidenced by a
promissory note duly executed and delivered by the Borrower substantially in the
form of Exhibit B, with blanks appropriately completed in conformity herewith
(each a "Term Note" and, collectively, the "Term Notes").

                (b)     The Term Note issued to each Lender that has a Term Loan
Commitment or outstanding Term Loans shall (i) be executed by the Borrower, (ii)
be payable to such Lender or its registered assigns and be dated the Initial
Borrowing Date (or, if issued after the Initial Borrowing Date, be dated the
date of issuance thereof), (iii) be in a stated principal amount equal to the
Term Loans made by such Lender on the Initial Borrowing Date (or, if issued
after the Initial Borrowing Date, be in a stated principal amount equal to the
outstanding Term Loans of such Lender at such time) and be payable in the
outstanding principal amount of Term Loans evidenced thereby, (iv) mature on the
Final Maturity Date, (v) bear interest as provided in the appropriate clause of
Section 1.08 in respect of the Base Rate Loans and Eurodollar Loans, as the case
may be, evidenced thereby, (vi) be subject to voluntary prepayment as provided
in Section 4.01, and mandatory repayment as provided in Section 4.02, and (vii)
be entitled to the benefits of this Agreement and the other Credit Documents.

                (c)     Each Lender will note on its internal records the amount
of each Term Loan made by it and each payment in respect thereof and prior to
any transfer of any of its Term Notes will endorse on the reverse side thereof
the outstanding principal amount of Term Loans evidenced thereby. Failure to
make any such notation or any error in such notation shall not affect the
Borrower's obligations in respect of such Term Loans.

                (d)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained above
in this Section 1.05 or elsewhere in this Agreement, Term Notes shall only be
delivered to Lenders which at any time specifically request the delivery of such
Term Notes. No failure of any Lender to request or obtain a Term Note evidencing
its Term Loans to the Borrower shall affect or in any manner impair the
obligations of the Borrower to pay the Term Loans (and all related Obligations)
incurred by the Borrower which would otherwise be evidenced thereby in
accordance with the requirements of this Agreement, and shall not in any way
affect the security or guaranties therefor provided pursuant to the various
Credit Documents. Any Lender which does not have a Term Note evidencing its
outstanding Term Loans shall in no event be required to make the notations
otherwise described in preceding clause (e). At any time when any Lender
requests the delivery of a Term Note to evidence any of its Term Loans, the
Borrower shall promptly execute and deliver to the respective Lender the
requested Term Note in the appropriate amount or amounts to evidence such Term
Loans.

                1.06    Conversions. The Borrower shall have the option to
convert, on any Business Day, all or a portion equal to at least the Minimum
Borrowing Amount of the outstanding principal amount of Term Loans into a
Borrowing of another Type of Term Loan, provided that, (i) except as otherwise
provided in Section 1.10(b), Eurodollar Loans may be converted into

                                       -3-
<PAGE>

Base Rate Loans only on the last day of an Interest Period applicable to the
Term Loans being converted and no such partial conversion of Eurodollar Loans
shall reduce the outstanding principal amount of such Eurodollar Loans made
pursuant to a single Borrowing to less than the Minimum Borrowing Amount
applicable thereto, (ii) unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, Base Rate
Loans may only be converted into Eurodollar Loans if no Default or Event of
Default is in existence on the date of the conversion, (iii) unless the
Administrative Agent otherwise agrees in its sole discretion or has determined
that the Syndication Date has occurred (at which time this clause (iii) shall no
longer be applicable), prior to the 90th day following the Initial Borrowing
Date, conversions of Base Rate Loans into Eurodollar Loans shall be subject to
the provisions of clause (B) of the proviso in Section 1.01(iii), and (iv) no
conversion pursuant to this Section 1.06 shall result in a greater number of
Borrowings of Eurodollar Loans than is permitted under Section 1.02. Each such
conversion shall be effected by the Borrower by giving the Administrative Agent
at the Notice Office prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) at least three Business
Days' prior notice (each a "Notice of Conversion/Continuation") in the form of
Exhibit A-2, appropriately completed to specify the Term Loans to be so
converted, the Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such Term Loans were
incurred and, if to be converted into Eurodollar Loans, the Interest Period to
be initially applicable thereto. The Administrative Agent shall give each Lender
prompt notice of any such proposed conversion affecting any of its Term Loans.
Upon any such conversion the proceeds thereof will be deemed to be applied
directly on the day of such conversion to prepay the outstanding principal
amount of the Term Loans being converted.

                1.07    Pro Rata Borrowings. All Borrowings of Term Loans under
this Agreement shall be incurred from the Lenders pro rata on the basis of their
Term Loan Commitments. It is understood that no Lender shall be responsible for
any default by any other Lender of its obligation to make Term Loans hereunder
and that each Lender shall be obligated to make the Term Loans provided to be
made by it hereunder, regardless of the failure of any other Lender to make its
Term Loans hereunder.

                1.08    Interest. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay interest in
respect of the unpaid principal amount of each Base Rate Loan from the date of
Borrowing thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by
acceleration or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Base Rate Loan to a
Eurodollar Loan pursuant to Section 1.06 or 1.09, as applicable, at a rate per
annum which shall be equal to the sum of the Applicable Margin plus the Base
Rate each as in effect from time to time.

                (b)     The Borrower agrees to pay interest in respect of the
unpaid principal amount of each Eurodollar Loan from the date of Borrowing
thereof until the earlier of (i) the maturity thereof (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) and (ii) the conversion of such Eurodollar Loan to a Base Rate
Loan pursuant to Section 1.06, 1.09 or 1.10, as applicable, at a rate per annum
which shall, during each Interest Period applicable thereto, be equal to the sum
of the Applicable Margin as in effect from time to time during such Interest
Period plus the Eurodollar Rate for such Interest Period.

                (c)     Overdue principal and, to the extent permitted by law,
overdue interest in respect of each Term Loan shall, in each case, bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to the greater of (x) the rate which is 2% in excess
of the rate then borne by such Term Loans and (y)

                                       -4-
<PAGE>

the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate otherwise applicable to Term Loans
that are maintained at Base Rate Loans from time to time, and all other overdue
amounts payable hereunder and under any other Credit Document shall bear
interest at a rate per annum equal to the rate which is 2% in excess of the rate
otherwise applicable to Term Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans from
time to time. Interest that accrues under this Section 1.08(c) shall be payable
on demand.

                (d)     Accrued (and theretofore unpaid) interest shall be
payable (i) in respect of each Base Rate Loan, (x) quarterly in arrears on each
Quarterly Payment Date, (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment in full
of all outstanding Base Rate Loans, and (z) at maturity (whether by acceleration
or otherwise) and, after such maturity, on demand, and (ii) in respect of each
Eurodollar Loan, (x) on the last day of each Interest Period applicable thereto
and, in the case of an Interest Period in excess of three months, on each date
occurring at three month intervals after the first day of such Interest Period,
and (y) on the date of any repayment or prepayment (on the amount repaid or
prepaid), at maturity (whether by acceleration or otherwise) and, after such
maturity, on demand.

                (e)     Upon each Interest Determination Date, the
Administrative Agent shall determine the Eurodollar Rate for each Interest
Period applicable to the respective Eurodollar Loans and shall promptly notify
the Borrower and the Lenders thereof. Each such determination shall, absent
manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all parties hereto.

                1.09    Interest Periods for Eurodollar Loans. At the time the
Borrower gives any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of Conversion/Continuation in
respect of the making of, or conversion into, any Eurodollar Loan (in the case
of the initial Interest Period applicable thereto) or prior to 12:00 Noon (New
York time) on the third Business Day prior to the expiration of an Interest
Period applicable to such Eurodollar Loan (in the case of any subsequent
Interest Period), the Borrower shall have the right to elect the interest period
(each an "Interest Period") applicable to such Eurodollar Loan, which Interest
Period shall, at the option of the Borrower (but otherwise subject to the
provisions of clause (B) of the proviso in Section 1.01(iii), be a one, two,
three or six month period or, to the extent agreed by all Lenders with Term
Loans, a nine or twelve month period, provided that (in each case):

                (i)     all Eurodollar Loans comprising a Borrowing shall at all
        times have the same Interest Period;

                (ii)    the initial Interest Period for any Eurodollar Loan
        shall commence on the date of Borrowing of such Eurodollar Loan
        (including the date of any conversion thereto from a Base Rate Loan) and
        each Interest Period occurring thereafter in respect of such Eurodollar
        Loan shall commence on the day on which the next preceding Interest
        Period applicable thereto expires;

                (iii)   if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan begins on a
        day for which there is no numerically corresponding day in the calendar
        month at the end of such Interest Period, such Interest Period shall end
        on the last Business Day of such calendar month;

                                       -5-
<PAGE>

                (iv)    if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would
        otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day, such Interest
        Period shall expire on the next succeeding Business Day; provided,
        however, that if any Interest Period for a Eurodollar Loan would
        otherwise expire on a day which is not a Business Day but is a day of
        the month after which no further Business Day occurs in such month, such
        Interest Period shall expire on the next preceding Business Day;

                (v)     unless the Required Lenders otherwise agree, no Interest
        Period may be selected at any time when a Default or an Event of Default
        is then in existence;

                (vi)    no Interest Period shall be selected which extends
        beyond the Final Maturity Date; and

                (vii)   no Interest Period in respect of any Borrowing of Term
        Loans shall be selected which extends beyond any date upon which a
        mandatory repayment of such Term Loans will be required to be made under
        Section 4.02(b) if the aggregate principal amount of such Term Loans
        which have Interest Periods which will expire after such date will be in
        excess of the aggregate principal amount of such Term Loans then
        outstanding less the aggregate amount of such required repayment.

                If by 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the third Business Day prior
to the expiration of any Interest Period applicable to a Borrowing of Eurodollar
Loans, the Borrower has failed to elect, or is not permitted to elect, a new
Interest Period to be applicable to such Eurodollar Loans as provided above, the
Borrower shall be deemed to have elected to convert such Eurodollar Loans into
Base Rate Loans effective as of the expiration date of such current Interest
Period.

                1.10    Increased Costs, Illegality, etc. (a) In the event that
any Lender shall have determined (which determination shall, absent manifest
error, be final and conclusive and binding upon all parties hereto but, with
respect to clause (i) below, may be made only by the Administrative Agent):

                (i)     on any Interest Determination Date that, by reason of
        any changes arising after the date of this Agreement affecting the
        interbank Eurodollar market, adequate and fair means do not exist for
        ascertaining the applicable interest rate on the basis provided for in
        the definition of Eurodollar Rate; or

                (ii)    at any time, that such Lender shall incur increased
        costs or reductions in the amounts received or receivable hereunder with
        respect to any Eurodollar Loan because of (x) any change since the
        Effective Date in any applicable law or governmental rule, regulation,
        order, guideline or request (whether or not having the force of law) or
        in the interpretation or administration thereof and including the
        introduction of any new law or governmental rule, regulation, order,
        guideline or request, such as, but not limited to: (A) a change in the
        basis of taxation of payment to any Lender of the principal of or
        interest on the Term Loans or the Term Notes or any other amounts
        payable hereunder (except for changes in the rate of tax on, or
        determined by reference to, the net income or net profits or capital or
        franchise taxes imposed in lieu thereof of such Lender or, in the

                                       -6-
<PAGE>

        case of a Lender that is a flow-through entity for tax purposes, a
        member or a partner of such Lender, pursuant to the laws of the country
        or national jurisdiction (or any political subdivision thereof) in which
        it is organized or in which its principal office or applicable lending
        office is located) (the preceding sentence shall not apply to increased
        costs with respect to Taxes which are addressed in Section 4.04) or (B)
        a change in official reserve requirements, but, in all events, excluding
        reserves required under Regulation D to the extent included in the
        computation of the Eurodollar Rate and/or (y) other circumstances
        arising since the Effective Date affecting such Lender, the interbank
        Eurodollar market or the position of such Lender in such market; or

                (iii)   at any time, that the making or continuance of any
        Eurodollar Loan has been made (x) unlawful by any law or governmental
        rule, regulation or order, (y) impossible by compliance by any Lender in
        good faith with any governmental request (whether or not having force of
        law) or (z) impracticable as a result of a contingency occurring after
        the Effective Date which materially and adversely affects the interbank
        Eurodollar market;

then, and in any such event, such Lender (or the Administrative Agent, in the
case of clause (i) above) shall promptly give notice (by telephone promptly
confirmed in writing) to the Borrower and, except in the case of clause (i)
above, to the Administrative Agent of such determination (which notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the other Lenders).
Thereafter (x) in the case of clause (i) above, Eurodollar Loans shall no longer
be available until such time as the Administrative Agent notifies the Borrower
and the Lenders that the circumstances giving rise to such notice by the
Administrative Agent no longer exist, and any Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation given by the Borrower with respect to Eurodollar Loans
which have not yet been incurred (including by way of conversion) shall be
deemed rescinded by the Borrower, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, but
subject to Section 13.17, the Borrower agrees to pay to such Lender, upon such
Lender's written request therefor, such additional amounts (in the form of an
increased rate of, or a different method of calculating, interest or otherwise
as such Lender in its sole discretion shall determine) as shall be required to
compensate such Lender for such increased costs or reductions in amounts
received or receivable hereunder (a written notice as to the additional amounts
owed to such Lender, showing in reasonable detail the basis for and the
calculation thereof, submitted to the Borrower by such Lender shall, absent
manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on all the parties hereto)
and (z) in the case of clause (iii) above, the Borrower shall take one of the
actions specified in Section 1.10(b) as promptly as possible and, in any event,
within the time period required by law.

                (b)     At any time that any Eurodollar Loan is affected by the
circumstances described in Section 1.10(a)(ii), the Borrower may, and in the
case of a Eurodollar Loan affected by the circumstances described in Section
1.10(a)(iii), the Borrower shall, either (x) if the affected Eurodollar Loan is
then being made initially or pursuant to a conversion, cancel such Borrowing by
giving the Administrative Agent telephonic notice (confirmed in writing) on the
same date that the Borrower was notified by the affected Lender or the
Administrative Agent pursuant to Section 1.10(a)(ii) or (iii) or (y) if the
affected Eurodollar Loan is then outstanding, upon at least three Business Days'
written notice to the Administrative Agent, require the affected Lender to
convert such Eurodollar Loan into a Base Rate Loan, provided that, if more

                                       -7-
<PAGE>

than one Lender is affected at any time, then all affected Lenders must be
treated the same pursuant to this Section 1.10(b).

                (c)     If any Lender determines that after the Effective Date
the introduction of or any change in any applicable law or governmental rule,
regulation, order, guideline, directive or request (whether or not having the
force of law) concerning capital adequacy, or any change in interpretation or
administration thereof by the NAIC or any governmental authority, central bank
or comparable agency, will have the effect of increasing the amount of capital
required or expected to be maintained by such Lender or any corporation
controlling such Lender based on the existence of such Lender's Commitments
hereunder or its obligations hereunder, then the Borrower agrees to pay to such
Lender, upon its written demand therefor, but subject to the provisions of
Section 13.17 (to the extent applicable), such additional amounts as shall be
required to compensate such Lender or such other corporation for the increased
cost to such Lender or such other corporation or the reduction in the rate of
return to such Lender or such other corporation as a result of such increase of
capital. In determining such additional amounts, each Lender will act reasonably
and in good faith and will use averaging and attribution methods which are
reasonable, provided that such Lender's determination of compensation owing
under this Section 1.10(c) shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive
and binding on all the parties hereto. Each Lender, upon determining that any
additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 1.10(c), will give
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall show in
reasonable detail the basis for calculation of such additional amounts.

                1.11    Compensation. Subject to Section 13.17, the Borrower
agrees to compensate each Lender, upon its written request (which request shall
set forth in reasonable detail the basis for requesting such compensation), for
all losses, expenses and liabilities (including, without limitation, any loss,
expense or liability incurred by reason of the liquidation or reemployment of
deposits or other funds required by such Lender to fund its Eurodollar Loans but
excluding loss of anticipated profits) which such Lender may sustain: (i) if for
any reason (other than a default by such Lender or the Administrative Agent) a
Borrowing of, or conversion from or into, Eurodollar Loans does not occur on a
date specified therefor in a Notice of Borrowing or Notice of
Conversion/Continuation (whether or not withdrawn by the Borrower or deemed
withdrawn pursuant to Section 1.10(a)); (ii) if any prepayment or repayment
(including any prepayment or repayment made pursuant to Section 4.01, Section
4.02 or as a result of an acceleration of the Term Loans pursuant to Section 10)
or conversion of any of its Eurodollar Loans occurs on a date which is not the
last day of an Interest Period with respect thereto; (iii) if any prepayment of
any of its Eurodollar Loans is not made on any date specified in a notice of
prepayment given by the Borrower; or (iv) as a consequence of (x) any other
default by the Borrower to repay Eurodollar Loans when required by the terms of
this Agreement or any Term Note held by such Lender or (y) any election made
pursuant to Section 1.10(b).

                1.12    Change of Lending Office. Each Lender agrees that on the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 1.10(a)(ii) or
(iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2.06 or Section 4.04 with respect to such
Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use reasonable efforts (subject
to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to designate another lending
office for any Term Loans or Letters of Credit affected by such event with the
object of avoiding the consequence of the event giving rise to the operation of
such Section, provided that such designation is made on such terms that such
Lender and its lending office suffer no economic,

                                       -8-
<PAGE>

legal or regulatory disadvantage. Nothing in this Section 1.12 shall affect or
postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the right of any Lender
provided in Sections 1.10, 2.06 and 4.04.

                1.13    Replacement of Lenders. (x) If any Lender becomes a
Defaulting Lender or otherwise defaults in its obligations to make Term Loans,
(y) upon the occurrence of an event giving rise to the operation of Section
1.10(a)(ii) or (iii), Section 1.10(c), Section 2.06 or Section 4.04 with respect
to any Lender which results in such Lender charging to the Borrower increased
costs or requires the Borrower to pay any amounts under Section 4.04, in each
case in excess of those being generally charged by the other Lenders or (z) in
the case of a refusal by a Lender to consent to certain proposed changes,
waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to this Agreement which have
been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the extent) provided in Section
13.12(b), the Borrower shall have the right, if no Default or Event of Default
then exists (or, in the case of preceding clause (z), will exist immediately
after giving effect to such replacement), to replace such Lender (the "Replaced
Lender") with one or more other Eligible Transferees, none of whom shall
constitute a Defaulting Lender at the time of such replacement (collectively,
the "Replacement Lender") and each of whom shall be required to be reasonably
acceptable to the Administrative Agent (or, at the option of the Borrower, if
the circumstances described above in this Section 1.13, or the consents required
of the respective Lender as described above, relate to only a single Tranche
hereunder, to replace only the Commitments and related outstandings and/or
participations of the respective Tranche of the Replaced Lender with a
Replacement Lender as described herein), provided that (i) at the time of any
replacement pursuant to this Section 1.13, the Replacement Lender shall enter
into one or more Assignment and Assumption Agreements pursuant to Section
13.04(b) (and with all fees payable pursuant to said Section 13.04(b) to be paid
by the Replacement Lender and/or the Replaced Lender (as may be agreed to at
such time by and among the Borrower, the Replacement Lender and the Replaced
Lender)) pursuant to which the Replacement Lender shall acquire all of the
Commitments and outstanding Term Loans of, and in each case participations in
Letters of Credit by, the Replaced Lender (or all of the foregoing relating to
the Tranche of the Replaced Lender being replaced, in the event that the
replacement is not in respect of all Tranches) and, in connection therewith,
shall pay to (x) the Replaced Lender in respect thereof an amount equal to the
sum of (I) an amount equal to the principal of, and all accrued interest on, all
outstanding Term Loans of the Replaced Lender (unless the Replaced Lender is not
being replaced with respect to such Tranche), (II) an amount equal to all Unpaid
Drawings that have been funded by (and not reimbursed to) such Replaced Lender,
together with all then unpaid interest with respect thereto at such time (unless
the Replaced Lender is not being replaced with respect to such Tranche) and
(III) an amount equal to all accrued, but theretofore unpaid, Fees owing to the
Replaced Lender pursuant to Section 3.01 (except to the extent that such Fees
relate to a Tranche with respect to which the Replaced Lender is not being
replaced) and (y) unless the Replaced Lender is not being replaced with respect
the L/C Commitment, each Issuing Lender an amount equal to such Replaced
Lender's L/C Percentage of any Unpaid Drawing (which at such time remains an
Unpaid Drawing) to the extent such amount was not theretofore funded by such
Replaced Lender to such Issuing Lender and (ii) all obligations of the Borrower
due and owing to the Replaced Lender at such time (other than (x) those
specifically described in clause (i) above in respect of which the assignment
purchase price has been, or is concurrently being, paid and (y) those relating
to a Tranche where the respective Replaced Lender is not being replaced) shall
be paid in full to such Replaced Lender concurrently with such replacement. Upon
the execution of the respective Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the payment
of amounts referred to in

                                       -9-
<PAGE>

clauses (i) and (ii) above and, if so requested by the Replacement Lender (if it
is acquiring Term Loans or any Term Loan Commitment pursuant to the respective
replacement), delivery to the Replacement Lender of the appropriate Term Note or
Term Notes executed by the Borrower, the Replacement Lender shall become a
Lender hereunder and the Replaced Lender shall cease to constitute a Lender
hereunder (with respect to any Tranche or Tranches with respect to which it is
being replaced), except with respect to indemnification provisions under this
Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06
and 13.01), which shall survive as to such Replaced Lender.

                SECTION 2. Letters of Credit.

                2.01    Letters of Credit. (a) Subject to and upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein, the Borrower may request that an Issuing Lender
issue, at any time and from time to time on and after the Initial Borrowing Date
and prior to the 60th day prior to the Final Maturity Date, for the account of
the Borrower and for the benefit of (x) any holder (or any trustee, agent or
other similar representative for any such holders) of L/C Supportable
Obligations, an irrevocable standby letter of credit, in a form customarily used
by such Issuing Lender or in such other form as is reasonably acceptable to such
Issuing Lender, and (y) sellers of goods to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, an irrevocable trade letter of credit, in a form customarily used
by such Issuing Lender or in such other form as has been approved by such
Issuing Lender (each such letter of credit, a "Letter of Credit" and,
collectively, the "Letters of Credit"). All Letters of Credit shall be
denominated in Dollars and shall be issued on a sight basis only.

                (b)     Subject to and upon the terms and conditions set forth
herein, each Issuing Lender agrees that it will, at any time and from time to
time on and after the Initial Borrowing Date and prior to the 60th day prior to
the Final Maturity Date, following its receipt of the respective Letter of
Credit Request, issue for account of the Borrower, one or more Letters of Credit
as are permitted to remain outstanding hereunder without giving rise to a
Default or an Event of Default, provided that no Issuing Lender shall be under
any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit of the types described above if at
the time of such issuance:

                (i)     any order, judgment or decree of any governmental
        authority or arbitrator shall purport by its terms to enjoin or restrain
        such Issuing Lender from issuing such Letter of Credit or any
        requirement of law applicable to such Issuing Lender or any request or
        directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any governmental
        authority with jurisdiction over such Issuing Lender shall prohibit, or
        request that such Issuing Lender refrain from, the issuance of letters
        of credit generally or such Letter of Credit in particular or shall
        impose upon such Issuing Lender with respect to such Letter of Credit
        any restriction or reserve or capital requirement (for which such
        Issuing Lender is not otherwise compensated hereunder) not in effect
        with respect to such Issuing Lender on the date hereof, or any
        unreimbursed loss, cost or expense which was not applicable or in effect
        with respect to such Issuing Lender as of the date hereof and which such
        Issuing Lender reasonably and in good faith deems material to it; or

                (ii)    such Issuing Lender shall have received from the
        Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders prior to the
        issuance of such Letter of Credit notice of the type described in the
        second sentence of Section 2.03(b).

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

                2.02    Maximum Letter of Credit Outstandings; Final Maturities.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, (i) no
Letter of Credit shall be issued the Stated Amount of which, when added to the
Letter of Credit Outstandings (exclusive of Unpaid Drawings which are repaid on
the date of, and prior to the issuance of, the respective Letter of Credit) at
such time would exceed the Total L/C Commitment at such time, and (ii) each
Letter of Credit shall by its terms terminate (x) in the case of standby Letters
of Credit, on or before the earlier of (A) the date which occurs 12 months after
the date of the issuance thereof (although any such standby Letter of Credit
shall be extendible for successive periods of up to 12 months, but, in each
case, not beyond the tenth Business Day prior to the Final Maturity Date, on
terms acceptable to the respective Issuing Lender) and (B) ten Business Days
prior to the Final Maturity Date, and (y) in the case of trade Letters of
Credit, on or before the earlier of (A) the date which occurs 180 days after the
date of issuance thereof and (B) 30 days prior to the Final Maturity Date.

                2.03    Letter of Credit Requests; Minimum Stated Amount. (a)
Whenever the Borrower desires that a Letter of Credit be issued for its account,
the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing
Lender at least five Business Days' (or such shorter period as is acceptable to
such Issuing Lender) written notice thereof (including by way of facsimile).
Each notice shall be in the form of Exhibit C, appropriately completed (each a
"Letter of Credit Request").

                (b)     The making of each Letter of Credit Request shall be
deemed to be a representation and warranty by the Borrower to the Lenders that
such Letter of Credit may be issued in accordance with, and will not violate the
requirements of, Section 2.02. Unless the respective Issuing Lender has received
notice from the Borrower, any other Credit Party or the Required Lenders before
it issues a Letter of Credit that one or more of the conditions specified in
Section 5 or 6 are not then satisfied, or that the issuance of such Letter of
Credit would violate Section 2.02, then such Issuing Lender shall, subject to
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, issue the requested Letter of Credit
for the account of the Borrower in accordance with such Issuing Lender's usual
and customary practices. Upon the issuance of or modification or amendment to
any standby Letter of Credit, each Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent, in writing of such issuance, modification
or amendment and such notice shall be accompanied by a copy of such Letter of
Credit or the respective modification or amendment thereto, as the case may be.
Promptly after receipt of such notice the Administrative Agent shall notify the
Participants, in writing, of such issuance, modification or amendment, and if so
requested by a Participant the Administrative Agent shall furnish such
Participant with a copy of such issuance, amendment or modification. On the
first Business Day of each week, each Issuing Lender shall furnish the
Administrative Agent with a written (including via facsimile) report of the
daily aggregate outstandings of trade Letters of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender for the immediately preceding week. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement, in the event that a Lender Default exists
with respect to an L/C Lender, no Issuing Lender shall be required to issue any
Letter of Credit unless such Issuing Lender has entered into arrangements
satisfactory to it and the Borrower to eliminate such Issuing Lender's risk with
respect to the participation in Letters of Credit by the Defaulting Lender or
Lenders, including by cash collateralizing such Defaulting Lender's or Lenders'
L/C Percentage of the Letter of Credit Outstandings.

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

                (c)     The initial Stated Amount of each Letter of Credit shall
not be less than $100,000 or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the
respective Issuing Lender.

                2.04    Letter of Credit Participations. (a) Immediately upon
the issuance by an Issuing Lender of any Letter of Credit, such Issuing Lender
shall be deemed to have sold and transferred to each L/C Lender, and each such
L/C Lender (in its capacity under this Section 2.04, a "Participant") shall be
deemed irrevocably and unconditionally to have purchased and received from such
Issuing Lender, without recourse or warranty, an undivided interest and
participation, to the extent of such Participant's L/C Percentage, in such
Letter of Credit, each drawing or payment made thereunder and the obligations of
the Borrower under this Agreement with respect thereto, and any security
therefor or guaranty pertaining thereto. Upon any change in the L/C Commitments
or L/C Percentages of the Lenders pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04(b), it is
hereby agreed that, with respect to all outstanding Letters of Credit and Unpaid
Drawings relating thereto, there shall be an automatic adjustment to the
participations pursuant to this Section 2.04 to reflect the new L/C Percentages
of the assignor and assignee Lender, as the case may be.

                (b)     In determining whether to pay under any Letter of
Credit, no Issuing Lender shall have any obligation relative to the other
Lenders other than to confirm that any documents required to be delivered under
such Letter of Credit appear to have been delivered and that they appear to
substantially comply on their face with the requirements of such Letter of
Credit. Any action taken or omitted to be taken by an Issuing Lender under or in
connection with any Letter of Credit issued by it shall not create for such
Issuing Lender any resulting liability to the Borrower, any other Credit Party,
any Lender or any other Person unless such action is taken or omitted to be
taken with gross negligence or willful misconduct on the part of such Issuing
Lender (as determined by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and
non-appealable decision).

                (c)     In the event that an Issuing Lender makes any payment
under any Letter of Credit issued by it and the Borrower shall not have
reimbursed such amount in full to such Issuing Lender pursuant to Section
2.05(a), such Issuing Lender shall promptly notify the Administrative Agent,
which shall promptly notify each Participant of such failure, and each
Participant shall promptly and unconditionally pay to such Issuing Lender the
amount of such Participant's L/C Percentage of such unreimbursed payment in
Dollars and in same day funds. If the Administrative Agent so notifies, prior to
12:00 Noon (New York time) on any Business Day, any Participant required to fund
a payment under a Letter of Credit, such Participant shall make available to the
respective Issuing Lender in Dollars such Participant's L/C Percentage of the
amount of such payment on such Business Day in same day funds. If and to the
extent such Participant shall not have so made its L/C Percentage of the amount
of such payment available to the respective Issuing Lender, such Participant
agrees to pay to such Issuing Lender, forthwith on demand such amount, together
with interest thereon, for each day from such date until the date such amount is
paid to such Issuing Lender at the overnight Federal Funds Rate for the first
three days and at the interest rate applicable to Term Loans that are maintained
as Base Rate Loans for each day thereafter. The failure of any Participant to
make available to an Issuing Lender its L/C Percentage of any payment under any
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall not relieve any other
Participant of its obligation hereunder to make available to such Issuing Lender
its L/C Percentage of any payment under any Letter of Credit on the date
required, as specified

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

above, but no Participant shall be responsible for the failure of any other
Participant to make available to such Issuing Lender such other Participant's
L/C Percentage of any such payment.

                (d)     Whenever an Issuing Lender receives a payment of a
reimbursement obligation as to which it has received any payments from the
respective Participants pursuant to clause (c) above, such Issuing Lender shall
pay to each such Participant which has paid its L/C Percentage thereof, in
Dollars and in same day funds, an amount equal to such Participant's share
(based upon the proportionate aggregate amount originally funded by such
Participant to the aggregate amount funded by all Participants) of the principal
amount of such reimbursement obligation and interest thereon accruing after the
purchase of the respective participations.

                (e)     Upon the request of any Participant, each Issuing Lender
shall furnish to such Participant copies of any standby Letter of Credit issued
by it and such other documentation as may reasonably be requested by such
Participant.

                (f)     The obligations of the Participants to make payments to
each Issuing Lender with respect to Letters of Credit shall be irrevocable and
not subject to any qualification or exception whatsoever and shall be made in
accordance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement under all
circumstances, including, without limitation, any of the following
circumstances:

                (i)     any lack of validity or enforceability of this Agreement
        or any of the other Credit Documents;

                (ii)    the existence of any claim, setoff, defense or other
        right which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries may have at any time
        against a beneficiary named in a Letter of Credit, any transferee of any
        Letter of Credit (or any Person for whom any such transferee may be
        acting), the Administrative Agent, any Participant, or any other Person,
        whether in connection with this Agreement, any Letter of Credit, the
        transactions contemplated herein or any unrelated transactions
        (including any underlying transaction between the Borrower or any
        Subsidiary of the Borrower and the beneficiary named in any such Letter
        of Credit);

                (iii)   any draft, certificate or any other document presented
        under any Letter of Credit proving to be forged, fraudulent, invalid or
        insufficient in any respect or any statement therein being untrue or
        inaccurate in any respect;

                (iv)    the surrender or impairment of any security for the
        performance or observance of any of the terms of any of the Credit
        Documents; or

                (v)     the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default.

                2.05    Agreement to Repay Letter of Credit Drawings. (a) The
Borrower agrees to reimburse each Issuing Lender, by making payment to the
Administrative Agent in immediately available funds at the Payment Office, for
any payment or disbursement made by such Issuing Lender under any Letter of
Credit issued by it (each such amount, so paid until reimbursed, an "Unpaid
Drawing"), not later than one Business Day following receipt by the Borrower of
notice of such payment or disbursement (provided that no such notice shall be

                                      -13-
<PAGE>

required to be given if a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05
shall have occurred and be continuing, in which case the Unpaid Drawing shall be
due and payable immediately without presentment, demand, protest or notice of
any kind (all of which are hereby waived by the Borrower)), with interest on the
amount so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender, to the extent not reimbursed
prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time) on the date of such payment or disbursement,
from and including the date paid or disbursed to but excluding the date such
Issuing Lender was reimbursed by the Borrower therefor at a rate per annum equal
to the Base Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin as in
effect from time to time for Term Loans that are maintained as Base Rate Loans;
provided, however, to the extent such amounts are not reimbursed prior to 12:00
Noon (New York time) on the third Business Day following the receipt by the
Borrower of notice of such payment or disbursement or following the occurrence
of a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05, interest shall
thereafter accrue on the amounts so paid or disbursed by such Issuing Lender
(and until reimbursed by the Borrower) at a rate per annum equal to the Base
Rate in effect from time to time plus the Applicable Margin for Term Loans that
are maintained as Base Rate Loans as in effect from time to time plus 2%, with
such interest to be payable on demand. Each Issuing Lender shall give the
Borrower prompt written notice of each Drawing under any Letter of Credit issued
by it, provided that the failure to give any such notice shall in no way affect,
impair or diminish the Borrower's obligations hereunder.

                (b)     The obligations of the Borrower under this Section 2.05
to reimburse each Issuing Lender with respect to drafts, demands and other
presentations for payment under Letters of Credit issued by it (each a
"Drawing") (including, in each case, interest thereon) shall be absolute and
unconditional under any and all circumstances and irrespective of any setoff,
counterclaim or defense to payment which the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower may have or have had against any Lender (including in its capacity as
an Issuing Lender or as a Participant), including, without limitation, any
defense based upon the failure of any drawing under a Letter of Credit to
conform to the terms of the Letter of Credit or any nonapplication or
misapplication by the beneficiary of the proceeds of such Drawing; provided,
however, that the Borrower shall not be obligated to reimburse any Issuing
Lender for any wrongful payment made by such Issuing Lender under a Letter of
Credit issued by it as a result of acts or omissions constituting willful
misconduct or gross negligence on the part of such Issuing Lender (as determined
by a court of competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

                2.06    Increased Costs. If at any time after the Effective
Date, the introduction of or any change in any applicable law, rule, regulation,
order, guideline or request or in the interpretation or administration thereof
by the NAIC or any governmental authority charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Issuing Lender or any Participant
with any request or directive by the NAIC or by any such governmental authority
(whether or not having the force of law), shall either (i) impose, modify or
make applicable any reserve, deposit, capital adequacy or similar requirement
against letters of credit issued by any Issuing Lender or participated in by any
Participant, or (ii) impose on any Issuing Lender or any Participant any other
conditions relating, directly or indirectly, to this Agreement or any Letter of
Credit; and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to any
Issuing Lender or any Participant of issuing, maintaining or participating in
any Letter of Credit, or reduce the amount of any sum received or receivable by
any Issuing Lender or any Participant hereunder or reduce the rate of return on
its capital with respect to Letters of Credit (except for changes in the rate of
tax on, or

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

determined by reference to, the net income or profits or capital or franchise
taxes imposed in lieu thereof of such Issuing Lender or such Participant or, in
the case of an Issuing Lender or Participant that is a flow-through entity for
tax purposes, a member or a partner of such Issuing Lender or Participant,
pursuant to the laws of the country or national jurisdiction (or any political
subdivision thereof) in which it is organized or in which its principal office
or applicable lending office is located), then, upon the delivery of the
certificate referred to below to the Borrower by any Issuing Lender or any
Participant (a copy of which certificate shall be sent by such Issuing Lender or
such Participant to the Administrative Agent), the Borrower agrees, subject to
the provisions of Section 13.17, to pay to such Issuing Lender or such
Participant such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such Issuing
Lender or such Participant for such increased cost or reduction in the amount
receivable or reduction on the rate of return on its capital, it being agreed
that this Section 2.06 shall not apply to Taxes which are the subject of Section
4.04(a). Any Issuing Lender or any Participant, upon determining that any
additional amounts will be payable pursuant to this Section 2.06, will give
prompt written notice thereof to the Borrower, which notice shall include a
certificate submitted to the Borrower by such Issuing Lender or such Participant
(a copy of which certificate shall be sent by the Issuing Lender or such
Participant to the Administrative Agent), setting forth in reasonable detail the
basis for and the calculation of such additional amount or amounts necessary to
compensate such Issuing Lender or such Participant. The certificate required to
be delivered pursuant to this Section 2.06 shall, absent manifest error, be
final and conclusive and binding on the Borrower.

                SECTION 3. L/C Commitment Commission; Fees; Reductions of
Commitment.

                3.01    Fees. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for distribution to each L/C Lender which is a
Non-Defaulting Lender a commitment commission (the "L/C Commitment Commission")
for the period from and including the Effective Date to and including the Final
Maturity Date (or such earlier date on which the Total L/C Commitment has been
terminated) computed at a rate per annum equal to 1/2 of 1% of the Unutilized
L/C Commitment of such L/C Lender as in effect from time to time. Accrued L/C
Commitment Commission shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each
Quarterly Payment Date and on the date upon which the Total L/C Commitment is
terminated.

                (b)     The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
for distribution to each L/C Lender (based on each such Lender's respective L/C
Percentage) a fee in respect of each Letter of Credit (the "Letter of Credit
Fee") for the period from and including the date of issuance of such Letter of
Credit to and including the date of termination or expiration of such Letter of
Credit, computed at a rate per annum equal to the Applicable Margin in respect
of the daily Stated Amount of each such Letter of Credit. Accrued Letter of
Credit Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in arrears on each Quarterly
Payment Date and on the first day on or after the termination of the Total L/C
Commitment upon which no Letter of Credit remains outstanding.

                (c)     The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent
for distribution to each Lender (based on each such Lender's respective Term
Loan Percentage calculated immediately before giving effect to the respective
repayment or prepayment) a Prepayment Premium in connection with (x) voluntary
prepayments made prior to the third anniversary of the Initial Borrowing Date
pursuant to Section 4.01 with proceeds received by the Borrower and its

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

Subsidiaries from the incurrence of Indebtedness or in anticipation of the
incurrence of any Indebtedness and (y) mandatory repayments made prior to the
third anniversary of the Initial Borrowing Date pursuant to Sections 4.02(d) and
4.02(e) (other than mandatory repayments of less than $5,000,000 required to be
made pursuant to Section 4.02(e) with Net Sale Proceeds from Asset Sales so long
as the aggregate amount of all such mandatory repayments does not exceed
$5,000,000 per fiscal year).

                (d)     The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for
its own account, a facing fee in respect of each Letter of Credit issued by it
(the "Facing Fee") for the period from and including the date of issuance of
such Letter of Credit to and including the date of termination or expiration of
such Letter of Credit, computed at a rate per annum equal to 1/4 of 1% on the
daily Stated Amount of such Letter of Credit, provided that in any event the
minimum amount of Facing Fees payable in any twelve-month period for each Letter
of Credit shall be not less than $500; it being agreed that, on the day of
issuance of any Letter of Credit and on each anniversary thereof prior to the
termination or expiration of such Letter of Credit, if $500 will exceed the
amount of Facing Fees that will accrue with respect to such Letter of Credit for
the immediately succeeding twelve-month period, the full $500 shall be payable
on the date of issuance of such Letter of Credit and on each such anniversary
thereof. Except as otherwise provided in the proviso to the immediately
preceding sentence, accrued Facing Fees shall be due and payable quarterly in
arrears on each Quarterly Payment Date and upon the first day on or after the
termination of the Total L/C Commitment upon which no Letter of Credit remains
outstanding.

                (e)     The Borrower agrees to pay to each Issuing Lender, for
its own account, upon each payment under, issuance of, or amendment to, any
Letter of Credit issued by it, such amount as shall at the time of such event be
the administrative charge and the reasonable expenses which such Issuing Lender
is generally imposing in connection with such occurrence with respect to letters
of credit.

                (f)     The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative
Agent such fees as may be agreed to in writing from time to time by the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries and the Administrative Agent.

                3.02    Voluntary Termination of Unutilized L/C Commitments. (a)
Upon at least three Business Days' prior notice from an Authorized
Representative of the Borrower to the Administrative Agent at its Notice Office
(which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the
Lenders), the Borrower shall have the right, at any time or from time to time,
without premium or penalty, to terminate the Total Unutilized L/C Commitment at
such time, in whole or in part, in integral multiples of $1,000,000 in the case
of partial reductions of the Total L/C Commitment. Each reduction to the Total
Unutilized L/C Commitment pursuant to this Section 3.02 shall apply to
proportionately and permanently reduce the L/C Commitment of each Lender (based
on their respective L/C Percentages).

                (b)     In the event of a refusal by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to
this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, subject to its
compliance with the requirements of Section 13.12(b), upon five

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

Business Days' prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice
Office (which notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of
the Lenders) terminate all of the L/C Commitment and/or the Term Loan Commitment
of such Lender, so long as all Term Loans, together with accrued and unpaid
interest, Fees and all other amounts, owing to such Lender (other than any such
amounts owing in respect of any Tranche maintained by such Lender which are not
being repaid pursuant to Section 13.12(b)) are repaid concurrently with the
effectiveness of such termination pursuant to Section 4.01(b) (at which time
Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect such changed amounts) and such
Lender's L/C Percentage of all outstanding Letters of Credit is cash
collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
respective Issuing Lenders (unless the respective Lender is not being repaid
with respect to its L/C Commitment pursuant to Section 13.12(b)), and at such
time, unless the respective Lender continues to have outstanding Term Loans or
Commitments of one or more Tranches hereunder, such Lender shall no longer
constitute a "Lender" for purposes of this Agreement, except with respect to
indemnifications under this Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections
1.10, 1.11, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01), which shall survive as to such repaid
Lender.

                3.03    Mandatory Reduction of Commitments. (a) The Total
Commitment (and the Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate in its entirety
on December 31, 2004, unless the Initial Borrowing Date has occurred on or prior
to such date.

                (b)     In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total Term Loan Commitment (and the Term Loan
Commitment of each Lender) shall terminate in its entirety on the Initial
Borrowing Date (after giving effect to the incurrence of Term Loans on such date
pursuant to Section 1.01).

                (c)     In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, the Total L/C Commitment shall terminate in its
entirety upon the earlier of (x) the Final Maturity Date and (y) unless the
Required Lenders otherwise agree in writing, the date on which a Change of
Control occurs.

                (d)     In addition to any other mandatory commitment reductions
pursuant to this Section 3.03, on each date upon which a mandatory repayment of
Term Loans pursuant to Section 4.02(c), (d), (e), (f) or (g) is required (and
exceeds in amount the aggregate principal amount of Term Loans then outstanding)
or would be required if Term Loans were then outstanding, the Total L/C
Commitment shall be permanently reduced by the amount, if any, by which the
amount required to be applied pursuant to said Sections (determined as if an
unlimited amount of Term Loans were actually outstanding) exceeds the aggregate
principal amount of Term Loans then outstanding.

                (e)     Each reduction to, or termination of, the Total L/C
Commitment shall be applied to proportionately reduce or terminate, as the case
may be, the L/C Commitment of each Lender with a L/C Commitment.

                SECTION 4. Prepayments; Payments; Taxes.

                4.01    Voluntary Prepayments. (a) Subject to Section 3.01(c),
the Borrower shall have the right to prepay Term Loans, in whole or in part at
any time and from time to time on the following terms and conditions: (i) the
Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon (New York time)
at the Notice Office (x) at least one Business Day's prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay Base
Rate Loans and (y) at least three Business Days' prior written notice (or
telephonic notice promptly confirmed in writing) of its intent to prepay
Eurodollar Loans, which notice (in each case) shall specify the amount of such
prepayment and the Types of Term Loans to be prepaid and, in the case of
Eurodollar Loans, the specific Borrowing or Borrowings pursuant to which such
Eurodollar Loans were made, and which notice the Administrative Agent shall
promptly transmit to each of the Lenders; (ii) each partial prepayment of Term
Loans pursuant to this Section 4.01(a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount
of at least $1,000,000 (or such lesser amount as is acceptable to the
Administrative Agent), provided that if any partial prepayment of Eurodollar
Loans made pursuant to any Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding principal
amount of Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less
than the Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, then such Borrowing may
not be continued as a Borrowing of Eurodollar Loans (and same shall
automatically be converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans) and any election
of an Interest Period with respect thereto given by the Borrower shall have no
force or effect; and (iii) each voluntary prepayment of Term Loans pursuant to
this Section 4.01(a) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining Scheduled
Repayments of the Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining
unpaid principal amounts of such Scheduled Repayments after giving effect to all
prior reductions thereto).

                (b)     In the event of a refusal by a Lender to consent to
certain proposed changes, waivers, discharges or terminations with respect to
this Agreement which have been approved by the Required Lenders as (and to the
extent) provided in Section 13.12(b), the Borrower may, upon five Business Days'
prior written notice to the Administrative Agent at the Notice Office (which
notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly transmit to each of the Lenders)
repay all Term Loans, together with accrued and unpaid interest, Fees, and other
amounts owing to such Lender (or owing to such Lender in respect of the Tranche
being repaid in the event such Lender is being repaid with respect to a single
Tranche only) in accordance with, and subject to the requirements of, said
Section 13.12(b) so long as (I) all Commitments of such Lender (other than
Commitments relating to any Tranche with respect to which such Lender is not
being replaced or terminated) are terminated concurrently with such repayment
pursuant to Section 3.02(b) (at which time Schedule I shall be deemed modified
to reflect the changed Commitments), (II) unless such Lender is an L/C Lender
that is not being repaid or replaced with respect to its L/C Commitment, such
Lender's L/C Percentage of all outstanding Letters of Credit is cash
collateralized in a manner satisfactory to the Administrative Agent and the
respective Issuing Lenders and (III) the consents, if any, required under
Section 13.12(b) in connection with the repayment pursuant to this clause (b)
have been obtained. Each prepayment of any Term Loans pursuant to this Section
4.01(b) shall be applied to reduce the then remaining Scheduled Repayments of
the Term Loans on a pro rata basis (based upon the then remaining unpaid
principal amounts of such Scheduled Repayments after giving effect to all prior
reductions thereto).

                4.02    Mandatory Repayments. (a) If the aggregate amount of the
Letter of Credit Outstandings exceeds the Total L/C Commitment on any day, the
Borrower shall pay to

                                      -18-
<PAGE>

the Administrative Agent at the Payment Office on such day an amount of cash
and/or Cash Equivalents equal to the amount of such excess (up to a maximum
amount equal to the Letter of Credit Outstandings at such time), such cash
and/or Cash Equivalents to be held as security for all obligations of the
Borrower to the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders hereunder in a cash collateral
account to be established by the Administrative Agent.

                (b)     In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant
to this Section 4.02, on each date set forth below (each, a "Scheduled Repayment
Date"), the Borrower shall be required to repay that principal amount of Term
Loans, to the extent then outstanding, as is set forth opposite each such date
below (each such repayment, as the same may be reduced as provided in Section
4.01(a), 4.01(b) or 4.02(h), a "Scheduled Repayment"):

                (c)     In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant
to this Section 4.02, on each date on or after the Initial Borrowing Date upon
which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries receives any cash proceeds from
any capital contribution or any sale or issuance of its Equity Interests (other
than cash proceeds from the issuance of Equity Interests to members of
management or employees of the Borrower in an amount not to exceed $5,000,000 in
any fiscal year of the Borrower), an amount equal to 100% of the Net Equity
Proceeds of such capital contribution or sale or issuance of equity shall be
applied on such date as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term
Loans in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(h) and (i); provided,
however, that with respect to no more than $2,500,000 in the aggregate of cash
proceeds from any sale or issuance of Qualified Capital Stock in any fiscal year
of the Borrower, the Net Equity Proceeds therefrom shall not be required to be
so applied on such date so long as no Default and no Event of Default then
exists and such Net Equity Proceeds shall be used to make a Permitted
Acquisition pursuant to Section 8.17 within 90 days following the date of the
issuance of such Qualified Capital Stock, and provided further, that if all or
any portion of such Net Equity Proceeds not required to be so applied as
provided above in this Section 4.02(c) are not so used within such 90-day period
(or such earlier date, if any, as the Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary
determines not to use the Net Equity Proceeds as set forth above), such
remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of such period (or such
earlier date, as the case may be) as provided above in this Section 4.02(c)
without regard to the preceding proviso.

                (d)     Subject to Section 3.01(c), in addition to any other
mandatory repayments pursuant to this Section 4.02, on each date on or after the
Initial Borrowing Date upon which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
receives any cash proceeds from any issuance or incurrence by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries of Indebtedness for borrowed money (other than
Indebtedness for borrowed money permitted to be incurred pursuant to Section
9.04 as in effect on the Effective Date), an amount equal to 100% of the Net
Debt Proceeds of the respective incurrence of Indebtedness shall be applied on
such date as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term Loans in
accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(h) and (i).

                (e)     Subject to Section 3.01(c), in addition to any other
mandatory repayments pursuant to this Section 4.02, on each date on or after the
Initial Borrowing Date upon which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
receives any cash proceeds from any Asset Sale, an amount equal to 100% of the
Net Sale Proceeds therefrom shall be applied on such date as a mandatory
repayment of principal of outstanding Term Loans in accordance with the
requirements of Sections 4.02(h); and (i) provided, however, that with respect
to the Net Sale Proceeds from the sale of the New York Microwave Subscribers
plus no more than $2,500,000 in the aggregate of cash proceeds from other Asset
Sales (other than Asset Sales made pursuant to any of clauses (xi), (xii),
(xiii), (xiv), (xvii (but only to the extent that such Asset Sale does not
relate to assets that constitute New York Microwave Subscribers)), (xviii) and
(xvix) of Section 9.02, the proceeds of which must be applied as provided above
without regard to this proviso) in any fiscal year of the Borrower, the Net Sale
Proceeds therefrom shall not be required to be so applied on such date so long
as no Default and no Event of Default then exists and such Net Sale Proceeds

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

shall be used to purchase assets (other than working capital) used or to be used
in the businesses permitted pursuant to Section 9.16 within 365 days following
the date of such Asset Sale, and provided further, that if all or any portion of
such Net Sale Proceeds not required to be so applied as provided above in this
Section 4.02(e) are not so reinvested within such 365-day period (or such
earlier date, if any, as the Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary determines not
to reinvest the Net Sale Proceeds from such Asset Sale as set forth above), such
remaining portion shall be applied on the last day of such period (or such
earlier date, as the case may be) as provided above in this Section 4.02(e)
without regard to the preceding proviso.

                (f)     In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant
to this Section 4.02, on each Excess Cash Payment Date, an amount equal to the
Applicable ECF Percentage of the Excess Cash Flow for the related Excess Cash
Payment Period shall be applied as a mandatory repayment of principal of
outstanding Term Loans in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(h)
and (i).

                (g)     In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant
to this Section 4.02, within 10 days following each date on or after the Initial
Borrowing Date upon which the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries receives any
cash proceeds from any Recovery Event (other than Recovery Events where the Net
Insurance Proceeds therefrom do not exceed $50,000), an amount equal to 100% of
the Net Insurance Proceeds from such Recovery Event shall be applied within such
ten day period in accordance with the requirements of Sections 4.02(h) and (i);
provided, however, that (i) so long as no Default or Event of Default then
exists and such Net Insurance Proceeds do not exceed $5,000,000, an amount equal
to such Net Insurance Proceeds shall not be required to be so applied within
such ten day period to the extent that the Borrower has delivered a certificate
to the Administrative Agent within such ten day period stating that such Net
Insurance Proceeds shall be used to replace or restore properties or assets in
respect of which such Net Insurance Proceeds were paid within 365 days following
the date of the receipt of such Net Insurance Proceeds (which certificate shall
set forth the estimates of the Net Insurance Proceeds to be so expended), and
(ii) if the amount of such Net Insurance Proceeds exceeds $5,000,000, then an
amount equal to the entire amount of such Net Insurance Proceeds (and not just
the portion thereof in excess of $5,000,000) shall be applied as provided above
in this Section 4.02(g) without regard to preceding clause (i) of this proviso,
and provided further, that if all or any portion of such Net Insurance Proceeds
not required to be so applied pursuant to the preceding proviso are not so used
within 365 days after the date of the receipt of such Net Insurance Proceeds (or
such earlier date, if any, as the Borrower or the relevant Subsidiary determines
not to reinvest the Net Insurance Proceeds relating to such Recovery Event as
set forth above), an amount equal to such remaining portion shall be applied on
the last day of such period (or such earlier date, as the case may be) as
provided above in this Section 4.02(g) without regard to the preceding proviso.

                (h)     Each amount required to be applied pursuant to Sections
4.02(c), (d), (e), (f) and (g) in accordance with this Section 4.02(h) shall be
applied (i) first, as a mandatory repayment of principal of outstanding Term
Loans, and (ii) second, to the extent in excess of the amounts required to be
applied pursuant to preceding clause (i), as a mandatory and permanent reduction
to the Total L/C Commitment. The amount of each principal repayment of
outstanding Term Loans made as required by this Sections 4.02(h) shall be
applied to reduce the then remaining Scheduled Repayments on a pro rata basis
(based upon the then remaining unpaid

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

principal amounts of such Scheduled Repayments after giving effect to all prior
reductions thereto).

                (i)     With respect to each repayment of Term Loans required by
this Section 4.02, the Borrower may designate the Types of Term Loans which are
to be repaid and, in the case of Eurodollar Loans, the specific Borrowing or
Borrowings to which such Eurodollar Loans were made, provided that: (i)
repayments of Eurodollar Loans pursuant to this Section 4.02 may only be made on
the last day of an Interest Period applicable thereto unless all Eurodollar
Loans with Interest Periods ending on such date of required repayment and all
Base Rate Loans have been paid in full; (ii) if any repayment of Eurodollar
Loans made pursuant to a single Borrowing shall reduce the outstanding
Eurodollar Loans made pursuant to such Borrowing to an amount less than the
Minimum Borrowing Amount applicable thereto, such Borrowing shall be
automatically converted into a Borrowing of Base Rate Loans; and (iii) each
repayment of any Term Loans made pursuant to a Borrowing shall be applied pro
rata among such Term Loans. In the absence of a designation by the Borrower as
described in the preceding sentence, the Administrative Agent shall, subject to
the above, make such designation in its sole discretion.

                (j)     In addition to any other mandatory repayments pursuant
to this Section 4.02, (i) all then outstanding Term Loans shall be repaid in
full on the Final Maturity Date and (ii) unless the Required Lenders otherwise
agree in writing, all then outstanding Term Loans shall be repaid in full on the
date on which a Change of Control occurs.

                4.03    Method and Place of Payment. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments under this Agreement and under any
Term Note shall be made to the Administrative Agent for the account of the
Lender or Lenders entitled thereto not later than 12:00 Noon (New York time) on
the date when due and shall be made in Dollars in immediately available funds at
the Payment Office. Whenever any payment to be made hereunder or under any Term
Note shall be stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due
date thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day and, with
respect to payments of principal, interest shall be payable at the applicable
rate during such extension.

                4.04    Net Payments. (a) All payments made by the Borrower
hereunder and under any Term Note will be made without setoff, counterclaim or
other defense. Except as provided in Section 4.04(b), all such payments will be
made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for, any present or
future taxes, levies, imposts, duties, fees, assessments or other charges of
whatever nature now or hereafter imposed by any jurisdiction or by any political
subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein with respect to such payments
(but excluding, except as provided in the second succeeding sentence, any tax
imposed on or measured by the net income, net profits or capital or franchise

flow-through entity for tax purposes, a member or a partner of such Lender or
Administrative Agent.

                (b)     The Administrative Agent and each Lender that is not a
United States person (as such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the
Code) for U.S. Federal income tax purposes agrees to deliver to the Borrower and
the Administrative Agent on or prior to the Effective Date or, in the case of a
Lender that is an assignee or transferee of an interest under this Agreement
pursuant to Section 1.13 or 13.04(b) (unless the respective Lender was already a
Lender hereunder immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date
of such assignment or transfer to such Lender, (i) in the case of each such
Lender, two accurate and complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue
Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect to a complete exemption under
an income tax treaty) (or successor forms) certifying to such Lender's
entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States
withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and
under any Term Note, (ii) in the case of each such Lender, if the Lender is not
a "bank" within the meaning of Section 881(c)(3)(A) of the Code and cannot
deliver either Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or Form W-8BEN (with respect
to a complete exemption under an income tax treaty) (or any successor forms)
pursuant to clause (i) above, (x) a certificate substantially in the form of
Exhibit D (any such certificate, a "Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate") and (y)

of interest to be made under this Agreement and under any Term Note , or (iii)
in the case of the Administrative Agent and each such Lender, if a Lender or the
Administrative Agent is a foreign intermediary or flow-through entity for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, two accurate and complete signed copies of Internal
Revenue Service Form W-8IMY (and all necessary attachments) establishing a
complete exemption from United States withholding tax with respect to payments
made to the Administrative Agent or the applicable Lender as the case may be
under this Agreement and under any Term Note. In addition, each Lender and the
Administrative Agent agree that from time to time after the Effective Date, when
a lapse in time or change in circumstances or law renders the previous
certification obsolete, invalid or inaccurate in any material respect, it will
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent two new accurate and
complete original signed copies of Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI, Form
W-8BEN (with respect to the benefits of any income tax treaty), or Form W-8BEN
(with respect to the portfolio interest exemption) and a Section 4.04(b)(ii)
Certificate or Form W-8IMY (with respect to foreign intermediary or flow through
entity), as the case may be, and such other forms and necessary attachments as
may be required in order to confirm or establish the entitlement of such Lender
to a continued exemption from or reduction in United States withholding tax with
respect to payments under this Agreement and any Term Note, or such Lender shall
immediately notify the Borrower and the Administrative Agent of its inability to
deliver any such Form or Certificate, in which case such Lender shall not be
required to deliver any such Form or Certificate pursuant to this Section
4.04(b). Each Lender and the Administrative Agent that is a United States person

income taxes (other than a Lender or Administrative Agent that may be treated as
an exempt recipient based on the indicators described in U.S. Treasury
Regulation Section 1.6049-4(c)(1)(ii) except to the extent required by Treasury
Regulation Section 1.1441-(1)(d)(4) (and any successor provision)) agrees to
deliver to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent on or prior to the
Effective Date or, in the case of such a Lender that is an assignee or
transferee of an interest under this Agreement pursuant to Section 1.13 or
13.04(b) (unless the respective Lender was already a Lender hereunder
immediately prior to such assignment or transfer), on the date of such
assignment or transfer to such Lender and at the other times described above
with respect to Lenders that are not United States persons, two accurate and
complete original signed copies of U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-9 (or
successor forms) certifying to such Lender's and/or Administrative Agent's
entitlement as of such date to a complete exemption from United States backup
withholding tax with respect to payments to be made under this Agreement and
under any other Credit Document. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
contained in Section 4.04(a), but subject to Section 13.04(b) and the
immediately succeeding sentence, (x) the Borrower shall be entitled, to the
extent it is required to do so by law, to deduct or withhold income or similar
taxes imposed by the United States (or any political subdivision or taxing
authority thereof or therein) from interest, Fees or other amounts payable
hereunder to the extent that such Lender has not provided to the Borrower U.S.
Internal Revenue Service Forms that establish a complete exemption from such
deduction or withholding and (y) the Borrower shall not be obligated pursuant to
Section 4.04(a) to gross-up payments to be made to a Lender in respect of
withholdings, income or similar taxes imposed by the United States if (I) such
Lender has not provided to the Borrower the Internal Revenue Service Forms
required to be provided to the Borrower pursuant to this Section 4.04(b) or (II)
in the case of a payment, other than interest, to a Lender described in clause
(ii) above, to the extent that such forms provided by such Lender do not
establish a complete exemption from withholding of such taxes. Notwithstanding

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

anything to the contrary contained in the preceding sentence or elsewhere in
this Section 4.04 and except as set forth in Section 13.04(b), the Borrower
agrees to pay any additional amounts and to indemnify each Lender in the manner
set forth in Section 4.04(a) (without regard to the identity of the jurisdiction
requiring the deduction or withholding) in respect of any amounts deducted or
withheld by it as described in the immediately preceding sentence as a result of
any changes that are effective after the Effective Date in any applicable law,
treaty, governmental rule, regulation, guideline or order, or in the
interpretation thereof, relating to the deducting or withholding of such Taxes.

                (c)     If the Administrative Agent has not provided to the
Borrower the U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms required to be provided to the
Borrower pursuant to Section 4.04(b) hereof, the Administrative Agent shall
deliver such U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms within 30 days following
written notice from the Borrower to the Administrative Agent requesting the
same; provided, however, that if the Administrative Agent does not deliver such
U.S. Internal Revenue Service Forms within such 30-day period, the
Administrative Agent shall, upon the subsequent written request of the Borrower,
designate an affiliate or another Lender that is a "United States person" (as
such term is defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code) to serve as the
Administrative Agent, subject to such designation not having an adverse effect
on the Administrative Agent and subject to the internal policy considerations of
the Administrative Agent, each to be determined in the sole discretion of the
Administrative Agent; provided further, however, that if the Administrative
Agent is unwilling or unable (within its sole discretion) to make such
appointment, the Borrower shall have the right to cause the Administrative Agent
to resign in accordance with Section 12.09 hereof.

                (d)     If the Borrower pays any additional amount under this
Section 4.04 to a Lender and such Lender determines in its sole discretion that
it has actually received or realized in connection therewith any refund or any
reduction of, or credit against, its Tax liabilities in or with respect to the
taxable year in which the additional amount is paid (a "Tax Benefit"), such
Lender shall pay to the Borrower an amount that the Lender shall, in its sole
discretion, determine is equal to the net benefit, after tax, which was obtained
by the Lender in such year as a consequence of such Tax Benefit; provided,
however, that (i) any Lender may determine, in its sole discretion consistent
with the policies of such Lender, whether to seek a Tax Benefit; (ii) any Taxes
that are imposed on a Lender as a result of a disallowance or reduction
(including through the expiration of any tax credit carryover or carryback of
such Lender that otherwise would not have expired) of any Tax Benefit with
respect to which such Lender has made a payment to the Borrower pursuant to this
Section 4.04(d) shall be treated as a Tax for which the Borrower is obligated to
indemnify such Lender pursuant to this Section 4.04 without any exclusions or
defenses; (iii) subject to Section 13.16, nothing in this Section 4.04(d) shall
require the Lender to disclose any confidential information to the Borrower
(including, without limitation, its tax returns); and (iv) no Lender shall be
required to pay any amounts pursuant to this Section 4.04(d) at any time which a
Default or Event of Default exists.

Borrowing Date. The obligation of each Lender with a Term Loan Commitment to

Administrative Agent, the Second-Lien Administrative Agent, the Third-Lien
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, the Second-Lien Collateral Agent and
the Third-Lien Collateral Agent shall have duly authorized, executed and
delivered the Intercreditor Agreement in the form of Exhibit I hereto (as

force and effect.

                (i)     a solvency opinion from the chief financial officer of
        the Borrower in the form of Exhibit J; and

                (ii)    certificates of insurance complying with the
        requirements of Section 8.03 for the business and properties of the
        Borrower and its Subsidiaries, in form and substance reasonably
        satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

Upon the occurrence of the Initial Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent
shall give each Lender and the Borrower notice that the Initial Borrowing Date
has occurred (although the failure to give any such notice shall not affect any
Lender's or the Borrower's obligations under this Agreement).

                SECTION 6. Conditions Precedent to All Credit Events. The
obligation of each Lender to make Term Loans (including Term Loans made on the

accordance with Sections 1.06 and/or 1.09) and the obligation of an Issuing
Lender to issue any Letter of Credit is subject, at the time of each

                                      -32-
<PAGE>

such Credit Event (except as hereinafter indicated), to the satisfaction of the
following conditions:

                6.01    No Default; Representations and Warranties At the time
of each such Credit Event and also after giving effect thereto (i) there shall
exist no Default or Event of Default and (ii) all representations and warranties
contained herein or in any other Credit Document shall be true and correct in
all material respects with the same effect as though such representations and
warranties had been made on the date of the making of such Credit Event (it
being understood and agreed that any representation or warranty which by its
terms is made as of a specified date shall be required to be true and correct in
all material respects only as of such specified date).

                6.02    Notice of Borrowings; Letter of Credit Request. Prior to
the making of each Loan, the Administrative Agent shall have received a Notice
of Borrowing meeting the requirements of Section 1.03(a). Prior to the issuance
of each Letter of Credit, the Administrative Agent and the respective Issuing
Lender shall have received a Letter of Credit Request meeting the requirements
of Section 2.03(a).

                The acceptance of the benefits or proceeds of each Credit Event,
in each case, shall constitute a representation and warranty by the Borrower to
the Administrative Agent and each of the Lenders that all the conditions
specified in Section 5 (with respect to Credit Events occurring on the Initial
Borrowing Date) and in this Section 6 (with respect to Credit Events occurring
on or after the Initial Borrowing Date) and applicable to such Credit Event
exist as of that time. All of the Term Notes, certificates, legal opinions and
other documents and papers referred to in Section 5 and in this Section 6,
unless otherwise specified, shall be delivered to the Administrative Agent at
the Notice Office for the account of each of the Lenders and, except for the

                SECTION 7. Representations, Warranties and Agreements. In order
to induce the Lenders to enter into this Agreement and to make the Term Loans,
and issue (or participate in) the Letters of Credit as provided herein, the
Borrower makes the following representations, warranties and agreements, in each
case after giving effect to the Transaction, all of which shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement and the Term Notes and the making of
the Term Loans and the issuance of the Letters of Credit, with the occurrence of
each Credit Event on or after the Initial Borrowing Date being deemed to
constitute a representation and warranty that the matters specified in this
Section 7 are true and correct in all material respects on and as of the Initial
Borrowing Date and on the date of each such other Credit Event (it being
understood and agreed that any representation or warranty which by its terms is
made as of a specified date shall be required to be true and correct in all
material respects only as of such specified date).

                7.01    Organizational Status. Each of the Borrower and each of
its Subsidiaries (i) is a duly organized and validly existing corporation,
partnership or limited liability company, as the case may be, in good standing
under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii) has the corporate,
partnership or limited liability company power and authority, as the case may
be, to own its property and assets and to transact the business in which it is
engaged and presently

                                      -33-
<PAGE>

proposes to engage and (iii) is duly qualified and is authorized to do business
and is in good standing in each jurisdiction where the ownership, leasing or
operation of its property or the conduct of its business requires such
qualifications except for failures to be so qualified which, either individually
or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.

                7.02    Power and Authority. Each Credit Party has the
corporate, partnership or limited liability company power and authority, as the
case may be, to execute, deliver and perform the terms and provisions of each of
the Documents to which it is party and has taken all necessary corporate,
partnership or limited liability company action, as the case may be, to
authorize the execution, delivery and performance by it of each of such
Documents. Each Credit Party has duly executed and delivered each of the
Documents to which it is party, and each of such Documents constitutes its
legal, valid and binding obligation enforceable in accordance with its terms,
except to the extent that the enforceability thereof may be limited by
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar
laws generally affecting creditors' rights and by equitable principles
(regardless of whether enforcement is sought in equity or at law).

                7.03    No Violation. Neither the execution, delivery or
performance by any Credit Party of the Documents to which it is a party, nor
compliance by it with the terms and provisions thereof, (i) will contravene any
provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation or any order, writ, injunction
or decree of any court or governmental instrumentality or the terms of any FCC
License or other Governmental Authorization, (ii) will conflict with or result
in any breach of any of the terms, covenants, conditions or provisions of, or
constitute a default under, or result in the creation or imposition of (or the
obligation to create or impose) any Lien (except pursuant to the Security
Documents, the Second-Lien Security Documents and the Third-Lien Credit
Documents) upon any of the property or assets of any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries pursuant to the terms of any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust,
credit agreement or Term Loan agreement, or any other material agreement,
contract or instrument, in each case to which any Credit Party or any of its
Subsidiaries is a party or by which it or any its property or assets is bound or
to which it may be subject, or (iii) will violate any provision of the
certificate or articles of incorporation, certificate of formation, limited
liability company agreement or by-laws (or equivalent organizational documents),
as applicable, of any Credit Party or any of its Subsidiaries.

                7.04    Approvals. No order, consent, approval, license,
authorization or validation of, or filing, recording or registration with
(except for (w) those that have otherwise been obtained or made on or prior to
the Initial Borrowing Date and which remain in full force and effect on the
Initial Borrowing Date, (y) filings which are necessary to perfect the security
interests created under the Security Documents, which filings shall have been
made (or will be made within ten days of the Initial Borrowing Date), (y)
filings which are necessary to perfect the security interests created under the
Second-Lien Security Documents, which filings will be made after the filings
described in clause (x) and within ten days following the Initial Borrowing Date
and (z) filings which are necessary to perfect the security interests created
under the Third-Lien Credit Documents, which filings will be made after the
filings described in clauses (x) and (y) and within ten days of the Initial
Borrowing Date), or exemption by, any governmental or public body or authority,
or any subdivision thereof, is required to be obtained or made by, or on

                                      -34-
<PAGE>

behalf of, any Credit Party to authorize, or is required to be obtained or made
by, or on behalf of, any Credit Party in connection with, (i) the execution,
delivery and performance of any Document or (ii) the legality, validity, binding
effect or enforceability of any such Document.

                7.05    Financial Statements; Financial Condition; Undisclosed
Liabilities; Projections. (a) (i) The consolidated balance sheets of the
Borrower and its subsidiaries as at December 31, 2001, December 31, 2002,
December 31, 2003, March 31, 2004, June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, and the
related consolidated statements of income, cash flows and retained earnings of
the Borrower for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2001, 2002 and 2003 and the
six- and nine-month periods ended June 30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, copies
of which have been furnished to the Lenders prior to the Initial Borrowing Date,
present fairly in all material respects the consolidated financial position of
the Borrower at the dates of such balance sheets and the consolidated results of
the operations of the Borrower for the periods covered thereby. All interim
monthly or quarterly financial statements furnished to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders prior to the Initial Borrowing Date, as the case may be, present
fairly in all material respects in accordance with GAAP the consolidated results
of the operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, for the periods covered
thereby (except, in the case of the aforementioned quarterly or monthly
financial statements, for normal year-end audit adjustments and the absence of
footnotes). All of the foregoing historical financial statements have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied (except, in the case of the aforementioned quarterly or
monthly financial statements, for normal year-end audit adjustments and the
absence of footnotes).

                (ii)    The Pro Forma Financials, copies of which have been
furnished to the Lenders prior to the Initial Borrowing Date, present in all
material respects the pro forma consolidated financial position and results of
operations of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries (after giving effect to the
Transaction) as at the dates and for the periods covered thereby.

                (b)     On and as of the Initial Borrowing Date and after giving
effect to the Transaction and to all Indebtedness (including the Term Loans and
Indebtedness incurred pursuant to the Second-Lien Note Indenture and the
Third-Lien Credit Agreement) being incurred or assumed and Liens created by the
Credit Parties in connection therewith (i) the sum of the assets, at a fair
valuation, of the Borrower on a stand-alone basis and of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries taken as a whole will exceed their respective debts, (ii) each of
the Borrower on a stand-alone basis and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries taken
as a whole have not incurred and do not intend to incur, and do not believe that
they will incur, debts beyond their respective ability to pay such debts as such
debts mature, and (iii) the Borrower on a stand-alone basis and the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries taken as a whole will have sufficient capital with which to
conduct their respective businesses. For purposes of this Section 7.05(b),
"debt" means any liability on a claim, and "claim" means (a) right to payment,
whether or not such a right is reduced to judgment, liquidated, unliquidated,
fixed, contingent, matured, unmatured, disputed, undisputed, legal, equitable,
secured, or unsecured or (b) right to an equitable remedy for breach of
performance if such breach gives rise to a payment, whether or not such right to
an equitable remedy is reduced to judgment, fixed, contingent, matured,
unmatured, disputed, undisputed, secured or unsecured. The amount of contingent
liabilities at any time shall be computed as the amount that, in the light of
all the facts and circumstances existing at such time, represents the amount
that can reasonably be expected to become an actual or matured liability.

                                      -35-
<PAGE>

                (c)     Except as fully disclosed in the financial statements
delivered pursuant to Section 7.05(a) there were as of the Initial Borrowing
Date no liabilities or obligations with respect to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries of any nature whatsoever (whether absolute, accrued, contingent or
otherwise and whether or not due) which, either individually or in the
aggregate, could reasonably be expected to be material to the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries. As of the Initial Borrowing Date, the Borrower knows of no
basis for the assertion against it or any of its Subsidiaries of any liability
or obligation of any nature whatsoever that is not fully disclosed in the
financial statements delivered pursuant to Section 7.05(a) or referred to in the
immediately preceding sentence which, either individually or in the aggregate,
could reasonably be expected to be material to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries.

                (d)     The Projections delivered to the Administrative Agent
and the Lenders on or prior to the Initial Borrowing Date, as the case may be,
have been prepared in good faith and are based on reasonable assumptions, and
there are no statements or conclusions in the Projections which are based upon
or include information known to the Borrower to be misleading in any material
respect or which fail to take into account material information known to the
Borrower regarding the matters reported therein. On the Initial Borrowing Date,
the Borrower believes that the Projections are reasonable and attainable, it
being recognized by the Lenders, however, that projections as to future events
are not to be viewed as facts and that the actual results during the period or
periods covered by the Projections may differ from the projected results and
such differences may be material.

                (e)     Since December 31, 2003, there has been no changes,
events and/or occurrences that have had, or could reasonably be expected to
have, either individually or in the aggregate, a Material Adverse Effect.

                7.06    Litigation. There are no actions, suits or proceedings
pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened (i) with respect to the
Transaction or any Document or (ii) that could reasonably be expected, either
individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                7.07    True and Complete Disclosure. All factual information
(taken as a whole) furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower in writing to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender (including, without limitation, all
information contained in the Documents) for purposes of or in connection with
this Agreement, the other Credit Documents or any transaction contemplated
herein or therein is, and all other such factual information (taken as a whole)
hereafter furnished by or on behalf of the Borrower in writing to the
Administrative Agent or any Lender will be, true and accurate in all material
respects on the date as of which such information is dated or certified and not
incomplete by omitting to state any fact necessary to make such information
(taken as a whole) not misleading in any material respect at such time in light
of the circumstances under which such information was provided.

                7.08    Use of Proceeds; Margin Regulations. (a) All proceeds of
the Term Loans will be used by the Borrower to finance, in part, the Transaction
and to pay the fees and expenses relating to the Transaction.

                                      -36-
<PAGE>

                (b)     All proceeds of any Letters of Credit will be used for
the purposes described in Section 2.01(a).

                (c)     No part of any Credit Event (or the proceeds thereof)
will be used to purchase or carry any Margin Stock or to extend credit for the
purpose of purchasing or carrying any Margin Stock. Neither the making of any
Term Loan or the issuance of any Letter of Credit, nor the use of the proceeds
thereof nor the occurrence of any other Credit Event will violate or be
inconsistent with the provisions of Regulation T, U or X of the Board of
Governors of the Federal Reserve System.

                7.09    Tax Returns and Payments. Each of the Borrower and each
of its Subsidiaries has timely filed or caused to be timely filed with the
appropriate taxing authority all federal income tax and other material returns,
statements, forms and reports for taxes (the "Returns") required to be filed by,
or with respect to the income, properties or operations of, the Borrower and/or
any of its Subsidiaries. The Returns accurately reflect in all material respects
all liability for taxes of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the periods
covered thereby. Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has paid all
taxes and assessments payable by it which have become due, other than (i) those
that are immaterial, (ii) those being contested in good faith and adequately
disclosed and fully provided for on the financial statements of the Borrower and
its Subsidiaries in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles,
(iii) those discharged pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization and (iv) those
payable over time pursuant to the Plan of Reorganization (which taxes and
assessments, in the case of this clause (iv) and to the extent due in accordance
with the Plan of Reorganization, have been paid in all material respects in
accordance with the terms of the Plan of Reorganization). Except as set forth on
Schedule XII, there is no action, suit, proceeding, investigation, audit or
claim now pending or, to the best knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by any
authority regarding any taxes relating to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries. Except as provided in Schedule XII, as of the Initial Borrowing
Date, neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has entered into an
agreement or waiver or been requested to enter into an agreement or waiver
extending any statute of limitations relating to the payment or collection of
taxes of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, or is aware of any
circumstances that would cause the taxable years or other taxable periods of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries not to be subject to the normally applicable
statute of limitations. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries has
incurred, nor will any of them incur, any material tax liability in connection
with the Transaction or any other transactions contemplated hereby (it being
understood that the representation contained in this sentence does not cover any
future tax liabilities of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries arising as a
result of the operation of their businesses in the ordinary course of business).

                7.10    Compliance with ERISA. Schedule IV sets forth, as of the
Initial Borrowing Date, the name of each Plan. Each Plan (and each related
trust) is in substantial compliance with its terms and with all applicable laws,
including, without limitation, ERISA and the Code; each Plan (and each related
trust, if any) which is intended to be qualified under Section 401(a) of the
Code has received or timely applied for a determination letter from the Internal
Revenue Service to the effect that it meets the requirements of Sections 401(a)
and 501(a) of the Code within the preceding six years; neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA Affiliates has ever maintained or contributed
to, or had any obligation to maintain or contribute to (or borne any liability
with respect to) any "employee pension benefit plan," within the

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

meaning of Section 3(2) of ERISA, that is a "multiemployer plan," within the
meaning of Section 3(37) of ERISA, or that is subject to the minimum funding
standards of Section 412 of the Code or Section 302 of ERISA or subject to Title
IV of ERISA; neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries or ERISA
Affiliates has any obligation to maintain or contribute to (or borne any
liability with respect to) any Foreign Pension Plan; all contributions required
to be made with respect to a Plan have been timely made; neither the Borrower
nor any Subsidiary of the Borrower nor any ERISA Affiliate has incurred any
material liability (including any indirect, contingent or secondary liability)
to or on account of a Plan pursuant to Section 409, 502(i), 502(l), 515, 4204 or
4212 of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code or expects to incur any such liability
under any of the foregoing sections with respect to any Plan; no condition
exists which presents a material risk to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate of incurring a liability to or on account of a
Plan pursuant to the foregoing provisions of ERISA and the Code; no action,
suit, proceeding, hearing, audit or investigation with respect to the
administration, operation or the investment of assets of any Plan (other than
routine claims for benefits) is pending, expected or, to the knowledge of the
Borrower, threatened; each group health plan (as defined in Section 607(1) of
ERISA or Section 4980B(g)(2) of the Code) which covers or has covered employees
or former employees of the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower, or any
ERISA Affiliate has at all times been operated in compliance with the provisions
of Part 6 of subtitle B of Title I of ERISA and Section 4980B of the Code,
except to the extent that any failure to comply could not reasonably be expected
to result in a material liability to the Borrower or any Subsidiary of the
Borrower; each group health plan (as defined in 45 Code of Federal Regulations
Section 160.103) which covers or has covered employees or former employees of
the Borrower, any Subsidiary of the Borrower, or any ERISA Affiliate has at all
times been operated in compliance with the provisions of the Health Insurance
Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 and the regulations promulgated
thereunder, except to the extent that any failure to comply could not reasonably
be expected to result in a material liability to the Borrower or any Subsidiary
of the Borrower; no lien imposed under the Code or ERISA on the assets of the
Borrower or any Subsidiary of the Borrower or any ERISA Affiliate exists or is
likely to arise on account of any Plan; and the Borrower and its Subsidiaries
may cease contributions to or terminate any employee benefit plan maintained by
any of them without incurring any material liability.

                7.11    The Security Documents. (a) The provisions of the
Security Agreement are effective to create in favor of the Collateral Agent for
the benefit of the Secured Creditors a legal, valid and enforceable security
interest in all right, title and interest of the Credit Parties in the Security
Agreement Collateral described therein, and the Collateral Agent, for the
benefit of the Secured Creditors, has (or will have within ten days of the
Initial Borrowing Date) a fully perfected security interest in all right, title
and interest in all of the Security Agreement Collateral described therein,
subject to no other Liens other than Permitted Liens. Following the recordation
of (x) the Grant of Security Interest in U.S. Patents, if applicable, and (y)
the Grant of Security Interest in U.S. Trademarks, if applicable, in the
respective form attached to the Security Agreement, in each case in the United
States Patent and Trademark Office, together with filings on Form UCC-1 made
pursuant to the Security Agreement, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the
Secured Creditors will have, as may be perfected by such filings and
recordation, a perfected security interest in the United States trademarks and
patents covered by the Security Agreement, and following the recordation of the
Grant of Security Interest in U.S. Copyrights, if applicable, in the form
attached to the Security Agreement with the United States

Copyright Office, together with filings on Form UCC-1 made pursuant to the
Security Agreement, the Collateral Agent for the benefit of the Secured
Creditors will have, as may be perfected by such filings and recordation, a
perfected security interest in the United States copyrights covered by the
Security Agreement.

                (b)     The security interests created under the Pledge
Agreement in favor of the Collateral Agent, as Pledgee, for the benefit of the
Secured Creditors, constitute perfected security interests in the Pledge
Agreement Collateral described in the Pledge Agreement, subject to no security
interests of any other Person. No filings or recordings are required in order to
perfect (or maintain the perfection or priority of) the security interests
created in the Pledge Agreement Collateral under the Pledge Agreement other than
with respect to that portion of the Pledge Agreement Collateral constituting a
"general intangible" under the UCC.

                (c)     Each Mortgage creates, as security for the obligations
purported to be secured thereby, a valid and enforceable perfected security
interest in and mortgage lien on the respective Mortgaged Property in favor of
the Collateral Agent (or such other trustee as may be required or desired under
local law) for the benefit of the Secured Creditors, superior and prior to the
rights of all third Persons (except that the security interest and mortgage lien
created on such Mortgaged Property may be subject to the Permitted Encumbrances
related thereto) and subject to no other Liens (other than Permitted Liens
related thereto).

                7.12    Properties. All Real Property having a fair market
value, as reasonably estimated by the Borrower, in excess of $1,000,000 that is
owned by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as of the Initial Borrowing
Date, and the nature of the interest therein, is correctly set forth in Schedule
III. Each of the Borrower and each of its Subsidiaries has good and indefeasible
title to all material properties owned by it, including all material property
reflected in the most recent historical balance sheets referred to in Section
7.05(a) (except as sold or otherwise disposed of since the date of such balance
sheet in the ordinary course of business or as permitted by the terms of this
Agreement), free and clear of all Liens, other than Permitted Liens.

and after giving effect to the Transaction, the Borrower has no Subsidiaries
other than those Subsidiaries listed on Schedule V. Schedule V correctly sets
forth, as of the Initial Borrowing Date and after giving effect to the
Transaction, (i) the percentage ownership (direct and indirect) of the Borrower
in each class of capital stock or other Equity Interests of each of its
Subsidiaries and also identifies the direct owner thereof and (ii) the
jurisdiction of organization of each such Subsidiary. All outstanding shares of
capital stock or other Equity Interests of each Subsidiary have been duly and
validly issued, are fully paid and non-assessable and have been issued free of
preemptive rights. On the Initial Borrowing Date and after giving effect to the
Transaction, except as set forth on Schedule V, no Subsidiary of the Borrower
has outstanding any securities convertible into or exchangeable for its capital
stock or other Equity Interests or outstanding any right to

                                      -39-

subscribe for or to purchase, or any options or warrants for the purchase of, or
any agreement providing for the issuance (contingent or otherwise) of or any
calls, commitments or claims of any character relating to, its capital stock or
other Equity Interests or any stock appreciation or similar rights.

                7.15    Compliance with Statutes, etc. Each of the Borrower and
each of its Subsidiaries is in compliance with all applicable laws, statutes,
regulations and orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, all
governmental bodies, domestic or foreign, in respect of the conduct of its
business, the holding of the FCC Licenses and the other Governmental
Authorizations and the ownership of its property (including, without limitation,
applicable statutes, regulations, orders and restrictions relating to
environmental standards and controls), except such noncompliances as could not,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                7.16    Investment Company Act. Neither the Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries is an "investment company" or a company "controlled" by an
"investment company," within the meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940,
as amended.

                7.17    Public Utility Holdings Company Act. Neither the
Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is a "holding company," or a "subsidiary
company" of a "holding company," or an "affiliate" of a "holding company" or of
a "subsidiary company" of a "holding company" within the meaning of the Public

Subsidiaries or any Real Property owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries or (ii) to cause any Real Property owned, leased or

Borrower, any property adjoining or adjacent to any Real Property, where such
generation, use, treatment, storage, transportation or Release has violated or
could be reasonably expected to violate any applicable Environmental Law or give
rise to an Environmental Claim.

                (c)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
7.18, the representations and warranties made in this Section 7.18 shall be
untrue only if the effect of any or all conditions, violations, claims,
restrictions, failures and noncompliances of the types described above could,
either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

                7.19    Labor Relations. Neither the Borrower nor any of its

expected, either individually or in the aggregate, to have a Material Adverse

threatened against any of them, before the National Labor Relations Board, and

bargaining agreement is so pending against the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened against any of

any of its Subsidiaries, except (with respect to any matter specified in clause

not reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                7.20    Intellectual Property, etc. Each of the Borrower and
each of its Subsidiaries owns or has the right to use all the patents,
trademarks, permits, domain names, service marks, trade names, copyrights,

to the foregoing, necessary for the conduct of its business (the "Business
Intellectual Property") without any known conflict with the rights of others
arising from the Borrower's or its Subsidiaries' use of the Business
Intellectual Property which, or the failure to obtain which, as the case may be,

representations and warranties set forth in the other Documents were true and
correct in all material respects at the time as of which such representations
and warranties were made (or deemed made) and shall be true and correct in all

warranties were made on and as of such date (it being understood and agreed that
any such representation or warranty which by its terms is made as of a specified
date shall be true and correct in all material respects as of such specified
date).

                7.24    FCC Licenses and Other Governmental Authorizations. (a)
The Borrower and its Subsidiaries hold all FCC licenses, registrations and
authorizations as are necessary to the Borrower's and its Subsidiaries'
businesses (collectively, the "FCC Licenses"). Each of the FCC Licenses that is
material to the business of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries has been
validly issued and is in full force and effect. All FCC Licenses in effect on
the Initial Borrowing Date and their respective expiration dates are listed and
described on Schedule X. The Borrower has no knowledge of any condition imposed
by the FCC as part of any FCC License which is neither set forth on the face
thereof as issued by the FCC nor contained in the policies, rules and
regulations of the FCC applicable generally to business of the type, nature,
class or location of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries. The Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are in compliance in all material respects with the terms and
conditions of the FCC Licenses applicable to it and with applicable policies,
rules and regulations of the FCC and the Communications Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Communications Act") except to the extent that any failure to comply would
not result in a Material Adverse Effect. No proceedings are pending or are, to
the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened which may reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation, rescission, modification, non-renewal or suspension of
any FCC License that is material to the business of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries, the denial of any pending applications, the issuance of any cease
and desist order or the imposition of any fines, forfeitures or other
administrative actions by the FCC with respect to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries that would, if such proceedings were decided adversely to the
Borrower or the Subsidiaries, have a Material Adverse Effect. All material
reports, applications, tariffs and other documents required to be filed by the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, with the FCC have in all
material respects been timely filed and all such reports, applications, tariffs
and documents are true, correct and complete in all material respects. To the
knowledge of the Borrower, there are no unsatisfied or otherwise outstanding
citations, complaint proceedings, notices of liability or notices of forfeiture
issued by the FCC and received by the Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof with
respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries or any of their respective
operations.

                (b)     In addition to the FCC Licenses issued by the FCC, the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries hold all material licenses, certificates,
registrations and authorizations issued by any other governmental entity
(domestic and foreign) necessary to operate their respective businesses for each
line of business of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries requiring such
authorization and in each jurisdiction in which Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries may be deemed to be conducting their respective businesses under
applicable law (collectively, the "Governmental Authorizations"). Each of the
Governmental Authorizations has been validly issued and is in full

                                      -42-
<PAGE>

force and effect. The Governmental Authorizations as of the Initial Borrowing
Date are listed on Schedule XI, with any expiration date for any such
authorization identified on Schedule XI, with authorizations issued by state
public service or utility commissions (or analogous state authorities) listed in
Part A of Schedule XI and other Governmental Authorizations listed in Part B of
Schedule XI. None of the Governmental Authorizations contain any conditions or
limitations outside the normal course that would materially and adversely
restrict the operations of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries. The Borrower
and its Subsidiaries have been and are in compliance in all respects with the
terms and conditions of the Governmental Authorizations applicable to them,
except to the extent that any failure to comply would not result in a Material
Adverse Effect. Other than the proceedings of a general nature, no proceedings
are pending or are, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, and, to the
Borrower's knowledge, no event has occurred, which may reasonably be expected to
result in the revocation, rescission, adverse modification, non-renewal or
suspension of any Governmental Authorization that is material to the business of
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, the denial of any pending applications
therefor, the issuance of any cease and desist order, or the imposition of any
material fines, forfeitures, or other administrative actions by a governmental
entity. All material reports, applications, tariffs and other documents required
to be filed by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, as appropriate, with the
governmental entity issuing a Government Authorization have in all material
respects been timely filed, and all such reports, applications, tariffs and
documents are true, correct and complete in all material respects. To the
knowledge of the Borrower, there are no material unsatisfied or otherwise
outstanding citations issued by any governmental entity and received by the
Borrower or a Subsidiary thereof with respect to the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries. Schedule XI separately lists all pending applications for
certificates or other authorizations from any state public service or utility
commission (or analogous state authority).

                (c)     The transactions contemplated herein, under applicable
law (including the Communications Act) and the applicable policies, rules,
regulations and practices of the FCC and other governmental entities, would not
disqualify the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries as an assignee or transferee
of the FCC Licenses or the Governmental Authorizations or result in the
imposition of any materially adverse condition on or modification of the FCC
Licenses or the Governmental Authorizations.

                7.25    Intercreditor Agreement. Assuming that the Intercreditor
Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by the parties
thereto (other than the Borrower and its Subsidiaries), the Intercreditor
Agreement is enforceable against the parties thereto (and the Creditors as
defined therein) in accordance with its terms.

                7.26    Certain Agreements. (a) Neither the Borrower nor any of
its Subsidiaries is a party to any agreement or instrument or subject to any
corporate, partnership or limited liability company restriction, as the case may
be, that, either individually or in the aggregate, has resulted or could
reasonably be expected to result in a Material Adverse Effect.

                (b)     Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries is in
default in any manner under any provision of any indenture or other agreement or
instrument evidencing Indebtedness, or any other material agreement or
instrument to which it is a party or by which it

                                      -43-
<PAGE>

or any of its properties or assets are or may be bound, if such default, either
individually or in the aggregate, could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

        the basis of an Environmental Claim against the Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries or any such Real Property;

                (iii)   any condition or occurrence on any Real Property owned,
        leased or operated by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries that could
        reasonably be expected to cause such Real Property to be subject to any
        restrictions on the ownership, lease, occupancy, use or transferability

        other administrative agency; provided that in any event the Borrower
        shall deliver to each Lender all notices received by the Borrower or any
        of its Subsidiaries from any government or governmental agency under, or
        pursuant to, CERCLA which identify the Borrower or any of its
        Subsidiaries as potentially responsible parties for remediation costs or
        which otherwise notify the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries of
        potential liability under CERCLA.

All such notices shall describe in reasonable detail the nature of the claim,
investigation, condition, occurrence or removal or remedial action and the
Borrower's or such Subsidiary's response thereto.

                (j)     Other Information. From time to time, such other
information or documents (financial or otherwise) with respect to the Borrower
or any of its Subsidiaries as the Administrative Agent or any Lender (through
the Administrative Agent) may reasonably request.

                8.02    Books, Records and Inspections; Annual Meetings. (a) The
Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, keep proper books of
record and accounts in which full, true and correct entries in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles and all requirements of law shall be
made of all dealings and transactions in relation to its business and
activities. The Borrower will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to,
permit officers and designated representatives of the Administrative Agent or
any Lender to visit and inspect, under guidance of officers of the Borrower or
such Subsidiary, any of the properties of the Borrower or such Subsidiary, and
to examine the books of account of the Borrower or such Subsidiary and discuss
the affairs, finances and accounts of the Borrower or such Subsidiary with, and
be advised as to the same by, its and their officers and independent
accountants, all upon reasonable prior notice and at such reasonable times and
intervals and to such reasonable extent as the Administrative Agent or any such
Lender may reasonably request; provided, that unless an Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, such visit and inspection by any Lender shall
occur no more than one time per year.

                (b)     At a date to be mutually agreed upon between the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower occurring on or prior to the 120th day
after the close of each fiscal year of the Borrower, the Borrower will, at the
request of the Administrative Agent, hold a meeting with all

                                      -47-
<PAGE>

of the Lenders at which meeting will be reviewed the financial results of the
Borrower and its Subsidiaries for the previous fiscal year and the budgets
presented for the current fiscal year of the Borrower.

                8.03    Maintenance of Property; Insurance. (a) The Borrower
will, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, (i) keep all property
necessary to the business of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in good working
order and condition, ordinary wear and tear excepted, (ii) maintain with
financially sound and reputable insurance companies insurance on all such
property and against all such risks as is consistent and in accordance with
industry practice for companies similarly situated owning similar properties and
engaged in similar businesses as the Borrower and its Subsidiaries, and (iii)
furnish to the Administrative Agent, upon its request therefor, full information
as to the insurance carried. In addition to the requirements of the immediately
preceding sentence, the Borrower will at all times cause insurance of the types
described in Schedule VII to be maintained (with the same scope of coverage as
that described in Schedule VII) at levels which are consistent with their
practices immediately before the Initial Borrowing Date. Such insurance shall
include physical damage insurance on all real and personal property (whether now
owned or hereafter acquired) on an all risk basis and business interruption
insurance. The provisions of this Section 8.03 shall be deemed supplemental to,
but not duplicative of, the provisions of any Security Documents that require
the maintenance of insurance.

                (b)     The Borrower will, and will cause each of its
Subsidiaries to, at all times keep its property insured in favor of the
Collateral Agent, and all policies or certificates (or certified copies thereof)
with respect to such insurance (and any other insurance maintained by the
Borrower and/or such Subsidiaries to the extent reasonably requested by the
Collateral Agent) (i) shall be endorsed to the Collateral Agent's satisfaction
for the benefit of the Collateral Agent (including, without limitation, by
naming the Collateral Agent as loss payee and/or additional insured), (ii) shall
state that such insurance policies shall not be canceled without at least 30
days' prior written notice thereof by the respective insurer to the Collateral
Agent, (iii) shall provide that the respective insurers irrevocably waive any
and all rights of subrogation with respect to the Collateral Agent and the other
Secured Creditors, and (iv) shall be deposited with the Collateral Agent.

                (c)     If the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries shall fail to
maintain insurance in accordance with this Section 8.03, or if the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries shall fail to so endorse and deposit all policies or
certificates with respect thereto, the Administrative Agent shall have the right
(but shall be under no obligation) to procure such insurance and the Borrower
agrees to reimburse the Administrative Agent for all reasonable costs and
expenses of procuring such insurance.

                8.04    Existence; Franchises. The Borrower will, and will cause
each of its Subsidiaries to, do or cause to be done, all things necessary to
preserve and keep in full force and effect its existence and its material
rights, franchises, licenses, permits, copyrights, trademarks and patents;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 8.04 shall prevent (i) sales of
assets and other transactions by the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries in
accordance with Section 9.02 or (ii) the withdrawal by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries of its qualification as a foreign corporation, partnership or
limited liability company, as the case may be, in any jurisdiction if

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

such withdrawal could not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                8.05    Compliance with Statutes, etc. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, comply with all applicable statutes,
regulations and orders of, and all applicable restrictions imposed by, all
governmental bodies, domestic or foreign, in respect of the conduct of its
business and the ownership of its property (including applicable statutes,
regulations, orders and restrictions relating to environmental standards and
controls), except such noncompliances as could not, either individually or in
the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

                8.06    Compliance with Environmental Laws. (a) The Borrower
will comply, and will cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply, with all
Environmental Laws and permits applicable to, or required by, the ownership,
lease or use of its Real Property now or hereafter owned, leased or operated by
the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries, except such noncompliances as could
not, either individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect, and will promptly pay or cause to be paid all costs and
expenses incurred in connection with such compliance, and will keep or cause to
be kept all such Real Property free and clear of any Liens imposed pursuant to
such Environmental Laws. Neither the Borrower nor any of its Subsidiaries will
generate, use, treat, store, Release or dispose of, or permit the generation,
use, treatment, storage, Release or disposal of Hazardous Materials on any Real
Property now or hereafter owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, or transport or permit the transportation of Hazardous
Materials to or from any such Real Property, except for Hazardous Materials
generated, used, treated, stored, Released or disposed of at any such Real
Properties in compliance in all material respects with all applicable
Environmental Laws and as required in connection with the normal operation, use
and maintenance of the business or operations of the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries.

                (b)     (i) After the receipt by the Administrative Agent or any
Lender of any notice of the type described in Section 8.01(i), (ii) at any time
that the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries are not in compliance with Section
8.06(a) or (iii) in the event that the Administrative Agent or the Lenders have
exercised any of the remedies pursuant to the last paragraph of Section 10, the
Borrower will (in each case) provide, at the sole expense of the Borrower and at
the request of the Administrative Agent, an environmental site assessment report
concerning any Real Property owned, leased or operated by the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries, prepared by an environmental consulting firm reasonably
approved by the Administrative Agent, indicating the presence or absence of
Hazardous Materials and the potential cost of any removal or remedial action in
connection with such Hazardous Materials on such Real Property. If the Borrower
fails to provide the same within 30 days after such request was made, the
Administrative Agent may order the same, the cost of which shall be borne by the
Borrower, and the Borrower shall grant, and hereby grants, to the Administrative
Agent and the Lenders and their respective agents access to such Real Property
and specifically grants the Administrative Agent and the Lenders an irrevocable
non-exclusive license, subject to the rights of tenants, to undertake such an
assessment at any reasonable time upon reasonable notice to the Borrower, all at
the sole expense of the Borrower.

Property except as set forth below) of the Borrower and such other Credit
Parties that are Subsidiaries of the Borrower as are not covered by the original
Security Documents and as may be reasonably requested from time to time by the

invoices, schedules, confirmatory assignments, conveyances, financing
statements, transfer endorsements, powers of attorney, certificates, real
property surveys, reports, landlord waivers, bailee agreements, control
agreements and other assurances or instruments and take such further steps
relating to the Collateral covered by any of the Security Documents as the
Collateral Agent may reasonably require. Furthermore, the Borrower will, and
will cause the other Credit Parties that are Subsidiaries of the Borrower to,
deliver to the Collateral Agent such opinions of counsel, title insurance and
other related documents as may be reasonably requested by the Administrative
Agent to assure itself that this Section 8.12 has been complied with.

                (c)     If the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders
reasonably determine that they are required by law or regulation to have
appraisals prepared in respect of any Real Property of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries constituting Collateral, the Borrower and the Borrower will, at
their own expense, provide to the Administrative Agent appraisals which satisfy
the applicable requirements of the Real Estate Appraisal Reform Amendments of

satisfactory to the Administrative Agent.

<PAGE>

                (d)     The Borrower and the Borrower agree that each action
required by clauses (a) through (c) of this Section 8.12 shall be completed as
soon as possible, but in no event later than 60 days after such action is
requested to be taken by the Administrative Agent or the Required Lenders;
provided that, in no event will the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries be
required to take any action, other than using its commercially reasonable
efforts, to obtain consents from third parties with respect to its compliance
with this Section 8.12.

                8.13    Ownership of Subsidiaries; etc. The Borrower will, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to, own 100% of the capital stock and other
Equity Interests of each of their Subsidiaries (other than directors' qualifying
shares to the extent required by applicable law); provided that the foregoing
shall not prohibit (x) Starpower from being a Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary prior
to the consummation of the Starpower Acquisition as required by following
Section 8.15 or (y) the Borrower and/or its Wholly-Owned Subsidiaries owning
Equity Interests in any Non-Wholly-Owned Subsidiary acquired after the Initial
Borrowing Date so long as all Investments therein made by the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries are justified pursuant to clause (xi) of Section 9.05.

                8.14    Corporate Separateness. The Borrower will, and will
cause each of its Subsidiaries to, satisfy customary corporate formalities,
including, as applicable, the holding of regular board of directors' and
shareholders' meetings or action by directors or shareholders without a meeting
and the maintenance of corporate offices and records. Neither the Borrower nor
any of its Subsidiaries shall take any action, or conduct its affairs in a
manner, which is likely to result in the corporate existence of the Borrower or
any of its Subsidiaries being ignored, or in the assets and liabilities of the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries being substantively consolidated with those
of any other such Person in a bankruptcy, reorganization or other insolvency
proceeding.

Starpower Acquisition within 2 Business Days of the Initial Borrowing Date.
Concurrently with consummation of the Starpower Acquisition, Starpower shall
become a Subsidiary Guarantor and shall execute and deliver such Security

Borrowing Date had it been a Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiary which was at such
time a Credit Party, all to the reasonable satisfaction of the Administrative
Agent.

                8.16    Third-Lien Credit Agreement. The Borrower shall pay
interest under the Third-Lien Credit Agreement in-kind (or through the
capitalization of interest in accordance with the terms of the Third-Lien Credit
Agreement) and not in cash to the maximum extent permitted under the Third-Lien
Credit Agreement. The Borrower shall cause the outstanding Indebtedness under
the Third-Lien Credit Agreement to not exceed at any time an amount equal to
$38,500,000 plus any increase in the principal amount thereof resulting from the
payment-in-kind, or capitalization, of interest thereon as contemplated above.

                8.17    Permitted Acquisitions. (a) Subject to the provisions of
this Section 8.17 and the requirements contained in the definition of Permitted
Acquisition, the Borrower and each Wholly-Owned Domestic Subsidiary of the

2005 effect Permitted Acquisitions, so long as (in each case except

<PAGE>

to the extent the Required Lenders otherwise specifically agree in writing in
the case of a specific Permitted Acquisition): (i) no Default or Event of

the proposed Permitted Acquisition or immediately after giving effect thereto;
(ii) the Borrower shall have given to the Administrative Agent and the Lenders
at least 10 Business Days' prior written notice of any Permitted Acquisition (or
such shorter period of time as may be reasonably acceptable to the
Administrative Agent), which notice shall describe in reasonable detail the
principal terms and conditions of such Permitted Acquisition; (iii) calculations
are made by the Borrower with respect to the financial covenants contained in
Sections 9.08 through 9.11, inclusive, for the respective Calculation Period on
a Pro Forma Basis as if the respective Permitted Acquisition (as well as all
other Permitted Acquisitions and Material Asset Sales theretofore consummated
after the first day of such Calculation Period) had occurred on the first day of
such Calculation Period, and such calculations shall show that such financial
covenants would have been complied with if the Permitted Acquisition had
occurred on the first day of such Calculation Period; (iv) based on good faith
projections prepared by the Borrower for the period from the date of the
consummation of the respective Permitted Acquisition to the date which is one
year thereafter, the level of financial performance measured by the financial
covenants set forth in Sections 9.08 through 9.11, inclusive, shall be better
than or equal to such level as would be required to provide that no Default or
Event of Default would exist under the financial covenants contained in such
Sections 9.08 through 9.11, inclusive, as compliance with such financial
covenants would be required through the date which is one year from the date of
the consummation of the respective Permitted Acquisition; (v) all
representations and warranties contained herein and in the other Credit
Documents shall be true and correct in all material respects with the same
effect as though such representations and warranties had been made on and as of
the date of such Permitted Acquisition (both before and after giving effect
thereto), unless stated to relate to a specific earlier date, in which case such
representations and warranties shall be true and correct in all material
respects as of such earlier date; (vi) the aggregate consideration (including,
without limitation, (I) the aggregate principal amount of any Indebtedness
assumed, refinanced, incurred or issued in connection therewith and (II) the
aggregate amount paid and reasonably expected to be paid (based on good faith
projections prepared by the Borrower) pursuant to any non-compete, consulting or
purchase price adjustments) payable for the proposed Permitted Acquisition, when
added to the aggregate consideration paid or payable for all other Permitted
Acquisitions effected after January 1, 2005, does not exceed the Permitted
Acquisition Amount (as determined at the time the respective Permitted
Acquisition is consummated and after giving effect thereto on a Pro Forma
Basis); (vii) the aggregate amount of deferred compensation or other deferred
purchase price (including any earn-outs) paid in any fiscal year of the Borrower
in respect of all Permitted Acquisitions (whether or not such Permitted
Acquisitions were consummated during such fiscal year) shall not exceed
$1,000,000 (it being understood and agreed, however, that any such deferred
compensation or other deferred purchase price (including any earn-outs) shall be
structured as a multiple of the excess of the cash flow of the Acquired Entity
or Business that is the subject of the respective Permitted Acquisition for the
most recently ended 12-month period above the cash flow for such Acquired Entity
or Business for such 12-month period selected to determine the purchase price
for such Permitted Acquisition); and (viii) the Borrower shall have delivered to
the Administrative Agent and each Lender a certificate executed by its chief
financial officer, certifying to the best of such officer's knowledge,
compliance with the requirements of preceding clauses (i) through (vii),
inclusive,

                                      -54-
<PAGE>

and containing the calculations (in reasonable detail) required by preceding
clauses (iii), (iv), (vi) and (vii).

                (b)     At the time of each Permitted Acquisition involving the
creation or acquisition of a Subsidiary, or the acquisition of capital stock or
other Equity Interest of any Person, the capital stock or other Equity Interests

extent required by) the Pledge Agreement.

                (c)     The Borrower will cause each Subsidiary which is formed
to effect, or is acquired pursuant to, a Permitted Acquisition to comply with,
and to execute and deliver all of the documentation as and to the extent
required by, Sections 8.12 and 9.19, to the reasonable satisfaction of the
Administrative Agent.

                (d)     The consummation of each Permitted Acquisition shall be
deemed to be a representation and warranty by each of the Borrower and the
Borrower that the certifications pursuant to this Section 8.15 are true and
correct and that all conditions thereto have been satisfied and that same is
permitted in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, which representation
and warranty shall be deemed to be a representation and warranty for all
purposes hereunder, including, without limitation, Sections 7 and 10.

                8.18    Ratings. The Borrower shall at all times maintain a
senior secured financing rating (of any level) from Moody's with respect to the
Loans.

Proceeds are not otherwise required to be applied to repay Term Loans pursuant
to Section 4.02(g) or reduce the Total L/C Commitment pursuant to Section
3.03(d).

<PAGE>

                12.01   Appointment. The Lenders hereby irrevocably designate
and appoint DBCI as Administrative Agent (for purposes of this Section 12 and
Section 13.01, the term "Administrative Agent" also shall include DBCI in its
capacity as Collateral Agent pursuant to the Security Documents) to act as
specified herein and in the other Credit Documents. Each Lender hereby
irrevocably authorizes, and each holder of any Term Note by the acceptance of
such Term Note shall be deemed irrevocably to authorize, the Administrative
Agent to take such action on its behalf under the provisions of this Agreement,
the other Credit Documents and any other instruments and agreements referred to
herein or therein and to exercise such powers and to perform such duties
hereunder and thereunder as are specifically delegated to or required of the
Administrative Agent by the terms hereof and thereof and such other powers as
are reasonably incidental thereto. The Administrative Agent may perform any of
its respective duties hereunder by or through its officers, directors, agents,
employees or affiliates.

                12.02   Nature of Duties. The Administrative Agent shall not
have any duties or responsibilities except those expressly set forth in this
Agreement and in the other Credit Documents. Neither the Administrative Agent
nor any of its officers, directors, agents, employees or affiliates shall be
liable for any action taken or omitted by it or them hereunder or under any
other Credit Document or in connection herewith or therewith, unless caused by
its or their gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision). The duties of
the Administrative Agent shall be mechanical and administrative in nature; the
Administrative Agent shall not have by reason of this Agreement or any other
Credit Document a fiduciary relationship in respect of any Lender or the holder
of any Term Note; and nothing in this Agreement or in any other Credit Document,
expressed or implied, is intended to or shall be so construed as to impose upon
the Administrative Agent any obligations in respect of this Agreement or any
other Credit Document except as expressly set forth herein or therein.

Independently and without reliance upon the Administrative Agent, each Lender
and the holder of each Term Note, to the extent it deems appropriate, has made
and shall continue to make (i) its own independent investigation of the
financial condition and affairs of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries in
connection with the extensions of credit hereunder and the taking or not taking
of any action in connection herewith and (ii) its own appraisal of the
creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries and, except as expressly
provided in this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty or
responsibility, either initially or on a continuing basis, to provide any Lender
or the holder of any Term Note with any credit or other information with respect
thereto, whether coming into its possession before the making of the Term Loans
or at any time or times thereafter. The Administrative Agent shall not be
responsible to any Lender or the holder of any Term Note for any recitals,
statements, information, representations or warranties herein or in any
document, certificate or other writing delivered in connection herewith or for
the execution, effectiveness, genuineness, validity, enforceability, perfection,
collectibility, priority or sufficiency of this Agreement or any other Credit
Document or the financial condition of the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
or be required to make any inquiry concerning either the performance or
observance of any of the terms, provisions or conditions of this Agreement or
any other Credit Document, or the financial condition of the Borrower or any of
its Subsidiaries or the existence or possible existence of any Default or Event
of Default.

                12.04   Certain Rights of the Administrative Agent. If the
Administrative Agent requests instructions from the Required Lenders with
respect to any act or action (including failure to act) in connection with this
Agreement or any other Credit Document, the Administrative Agent shall be
entitled to refrain from such act or taking such action unless and until the
Administrative Agent shall have received instructions from the Required Lenders;
and the Administrative Agent shall not incur liability to any Lender by reason
of so refraining. Without limiting the foregoing, neither any Lender nor the
holder of any Term Note shall have any right of action whatsoever against the
Administrative Agent as a result of the Administrative Agent acting or
refraining from acting hereunder or under any other Credit Document in
accordance with the instructions of the Required Lenders.

                12.05   Reliance. The Administrative Agent shall be entitled to
rely, and shall be fully protected in relying, upon any note, writing,
resolution, notice, statement, certificate, telex, teletype or telecopier
message, cablegram, radiogram, order or other document or telephone message
signed, sent or made by any Person that the Administrative Agent believed to be
the proper Person, and, with respect to all legal matters pertaining to this
Agreement and any other Credit Document and its duties hereunder and thereunder,
upon advice of counsel selected by the Administrative Agent.

                12.06   Indemnification. To the extent the Administrative Agent
(or any affiliate thereof) is not reimbursed and indemnified by the Borrower,
the Lenders will reimburse and indemnify the Administrative Agent (and any
affiliate thereof) in proportion to their respective "percentage" as used in
determining the Required Lenders (determined as if there were no Defaulting
Lenders) for and against any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, claims, actions, judgments, costs, expenses or disbursements of
whatsoever kind or nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred
by the Administrative Agent (or any affiliate thereof) in performing its duties
hereunder or under any other Credit Document or in any way relating to or
arising out of this Agreement or any other Credit Document; provided that no
Lender shall be liable for any portion of such liabilities, obligations, losses,
damages, penalties, claims, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements resulting from the Administrative Agent's (or such affiliate's)
gross negligence or willful misconduct (as determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction in a final and non-appealable decision).

                12.07   The Administrative Agent in its Individual Capacity.
With respect to its obligation to make Term Loans, or issue or participate in
Letters of Credit, under this Agreement, the Administrative Agent shall have the
rights and powers specified herein for a "Lender" and may exercise the same
rights and powers as though it were not performing the duties specified herein;
and the term "Lender," "Required Lenders," "Supermajority Lenders," "holders of
Term Notes" or any similar terms shall, unless the context clearly indicates
otherwise, include the Administrative Agent in its respective individual
capacities. The Administrative Agent and its affiliates may accept deposits
from, lend money to, and generally engage in any kind of banking, investment
banking, trust or other business with, or provide debt financing, equity capital
or other services (including financial advisory services) to any Credit Party or
any Affiliate of any Credit Party (or any Person engaged in a similar business
with any Credit Party or any Affiliate thereof) as if they were not performing
the duties specified herein, and may accept fees and other consideration from
any Credit Party or any Affiliate of any Credit

                                      -105-
<PAGE>

Party for services in connection with this Agreement and otherwise without
having to account for the same to the Lenders.

                12.08   Holders. The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the
payee of any Term Note as the owner thereof for all purposes hereof unless and
until a written notice of the assignment, transfer or endorsement thereof, as
the case may be, shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Any
request, authority or consent of any Person who, at the time of making such
request or giving such authority or consent, is the holder of any Term Note
shall be conclusive and binding on any subsequent holder, transferee, assignee
or endorsee, as the case may be, of such Term Note or of any Term Note or Term
Notes issued in exchange therefor.

                12.09   Resignation by the Administrative Agent. (a) The
Administrative Agent may resign from the performance of all its respective
functions and duties hereunder and/or under the other Credit Documents at any
time by giving 15 Business Days' prior written notice to the Lenders and, unless
a Default or an Event of Default under Section 10.05 then exists, the Borrower.
Any such resignation by an Administrative Agent hereunder shall also constitute
its resignation as an Issuing Lender, in which case the resigning Administrative
Agent (x) shall not be required to issue any further Letters of Credit hereunder
and (y) shall maintain all of its rights as Issuing Lender, with respect to any
Letters of Credit issued by it prior to the date of such resignation. Such
resignation shall take effect upon the appointment of a successor Administrative
Agent pursuant to clauses (b) and (c) below or as otherwise provided below.

                (b)     Upon any such notice of resignation by the
Administrative Agent, the Required Lenders shall appoint a successor
Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder who shall be a commercial bank or
trust company reasonably acceptable to the Borrower, which acceptance shall not
be unreasonably withheld or delayed (provided that the Borrower's approval shall
not be required if an Event of Default then exists).

                (c)     If a successor Administrative Agent shall not have been
so appointed within such 15 Business Day period, the Administrative Agent, with
the consent of the Borrower (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed, provided that the Borrower's consent shall not be required if an Event
of Default then exists), shall then appoint a successor Administrative Agent who
shall serve as Administrative Agent hereunder or thereunder until such time, if
any, as the Required Lenders appoint a successor Administrative Agent as
provided above.

                (d)     If no successor Administrative Agent has been appointed
pursuant to clause (b) or (c) above by the 20th Business Day after the date such
notice of resignation was given by the Administrative Agent, the Administrative
Agent's resignation shall become effective and the Required Lenders shall
thereafter perform all the duties of the Administrative Agent hereunder and/or
under any other Credit Document until such time, if any, as the Required Lenders
appoint a successor Administrative Agent as provided above.

                (e)     Upon a resignation of the Administrative Agent pursuant
to this Section 12.09, the Administrative Agent shall remain indemnified to the
extent provided in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents and the
provisions of this Section 12 shall continue

                                      -106-

VOID. THIS SUBSECTION (b) SHALL BE SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF EACH OF THE LENDERS
AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT HEREUNDER.

                13.04   Benefit of Agreement; Assignments; Participations. (a)
This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the respective successors and assigns of the parties hereto;
provided, however, neither the Borrower nor the Borrower may assign or transfer
any of its rights, obligations or interest hereunder without the prior written
consent of the Lenders and, provided further, that, although any Lender may
transfer, assign or grant participations in its rights hereunder, such Lender
shall remain a "Lender" for all purposes hereunder (and may not transfer or
assign all or any portion of its Commitments hereunder except as provided in
Sections 1.13 and 13.04(b)) and the transferee, assignee or participant, as the
case may be, shall not constitute a "Lender" hereunder and, provided further,
that no Lender shall transfer or grant any participation under which the
participant shall have rights to approve any amendment to or waiver of this
Agreement or any other Credit Document except to the extent such amendment or
waiver would (i) extend the final scheduled maturity of any Term Loan, Term Note
or Letter of Credit (unless such Letter of Credit is not extended beyond the
Final Maturity Date) in which such participant is participating, or reduce the
rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon (except in
connection with a waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in
interest rates) or reduce the principal amount thereof (it being understood that
any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in this Agreement or
to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or
Fees payable hereunder), or increase the amount of the participant's
participation over the amount thereof then in effect (it being understood that a
waiver of any Default or Event of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the
Total Commitment shall not constitute a change in the terms of such
participation, and that an increase in any Commitment (or the available portion
thereof) or Term

                                      -109-
<PAGE>

Loan shall be permitted without the consent of any participant if the
participant's participation is not increased as a result thereof), (ii) consent
to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and
obligations under this Agreement or (iii) release all or substantially all of
the Collateral under all of the Security Documents (except as expressly provided
in the Credit Documents) supporting the Term Loans or Letters of Credit
hereunder in which such participant is participating. In the case of any such
participation, the participant shall not have any rights under this Agreement or
any of the other Credit Documents (the participant's rights against such Lender
in respect of such participation to be those set forth in the agreement executed
by such Lender in favor of the participant relating thereto) and all amounts
payable by the Borrower hereunder shall be determined as if such Lender had not
sold such participation.

                (b)     Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Lender (or any Lender
together with one or more other Lenders) may (x) assign all or a portion of its
Commitments and related outstanding Obligations (or, if the Term Loan
Commitments or L/C Commitments have terminated, the related outstanding
Obligations) hereunder to (i)(A) its parent company and/or any affiliate of such
Lender which is at least 50% owned by such Lender or its parent company or (B)
to one or more other Lenders or any affiliate of any such other Lender which is
at least 50% owned by such other Lender or its parent company (provided that any
fund that invests in Term Loans and is managed or advised by the same investment
advisor of another fund which is a Lender (or by an Affiliate of such investment
advisor) shall be treated as an affiliate of such other Lender for the purposes
of this sub-clause (x)(i)(B)), or (ii) in the case of any Lender that is a fund
that invests in Term Loans, any other fund that invests in Term Loans and is
managed or advised by the same investment advisor of any Lender or by an
Affiliate of such investment advisor or (y) assign all, or if less than all, a
portion equal to at least $1,000,000 in the aggregate for the assigning Lender
or assigning Lenders, of such Commitments and related outstanding Obligations
(or, if the Term Loan Commitments or L/C Commitments have terminated, the
related outstanding Obligations) hereunder to one or more Eligible Transferees
(treating any fund that invests in Term Loans and any other fund that invests in
loans and is managed or advised by the same investment advisor of such fund or
by an Affiliate of such investment advisor as a single Eligible Transferee),
each of which assignees shall become a party to this Agreement as a Lender by
execution of an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, provided that (i) at such
time, Schedule I shall be deemed modified to reflect the Commitments and/or
outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be, of such new Lender and of the
existing Lenders, (ii) upon the surrender of the relevant Term Notes by the
assigning Lender (or, upon such assigning Lender's indemnifying the Borrower for
any lost Term Note pursuant to a customary indemnification agreement) new Term
Notes will be issued, at the Borrower's expense, to such new Lender and to the
assigning Lender upon the request of such new Lender or assigning Lender, such
new Term Notes to be in conformity with the requirements of Section 1.05 (with
appropriate modifications) to the extent needed to reflect the revised
Commitments and/or outstanding Term Loans, as the case may be, (iii) the consent
of the Administrative Agent and the Borrower (unless a Default under Section
10.01 or 10.05 or an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and with
such consent of the Borrower not being required in connection with the primary
syndication (as determined by the Administrative Agent) of the Term Loans) shall
be required in connection with any such assignment pursuant to clause (y) above
(which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), (iv) the consent
of each Issuing Lender shall be required for any assignment of any L/C
Commitment or participation in any Letter of Credit Outstandings, (v) the
Administrative Agent shall receive at the time of each such assignment, from the
assigning or

                                      -110-
<PAGE>

assignee Lender, the payment of a non-refundable assignment fee of $3,500 and
(vi) no such transfer or assignment will be effective until recorded by the
Administrative Agent on the Register pursuant to Section 13.15. To the extent of
any assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b), the assigning Lender shall be
relieved of its obligations hereunder with respect to its assigned Commitments.
At the time of each assignment pursuant to this Section 13.04(b) to a Person
which is not already a Lender hereunder, the respective assignee Lender shall,
to the extent legally entitled to do so, provide to the Borrower the appropriate
Internal Revenue Service Forms and necessary attachments (and, if applicable, a
Section 4.04(b)(ii) Certificate) described in Section 4.04(b). To the extent
that an assignment of all or any portion of a Lender's Commitments and related
outstanding Obligations pursuant to Section 1.13 or this Section 13.04(b) would,
at the time of such assignment, result in greater amounts under Section 1.10,
2.06 or 4.04 from the amounts the Borrower is required to pay or increase with
respect to the respective assigning Lender prior to such assignment, then the
Borrower shall not be obligated to pay such increased amounts (although the
Borrower, in accordance with and pursuant to the other provisions of this
Agreement, shall be obligated to pay any other increased costs of the type
described above resulting from changes after the date of the respective
assignment).

                (c)     Nothing in this Agreement shall prevent or prohibit any
Lender from pledging its Term Loans and Term Notes hereunder to a Federal
Reserve Bank in support of borrowings made by such Lender from such Federal
Reserve Bank and, with prior notification to the Administrative Agent (but
without the consent of the Administrative Agent or the Borrower), any Lender
which is a fund may pledge all or any portion of its Term Loans and Term Notes
to its trustee or to a collateral agent providing credit or credit support to
such Lender in support of its obligations to such trustee, such collateral agent
or a holder of such obligations, as the case may be. No pledge pursuant to this
clause (c) shall release the transferor Lender from any of its obligations
hereunder.

                13.05   No Waiver; Remedies Cumulative. No failure or delay on
the part of the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender
or any Lender in exercising any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any
other Credit Document and no course of dealing between the Borrower or any other
Credit Party and the Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing
Lender or any Lender shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, power or privilege hereunder or under any other
Credit Document preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right, power or privilege hereunder or thereunder. The rights,
powers and remedies herein or in any other Credit Document expressly provided
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, powers or remedies which the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender
would otherwise have. No notice to or demand on any Credit Party in any case
shall entitle any Credit Party to any other or further notice or demand in
similar or other circumstances or constitute a waiver of the rights of the
Administrative Agent, the Collateral Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender to
any other or further action in any circumstances without notice or demand.

                13.06   Payments Pro Rata. (a) Except as otherwise provided in
this Agreement, the Administrative Agent agrees that promptly after its receipt
of each payment from or on behalf of the Borrower in respect of any Obligations
hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall distribute such payment to the Lenders
entitled thereto (other than any Lender that has consented

                                      -111-
<PAGE>

in writing to waive its pro rata share of any such payment) pro rata based upon
their respective shares, if any, of the Obligations with respect to which such
payment was received.

                (b)     Each of the Lenders agrees that, if it should receive
any amount hereunder (whether by voluntary payment, by realization upon
security, by the exercise of the right of setoff or banker's lien, by
counterclaim or cross action, by the enforcement of any right under the Credit
Documents, or otherwise), which is applicable to the payment of the principal
of, or interest on, the Term Loans, Unpaid Drawings, L/C Commitment Commission
or Letter of Credit Fees, of a sum which with respect to the related sum or sums
received by other Lenders is in a greater proportion than the total of such
Obligation then owed and due to such Lender bears to the total of such
Obligation then owed and due to all of the Lenders immediately prior to such
receipt, then such Lender receiving such excess payment shall purchase for cash
without recourse or warranty from the other Lenders an interest in the
Obligations of the respective Credit Party to such Lenders in such amount as
shall result in a proportional participation by all the Lenders in such amount;
provided that if all or any portion of such excess amount is thereafter
recovered from such Lenders, such purchase shall be rescinded and the purchase
price restored to the extent of such recovery, but without interest.

                (c)     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, the provisions of the preceding Sections 13.06(a) and (b) shall be
subject to the express provisions of this Agreement which require, or permit,
differing payments to be made to Non-Defaulting Lenders as opposed to Defaulting
Lenders.

                13.07   Calculations; Computations. (a) The financial statements
to be furnished to the Lenders pursuant hereto shall be made and prepared in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States
consistently applied throughout the periods involved (except as set forth in the
notes thereto or as otherwise disclosed in writing by the Borrower to the
Lenders); provided that, (i) except as otherwise specifically provided herein,
all computations of Excess Cash Flow, and all computations and all definitions
(including accounting terms) used in determining compliance with Sections 8.17
and 9, inclusive, shall utilize generally accepted accounting principles and
policies in conformity with those used to prepare the financial statements of
the Borrower referred to in Section 8.01(c) for the fiscal year ending December
31, 2004 and (ii) to the extent expressly provided herein, certain calculations
shall be made on a Pro Forma Basis.

                (b)     All computations of interest, L/C Commitment Commission
and other Fees hereunder shall be made on the basis of a year of 360 days for
the actual number of days (including the first day but excluding the last day;
except that in the case of Letter of Credit Fees and Facing Fees, the last day
shall be included) occurring in the period for which such interest, L/C
Commitment Commission or Fees are payable.

OF JURY TRIAL. (a) THIS AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER CREDIT DOCUMENTS AND THE RIGHTS
AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE PARTIES HEREUNDER AND THEREUNDER SHALL, EXCEPT AS

same instrument. A set of counterparts executed by all the parties hereto shall

Agreement.

                13.12   Amendment or Waiver; etc. (a) Neither this Agreement nor
any other Credit Document nor any terms hereof or thereof may be changed,
waived, discharged or terminated unless such change, waiver, discharge or
termination is in writing signed by the respective Credit Parties party hereto
or thereto and the Required Lenders (although additional parties may be added to
(and annexes may be modified to reflect such additions), and Subsidiaries of the
Borrower may be released from, the Subsidiaries Guaranty and the Security
Documents in accordance with the provisions hereof and thereof without the
consent of the other Credit Parties party thereto or the Required Lenders),
provided that no such change, waiver, discharge or termination shall, without
the consent of each Lender (other than a Defaulting Lender) (with Obligations
being directly modified in the case of following clause (i)), (i) extend the
final scheduled maturity of any Term Loan or Term Note or extend the stated
expiration date of any Letter of Credit beyond the Final Maturity Date, or
reduce the rate or extend the time of payment of interest or Fees thereon
(except in connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default
increase in interest rates), or reduce the principal amount thereof (it being
understood that any amendment or modification to the financial definitions in
this Agreement or to Section 13.07(a) shall not constitute a reduction in the
rate of interest or Fees for the purposes of this clause (i)), (ii) release all
or substantially all of the Collateral (except as expressly provided in the
Credit Documents) under all the Security Documents, (iii) amend, modify or waive
any provision of this Section 13.12 (except for technical amendments with
respect to additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement which
afford the protections to such additional extensions of credit of the type
provided to the Term Loans and the L/C Commitments on the Effective Date), (iv)
reduce the percentage specified in the definition of Required Lenders (it being
understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders, additional extensions
of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in the determination of the
Required Lenders on substantially the same basis as the extensions of Term Loans
and L/C Commitments are included on the Effective Date) or (v) consent to the
assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its rights and obligations
under this Agreement; provided further, that no such change, waiver, discharge
or termination shall (1) increase the Commitments of any Lender over the amount
thereof then in effect without the consent of such Lender (it being understood
that waivers or modifications of conditions precedent, covenants, Defaults or
Events of Default or of a mandatory reduction in the Total Commitment shall not
constitute an increase of the

                                      -114-
<PAGE>

Commitment of any Lender, and that an increase in the available portion of any

such Lender), (2) without the consent of each Issuing Lender, amend, modify or
waive any provision of Section 2 or alter its rights or obligations with respect
to Letters of Credit, (3) without the consent of the Administrative Agent,
amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 12 or any other provision as

without the consent of Collateral Agent, amend, modify or waive any provision
relating to the rights or obligations of the Collateral Agent, or (5) reduce the
amount of, or extend the date of, any Scheduled Repayment without the consent of
the Supermajority Lenders holding Term Loans, or amend the definition of
Supermajority Lenders without the consent of the Supermajority Lenders holding
Term Loans (it being understood that, with the consent of the Required Lenders,
additional extensions of credit pursuant to this Agreement may be included in
the determination of the Supermajority Lenders on substantially the same basis
as the extensions of Term Loans and L/C Commitments are included on the
Effective Date).

                (b)     If, in connection with any proposed change, waiver,
discharge or termination of any of the provisions of this Agreement as
contemplated by clauses (i) through (v), inclusive, of the first proviso to
Section 13.12(a), the consent of the Required Lenders is obtained but the
consent of one or more of such other Lenders whose consent is required is not
obtained, then the Borrower shall have the right, so long as all non-consenting
Lenders whose individual consent is required are treated as described in either
clauses (A) or (B) below, to either (A) replace each such non-consenting Lender
or Lenders (or, at the option of the Borrower if the respective Lender's consent
is required with respect to less than all Tranches (or related Commitments), to
replace only the respective Tranche or Tranches of Commitments and/or related
outstandings of the respective non-consenting Lender which gave rise to the need
to obtain such Lender's individual consent) with one or more Replacement Lenders
pursuant to Section 1.13 so long as at the time of such replacement, each such
Replacement Lender consents to the proposed change, waiver, discharge or
termination or (B) terminate such non-consenting Lender's Commitments and repay
the outstanding Term Loans of such Lender and cash collateralize such Lender's
L/C Percentage of all outstanding Letters of Credit (or, if such Lender is being
replaced as to a single Tranche only, take such actions with respect to the
Tranche for which it is being terminated), all in accordance with Sections
3.02(b) and/or 4.01(b), provided that, unless the Commitments that are
terminated, and Term Loans repaid, pursuant to preceding clause (B) are
immediately replaced in full at such time through the addition of new Lenders or
the increase of the Commitments and/or outstanding Term Loans of existing
Lenders (who in each case must specifically consent thereto), then in the case
of any action pursuant to preceding clause (B) the Required Lenders (determined
after giving effect to the proposed action) shall specifically consent thereto,
provided further, that in any event the Borrower shall not have the right to
replace a Lender, terminate its Commitments or repay its Term Loans solely as a
result of the exercise of such Lender's rights (and the withholding of any
required consent by such Lender) pursuant to the second proviso to Section
13.12(a).

                13.13   Survival. All indemnities set forth herein including,
without limitation, in Sections 1.10, 1.11, 2.06, 4.04, 12.06 and 13.01 shall
survive the execution, delivery and termination of this Agreement and the Term
Notes and the making and repayment of the Obligations.

                                      -115-
<PAGE>

                13.14   Domicile of Term Loans. Each Lender may transfer and
carry its Term Loans at, to or for the account of any office, Subsidiary or
Affiliate of such Lender. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
herein, to the extent that a transfer of Term Loans pursuant to this Section
13.14 would, at the time of such transfer, result in increased costs under
Section 1.10, 1.11, 2.06 or 4.04 from those being charged by the respective
Lender prior to such transfer, then the Borrower shall not be obligated to pay
such increased costs (although the Borrower shall be obligated to pay any other
increased costs of the type described above resulting from changes after the
date of the respective transfer).

                13.15   Register. The Borrower hereby designates the
Administrative Agent to serve as its agent, solely for purposes of this Section
13.15, to maintain a register (the "Register") on which it will record the
Commitments from time to time of each of the Lenders, the Term Loans made by
each of the Lenders and each repayment in respect of the principal amount of the
Term Loans of each Lender. Failure to make any such recordation, or any error in
such recordation, shall not affect the Borrower's obligations in respect of such
Term Loans. With respect to any Lender, the transfer of the Commitments of such
Lender and the rights to the principal of, and interest on, any Term Loan made
pursuant to such Commitments shall not be effective until such transfer is
recorded on the Register maintained by the Administrative Agent with respect to
ownership of such Commitments and Term Loans and prior to such recordation all
amounts owing to the transferor with respect to such Commitments and Term Loans
shall remain owing to the transferor. The registration of assignment or transfer
of all or part of any Commitments and Term Loans shall be recorded by the
Administrative Agent on the Register only upon the acceptance by the
Administrative Agent of a properly executed and delivered Assignment and
Assumption Agreement pursuant to Section 13.04(b). Coincident with the delivery
of such an Assignment and Assumption Agreement to the Administrative Agent for
acceptance and registration of assignment or transfer of all or part of a Term
Loan, or as soon thereafter as practicable, the assigning or transferor Lender
shall surrender the Term Note (if any) evidencing such Term Loan, and thereupon
one or more new Term Notes in the same aggregate principal amount shall be
issued to the assigning or transferor Lender and/or the new Lender at the
request of any such Lender. The Borrower agrees to indemnify the Administrative
Agent from and against any and all losses, claims, damages and liabilities of
whatsoever nature which may be imposed on, asserted against or incurred by the
Administrative Agent in performing its duties under this Section 13.15.

                13.16   Confidentiality. (a) Subject to the provisions of clause
(b) of this Section 13.16, each of the Administrative Agent and the Lender
agrees that it will use its reasonable efforts not to disclose without the prior
consent of the Borrower (other than to its employees, auditors, advisors or
counsel or to another Lender if such Lender or such Lender's holding or parent
company in its sole discretion determines that any such party should have access
to such information, provided such Persons shall be subject to the provisions of
this Section 13.16 to the same extent as such Lender) any information with
respect to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries which is now or in the future
furnished pursuant to this Agreement or any other Credit Document, provided that
any Lender may disclose any such information (i) as has become generally
available to the public other than by virtue of a breach of this Section
13.16(a) by the respective Lender, (ii) as may be required or appropriate in any
report, statement or testimony submitted to any municipal, state or Federal
regulatory body having or claiming to have jurisdiction over such Lender or to
the Federal Reserve Board or the Federal Deposit Insurance

                                      -116-
<PAGE>

Corporation or similar organizations (whether in the United States or elsewhere)
or their successors, (iii) as may be required or appropriate in respect to any
summons or subpoena or in connection with any litigation, (iv) in order to
comply with any law, order, regulation or ruling applicable to such Lender, (v)
to the Administrative Agent or the Collateral Agent, (vi) to any direct or
indirect contractual counterparty in any swap, hedge or similar agreement (or to
any such contractual counterparty's professional advisor), so long as such
contractual counterparty (or such professional advisor) agrees to be bound by
the provisions of this Section 13.16, and (vii) to any prospective or actual
transferee or participant in connection with any contemplated transfer or
participation of any of the Term Notes or Commitments or any interest therein by
such Lender, provided that such prospective transferee agrees to be bound by the
confidentiality provisions contained in this Section 13.16.

                (b)     The Borrower hereby acknowledges and agrees that each
Lender may share with any of its affiliates, and such affiliates may share with
such Lender, any information related to the Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries
(including, without limitation, any non-public customer information regarding
the creditworthiness of the Borrower and its Subsidiaries), provided such
Persons shall be subject to the provisions of this Section 13.16 to the same
extent as such Lender.

                13.17   Limitation on Additional Amounts. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in Section 1.10, 1.11 or 2.06, unless a
Lender gives notice to the Borrower that it is obligated to pay an amount under
any such Section within 270 days after the later of (x) the date the Lender
incurs the respective increased costs, Taxes, loss, expense or liability,
reduction in amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital or
(y) the date such Lender has actual knowledge of its incurrence of the
respective increased costs, Taxes, loss, expense or liability, reductions in
amounts received or receivable or reduction in return on capital, then such
Lender shall only be entitled to be compensated for such amount by the Borrower
pursuant to said Section 1.10, 1.11 or 2.06, as the case may be, to the extent
the costs, Taxes, loss, expense or liability, reduction in amounts received or
receivable or reduction in return on capital are incurred or suffered on or
after the date which occurs 270 days prior to such Lender giving notice to the
Borrower that it is obligated to pay the respective amounts pursuant to said
Section 1.10, 1.11 or 2.06. This Section 13.17 shall have no applicability to
any Section of this Agreement other than said Sections 1.10, 1.11or 2.06.

                13.18   Post-Closing Actions. Notwithstanding anything to the
contrary contained in this Agreement or the other Credit Documents, the parties
hereto acknowledge and agree that the Borrower and its Subsidiaries shall be
required to take the actions specified in Schedule XV as promptly as
practicable, and in any event within the time periods set forth in Schedule XV
or such other time periods as the Administrative Agent may agree. The provisions
of Schedule XV shall be deemed incorporated by reference herein as fully as if
set forth herein in their entirety. All provisions of this Agreement and the
other Credit Documents (including, without limitation, all conditions precedent,
representations, warranties, covenants, events of default and other agreements
herein and therein) shall be deemed modified to the extent necessary to effect
the foregoing (and to permit the taking of the actions described above within
the time periods required above, rather than as otherwise provided in the Credit
Documents); provided that (x) to the extent any representation and warranty
would not be true because the foregoing actions were not taken on the Initial
Borrowing Date, the respective representation and

                                      -117-
<PAGE>

warranty shall be required to be true and correct in all material respects at
the time the respective action is taken (or was required to be taken) in
accordance with the foregoing provisions of this Section 13.18 and (y) all
representations and warranties relating to the Security Documents shall be
required to be true immediately after the actions required to be taken by this
Section 13.18 have been taken (or were required to be taken). The acceptance of
the benefits of each Credit Event shall constitute a covenant and agreement by
the Borrower to each of the Lenders that the actions required pursuant to this
Section 13.18 will be, or have been, taken within the relevant time periods
referred to in this Section 13.18 and that, at such time, all representations
and warranties contained in this Agreement and the other Credit Documents shall
then be true and correct in all material respects without any modification
pursuant to this Section 13.18. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that
the failure to take any of the actions required above (other than any actions
that are not material, either individually or in the aggregate), within the
relevant time periods required above, shall give rise to a Default pursuant to
this Agreement upon notice of such failure to the Borrower by the Administrative
Agent or the Required Lenders.

                13.19   The Patriot Act. Each Lender subject to the USA PATRIOT
ACT (Title 111 of Pub. L. 107-56 (signed into law October 26, 2001)) (the "Act")
hereby notifies the Borrower that pursuant to the requirements of the Act, it is
required to obtain, verify and record information that identifies the Borrower
and the other Credit Parties and other information that will allow such Lender
to identify the Borrower and the other Credit Parties in accordance with the
Act.

                13.20   OTHER LIENS ON COLLATERAL; TERMS OF INTERCREDITOR
AGREEMENT; ETC. (a) EACH LENDER PARTY HERETO UNDERSTANDS, ACKNOWLEDGES AND
AGREES THAT LIENS SHALL BE CREATED ON THE COLLATERAL PURSUANT TO THE SECOND-LIEN
NOTE DOCUMENTS AND ON THE COLLATERAL OF THE BORROWER PURSUANT TO THE THIRD-LIEN
CREDIT DOCUMENTS, WHICH LIENS SHALL BE REQUIRED TO BE SUBORDINATED AND JUNIOR TO
THE LIENS CREATED PURSUANT TO THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS
OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT. PURSUANT TO THE EXPRESS TERMS OF SECTION 8.1 OF
THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, IN THE EVENT OF ANY CONFLICT BETWEEN THE TERMS OF
THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT AND ANY OF THE CREDIT DOCUMENTS, THE PROVISIONS OF
THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT SHALL GOVERN AND CONTROL.

                (b)     EACH LENDER AUTHORIZES AND INSTRUCTS THE COLLATERAL
AGENT AND THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT TO ENTER INTO THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ON
BEHALF OF THE LENDERS, AND TO TAKE ALL ACTIONS (AND EXECUTE ALL DOCUMENTS)
REQUIRED (OR DEEMED ADVISABLE) BY IT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE
INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT.

                (c)     THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 13.20 ARE NOT INTENDED TO
SUMMARIZE ALL RELEVANT PROVISIONS OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT, THE FORM OF
WHICH IS ATTACHED AS AN EXHIBIT TO THIS AGREEMENT. REFERENCE MUST BE MADE TO THE
INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT ITSELF TO

                                      -118-
<PAGE>

UNDERSTAND ALL TERMS AND CONDITIONS THEREOF. EACH LENDER IS RESPONSIBLE FOR
MAKING ITS OWN ANALYSIS AND REVIEW OF THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT AND THE TERMS
AND PROVISIONS THEREOF, AND NO AGENT OR ANY OF AFFILIATES MAKES ANY
REPRESENTATION TO ANY LENDER AS TO THE SUFFICIENCY OR ADVISABILITY OF THE
PROVISIONS CONTAINED IN THE INTERCREDITOR AGREEMENT. EACH LENDER IS FURTHER
AWARE THAT CERTAIN AGENTS ARE ALSO ACTING IN AN AGENCY CAPACITY UNDER, AND AS
DEFINED IN, THE SECOND-LIEN NOTE DOCUMENTS, AND EACH LENDER HEREBY IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES ANY OBJECTION THERETO OR CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING THEREFROM. *  *  *
