                        Rate, Fourth Quarter EPS 79 Cents;

           Operating Cash Flow Reaches $101.2 Million for Fiscal 2004

LAKE FOREST, Calif., December 13, 2004 -- The Cooper Companies, Inc. (NYSE: COO)
today reported results for its fourth quarter and fiscal year ended October 31,
2004 and restated earlier earnings per share to reflect new accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States (GAAP) which amend the
methodology of calculating diluted earnings per share (EPS) for contingently
convertible senior debentures (convertibles).

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Results

     o    Fourth quarter revenue $130.8 million, 16% above fourth quarter 2003,
          12% in constant currency. Fiscal 2004 revenue $490.2 million, 19%
          above fiscal 2003, 14% in constant currency.

     o    Giving effect to the new methodology for convertibles and an
          adjustment to the Effective Tax Rate (ETR), fourth quarter EPS 79
          cents, up 30%, and fiscal year 2004 EPS $2.59, up 24%.

     o    Before the effect of the new methodology for convertibles and the ETR
          adjustment, fourth quarter 2004 EPS 72 cents, up 13%, and fiscal year
          2004 EPS $2.61, up 23%.

     o    Cash flow (income before taxes, depreciation and amortization) per
          share 96 cents, up 10% from 87 cents in fourth quarter 2003; fiscal
          2004 up 13% to $3.50 from $3.10 in fiscal 2003.

     o    Operating cash flow $35.2 million for the quarter; $101.2 million for
          fiscal 2004 versus $80 million for fiscal 2003.

Accounting Change

During the fiscal fourth quarter, the Company elected to adopt EITF 04-8 and as
a result has included the dilutive effect of its contingently convertible senior
debentures in its diluted earnings per share calculation from the time of
issuance of the notes, in accordance with the if-converted methodology under
SFAS No. 128. The effect of this election was to decrease EPS for the fourth
quarter by 4 cents.


                                                                         Page 1

Lower Effective Tax Rate

Cooper's effective tax rate (ETR) for fiscal 2004 (provision for taxes divided
by income before taxes) is 17.5% down from the 21% reported in its third quarter
results. GAAP requires the projected fiscal year ETR to be used when reporting
year-to-date results for interim periods. The ETR was revised downward in the
fourth quarter to adjust for increased profit and reinvestment of earnings from
the continuing growth of CooperVision business outside the United States and the
release of certain tax reserves no longer required.

The effect of the lower fiscal year ETR was to reduce the ETR for the fourth
quarter to 8% and to increase EPS by 11 cents. Cooper expects that the ETR for
fiscal 2005 will be 21%.

Restated and Pro Forma Diluted Earnings Per Share

As described above, the Company has restated diluted earnings per share,
starting in the third quarter of fiscal 2003 through the third quarter of fiscal
2004 for the effects of the accounting change for convertibles. In addition,
diluted earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 has been
affected by the lower ETR. The table below shows a comparison of diluted
earnings per share for fiscal 2003 and 2004 before and including the effects of
such changes.

2004 Performance

Commenting on the year's results, Chief Executive Officer A. Thomas Bender said,
"The Cooper Companies had another solid year, continuing the consistent
performance it has delivered since 1995. Compared to 2003, revenue grew 19%,
operating income grew 23%, earnings per share were up 24% and cash flow per
share increased 13%. Our five-year compounded annual growth in revenue is 24%,
in operating income 25%, in earnings per share 28% and in cash flow per share
20%.

"According to independent sales audit data, CooperVision (CVI), our contact lens
business, improved its market position in all of the major markets where it
competes. We estimate that our worldwide soft contact lens market share exceeds
10%, up from 6% three years ago. In the United States, the world's largest
market, CVI is now the

nation's third largest contact lens manufacturer, with about 13% of the market.
Year to date, our U.S. business grew 12% compared to estimated 2004 market
growth of 8%.

"CooperSurgical (CSI), our women's health care business, continued to execute
successfully its strategy of consolidating the market through acquisition,
completing two transactions during the fiscal year that strengthened its
presence in the incontinence sector."

Fourth Quarter and Fiscal 2004 Revenue and Expense Summary

Cooper's quarterly revenue of $130.8 million was 16% above last year's fourth
quarter, 12% in constant currency. For the fiscal year, revenue grew 19%, 14% in
constant currency.

Gross margin for the quarter was 64%, versus 66% in last year's fourth quarter
as lower margin sales to distributors outside the U.S. and a weaker U.S. dollar
offset improvements in manufacturing efficiency. For the fiscal year, gross
margin was 64%, the same as last year.

Selling, general and administrative expenses grew 13%, 10% in constant currency,
and decreased to 38% of revenue from 39% in last year's fourth quarter. SG&A
spending for the fiscal year was 39% of sales compared to 40% in 2003.

Fourth quarter 2004 research and development expense was $1.9 million, up 22%
over the fourth quarter of 2003, supporting previously announced plans to
develop both new and improved contact lens products and development efforts for
new incontinence products at CooperSurgical.

Operating income grew 12% and the quarter's operating margin was 25% of revenue
versus 26% in last year's fourth quarter. Total operating expenses were 40% of
revenue, down from 41% in last year's fourth quarter. For the fiscal year,
operating income rose 23% with an operating margin of 24% versus 23% in 2003.

Currency fluctuations did not materially impact operating income in the quarter.
Because CVI manufactures the majority of its lenses in the United Kingdom with
costs denominated in pounds sterling, the unfavorable currency translation of
manufacturing and operating costs tends to offset the currency gains on overseas
revenue.

Income before taxes in the quarter grew 13% and increased 24% for the fiscal
year.


                                                                         Page 3




<Page>



ETR for fiscal 2004 was 17.5% compared to 24% for fiscal 2003 reflecting a
favorable mix of profits outside the United States and the release of certain
tax reserves no longer required.

Interest expense fell 13% versus last year's fourth quarter, reflecting a
general decrease in interest rates and reduced debt levels due to strong
operating cash flow.

Reflecting the accounting change for convertibles, the number of shares used to
compute diluted earnings per share grew to 36.9 million in the fourth quarter,
up 4% and to 36.6 million for the fiscal year, up 10%.

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow Highlights

     o    At the end of the fourth fiscal quarter, Cooper's days sales
          outstanding (DSO's) decreased to 65 days from 67 days a year ago.
          Given continued strong growth expectations outside the United States
          where DSO's are higher, Cooper expects future DSO's in the mid to
          upper 60's to low 70's.

     o    Inventory months on hand was 6.9 months at the end of the quarter
          compared to 7.0 months a year ago, in line with Company expectations.

     o    Capital expenditures were about $10 million in the quarter and $41
          million for the year, primarily to expand CVI's manufacturing capacity
          and continue the rollout of new information systems in selected
          locations, including several outside the United States.

     o    Depreciation and amortization was $4.1 million for the quarter, $15.7
          million for the year.

CVI fourth quarter revenue was $103.8 million, up 14%, about 10% in constant
currency, and $388.7 million for the fiscal year, up 18%, 12% in constant
currency.

"In our fourth quarter," said Bender, "CVI significantly outpaced both the
market and the results reported for the third calendar quarter by our four
direct competitors. Our specialty lens franchise -- toric, cosmetic, and
multifocal lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms -- continues to gain
momentum, while our value-added monthly disposable spherical products continue
to capture market share from two-week commodity disposable spherical lenses."

CVI's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 28% versus 29% in last year's
fourth quarter and 27% for fiscal 2004, the same as in fiscal 2003.

Proposed Acquisition of Ocular Sciences, Inc.

In July, Cooper and Ocular Sciences, Inc.(Nasdaq: OCLR) announced that they had
signed a definitive agreement for Cooper to acquire Ocular in a merger in which
Ocular stockholders will be entitled to receive 0.3879 of a share of Cooper
common stock and $22.00 in cash, without interest, for each share of Ocular
common stock they own.


                                                                         Page 5

At closing, expected in the first quarter of Cooper's 2005 fiscal year, which
began on November 1, 2004, Cooper will pay approximately $600 million in cash
and issue approximately 10.7 million shares of its common stock to Ocular
Sciences stockholders and option holders.

Completion of the transaction, which has been approved by each company's
stockholders, remains subject to expiration of the waiting period required under
the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act and customary closing
conditions.

Revenue and Earnings Per Share Guidance

The table below shows Cooper's estimates of the revenue and earnings of the
combined company for the fiscal years 2005 through 2007 assuming no major change
in exchange rates. They exclude nonrecurring charges for acquisition accounting
and restructuring. They assume, for the purpose of these projections, that the
transaction closes December 31, 2004, not November 1, 2004, as used in previous
guidance. Earnings per share estimates have been revised to reflect the impact
of applying the if-converted method for calculating earnings per share discussed
above.

CSI revenue grew 22% in the quarter to $27 million and 23% for the fiscal year
to $101.5 million. Organic growth in the fourth quarter and fiscal year was 4%.

CSI's operating margin in the fourth quarter was 21%, down from 25% in last
year's fourth quarter, and 21% for the fiscal year, down from 22% the previous
year, reflecting the previously announced planned increase in sales and
marketing expenditures designed to stimulate future organic growth.

CooperSurgical Acquisitions in 2004

In December 2003, CSI announced the purchase from privately held SURx, Inc., of
the assets and associated worldwide license rights for the Laparoscopic (LP) and
Transvaginal (TV) product lines of its Radio Frequency (RF) Bladder Neck
Suspension technology, which uses radio frequency based thermal energy instead
of implants to restore continence.

RF Bladder Neck Suspension is a minimally invasive procedure used to treat
genuine stress incontinence (GSI). Using low power, bipolar RF energy, the
procedure shrinks tissue in the pelvic floor to lift the urethra and bladder
neck to a more normal anatomical position. This procedure can be performed using
either a laparoscopic or a transvaginal approach.

The SURx System consists of a small, lightweight 15 watt SURx Radio Frequency
Generator that delivers RF energy to a single-use handheld applicator for each
surgical approach.

In February, Cooper acquired Milex Products, Inc., a manufacturer and marketer
of obstetric and gynecologic products and customized print services. Milex is a
leading supplier of pessaries--products used to medically manage female urinary
incontinence and pelvic support conditions--and also supplies cancer screening
products, including endometrial and endocervical sampling devices and a breast
biopsy needle for fine needle aspiration. Milex also publishes patient education
materials that discuss prenatal and pregnancy issues, breast health, menopause
and osteoporosis.

CVI Business Details

Worldwide Contact Lens Market

Revenue reported for the first nine months of 2004 by the five leading contact
lens manufacturers that represent more than 95% of the global market indicates
that the worldwide market grew about 13%, or 9% in constant currency. Cooper
estimates that the worldwide market for soft contact lenses is $3.9 billion
annually.

Fourth Quarter and Year-To-Date Contact Lens Revenue

     o    Worldwide CVI revenue grew 14% in the fourth quarter, 10% in constant
          currency, and was 18% ahead for the year, 12% in constant currency.

     o    Revenue for specialty lenses -- toric lenses, cosmetic lenses,
          multifocal lenses and lenses to alleviate dry eye symptoms -- grew 18%
          in the fourth quarter, 23% for the year, and now accounts for over 62%
          of CVI's worldwide business and 70% of its revenue in the United
          States.

          quarter and 20% for the fiscal year reflecting the ongoing transition
          worldwide from commodity two-week spheres to monthly disposable
          spheres that offer unique patient benefits such as CVI's Proclear
          brand for patients with dry eye symptoms.

was expanded to include Proclear Multifocal, and the UltraVue 2000 Multifocal,
UltraVue 2000 Multifocal Toric and UltraVue 2000 Multifocal Options. Coupled

Operating Cash Flow

Primarily due to strong operating results, improved days sales outstanding, and
U. S. federal tax savings resulting from net operating loss carryforwards,
Cooper's fourth quarter operating cash flow was $35.2 million and $101.2 million
for fiscal 2004. Excluding $41 million in capital expenditures during 2004,
"free cash flow" was $60 million.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

In this news release we report Cooper's earnings per share before the effect of
the new methodology for convertibles and the ETR adjustment as 72 cents for the
fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and as $2.61 for the 12 months ended October 31,
2004.

Although earnings per share for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004 and for the
twelve months ended October 31, 2004 before the effect of the new methodology
for convertibles and the ETR adjustment are non-GAAP financial measures, we
disclose them because we believe it is beneficial to the reader to show the
effect of these items arising in our fiscal fourth quarter 2004 and thereby
enable our readers to compare earnings per share in fiscal 2003 and 2004 on a
consistent basis.

To calculate earnings per share before the effect of the new methodology for
convertibles and the ETR adjustment we deduct the favorable impact of the change
in the ETR to arrive at an ETR of 21%, and we add back the interest related to
the convertible debentures, net of tax to "Income for calculating earnings per
share." From the "Number of shares used to compute diluted earnings per share"
we deduct the "Shares applicable to convertible debt" to arrive at "Number of
shares used to compute diluted earnings per share before the effect of the new
methodology for convertibles." The "Income before the effect of the new
methodology for convertibles and the ETR adjustment" is then divided by "Number
of shares used to compute diluted earning per share before the effect of the new
methodology for convertibles."


                                                                         Page 9

</TABLE>

In this news release, we report Cooper's "cash flow per share" as 96 cents for
the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, 87 cents for the fourth quarter of 2003 and
$3.50 for the 12 months ended October 31, 2004.

Although "cash flow per share" is a non-GAAP financial measure, we disclose it
because we believe it is the most appropriate measure of Cooper's liquidity and
financial strength, particularly when calculated consistently over time.

In Cooper's case, cash flow per share is more informative than the more common
non-GAAP measure of liquidity called "earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation and amortization" (EBITDA) because, unlike most companies, Cooper
does not expect to pay federal income taxes until about 2007, when it expects to
exhaust the usage of its U.S. net operating loss carryforwards. Cooper has a
significant competitive advantage, as most companies expend a large portion of
their pretax profits on taxes. Readers should understand this and judge our
financial strength accordingly.


                                                                        Page 10

To calculate "cash flow per share," we add back non-cash charges for
depreciation and amortization to income before income taxes, and then divide the
result by the average number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per
share. In the tables below, we reconcile earnings per share (the closest GAAP
disclosure) to "cash flow per share" for all periods reported using the same
diluted per share figures.
