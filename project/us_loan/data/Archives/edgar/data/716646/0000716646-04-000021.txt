</b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">(a Delaware corporation)</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Adopted as of December 16, 2004</p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;</p>
</u>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><u>ARTICLE 1. Stockholders</u></p>

<p><a NAME="_Toc473617246">1.1 <u>Place of Meetings</u>.</a> All meetings of stockholders
shall be held at such place within or without the State of Delaware as may be designated
from time to time by the Board of Directors or the President or, if not so designated, at
the registered office of the corporation in Delaware.</p>

<p>1.2 <u>Annual Meeting</u>. The annual meeting of stockholders for the election of
directors and for the transaction of such other business as may properly be brought before
the meeting shall be held on the second Tuesday of September in each year, at a time and
place fixed by the Board of Directors or the President. If this date shall fall upon a
legal holiday at the place of the meeting, then such meeting shall be held on the next
succeeding business day at the same hour. If no annual meeting is held in accordance with
the foregoing provisions, the Board of Directors shall cause the meeting to be held as
soon thereafter as convenient. If no annual meeting is held in accordance with the
foregoing provisions, a special meeting may be held in lieu of the annual meeting, and any
action taken at that special meeting shall have the same effect as if it had been taken at
the annual meeting, and in such case all references in these By-Laws to the annual meeting
of the stockholders shall be deemed to refer to such special meeting.</p>

<p>1.3 <u>Special Meetings</u>. Special meetings of stockholders may be called at any time
by the President or by the Board of Directors. The business transacted at any special
meeting of stockholders shall be limited to matters relating to the purpose or purposes
stated in the notice of meeting.</p>

<p>1.4.1 <u>Notice of Meetings</u>. Except as otherwise provided by law, written notice of
any meeting of stockholders, whether annual or special, shall be given not less than 10
nor more than 60 days before the date of the meeting to each stockholder entitled to vote
at such meeting. The notices of all meetings shall state the place, date and hour of the
meeting. The notice of a special meeting shall state, in addition, the purpose or purposes
for which the meeting is called. If mailed, notice is given when deposited in the United
States mail, postage prepaid, directed to the stockholder at his address as it appears on
the records of the corporation.</p>

<p>1.4.2 Without limiting the manner by which notice otherwise may be given effectively to
stockholders, any notice to stockholders given by the corporation under any provision of
the law, the certificate of incorporation, or the By-Laws shall be effective if given by a
form of electronic transmission consented to by the stockholder to whom the notice is
given. Any such consent shall be revocable by the stockholder by written notice to the
corporation. Any such consent shall be deemed revoked if (1) the corporation is unable to
deliver by electronic transmission 2 consecutive notices given by the corporation in
accordance with such consent and (2) such inability becomes known to the secretary or an
assistant secretary of the corporation or to the transfer agent, or other person
responsible for the giving of notice; provided, however, the inadvertent failure to treat
such inability as a revocation shall not invalidate any meeting or other action. </p>

<p>1.4.3 Notice given pursuant to subsection 1.4.2 of this section shall be deemed given:
(1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a number at which the stockholder
has consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic
mail address at which the stockholder has consented to receive notice; (3) if by a posting
on an electronic network together with separate notice to the stockholder of such specific
posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate notice;
and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed to the stockholder.
An affidavit of the secretary or an assistant secretary or of the transfer agent or other
agent of the corporation that the notice has been given by a form of electronic
transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated
therein. </p>

<p>1.4.4 An &quot;electronic transmission&quot; means any form of communication, not
directly involving the physical transmission of paper, that creates a record that may be
retained, retrieved and reviewed by a recipient thereof, and that may be directly
reproduced in paper form by such a recipient through an automated process. </p>

<p>1.5 <u>Voting List</u>. The officer who has charge of the stock ledger of the
corporation shall prepare, at least 10 days before every meeting of stockholders, a
complete list of the stockholders entitled to vote at the meeting, arranged in
alphabetical order, and showing the address of each stockholder and the number of shares
registered in the name of each stockholder. Such list shall be open to the examination of
any stockholder, for any purpose germane to the meeting, during ordinary business hours,
for a period of at least 10 days prior to the meeting, at a place within the city where
the meeting is to be held. Such place shall be specified in the notice for the meeting.
The list shall also be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the
whole time of the meeting, and may be inspected by any stockholder who is present.</p>

<p><a NAME="_Toc473617251">1.6 <u>Quorum</u>.</a> Except as otherwise provided by law, the
Certificate of Incorporation or these By-Laws, the holders of a majority of the shares of
the capital stock of the corporation issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the
meeting (or if there are two or more classes of stock entitled to vote as separate
classes, then in the case of each such class, the holders of a majority of the shares of
such class issued and outstanding and entitled to vote at the meeting), present in person
or represented by proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of any business of
the corporation.</p>

<p><a NAME="_Toc473617252">1.7 <u>Adjournments</u>.</a> Any meeting of stockholders may be
adjourned to any other time and to any other place at which a meeting of stockholders may
be held under these By-Laws by the stockholders present or represented at the meeting and
entitled to vote, although less than a quorum, or, if no stockholder is present, any
officer entitled to preside at or to act as Secretary of such meeting. It shall not be
necessary to notify any stockholder of any adjournment of 30 days or less if the time and
place of the adjourned meeting are announced at the meeting at which adjournment is taken,
unless after the adjournment a new record date is fixed for the adjourned meeting. Notice
of the time and place shall be duly given to all shareholders of record and entitled to
vote at the adjourned meeting of any adjournment of more than 30 days. At the adjourned
meeting, the corporation may transact any business which might have been transacted at the
original meeting.</p>

<p><a NAME="_Toc473617253">1.8 <u>Voting and Proxies</u>.</a> Each stockholder shall have
one vote for each share of stock entitled to vote held of record by such stockholder and a
proportionate vote for each fractional share so held, unless otherwise provided in the
Certificate of Incorporation. Each stockholder of record entitled to vote at a meeting of
stockholders, or to express consent or dissent to corporate action in writing without a
meeting, may vote or express such consent or dissent in person or may authorize another
person or persons to vote or act for him or her by written proxy executed by the
stockholder or his authorized officer, director, employee or agent and delivered to the
Secretary of the corporation. No such proxy shall be voted or acted upon after three years
from the date of its execution, unless the proxy expressly provides for a longer period.</p>

<p><a NAME="_Toc473617254">1.9 <u>Nominations of Directors</u>. Nominations of candidates
for election as directors at any annual meeting of stockholders may be made (i) by, or at
the direction of, a majority of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any stockholder of
record entitled to vote at such annual meeting. Only persons nominated in accordance with
procedures set forth in this Section 1.9 shall be eligible for election as a director at
an annual meeting.</p>

<p>Nominations, other than those made by, or at the direction of, a majority of the Board
of Directors, shall be made pursuant to timely notice in writing to the Secretary of the
corporation as set forth in this Section 1.9. To be timely, a stockholder's notice shall
be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of the
corporation not later than ninety (90) days in advance of the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual meeting. Such stockholder's notice shall be set forth (i) as
to each person whom the stockholder proposes to nominate as a director (a) the name, age,
business address and residence address of such person, (b) the principal occupation or
employment of such person, (c) the class and number of shares of the corporation's equity
securities which are Beneficially Owned (as defined below) by such person on the date of
such stockholder notice and (d) and any other information relating to such person that
would be required to be disclosed pursuant to Regulation 13D under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the &quot;Exchange Act&quot;), in connection with the acquisition
of shares, and pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Exchange Act, in connection with the
solicitation of proxies with respect to nominees for election as directors, regardless of
whether such person is subject to the provisions of such regulations, including, but not
limited to, information required to be disclosed by Items 4(b) and 6 of Schedule A of
Regulation (as such Items are in effect on the date hereof and such additional information
as may be required by those provisions or successor provisions adopted after the date
thereof); and (ii) as to the stockholder giving the notice (a) the name and address, as
they appear on the corporation's books, of such stockholder and any other stockholder who
is a record or Beneficial Owner of any equity securities of the corporation and who is
known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominee(s) and (b) the class and number of
shares of the corporation's equity securities which are Beneficially Owned and owned of
record by such stockholder on the date of such stockholder notice and the number of shares
of the corporation's equity securities Beneficially Owned and owned of record by any
Person known by such stockholder to be supporting such nominee(s) on the date of such
stockholder notice. At the request of a majority of the Board of Directors any person
nominated by, or at the direction of, the Board of Directors for election as a director at
an annual meeting shall furnish to the Secretary of the corporation that information
required to be set forth in a stockholder's notice of nomination which pertains to the
nominee. Ballots bearing the names of all the persons who have been nominated for election
as directors at an annual meeting in accordance with procedures set forth in this Section
1.9 shall be provided for use at the annual meeting.</p>

<p>A majority of the directors may reject any nomination by a stockholder not timely made
in accordance with the requirements of this Section 1.9. If a majority of the directors
determines that the information provided in a stockholder's notice does not satisfy the
informational requirements of this Section 1.9 in any material respect, the Secretary of
the corporation shall promptly notify such stockholder of the deficiency in the notice.
The stockholder shall have an opportunity to cure the deficiency by providing additional
information to the Secretary within such period of time, not to exceed five (5) days, from
the date such deficiency notice is given to the stockholder, as a majority of the
directors shall reasonably determine. If the deficiency is not cured within such period,
or if a majority of the directors reasonably determine that the additional information
provided by the stockholder, together with the information previously provided, does not
satisfy the requirements of this Section 1.9 in any material respect, then a majority of
the directors may reject such stockholder's nomination. The Secretary of the corporation
shall notify a stockholder in writing whether his nomination has been made in accordance
with the time and informational requirements of this Section 1.9. Notwithstanding the
procedure set forth in this Section 1.9, if the majority of the directors does not make a
determination as to the validity of any nominations by a stockholder, the presiding
officer of the annual meeting shall determine and declare at the annual meeting whether a
nomination was not made in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.9. If the presiding
officer determines that a nomination was not made in accordance with the terms of this
Section 1.9, he shall so declare at the annual meeting and the defective nomination shall
be disregarded.</p>

<p>For the purposes of this Section 1.9 and Section 1.10, a person shall be considered the
&quot;Beneficial Owner&quot; of any security (whether or not owned of record):</p>

<p>(a) with respect to which such person or any affiliate or associate (as those terms are
defined under Rule 12b-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Exchange Act) of
such person directly or indirectly has or shares (i) voting power, including the power to
vote or to direct the voting of such securities and/or (ii) investment power, including
the power to dispose of or to direct the disposition of such security;</p>

<p>(b) which such person or any affiliate or associate of such person has (i) the right or
obligation to acquire (whether such right or obligation is exercisable immediately or only
after the passage of time) pursuant to any agreement, arrangement or understanding
(whether or not in writing) or upon the exercise of conversion rights, exchange rights,
warrants or options, or otherwise, and/or (ii) the right to vote pursuant to any
agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing and whether or not such
right is exercisable immediately or only after the passage of time); or</p>

<p>(c) which is Beneficially Owned within the meaning of (a) or (b) of this paragraph by
any other person with which such first-mentioned person or any of its affiliates or
associates has any agreement, arrangement or understanding (whether or not in writing),
with respect to (x) acquiring, holding, voting or disposing of such security or any
security convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for such security, or (y)
acquiring, holding or disposing of all or substantially all of the assets or businesses of
the corporation or a subsidiary of the corporation.</p>

<p>1.10 <u>New Business</u>. At the annual meeting of stockholders, only such new business
shall be conducted, and only such proposals shall be acted upon, as shall have been
brought before the annual meeting (a) by, or at the direction of, the majority of the
Board of Directors or (b) by any stockholder of the corporation who complies with the
notice procedures set forth in this Section 1.10. For the proposal to be properly brought
before an annual meeting by a stockholder, the stockholder must have given timely notice
thereof in writing to the Secretary of the corporation. To be timely, a stockholder's
notice must be delivered to, or mailed and received at, the principal executive offices of
the corporation not later than ninety (90) days in advance of the anniversary date of the
immediately preceding annual meeting. A stockholder's notice to the Secretary shall set
forth as to each matter the stockholder proposes to bring before the annual meeting (a) a
brief description of the proposal desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the
reasons for conducting such business at the annual meeting, (b) the name and address, as
they appear on the corporation's books, of the stockholder proposing such business and any
other stockholder who is the record or Beneficial Owner of any equity security of the
corporation known by such stockholder to be supporting such proposal, (c) the class and
number of shares of the corporation's equity securities which are Beneficially Owned and
owned of record by the stockholder giving the notice on the date of such stockholder
notice and by any other record or Beneficial Owners of the corporation's equity securities
known by such stockholder to be supporting such proposal on the date of such stockholder
notice, and (d) any financial or other interest of the stockholder in such proposal.</p>

<p>A majority of the directors may reject any stockholder proposal not timely made in
accordance with the terms of this Section 1.10. If a majority of the directors determine
that the information provided in a stockholder's notice does not satisfy the informational
requirements of this Section 1.10 in any material respect, the Secretary of the
corporation shall promptly notify such stockholder of the deficiency in the notice. The
stockholder shall have an opportunity to cure the deficiency by providing additional
information to the Secretary within such period of time, not to exceed five (5) days from
the date such deficiency notice is given to the stockholder, as the majority of the
directors shall reasonably determine. If the deficiency is not cured within such period,
or if the majority of the directors determines that the additional information provided by
the stockholder, together with information previously provided, does not satisfy the
requirements of this Section 1.10 in any material respect, then a majority of the
directors may reject such stockholder's proposal. The Secretary of the corporation shall
notify a stockholder in writing whether his or her proposal has been made in accordance
with the time and information requirements of this Section 1.10. Notwithstanding the
procedures set forth in this paragraph, if a majority of the directors does not make a
determination as to the validity of any stockholder proposal, the presiding officer of the
annual meeting shall determine and declare at the annual meeting whether the stockholder
proposal was made in accordance with the terms of this Section 1.10. If the presiding
officer determines that a stockholder proposal was not made in accordance with the terms
of this Section 1.10, he or she shall so declare at the annual meeting and any such
proposal shall not be acted upon at the annual meeting.</p>

<p>1.11 <u>Action at Meeting</u></a>. When a quorum is present at any meeting, the holders
of a majority of the stock present or represented and voting on a matter (or if there are

committee to consist of one or more of the directors of the corporation. The Board may
designate one or more directors as alternate members of any committee, who may replace any
absent or disqualified member at any meeting of the committee. In the absence or
disqualification of a member of a committee, the member or members of the committee
present at any meeting and not disqualified from voting, whether or not he or she or they
constitute a quorum, may unanimously appoint another member of the Board of Directors to
act at the meeting in the place of any such absent or disqualified member. Any such
committee, to the extent provided in the resolution of the Board of Directors and subject
to the provisions of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, shall have and
may exercise all the powers and authority of the Board of Directors in the management of
the business and affairs of the corporation, and may authorize the seal of the corporation
to be affixed to all papers which may require it; provided, however, that no such
committee shall have the power or authority (i) to approve or adopt, or recommend to the
stockholders, any action or matter expressly required by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware to be submitted to stockholders for approval or (ii) to amend or
repeal these By-Laws or to adopt any new by-laws. Each such committee shall keep minutes
and make such reports as the Board of Directors may from time to time request. Except as
