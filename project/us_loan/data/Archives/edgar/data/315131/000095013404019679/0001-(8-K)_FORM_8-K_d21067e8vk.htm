<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Form 8-K contains the Company&#146;s press release dated December&nbsp;16, 2004 announcing
departure of two directors, election of one director and appointment of a new vice president.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;OKLAHOMA CITY, OK&#150; PANHANDLE ROYALTY COMPANY (AMEX-PHX) today announced the
retirement of Board Chairman, Jerry Smith, Board Director, Michael Cawley and Vice President of
Land, Wanda Tucker. Chairman Smith will not stand for reelection to the Board and retire upon
completion of his term following the Annual Shareholder meeting, February&nbsp;25<SUP>th</SUP>, 2005.
Michael Cawley retired at the December&nbsp;16th, Board of Directors meeting. Wanda Tucker will retire
on December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jerry Smith was first elected a Director in February&nbsp;1987 and was elected Chairman of the
Board of Directors in February&nbsp;1997. His eighteen years as a director with the past eight being
chairman, have been the most active growth years in the Company&#146;s seventy-eight year existence.
During this period, there was a tenfold increase in revenue and even more in profit; fee mineral
ownership tripled; reserve value grew 700%; Company personnel tripled; and several acquisitions
were completed, including that of Wood Oil Company, which added about 60% to the Company&#146;s then
size. His plans are to spend much more time with his family and personal business interests.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Michael Cawley was elected a Director in December&nbsp;1991 and has served on the Compensation
Committee most of this thirteen-year period. He has been instrumental in establishing policies,
which allowed Panhandle to become a much more proactive company. He was also very instrumental and
supportive of the same activities and policies as Jerry Smith. Shortly after becoming a Director,
he was named President of the Noble


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Foundation, one of the larger non-profits in the country. His primary responsibilities with Noble
and its associated affiliates have grown considerably to where he needs more time for those
activities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wanda Tucker, Vice President of Land, has spent 261/2 years with the Company. She is the
Company&#146;s longest serving employee and officer. She was named Vice President in 1990. The Company
was a co-op when she was employed. She set up the Company Land Department and has seen its staff
grow four fold while mineral ownership increased from about 50,000 net acres to 260,000 net acres.
Leasehold went from none to 20,000 acres while producing wells increased from a few hundred to over
5,000. Her expertise in minerals management is a unique specialty that Panhandle has been
privileged to utilize in its continuing growth. She and her husband plan to enjoy retirement with
their family and friends with some golf.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>APPOINTMENTS</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has appointed Bruce M. Bell to fill the remaining two years of the
retiring Michael Cawley&#146;s term as Director. Dr.&nbsp;Bell received his PhD in Paleontology from the
University of Cincinnati in 1972 and has been employed by large oil companies and museums. For the
past several years, he has served as the CEO and Chairman of the Board of Southwestern Bank &#038; Trust
in Oklahoma City, Southwest Bankshares, Inc. of Oklahoma City and Post Oak Oil Company of Oklahoma
City. For the past seven years, he has been chairman of the Mid-Continent Oil &#038; Gas Association
and has been a member of the Interstate Oil &#038; Gas Compact Commission along with numerous other
professional and business association memberships and offices. He and his wife reside in Oklahoma
City.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors has approved the promotion of Ben Spriestersbach to Vice President of
Land effective January&nbsp;1, 2005. Mr.&nbsp;Spriestersbach holds a BS degree from Central Oklahoma State
University and has worked in the Petroleum Industry the past twenty-five years with various
companies. For the past three years, he has been Land Manager for Panhandle. Prior to Panhandle,
he was employed for eleven years as Secretary/Treasurer of Farmers Union Cooperative Royalty
Company. He belongs to local professional landman associations. His experience recently has been
in oil and gas law as it applies to contracts, oil &#038; gas property evaluation and computer
applications to land and minerals management. He and his wife and family make their home in
Oklahoma City.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>H W Peace II, Company President and CEO stated:</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Panhandle Royalty Company has been unusually fortunate to have directors and officers of
the quality experience and character exemplified by the three retirees. Jerry Smith and Mike
Cawley&#146;s advice and direction, together with the other Directors, in setting policy have
established the path, which Panhandle has and is now following. That path has been instrumental in
Company growth and success. We are extremely fortunate to have an individual of Bruce Bell&#146;s
caliber and experience joining the Board of Directors. He will bring to the Board a strong
background and knowledge in exploration and business interaction.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Wanda Tucker will be greatly missed for her background knowledge and history with the
Company. She was only one of three employees when originally hired in 1978. She was quite
instrumental in preparing contracts and documents along with negotiations for acquisitions from the
early New Mexico Osage purchase through many small acquisitions to the latest and largest merger of
Wood Oil Company into Panhandle in 2001. She created the land department, which has grown fourfold
over her tenure. We are extremely fortunate to have a manager such as Ben Spriestersbach to step
into Wanda&#146;s position. He not only has great experience in minerals management and negotiations
but also has a good knowledge of creating and utilizing computer applications in that field.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>Panhandle Royalty Company (AMEX-PHX) </B>is a publicly held diversified mineral holding company
engaged in the acquisition, ownership, management and development of its fee minerals. It actively
participates in the exploration, drilling, production and acquisition of hydrocarbons on internally
and externally generated prospects. Its stock is traded on the American Stock Exchange under the
symbol PHX. The Company&#146;s office is located in Oklahoma City while its mineral holdings and
production are situated in Oklahoma, New Mexico, Texas and 19 other states.
