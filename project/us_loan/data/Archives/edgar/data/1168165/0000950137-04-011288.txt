<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Section&nbsp;1 &#150; Registrant&#146;s Business and Operations.<BR>
Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2004, Exelon Corporation (&#147;Exelon&#148;) and Public Service Enterprise Group
Incorporated (&#147;PSEG&#148;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;).
Concurrently therewith, Exelon Generation Company, LLC (&#147;Generation&#148;) entered into an Operating
Services Contract with PSEG Nuclear LLC relating to the provision of operating services by
Generation in respect of PSEG&#146;s Salem and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations. In addition,
concurrently therewith, Exelon entered into a first amendment to its employment agreement with John
W. Rowe, Exelon&#146;s current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2004,
Exelon and PSEG filed in separate reports a joint press release dated
December&nbsp;20, 2004 announcing the execution of the Merger
Agreement (the &#147;Press Release&#148;). &nbsp;A copy
of the Press Release is incorporated herein by reference to
Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 of Exelon&#146;s Current Report on Form 8-K,
File No.&nbsp;1-16169, filed on December&nbsp;20, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Merger Agreement</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Merger Agreement provides for a business combination whereby PSEG will be merged with and into
Exelon, with Exelon surviving (the &#147;Merger&#148;). At the effective time of and as a result of the
Merger, (i)&nbsp;each share of PSEG common stock (other than shares owned by Exelon or PSEG) will be
converted into the right to receive 1.225 shares of Exelon common stock (the &#147;Exchange Ratio&#148;) and
(ii)&nbsp;each share of Exelon common stock will remain outstanding. All outstanding PSEG stock options
will be converted into options to purchase the number of shares of Exelon common stock determined
by multiplying (a)&nbsp;the number of shares of PSEG common stock subject to such stock option
immediately prior to the effective time by (b)&nbsp;the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share
of Exelon common stock equal to the exercise price per share of PSEG common stock under such stock
option immediately prior to the effective time divided by the Exchange Ratio.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Following the effective time of the Merger, the surviving corporation will have an eighteen-member
board of directors, which will include twelve Exelon directors and six new members nominated by
PSEG. John W. Rowe, the current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon, will become the
President and Chief Executive Officer of the surviving corporation.
E. James Ferland, the current Chairman, President and Chief
Executive Officer of PSEG, will become the non-executive Chairman of the Board of the surviving
corporation until his retirement on March&nbsp;31, 2007, at which time Mr.&nbsp;Rowe will become Chairman of
the surviving corporation.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Exelon and PSEG have made customary representations, warranties and covenants in the Merger
Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i)&nbsp;by PSEG not to
(a)&nbsp;solicit proposals relating to
alternative business combination transactions or (b)&nbsp;subject to certain exceptions, enter into
discussions concerning alternative business combination transactions, (ii)&nbsp;by Exelon and PSEG to
cause shareholder meetings to be held to consider approval of the Merger and related transactions,
(iii)&nbsp;subject to PSEG&#146;s right to terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal (as
described in the Merger Agreement), for the board of directors of PSEG to recommend adoption and
approval by PSEG&#146;s shareholders of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and (iv)&nbsp;for the
board of directors of Exelon to recommend approval by Exelon&#146;s shareholders of the issuance of
shares of Exelon contemplated by the Merger Agreement subject to Exelon&#146;s board of directors&#146; right
to change its recommendation as required by its fiduciary duties.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Consummation of the Merger is subject to various customary conditions, including the requisite
approval by the shareholders of Exelon and PSEG, respectively, no legal impediment to the Merger,
the receipt of required regulatory approvals, the absence of a material adverse effect on Exelon,
PSEG or, prospectively, the surviving corporation and the absence of certain specified burdensome
actions as a condition to the regulatory approvals for the Merger. The Merger Agreement contains
certain termination rights for both Exelon and PSEG, and further provides that, upon termination of
the Merger Agreement, a termination fee may be payable under specified circumstances including (i)
if Exelon enters into a definitive agreement to be acquired, it must pay PSEG a termination fee of
$400&nbsp;million plus PSEG&#146;s transaction expenses up to

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">$40&nbsp;million, (ii)&nbsp;if Exelon&#146;s board of
directors changes its recommendation, it must pay PSEG&#146;s
transactions expenses up to $40&nbsp;million
and (iii)&nbsp;if PSEG&#146;s board of directors changes its recommendation or if PSEG enters into a
definitive agreement for a superior proposal to be acquired it must pay Exelon a termination fee of
$400&nbsp;million plus Exelon&#146;s transaction expenses up to $40&nbsp;million.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Subsidiaries of Exelon and PSEG share ownership interests in certain nuclear facilities. Each of
the Salem Nuclear Generating Station, Units 1 and 2 is owned 57.41% by PSEG Nuclear LLC and 42.59%
by Generation. Each of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power Station, Units 2 and 3 is owned 50% by PSEG
Nuclear LLC and 50% by Generation. PSEG Nuclear LLC is the operator of the Salem Nuclear
Generating Station, Units 1 and 2, and Generation is the operator of the Peach Bottom Atomic Power
Station, Units 2 and 3.

Agreement is included herein as Exhibit&nbsp;2.1. &nbsp;The Merger Agreement is
incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Merger Agreement is qualified
in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Operating Services Contract</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Operating Services Contract provides that, commencing on January&nbsp;17, 2005, Generation will
provide a chief nuclear officer and other key personnel to oversee daily plant operations at the
Hope Creek and Salem nuclear generating stations and to implement the Exelon Nuclear Management
Model, which defines practices that Exelon has used to manage its own nuclear performance
improvement program. PSEG Nuclear LLC will continue as the license holder with exclusive legal
authority to operate and maintain the plants, will retain responsibility for management oversight
and will have full authority with respect to the marketing of its share of the output from the
facilities. Generation will be entitled to receive reimbursement of its costs in discharging its
obligations, an annual operating services fee and incentive fees based on attainment of goals
relating to safety, capacity factors of the plants and operation and maintenance expenses. The
Operating Services Contract has a term of two years, subject to earlier termination in certain
events upon prior notice, including any termination of the Merger Agreement. In the event of
termination, Generation will continue to provide services under the Operating Services Contract for
a transition period of at least 180&nbsp;days and up to two years at the election of PSEG Nuclear LLC.
This period may be further extended by PSEG Nuclear LLC for up to an additional 12&nbsp;months if PSEG
Nuclear LLC determines that additional time is necessary to complete required activities during the
transition period.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">A copy of the Operating Services Contract is included herein as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1. The Operating
Services Contract is incorporated herein by reference. The foregoing description of the Operating
Services Contract is qualified in its entirety by reference to the full text of the Operating
Services Contract.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>First Amendment to Employment Agreement</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2004, Exelon and John W. Rowe, the current Chairman, President and Chief Executive
Officer of Exelon, entered into a First Amendment (the &#147;Amendment&#148;) to Mr.&nbsp;Rowe&#146;s Amended and
Restated Employment Agreement dated as of November&nbsp;26, 2001 (the &#147;Original Employment Agreement&#148;).
The Amendment provides that, as of the consummation of the Merger, Mr.&nbsp;Rowe will continue to serve
as the surviving corporation&#146;s President and Chief Executive Officer but will not serve as Chairman. Mr.&nbsp;Rowe waives
his right to resign his employment for &#147;good reason&#148; or &#147;failure to appoint or elect&#148; as a result
of the Merger because of the change to his position or Mr.&nbsp;Ferland&#146;s appointment as Chairman;
provided that Mr.&nbsp;Rowe is reappointed as Chairman upon the earlier of April&nbsp;1, 2007 or the
resignation of Mr.&nbsp;E. James Ferland as Chairman and that the appointments and other matters
referred to above are on the terms and conditions specified in the Amended and Restated By-laws of
Exelon attached as Exhibit&nbsp;A to the Merger Agreement. Otherwise, the provisions of Mr.&nbsp;Rowe&#146;s
Original Employment Agreement remain in effect. If the Merger is not consummated, the Amendment
will automatically terminate and the Original Employment Agreement will remain in effect as if it
had not been amended by the Amendment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Except for the historical information contained herein, certain of the matters discussed in this
report constitute &#147;forward-looking statements&#148; within the meaning of the Securities Act of 1933 and
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, both as amended by the Private Securities Litigation Reform
Act of 1995. These forward-looking statements include statements regarding benefits of the
proposed merger, integration plans, and expected synergies, anticipated future financial and
operating performance and results, including estimates for growth. These statements are based on
the current expectations of management of the Exelon Registrants, and the current expectations of
management of PSEG, Public Service Electric and Gas Company (&#147;PSE&#038;G&#148;), PSEG Power LLC (&#147;PSEG
Power&#148;), and PSEG Energy Holdings LLC (&#147;PSEG Holdings&#148; and together with PSEG, PSE&#038;G and PSEG
Power, the &#147;PSEG Registrants&#148;). There are a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause
actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking statements included in this report.
For example, (1)&nbsp;the companies may be unable to obtain shareholder approvals required for the
merger; (2)&nbsp;the companies may be unable to obtain regulatory approvals required for the merger, or
required regulatory approvals may delay the merger or result in the imposition of conditions that
could have a material adverse effect on the combined company or cause the companies to abandon the
merger; (3)&nbsp;conditions to the closing of the merger may not be satisfied; (4)&nbsp;an unsolicited offer
of another company to acquire assets or capital stock of Exelon or PSEG could interfere with the
merger; (5)&nbsp;problems may arise in successfully integrating the businesses of the companies, which
may result in the combined company not operating as effectively and efficiently as expected; (6)
the combined company may be unable to achieve cost-cutting synergies or it may take longer than
expected to achieve those synergies; (7)&nbsp;the merger may involve unexpected costs or unexpected
liabilities, or the effects of purchase accounting may be different from the companies&#146;
expectations; (8)&nbsp;the credit ratings of the combined company or its subsidiaries may be different
from what the companies expect; (9)&nbsp;the businesses of the companies may suffer as a result of
uncertainty surrounding the merger; (10)&nbsp;the companies may experience more difficulties than
expected in achieving operating improvements at jointly owned nuclear generating facilities; (11)
the companies may not realize the values expected to be obtained for properties expected or
required to be divested; (12)&nbsp;the industry may be subject to future regulatory or legislative
actions that could adversely affect the companies; and (13)&nbsp;the companies may be adversely affected
by other economic, business, and/or competitive factors. Other unknown or unpredictable factors
could also have material adverse effects on future results, performance or achievements of the
combined company. A discussion of some of these other important factors and assumptions is
contained in the Exelon Registrants&#146; and PSEG Registrants&#146; respective filings with the SEC,
including: (1)&nbsp;the Exelon Registrants&#146; 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#150; Item&nbsp;7. Management&#146;s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#150; Business Outlook and the
Challenges in Managing Our Business for Each of Exelon, ComEd, PECO and Generation; (2)&nbsp;the Exelon
Registrants&#146; 2003 Annual Report on Form 10-K &#150; Item&nbsp;8. Financial Statements and Supplementary Data:
Exelon &#150; Note 19, ComEd &#150; Note 15, PECO &#150; Note 14 and Generation &#150; Note 13; and (3)&nbsp;the PSEG
Registrants&#146; Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended September&nbsp;30, 2004 &#150;
Forward Looking Statements. These risks, as well as other risks associated with the merger, will
be more fully discussed in the joint proxy statement/prospectus that will be included in the
Registration Statement on Form S-4 that Exelon will file with the SEC in connection with the
proposed merger. In light of these risks, uncertainties, assumptions and factors, the
forward-looking events discussed in this report may not occur. Readers are cautioned not to place
undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date of this report.
None of the Exelon Registrants or PSEG Registrants undertakes any obligation to publicly release
any revision to its forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of
this report.

given to any person under the provisions of the Business Corporation Law or by

the shareholder provides the corporation with a current address, the
corporation shall recommence sending notices and other communications to the
shareholder in the manner provided by these bylaws.

a.m., Eastern Daylight Time on the fourth Wednesday in April of each year or,
if such Wednesday is a legal holiday in the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania or in

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;General Rule. A meeting of the shareholders of the corporation duly

is present. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of the Preferred Stock,
the presence of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes
that all shareholders are entitled to cast on a particular matter to be acted
upon at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the purposes of consideration
and action on the matter. Shares of the corporation owned, directly or
indirectly, by it shall not be counted in determining the total number of
outstanding shares for quorum purposes at any given time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Withdrawal of a Quorum. The shareholders present at a duly organized
meeting can continue to do business until adjournment notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

who attend a meeting of shareholders that has been previously adjourned for one
or more periods aggregating at least 15 calendar days because of an absence of

shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting upon any
matter set forth in the notice of the meeting if the notice states that those
shareholders who attend the adjourned meeting shall nevertheless constitute a

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.05 Action by Shareholders.

taken by vote of the shareholders of the corporation, it shall be authorized
upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all
shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to
vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class, in each case at
a duly organized meeting of shareholders. Except as otherwise provided in the
terms of the Preferred Stock or when acting by unanimous consent to remove a
director or directors, the shareholders of the corporation may act only at a
duly organized meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Conduct of Business. Only such business will be conducted at an annual

a shareholder, the shareholder must have given to the secretary of the
corporation timely written notice of the shareholder&#146;s intention to make
a proposal, in the manner and form prescribed herein.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To be timely, a shareholder&#146;s notice with respect to an

meeting (A)&nbsp;a description in reasonable detail of the business
desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for

shareholder proposing such business and of the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (C)&nbsp;the class and number
of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of
record by the shareholder proposing such business and by the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, and

bylaws, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange
Act&#148;) and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section. For purposes of this Section,

Economic Services or in a document publicly filed by the
corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Section&nbsp;13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or publicly filed by
the corporation with any national securities exchange or quotation
service through which the corporation&#146;s stock is listed or traded,

Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of the date of the annual
meeting is required for the advance notice provision of this
Section&nbsp;3.05 (b)&nbsp;to be effective if the annual meeting is held on
such date as specified in Section&nbsp;3.02 of these bylaws. Nothing in
this Section will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to
request inclusion of proposals in the corporation&#146;s proxy statement
pursuant to Rule&nbsp;14a-8 under the Exchange Act.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business may be
conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be
properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i)&nbsp;specified

action of the Whole Board, one of the following officers present in the order
stated: The president, if there be one, the vice presidents in their order of
rank and seniority shall act as &#147;presiding officer&#148; of the meeting. The term
&#147;presiding officer&#148; means an officer who presides over a meeting of
shareholders. The secretary or, in the absence of the secretary, an assistant
secretary, or, in the absence of both the secretary and assistant secretaries,
a person appointed by the presiding officer of the meeting, shall act as
secretary of the meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Rules of Conduct. Unless otherwise determined by the board of
directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of
shareholders will determine the order of business and have the authority to
make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as
such presiding officer deems necessary, appropriate or convenient for the
proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an

accept as the vote of all shares represented thereby the vote cast by a
majority of them and, if a majority of the proxies cannot agree whether
the shares represented shall be voted, or upon the manner of voting the shares, the voting of the shares shall be divided equally among those
persons.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Form of Proxy. Every proxy shall be in a form approved by the
secretary of the corporation or as otherwise provided by the Business
Corporation Law.

revocable at will, notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the
proxy to the contrary, but the revocation of a proxy shall not be effective
until written notice thereof has been given to the secretary of the
corporation. An unrevoked proxy shall not be valid after three years from the
date of its execution unless a longer time is expressly provided therein. A
proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless,
before the vote is counted or the authority is exercised, written notice of the
death or incapacity is given to the secretary of the corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Expenses. The corporation shall pay the reasonable expenses of
solicitation of votes or proxies of shareholders by or on behalf of the board
of directors or its nominees for election to the board, including solicitation
by professional proxy solicitors and otherwise.

standing in the name of a trustee or other fiduciary and shares held by an
assignee for the benefit of creditors or by a receiver may be voted by the
trustee, fiduciary, assignee or receiver. A shareholder whose shares are
pledged shall be entitled to vote the shares until the shares have been
transferred into the name of the pledgee, or a nominee of the pledgee, but
nothing in this Section shall affect the validity of a proxy given to a pledgee
or nominee.

for profit or not-for-profit that is a shareholder of this corporation may vote
at meetings of shareholders of this corporation by any of its officers or

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that, as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an
&#147;affiliate&#148; of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, a New Jersey
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), as such term is defined for purposes of paragraphs
(c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the Rules and Regulations (the &#147;Rules and
Regulations&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
December&nbsp;20, 2004 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to
time, the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), between the Company and Exelon Corporation, a
Pennsylvania corporation (&#147;Parent&#148;), the Company will be merged with and into
Parent (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Shares pursuant to the
Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that
since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Merger
Agreement is submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company, my ability
to sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares that I receive in exchange for
any shares of Common Stock, no par value per share, of the Company (&#147;Company
Common Stock&#148;) pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale,
assignment or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
from such registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are
limited and I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions
of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to
the sale of such Parent Shares of Rules&nbsp;144 and 145(d) promulgated under the
Securities Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with Parent that I will not
sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares except (i)&nbsp;pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;by a sale made in
conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule&nbsp;145 (and otherwise in
accordance with Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of
Parent and if so required at the time) or (iii)&nbsp;in a transaction which, in the
opinion of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as
described in a &#147;no-action&#148; or interpretive letter from the Staff of the
Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be registered
under the Securities Act. In the event of a sale of Parent Shares pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;145, I will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in
the form of customary seller&#146;s and broker&#146;s Rule&nbsp;145 representation letters or
as Parent may otherwise reasonably request.

assignment, transfer or other disposition of Parent Shares by me or on my

to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as
a result of the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on
certificates representing Parent Shares delivered to me or held by a transferee
thereof, which legends will be removed (i)&nbsp;by delivery of substitute

opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to

a sale of Parent Shares which has been registered under the Securities Act or
made in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145.

the Parent Shares not to register the transfer of any Parent Shares held by me
unless any such transfer is made in accordance with this letter agreement.

that I am such an affiliate on or after the date of this letter.

scopes of responsibilities will be established from time to time by mutual
agreement of PS and Exelon. The individuals assigned to fill such positions
shall be selected by Exelon, subject to PS&#146;s right to approve such selections,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Parties anticipate that
one of the individuals providing On-Site Operating Services will be designated
