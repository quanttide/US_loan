<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Marketable securities consist of
investments in equity of publicly traded and non-public domestic companies and are stated
at market value based on the most recently traded price of these securities at September
30, 2004.&nbsp; All marketable securities are classified as available for sale at
September 30, 2004. Unrealized gains and losses, determined by the difference between
historical purchase price and the market value at each balance sheet date, are recorded as
a component of Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income in Stockholders&#146; Equity.
Realized gains and losses are determined by the difference between historical purchase
price and gross proceeds received when the marketable securities are sold. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Transactions and balances originally
denominated in U.S. dollars are presented at their original amounts. Transactions and
balances in other currencies are converted into U.S. dollars in accordance with Statement
of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 52, &#147;Foreign Currency Translation,&#148;
and are included in determining net income or loss. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>For foreign operations with the local
currency as the functional currency, assets and liabilities are translated from the local
currencies into U.S. dollars at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Revenues and expenses are translated at weighted average exchange rates for the period to
approximate translation at the exchange rates prevailing at the dates those elements are
recognized in the financial statements. Translation adjustments resulting from the process
of translating the local currency financial statements into U.S. dollars are included in
determining comprehensive loss. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The reporting currency is the U.S.
dollar. The functional currency of the Company is the local currency. The financial
statements are translated into United States dollars using year-end rates of exchange for
assets and liabilities, and average rates of exchange for the period for revenues, costs,
and expenses. Net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are
included in the statements of operations and were not material during the periods
presented because the Chinese dollar (RMB) fluctuates with the United States dollar. The
cumulative translation adjustment and effect of exchange rate changes on cash at September
30, 2004 was not material. </FONT></P>

assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. An
audit includes examining on a test basis, evidence supporting the amount and disclosures
in the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion. </FONT></P>
