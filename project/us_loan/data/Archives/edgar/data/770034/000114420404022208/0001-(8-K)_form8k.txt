ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         See Item 5.02 below for a description of the agreement.

ITEM 3.02  SALE OF UNREGISTERED SECURITIES

         On December 20, 2004, Advance Display Technologies, Inc. (the
"Company") entered into an employment agreement with one of its directors
whereby it agreed to issue 6,000,000 shares on an installment basis of its
Series D Preferred Stock. See Item 5.02 below for a description of the
transaction. The offer and sale of the Series D Preferred Stock, and the
underlying shares of Common Stock into which the Series D are convertible, were
exempt from registration under the Securities Act of 1933 (the "Act") as a
private offering to an "accredited investor" under Sections 4(2) and 4(6) of the
Act and Rules 505 and 506 of Regulation D thereunder.

ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS;
APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS

         On December 20, 2004, the Company entered into an Executive Employment
Agreement dated December 1, 2004, with John W. Temple, one of the Company's
Directors, appointing him as Executive Vice President of Sales and Marketing for
a three year term and thereafter on a month to month basis. The Agreement also
provides that Mr. Temple will cause all pending or future business previously
conducted by him to inure to the benefit of the Company. Mr. Temple has
previously provided technical services, marketing services, business consulting
services and the sales of large screen electronic displays for and to various
clients worldwide. The principal business of the Company is screen displays. In
addition, the Agreement provides that Mr. Temple will be granted 6,000,000
shares of the Company's Series D Convertible Preferred Stock (the "Shares"),
1,000,000 Shares effective December 1, 2004, and 500,000 Shares each month
thereafter until fully granted. The number of Shares granted are subject to
reduction, including the first installment, based on net sales revenues
generated by Mr. Temple for the Company through December 31, 2005 as described
in the Agreement. Also, if approved by the Company's Compensation Committee at a
meeting to be held in January 2005, Mr. Temple will be granted options to
purchase 1,680,000 shares of the Company's Common Stock exercisable at $0.03 per
share vesting at the rate of 120,000 shares every three months beginning April
1, 2005. Mr. Temple is entitled to receive sales incentives equal to 3% of the
gross sales revenues directly generated by his sales efforts or his outside
sales network, less any outside sales commissions, finder's fees, or other sales
incentives paid to third parties (including commissions or sales incentives paid
to any inside sales force of the Company). The payment of the sales incentive
will terminate on the earlier of the vesting of the 6,000,000 shares of Series D
Preferred Stock or December 31, 2004.

         Mr. Temple's employment is subject to a probationary period through
February 28, 2005 during which time the Company's Directors, excluding Mr.
Temple, will evaluate the benefits generated by him to the Company and the value
of certain intangible assets to be contributed by him to the Company. If during
the probationary period, the Board determines that Mr. Temple is unfit in any
manner to continue his employment, the Company will return to Mr. Temple all
sales commission revenues received by it on account of his efforts and sales of
certain licensed technologies, less all commissions paid to Mr. Temple or
others, all salaries and benefits paid to him, expenses, and all costs of sales
and other direct sales expenses of the Company incurred in connection with those
sales revenues. Mr. Temple would also be required to return all stock
compensation and stock options granted to him and the Company would be required
to return the contributed intangible assets it possessed at the time of
termination. Upon completion of the probationary period, Mr. Temple and the
Company will enter into a definitive licensing agreement granting the Company an
exclusive and perpetual worldwide license for all Mr. Temple's prior inventions
and intellectual property for which Mr. Temple will receive royalties.

         If the Company terminates Mr. Temple's employment for death, disability
or cause, as defined in the Agreement, he or his estate or beneficiary, as the
case may be, will receive his pro rata salary through the date of such
termination but not any individual bonuses or individual incentive compensation
not yet due to Mr. Temple at the date of such termination. In the case of an
involuntary termination, death or disability, Mr. Temple is entitled to receive
a pro rata annual incentive payment through the date of such termination and he
shall become fully vested in specific grants or awards made or awarded under a
long term incentive plan maintained by the Company. If Mr. Temple terminates his
employment relationship with the Company he will be entitled to his pro rata
salary through the date of termination, but he will not be entitled to any
individual bonuses or individual compensation. If Mr. Temple's employment is
terminated by the Board without cause after the probationary period and prior to
the end of the initial three year term, an involuntary termination, he is
entitled to receive 125% of his then monthly base salary as if employment had
continued for the full term. Mr. Temple also agreed to certain non-competition
obligations until December 31, 2008 unless he is terminated prior to the end of
his probationary period.

         The Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated by
reference herein.
