1    The weighted average lives with respect to the Class C-B Certificates  will
     be calculated to 'Call' assuming the 10% optional  termination is exercised
     and all loans  pay down on their  initial  reset  date;  and to  'Maturity'
     assuming  all loans pay down on their  initial  reset  date;  in both cases
     assuming  the Pricing  Speed and  Assumptions  stated  above.  The weighted
     average  lives  with  respect  to  the  Group  7  Certificates  assumes  no
     application of cross-collateralization from Group 5 and Group 6.

2    The principal  windows with respect to the Class C-B  Certificates  will be
     calculated to 'Call' assuming the 10% optional termination is exercised and
     all loans pay down on their initial reset date; and to 'Maturity'  assuming
     all loans pay down on their initial reset date; in both cases  assuming the
     Pricing  Speed and  Assumptions  stated above.  The  principal  window with
     respect   to  the  Group  7   Certificates   assumes  no   application   of
     cross-collateralization from Group 5 and Group 6.

3    Based on weighted average  information on the assumed  collateral as of the
     Cut-off Date.

4    The Group 7 Subordinate  Certificates and the Class C-B Certificates  (each
     as defined  herein,  and other than the Class  C-B-6  Certificates)  may be
     rated by one or more rating agencies.

5    The initial  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-1  Certificates is expected
     to be approximately  [TBD]% per annum.  After the first  distribution date,
     the per annum  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-1 Certificates will equal
     the least of (i) the sum of one-month LIBOR for that distribution date plus
     [TBD]%,  (ii)  the  related  group 7 net  funds  cap,  and  (iii)  [11.00]%
     (ACT/360,  0 day delay).  After the optional termination date for the group
     7A and group 7B  mortgage  loans the Class  7-M-1  certificate  margin will
     increase to [TBD]%.

6    The initial  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-2  Certificates is expected
     to be approximately  [TBD]% per annum.  After the first  distribution date,
     the per annum  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-2 Certificates will equal
     the least of (i) the sum of one-month LIBOR for that distribution date plus
     [TBD]%,  (ii)  the  related  group 7 net  funds  cap,  and  (iii)  [11.00]%
     (ACT/360,  0 day delay).  After the optional termination date for the group
     7A and group 7B  mortgage  loans the Class  7-M-2  certificate  margin will
     increase to [TBD]%.

7    The initial  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-3  Certificates is expected
     to be approximately  [TBD]% per annum.  After the first  distribution date,
     the per annum  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-3 Certificates will equal
     the least of (i) the sum of one-month LIBOR for that distribution date plus
     [TBD]%,  (ii)  the  related  group 7 net  funds  cap,  and  (iii)  [11.00]%
     (ACT/360,  0 day delay).  After the optional termination date for the group
     7A and group 7B  mortgage  loans the Class  7-M-3  certificate  margin will
     increase to [TBD]%.

8    The initial  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-4  Certificates is expected
     to be approximately  [TBD]% per annum.  After the first  distribution date,
     the per annum  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-4 Certificates will equal
     the least of (i) the sum of one-month LIBOR for that distribution date plus
     [TBD]%,  (ii)  the  related  group 7 net  funds  cap,  and  (iii)  [11.00]%
     (ACT/360,  0 day delay).  After the optional termination date for the group
     7A and group 7B  mortgage  loans the Class  7-M-4  certificate  margin will
     increase to [TBD]%.

9    The initial  pass-through rate on the Class C-B Certificates is expected to
     be approximately  [TBD]% per annum.  After the first distribution date, the
     per annum  pass-through  rate on the Class C-B Certificates  will equal the
     weighted  average of the net interest  rates on the group 1, group 2, group
     3, group 4, group 5 and group 6 mortgage  loans (less [0.02]% for the group
     5 and group 6 mortgage  loans),  as  further  described  in the  prospectus
     supplement (30/360 accrual basis, 24 day delay).

10   The Class P  Certificates  will receive  prepayment  penalty  premiums from
     certain mortgage loans. The Class P Certificates are not offered hereby.

     [TBD]%,  (ii)  the  related  group 7 net  funds  cap,  and  (iii)  [11.00]%
     (ACT/360,  0 day delay).  After the optional termination date for the group
     7A and group 7B  mortgage  loans the Class  7-M-2  certificate  margin will
     increase to [TBD]%.

7    The initial  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-3  Certificates is expected
     to be approximately  [TBD]% per annum.  After the first  distribution date,
     the per annum  pass-through rate on the Class 7-M-3 Certificates will equal

     the least of (i) the sum of one-month LIBOR for that distribution date plus
     [TBD]%,  (ii)  the  related  group 7 net  funds  cap,  and  (iii)  [11.00]%
     (ACT/360,  0 day delay).  After the optional termination date for the group
     7A and group 7B  mortgage  loans the Class  7-M-4  certificate  margin will
     increase to [TBD]%.

9    The initial  pass-through rate on the Class C-B Certificates is expected to
     be approximately  [TBD]% per annum.  After the first distribution date, the
     per annum  pass-through  rate on the Class C-B Certificates  will equal the
     weighted  average of the net interest  rates on the group 1, group 2, group
     3, group 4, group 5 and group 6 mortgage  loans (less [0.02]% for the group
     5 and group 6 mortgage  loans),  as  further  described  in the  prospectus
     supplement (30/360 accrual basis, 24 day delay).

10   The Class P  Certificates  will receive  prepayment  penalty  premiums from
     certain mortgage loans. The Class P Certificates are not offered hereby.

     Federal income tax consequences

          For federal  income tax purposes,  the depositor  will cause  multiple
          separate real estate mortgage  investment conduit ("REMIC")  elections
          to be made with respect to the trust  (exclusive of the assets held in
          the basis risk reserve fund). The Offered Certificates, other than the
          Class AR and Class AR-L  Certificates,  will  represent  ownership  of
          regular  interests in the upper tier REMIC.  These  certificates  will
          generally  be treated as  representing  ownership  of debt for federal
          income tax purposes. Holders of these certificates will be required to
          include as income all interest and original issue discount, if any, on
          such certificates in accordance with the accrual method of accounting,
          regardless of the certificateholders'  usual methods of accounting. In
          addition,  the  Group  7  Certificates,   other  than  the  Class  7-X
          Certificates,  will be treated  as having a right to  receive  certain
          payments from the related basis risk reserve fund.  For federal income
          tax purposes,  the Class AR-L Certificates will represent ownership of
          the residual interests in the lower-tier  REMICs,  which will hold the
          mortgage loans, and the Class AR Certificates will represent ownership
          of the residual interest in each remaining REMIC.

     Legal investment

          When  issued,  the Offered  Certificates,  other than the Class 7-M-2,
          Class 7-M-3,  Class 7-M-4,  Class C-B-2 and Class C-B-3  Certificates,
          will be "mortgage  related  securities"  for purposes of the Secondary
          Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984 ("SMMEA").  You should consult
          your legal  advisors  in  determining  whether  and to what extent the
          Offered Certificates constitute legal investments for you.

     Principal and interest advancing

          Each servicer (or if a servicer  fails to make an advance,  the master
          servicer),   will  make  cash  advances  with  respect  to  delinquent
          scheduled  payments of principal  and  interest on any  mortgage  loan
          serviced by it, to the extent they are deemed recoverable.

     Compensating interest

          Each  servicer  will  provide  compensating  interest  for  prepayment
          interest  shortfalls  only to the extent  described in the  prospectus
          supplement.

     Servicing transfer

          It is  anticipated  that on or about  March  1,  2005,  the  servicing
          function  for all or a portion of the mortgage  loans  serviced by SPS
          will  be   transferred   to  a  successor   servicer  that  meets  the
          requirements  of a successor  servicer  in the  pooling and  servicing
          agreement.

     SPS servicing risk

          Fairbanks  changed its name to "Select Portfolio  Servicing,  Inc." on
          June 30, 2004.

          SPS maintains an "Average" rating with a "Stable" outlook with S&amp;P and
          an "SQ3"  rating  with  Moody's.  Fitch has  given  SPS a  residential
          primary  servicer  rating for subprime and home equity of "RPS3-",  an
          Alt-A primary  servicer rating of "RPS3" and a special servicer rating
          of "RSS3".

          On May 18, 2004, the United States  District Court for the District of
          Massachusetts   entered  its  final  approval  of  the  settlement  of
          approximately  40 putative  class action cases and made  permanent its
          December  10,  2003  injunction  that has the  effect of  staying  all
          litigation  against  SPS  relating  to  the  claims  addressed  by the
          settlement  agreement.   The  injunction  excludes  counterclaims  and
          defenses  that might  arise out of  foreclosure  proceedings  that SPS
          initiates and individuals who excluded  themselves from the settlement
          to pursue  individual claims for relief.  The settlement  contemplates
          that  plaintiff's  redress would come, in part,  from the redress fund
          established in connection  with SPS'  settlement  with the FTC and HUD
          described below.

          On May 5, 2004, a West Virginia state court entered an order approving
          a settlement  between SPS and plaintiffs in a putative class action in
          which plaintiffs  alleging certain of SPS' fees violated provisions of
          the West  Virginia  Code  sought an  injunction,  declaratory  relief,
          actual damages,  civil penalties,  punitive damages,  attorneys' fees,
          and other relief from SPS.  Under the  settlement,  SPS may resume its
          previously enjoined foreclosure  activities in West Virginia,  subject
          to  compliance  with  applicable  law.  The  settlement  requires  the
          approximately 200 West Virginia loans that were in one of two specific
          categories  (i.e.,  real estate owned or foreclosure) as of January 7,
          2003  to  be   reviewed   by  a   three-person   panel,   including  a
          representative of SPS, to resolve any customer disputes that may exist
          regarding  charges assessed by SPS on such customer's  accounts and/or
          SPS' right to foreclose.  On May 13, 2004,  the West Virginia  Supreme
          Court  accepted a  petition  to certify  certain  questions  regarding
          foreclosure  procedure.  A hearing  will be held in late 2004,  which,
          depending on whether and how the Court  answers these  questions,  may
          impact the  activities  of SPS and other  servicers in that state with
          respect to foreclosures and loan workouts.


                                                                               7

                                   TERM SHEET


          On November 12, 2003,  SPS announced  that it had entered into a final
          settlement  agreement  with the FTC and HUD to resolve  issues  raised
          during  their  review  of  SPS'  servicing  practices.  As part of the
          settlement, SPS agreed to pay to the FTC the amount of $40 million for
          the  creation of a redress  fund for the benefit of  consumers  harmed
          allegedly by SPS and to implement  certain  practices on a prospective
          basis.

          SPS has  recently  entered  into consent  agreements  with  regulatory
          agencies in Florida,  Michigan,  Colorado and Illinois,  which provide
          for provisions similar to those contained in the consent order entered
          into with the FTC and HUD. While not admitting any liability in any of
          those agreements,  SPS agreed to refund certain amounts to Florida and
          Michigan consumers identified by the regulators in those states.

          SPS has  experienced an increased level of scrutiny from various state
          regulatory  agencies  and a few states  have  conducted  or  commenced
          formal  investigations.  A few agencies  have taken the position  that
          notwithstanding  the amount available under the FTC redress fund, such
          agencies  would seek to ensure  that the  consumers  residing in those
          states receive relief without regard to the relief available under the
          FTC redress fund. If those state regulatory  agencies persist in their
          desire to have amounts  paid to  consumers  who reside in those states
          regardless  of the  establishment  of the FTC redress  fund,  and such
          amounts in the aggregate are material, it is unlikely that SPS will be
          able to pay such amounts.  As a result,  those agencies might elect to
          bring  administrative  or other actions against SPS seeking to require
          refunds,  the imposition of monetary  penalties  and/or  revocation of
          SPS' licenses to conduct its servicing  activities in that state.  Due
          to this current and potential future adverse event, future income from
          SPS's operations may be impacted negatively.

          The  occurrence  of  one  or  more  of  the  foregoing   events  or  a
          determination by any court or regulatory agency that SPS' policies and
          procedures  do not comply  with  applicable  law could lead to further
          downgrades  by one  or  more  rating  agencies,  a  transfer  of  SPS'
          servicing  responsibilities,  increased  delinquencies on the mortgage
          loans  serviced  by  SPS,  delays  in  distributions  on  the  offered
          certificates,  losses on the offered certificates,  or any combination
          of these events. In addition,  such developments  could result in SPS'
          insolvency or bankruptcy,  and there can be no assurance, in the event
          of a bankruptcy proceeding,  that SPS could reorganize successfully in
          bankruptcy.

II.  CREDIT ENHANCEMENT (Groups 1 - 6)

     Subordination

          The  Group  1,  Group  2,  Group  3,  Group  4,  Group  5 and  Group 6
          Certificates  will receive  distributions  of interest  and  principal
          before   the  Class  C-B   Certificates   are   entitled   to  receive
          distributions  of interest or  principal.  The Class C-B  Certificates
          absorb most losses,  in reverse  order of principal  priority,  on the
          group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 mortgage  loans  prior to the Group 1, Group
          2, Group 3, Group 4, Group 5 and Group 6 Certificates.

          NOTE: The Class C-B Certificates  represent  interests in the group 1,
          2,  3,  4,  5  and 6  mortgage  loans;  consequently,  the  Class  C-B
          Certificates   could   be   reduced   to  zero  as  a   result   of  a
          disproportionate  amount of Realized  Losses on the mortgage  loans in
          any of these groups.

     Group 1 - 6 credit enhancement percentages

          For any certificate on any distribution date, the fraction,  expressed
          as a  percentage,  the  numerator of which is the sum of the aggregate
          class principal  balance of the  subordinate C-B  Certificates to that
          certificate after giving effect to payments on such distribution date,
          and the  denominator  of which is the aggregate loan group balance for
          group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 mortgage loans for such distribution date.

          Initial Group 1-6 Credit Enhancement Percentages:

          -------------------------------------------------
          *Based on collateral cut-off balance. Subject to a +/- 0.50% variance.

     Shifting of interests

          Except as  described  below,  the Group 1,  Group 2, Group 3, Group 4,
          Group 5 and  Group  6  Certificates  will  receive  100% of  principal
          prepayments  received on the mortgage  loans in the related loan group
          until the [seventh] anniversary of the first distribution date. During
          the next four years, the senior  certificates will generally receive a
          disproportionately   large,   but   decreasing,   share  of  principal
          prepayments.  This will  result in a quicker  return of  principal  to
          these senior certificates and increases the likelihood that holders of
          these  certificates will be paid the full amount of principal to which
          they are entitled.

          If the  subordinate  percentage  before the third  anniversary  of the
          first  distribution  date  is  greater  than or  equal  to  twice  the
          subordinate  percentage  as of the  closing  date (and  certain  other
          rating agency collateral performance requirements are satisfied), then
          the  subordinate  classes  will receive 50% of their pro rata share of
          principal  prepayments.  If the subordinate percentage on or after the
          third  anniversary of the first  distribution  date is greater than or
          equal to twice the subordinate  percentage as of the closing date (and
          certain  rating  agency   collateral   performance   requirements  are
          satisfied),  then the subordinate  classes will receive their pro rata
          share of principal prepayments.

     Cross-collateralization

          In certain  limited  circumstances,  principal and interest  collected
          from any of the loan group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6  mortgage  loans may be
          used to pay principal or interest, or both, to the senior certificates
          unrelated to that loan group.

     Coverage for excess losses

          The Class C-B  Certificates  will provide  limited  protection  to the
          classes of certificates of higher  relative  priority  against special
          hazard losses, bankruptcy losses and fraud losses in excess of certain
          amounts, as described in the prospectus supplement.

          Note: The Class C-B  Certificates  are allocated  losses from mortgage
          loans   in  loan   groups   1,  2,  3,  4,  5  and  6;   consequently,
          disproportionately  high special  hazard,  bankruptcy  or fraud losses
          experienced  by one loan group could  adversely  impact  protection to
          unrelated  Group 1,  Group 2,  Group 3,  Group 4,  Group 5 and Group 6
          Certificates for these types of losses.

     Available distribution amount

          For any  distribution  date and each of the  group 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6
          mortgage loans, the sum of: (i) scheduled payments and advances on the
          related  mortgage  loans,  net  of  related  servicing,  trustee,  and

          or by the special  servicer,  as provided in the pooling and servicing
          agreement,  net of advances  previously  made and other  amounts as to
          which the trustee, the trust  administrator,  a servicer or the master
          servicer is entitled to be reimbursed; (v) compensating interest; (vi)
          recoveries;  and (vii) any amount paid in connection  with an optional
          termination, up to the amount of the par value for the related group.

     Priority of distributions

          Distributions  will in general be made to the extent of the  available
          funds for the related loan group in the order and priority as follows:

          1.   First, to the related senior certificates,  pro-rata, accrued and
               unpaid interest at their respective  pass-through  rates on their
               respective class principal balances.

          2.   Second,  to the related senior  certificates,  as principal,  the
               related senior principal  distribution  amount as described below
               under the heading "Distributions of principal,"

          3.   Third, to each class of Class C-B Certificates, interest and then
               principal in increasing order of numerical class designation, and

          4.   Fourth,  to  the  Class  AR  or  Class  AR-L   Certificates,   as
               appropriate, the remainder (which is expected to be zero).

     Distribution of principal

          On  each  distribution  date,  an  amount  up to the  Group  1  senior
          principal  distribution  amount  for that  distribution  date  will be
          distributed  as principal  pro rata to the Class AR  Certificates  and
          Class  AR-L  Certificates   until  their  respective  class  principal
          balances   are   reduced  to  zero,   and  then  to  the  Class  1-A-1
          Certificates,  until its class  principal  balance has been reduced to
          zero.

          principal  distribution  amount  for that  distribution  date  will be
          distributed  as principal to the Class 5-A-1  Certificates,  until its
          class principal balance has been reduced to zero.

IV.  CREDIT ENHANCEMENT (Group 7)

     Overcollateralization

          The group 7A and group 7B mortgage  loans bear  interest each month in
          an amount  that in the  aggregate  is  expected  to exceed  the amount
          needed to pay monthly interest on the Group 7 Certificates and certain
          related trust  expenses.  This excess  interest will be applied to pay
          principal  on the  Group 7  Certificates  (other  than the  Class  7-X
          Certificates)  in order to create and maintain  the required  level of
          overcollateralization.  The overcollateralization will be available to
          absorb  losses  on the  group 7A and  group  7B  mortgage  loans.  The
          required level of overcollateralization  may increase or decrease over
          time. We cannot assure you that sufficient  interest will be generated
          by the group 7A and group 7B mortgage loans to create and maintain the
          required  level of  overcollateralization  or to absorb  losses on the
          group 7A and group 7B mortgage loans.

     Overcollateralization amount

          For any  distribution  date will be equal to the  amount,  if any,  by
          which  (x) the  aggregate  loan  balance  of the group 7A and group 7B
          mortgage  loans for such  distribution  date exceeds (y) the aggregate
          class  principal  balance  of the Group 7  Certificates  after  giving
          effect to payments on such distribution date.

     Initial overcollateralization

          As of the closing date, the overcollateralization amount will be equal
          to $[0.00].

     Targeted overcollateralization amount

          For any  distribution  date prior to the stepdown date,  approximately
          [0.50]%  of the  aggregate  loan  balance of the group 7A and group 7B
          mortgage loans as of the cut off date. For any distribution date on or
          after the stepdown  date and with respect to which a trigger  event is
          not in effect,  the  greater  of (a)  [1.00]%  of the  aggregate  loan
          balance  of  the  group  7A and  group  7B  mortgage  loans  for  such

     Trigger event

          A trigger event will occur for any distribution date if either (i) the
          average  of the  delinquency  rates  for each of the three (or one and
          two,  in  the  case  of  the  first  and  second  distribution  dates)
          immediately  preceding  months  as of the  last  day  of  the  related
          collection  period  equals or  exceeds  [TBD]% or (ii) the  cumulative
          realized losses as a percentage of the original  aggregate  collateral
          balance on the closing date for such distribution date is greater than
          the percentage set forth below:

          ----------------------------- --------------------------

     Delinquency rate

          With respect to any  distribution  date, the fraction,  expressed as a
          percentage,  the numerator of which is the  aggregate  loan balance of
          the group 7A and group 7B  mortgage  loans 60 or more days  delinquent
          (including  all  foreclosures  and REO  Properties) as of the close of
          business on the last day of such month,  and the  denominator of which
          is the  aggregate  loan  balance of the group 7A and group 7B mortgage
          loans as of the close of business on the last day of such month.

     Subordination

          The Group 7 Senior  Certificates will have a payment priority over the
          Group 7  Subordinate  Certificates.  Each class of Group 7 Subordinate
          Certificates  will be  subordinate  to each other class of subordinate
          certificates with a higher payment priority.

          Losses on the group 7A and group 7B mortgage  loans will first  reduce
          the    available    excess    interest    and    then    reduce    the
          overcollateralization  amount. If there is no overcollateralization at
          that time, losses on the mortgage loans will be allocated to the Group
          7 Subordinate Certificates,  in the reverse order of their priority of
          payment,  until  the  principal  amount  of all  classes  of  Group  7
          Subordinate Certificates are reduced to zero.

     Cross-collateralization

          In certain  limited  circumstances,  principal and interest  collected
          from any of the loan group 7A or group 7B  mortgage  loans may be used
          to pay  principal  or  interest,  or  both,  to  the  Group  7  Senior
          Certificates  unrelated to that loan group.  In addition,  each month,
          certain  monthly  interest  payments  equal to the  product  of a) one
          twelfth of 0.02% and b) the  preceding  Group 5 and Group 6 collateral
          balance  will  be  allocated  to  group  7  available  funds,  thereby
          increasing available excess interest.  These interest payments will be
          added  to the  group 7  available  funds  concurrently  with  interest
          distributions being made on the Group 5 and Group 6 Certificates.

                                                                              14

          For any  distribution  date and the related loan group, the sum of (i)
          scheduled interest payments (other than payaheads) and advances on the
          mortgage  loans in the related  loan group for the related  collection
          period,  the  interest  portion of payaheads  previously  received and

          interest  portion  of all  payoffs  (net of payoff  interest  for such
          distribution  date) and  curtailments  received on the mortgage  loans
          during the related prepayment period,  less (x) the applicable expense
          fees with respect to such mortgage loans and (y) unreimbursed advances
          and other amounts due to the master servicer,  the applicable servicer
          and the trust  administrator  with respect to such mortgage  loans, to
          the extent allocable to interest,  (ii) compensating  interest,  (iii)
          the portion of any substitution  adjustment  amount and purchase price
          paid with respect to such mortgage loans during the related collection
          period,  in each  case  allocable  to  interest  and  amounts  paid in
          connection  with an  optional  termination,  up to the  amount  of the
          interest portion of the par value for the related loan group, (iv) net
          liquidation proceeds (net of unreimbursed advances, servicing advances
          and other expenses,  to the extent  allocable to interest,  and unpaid
          expense  fees)  collected  with respect to the  mortgage  loans in the
          related loan group during the related collection period, to the extent
          allocable to interest and (v) excess interest  provided by Group 5 and
          Group  6 as  described  under  the  heading  "Cross-collateralization"
          above.

     Distributions of interest

          The  pass-through  rate for each class of Group 7 Certificates,  other
          than the Class 7-X  Certificates,  for each distribution date is a per
          annum  rate equal to the least of (i) the sum of the  one-month  LIBOR
          for that distribution date plus the related  certificate  margin, (ii)
          the applicable Group 7 net funds cap, and (iii) [11.00]%.

          The amount of interest payable on each distribution date in respect of
          each  class  of  Group  7  Certificates,  other  than  the  Class  7-X
          Certificates,  will  equal the sum of (1)  current  interest  for such
          class on such date and (2) any  carryforward  interest  for such class
          and date.

          On each  distribution  date, the interest  remittance  amount for such
          date will be paid in the following order of priority:

          (1) from the interest  remittance  amount for loan group 7A and 7B, to
          the  Group 7 Senior  Certificates,  pro rata  based  on  amounts  due,
          current interest and any carryforward interest for such class and such
          distribution date,  provided that (a) amounts distributed to the Class
          7-A-1-1  and Class  7-A-1-2  Certificates  will  reduce  the  interest
          remittance  amount  for loan  group 7A  before  any  reduction  to the
          interest  remittance  amount  for  loan  group 7B in  respect  of such
          distribution,   and  (b)  amounts   distributed  to  the  Class  7-A-2
          Certificates will reduce the interest remittance amount for loan group
          7B before any  reduction  to the interest  remittance  amount for loan
          group 7A in respect of such distributions;

          (2) first,  from the interest  remittance amount for loan group 7B and
          then from the interest  remittance amount for the loan group 7A to the
          Class  7-M-1  Certificates,  current  interest  and  any  carryforward
          interest for such class and such distribution date;

          (3) first, from the interest  remittance amount for loan group 7B and,
          then from the  interest  remittance  amount  for loan group 7A, to the

          interest for such class and such distribution date;

          (4) first,  from the interest  remittance amount for loan group 7B and
          then from the  interest  remittance  amount  for loan group 7A, to the
          Class  7-M-3  Certificates,  current  interest  and  any  carryforward
          interest for such class and such distribution date;

     Group 7 net funds caps

          The  annual   pass-through   rates  on  each  Class  of  the  Group  7
          Certificates  (other than the Class 7-X  Certificates)  are subject to
          the net funds caps.

          On any  distribution  date, the Group 7, 7A and 7B net funds caps will
          each equal (a) a fraction, expressed as a percentage, the numerator of
          which is the product of (1) the related  optimal  interest  remittance
          amount for such date and (2) 12, and the  denominator  of which is the
          aggregate  loan  balance of the  mortgage  loans in the  related  loan
          group(s) for the immediately  preceding  distribution date, multiplied
          by (b) a fraction, the numerator of which is 30 and the denominator of
          which  is the  actual  number  of  days in the  immediately  preceding
          accrual period.

          On any distribution  date, if the current interest rate (calculated on
          the basis of the  lesser of (x) one month  LIBOR  plus the  applicable
          certificate  margin and (y) the maximum interest rate) on any Class of
          Group 7  Certificates  (other  than the  Class  7-X  Certificates)  is
          limited by the related net funds cap, such  difference will constitute
          a basis risk shortfall.

          Schedules  of the Group 7, 7A and 7B net funds  caps are  included  in
          this document.

     [Group 7 interest rate caps]

          [On or before the closing date,  the trustee,  acting on behalf of the
          trust,  may enter into one or more interest rate cap  agreements  with
          [Credit Suisse First Boston International], as counterparty,  whereby,
          in  consideration  for a  one-time  payment  by the  trust  to the cap
          counterparty on the closing date, the cap  counterparty  will agree to
          make certain  payments,  as described  below, on each related interest
          rate cap agreement payment date. Payments under any such interest rate
          cap agreement  will be available to cover basis risk  shortfalls for a
          related class of Group 7 Senior  Certificates,  realized losses on the
          group 7 mortgage loans and deferred amounts on the Class 7-M-1,  Class
          7-M-2,  Class 7-M-3 and Class 7-M-4  Certificates.  The first and last
          payment dates for any such  interest rate cap agreement  will occur on
          the dates specified in the prospectus supplement.

          Under any such interest rate cap agreement,  the cap counterparty will
          agree to make  payments on each  payment  date equal to the product of
          (i) a fraction,  the  numerator of which is the actual  number of days
          elapsed since the  immediately  preceding  interest rate cap agreement
          payment date (or, in the case of the first interest rate cap agreement
          payment  date,  the closing  date)  through,  but not  including,  the
          current  interest  rate cap  agreement  payment  date,  subject to the
          "Modified  Following"  Business Day Convention  (within the meaning of
          the 2000 ISDA Definitions),  and the denominator of which is 360, (ii)
          a  notional  amount  (as set  forth  in the  related  annex  for  such
          scheduled  interest  rate cap  agreement  payment  date) and (iii) the

          Index Rate for such  period and (b) the  percentage  specified  in the

          set forth in the related  annex for such  interest  rate cap agreement
          payment date); provided,  that if the Index Rate is less than or equal
          to the applicable  cap strike rate,  then the payment amount due under
          the related interest rate cap agreement will be zero.  Generally,  the
          "Index Rate" will be the rate for one-month  deposits in U.S.  Dollars
          which appear on the Telerate  Page 3750 two London  banking days prior
          to the  first  day of the  related  accrual  period  for  the  related
          interest  rate cap  agreement  or, if such rate does not appear on the
          Telerate Page 3750,  the rate  determined  based on the rates at which
          one-month  deposits in U.S. Dollars are offered by the reference banks
          to prime banks in the London interbank market.

          Any  amounts  received  by the  trust  administrator  under  any  such
          interest  rate cap  agreement  will be deposited to a related  account
          established  by the trust  administrator.  Amounts  on  deposit in the
          related   interest  rate  cap  account  will  be  distributed  on  any
          distribution date to the related class of Group 7 Senior Certificates,
          in respect of any  applicable  Basis Risk  Shortfall,  prior to giving
          effect to any withdrawals  from the Group 7 Basis Risk Reserve Fund or
          from amounts  available to be paid in respect of Basis Risk Shortfalls
          as described  herein on such  distribution  date. On any  distribution
          date,  after payment of applicable Basis Risk Shortfall to the related
          class of Group 7 Senior Certificates, the pro rata share, based on the
          amount  remaining on deposit in the related  interest rate cap account
          as a  percentage  of the  aggregate  amount  remaining  in the related
          interest rate cap account and all other interest rate cap accounts, in
          each case after  payments in respect of Basis Risk  Shortfalls  on the
          related class of certificates,  of remaining amounts on deposit in the
          related  interest  rate  cap  account,  will  be  distributed  in  the
          following order of priority:

          (i) to the Principal  Remittance Amounts for loan groups 7A and 7B, up
          to the amount of such  Realized  Losses on the  mortgage  loans in the
          related loan group incurred during the related  Collection Period, any
          shortfall  to be  allocated  pro rata  based  upon the  amount of such
          Realized Losses applicable to each such loan group; and

          (ii) to the Class  7-M-1,  Class  7-M-2,  Class  7-M-3 and Class 7-M-4
          Certificates,  in that order, any applicable Deferred Amounts prior to
          giving  effect to amounts  available to be paid in respect of Deferred
          Amounts as described herein on such distribution date.

          Amounts paid under the related interest rate cap agreement not used on
          any  distribution  date to pay Basis Risk  Shortfalls  on the  related
          class of Group 7 Senior  Certificates,  Realized Losses on the group 7
          mortgage loans or Deferred  Amounts on the 7-M-1,  Class 7-M-2,  Class
          7-M-3 and Class  7-M-4  Certificates  will  remain on  deposit  in the
          related  interest  rate cap  account  and may be  available  on future
          distribution  dates to make the payments  described  in the  preceding
          paragraph;  provided,  however that such amounts will be paid into and
          distributed  out of a separate  trust created  pursuant to the pooling
          and servicing  agreement for the benefit of the Group 7  Certificates.
          However, at no time will the amount on deposit in the related interest
          rate cap account exceed the deposit amount.  The "deposit amount" will
          be  calculated  on each  distribution  date,  after  giving  effect to
          withdrawals  from  the  related  interest  rate  cap  account  on that
          distribution  date and  distributions  and allocation of losses on the
          certificates  on such  date,  and  will  equal  the  product  of (i) a
          fraction expressed as a percentage, the numerator of which is equal to
          the Class  Principal  Balance of the  related  class of Group 7 Senior
          Certificates after giving effect to distributions on such distribution
          date and the  denominator  of which  is equal to the  aggregate  Class
          Principal Balance of all other Group 7 Senior Certificates entitled to
          receive  payments  from an interest rate cap  agreement,  after giving
          effect  to  distributions  on such  distribution  date,  and  (ii) the
          excess, if any, of the Targeted  Overcollateralization Amount for such
          distribution  date  over  the  Overcollateralization  Amount  for such
          distribution date.

          Unless  terminated  earlier,  each interest  rate cap  agreement  will
          terminate on the date specified in the prospectus supplement. Both the
          trustee and the cap counterparty will have the right to terminate each
          interest  rate cap  agreement  for  certain  reasons  set forth in the
          documentation  associated  with  each  interest  rate  cap  agreement,
          including,  without limitation, the related ISDA Master Agreement, the
          Schedule  thereto and a  Confirmation  thereunder.  Although it is not
          anticipated  that there will be amounts payable by the trust,  certain
          amounts  may be payable  by the trust  under  each  interest  rate cap
          agreement  from funds  otherwise  distributable  to the holders of the
          certificates as a result of such termination.


                                                                              21

                                   TERM SHEET




     *The mortgage  loans have been  originated  under "full" or  "alternative,"
     "reduced  documentation,"  "stated  income/stated  assets" or "no income/no
     asset" programs. The "alternative," "reduced," "stated income/stated asset"
     and "no income/no asset" programs  generally require either  alternative or
     less  documentation  and verification than do full  documentation  programs
     which generally require standard Fannie  Mae/Freddie Mac approved forms for
     verification of  income/employment,  assets and certain payment  histories.
     Generally,  an "alternative"  documentation  program  requires  information
     regarding the mortgagor's  income (i.e.,  W-2 forms, tax returns and/or pay
     stubs)  and  assets  (i.e.,  bank  statements)  as does a "full  doc" loan,
     however,  alternative forms of standard  verifications are used. Generally,
     under both  "full" and  "alternative"  documentation  programs at least one
     year of income  documentation  is  provided.  Generally,  under a  "reduced
     documentation"  program,  either no  verification  of a mortgagor's  stated
     income is undertaken by the originator or no  verification of a mortgagor's
     assets is  undertaken  by the  originator.  Under a  "stated  income/stated
     assets"  program,  no  verification  of  either a  mortgagor's  income or a
     mortgagor's assets is undertaken by the originator although both income and
     assets are stated on the loan  application and a  "reasonableness  test" is
     applied.  Generally, under a "no income/no asset" program, the mortgagor is
     not  required  to state  his or her  income  or assets  and  therefore,  no
     verification  of such  mortgagor's  income or assets is  undertaken  by the
     originator. The underwriting for such mortgage loans may be based primarily
     or entirely on the estimated  value of the  mortgaged  property and the LTV
     ratio at origination as well as on the payment history and credit score.
