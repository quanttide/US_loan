ITEM 4.01 CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.

(a) Changing accountants.

      On December 22, 2004, Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust (the
"Trust") and Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (together with the Trust, the
"Company") replaced WithumSmith+Brown, P.C. ("WSB"), who was previously engaged
as the principal accountant to audit the Company's financial statements.

      The report issued by WSB on the financial statements for the period from
inception to June 30, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of
opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or
accounting principles.

      During the period from inception to June 30, 2004 and subsequent interim
periods through December 22, 2004, there were no disagreements between the
Company and WSB on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if
not resolved to the satisfaction of WSB would have caused it to make reference
to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its reports.
Furthermore, there were no "reportable events," as that term is used in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, for the period from inception to June 30, 2004
and the subsequent interim periods through December 22, 2004.

      The decision to change independent accountants was recommended and
approved by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

      On December 23, 2004, the Company provided a draft copy of the foregoing
disclosures to WSB and requested that WSB provide a letter addressed to the
Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether WSB agree with such
disclosures. The confirming letter from WSB is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1.

(b) New independent accountants.

      On December 22, 2004, the Company engaged KPMG LLP as the Company's new
independent registered public accountants to audit the Company's financial
statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2004 and 2005. The
appointment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 will be submitted to the
shareholders of the Trust for ratification at the 2005 Annual Meeting.

      Prior to the engagement of KPMG LLP, neither the Company nor anyone on the
Company's behalf consulted with KPMG LLP regarding the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements.

<PAGE>

the extent the Board of Directors of the Company deems it necessary or

any actions necessary to transfer any aspect of the ownership or control of the

and the Manager will comply with all such reasonable directions. In addition,
the Manager must at the Company's expense deliver to new management or the
Company any books or records held by the Manager under this Agreement and must
execute and deliver such instruments and do such things as may reasonably be
required to permit new management of the Company to effectively assume its
responsibilities.

                                    INDEMNITY

            Section 11.1 Indemnification of Manager. The Company and each
Managed Subsidiary, jointly and severally, agrees to indemnify the Manager, any
controlling person of the Manager, and each of their respective directors,
officers, employees, agents, Affiliates and representatives (each, an
"INDEMNIFIED PARTY") and hold each of them harmless against any and all losses,
(including lost profits) claims, damages, expenses or liabilities, joint or
several (collectively, "LIABILITIES"), to which the Indemnified Parties may
become liable, directly or indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this
Agreement, unless it is finally judicially determined that the Liabilities
resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless
disregard of duty of any Indemnified Party or fraudulent or dishonest acts of
such Indemnified Party. The Company and the Managed Subsidiaries further agree
to reimburse each Indemnified Party immediately upon request for all expenses
(including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) as they are incurred in
connection with the investigation of, preparation for, defense of, or providing
evidence in any action, claim, suit, proceeding or investigation, directly or
indirectly, arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or the Manager's
services hereunder, whether or not pending or threatened and whether or not any
Indemnified Party is a party to such proceeding. The Company and the Managed
Subsidiaries also agree that no Indemnified Party shall have any liability
(whether direct or indirect, in contract or tort or otherwise) to the Company,
the Managed Subsidiaries, or any person asserting claims on behalf of or in
right of the Company or the Managed Subsidiaries, directly or indirectly,
arising out of, or relating to, this Agreement or the Manager's services
thereunder, unless it is finally judicially determined that such Liability
resulted from the gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless
disregard of duty of such Indemnified Party or fraudulent or dishonest acts of
such Indemnified

                                       31
<PAGE>

Party. Moreover, in no event, regardless of the legal theory advanced, shall any
Indemnified Party be liable to the Company, the Managed Subsidiaries, or any
person asserting claims on behalf of or in the right of the Company or the
Managed Subsidiaries for any consequential, indirect, incidental or special
damages of any nature. In the event that an Indemnified Party is requested or
required to appear as a witness in any action brought by or on behalf of or
against the Company or the Managed Subsidiaries or any Affiliate of the Company
or the Managed Subsidiaries in which such Indemnified Party is not named as a
defendant, the Company and the Managed Subsidiaries agree to reimburse the
Manager for all expenses incurred by it in connection with such Indemnified
Party's appearing and preparing to appear as such a witness, including, without
limitation, the reasonable fees and disbursements of its legal counsel.

            The Company and the Managed Subsidiaries agree that, without the
Manager's prior written consent, they will not settle, compromise or consent to
the entry of any judgment in or otherwise seek to terminate any claim, action,
suit, proceeding or investigation in respect of which indemnification could be
sought hereunder (whether or not the Manager or any other Indemnified Party is
an actual or potential party to such claim, action, suit, proceeding or
investigation), unless (a) such settlement, compromise, consent or termination
includes an unconditional release of each Indemnified Party from any liabilities
arising out of such claim action, suit, proceeding or investigation and (b) the
parties agree that the terms of such settlement shall remain confidential.

            Section 11.2 Indemnification of Company. The Manager agrees to
indemnify the Company and the Trust and hold each of them harmless against any
Liabilities to the same extent as the foregoing indemnity from the Company and
the Managed Subsidiaries to the Manager, but only insofar as it is finally
judicially determined that the Liabilities arose out of or were based on the
gross negligence, willful misconduct, bad faith or reckless disregard of duty of
the Manager in the performance of its duties under this Agreement or its
fraudulent or dishonest acts.

            Section 11.3 Indemnification. The rights of the Indemnified Parties
referred to above shall be in addition to any rights that any Indemnified Party
may otherwise have. The indemnities referred to in this Article XI survive the
termination of this Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                     LIMITATION OF LIABILITY OF THE MANAGER

            Section 12.1 Limitation of Liability. The Manager shall not be
liable for, and the Company and the Managed Subsidiaries will not take any
action against the Manager to hold the Manager liable for, any error of judgment
or mistake of law or for any loss suffered by the Company and the Managed
Subsidiaries (including, without limitation, by reason of the purchase, sale or
retention of any security) in connection with the performance of the Manager's
duties under this Agreement, except for a loss resulting from gross negligence,
willful misconduct or bad faith on the part of the Manager in the performance of
its duties under this Agreement, or by reason of its reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties under this Agreement or its fraudulent or dishonest acts.

            Section 12.2 Manager May Rely. The Manager may take and may act
upon:

            (a) the opinion or advice of legal counsel, which may be in-house
      counsel to the Company or the Manager, any U.S.-based law firm of
      recognized standing, or other legal counsel reasonably acceptable to the
      Board of Directors of the Company, in relation to the interpretation of
      this Agreement or any other document (whether statutory or otherwise) or
      generally in connection with the Company;

            (b) advice, opinions, statements or information from bankers,
      accountants, auditors, valuation consultants and other persons consulted
      by the Manager who are in each case believed by the Manager in good faith
      to be expert in relation to the matters upon which they are consulted;

            (c) a document which the Manager believes in good faith to be the
      original or a copy of an appointment by a Member in respect of an LLC
      Interest or holder of a Trust Certificate in respect of a share of Trust
      Stock of a person to act as their agent for any purpose connected with the
      Company; and

            (d) any other document provided to the Manager in connection with
      the Company upon which it is reasonable for the Manager to rely;

and the Manager will not be liable for anything done, suffered or omitted by it
in good faith in reliance upon such opinion, advice, statement, information or
document.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                  LEGAL ACTIONS

            Section 13.1 Third Party Claims. (a) The Manager will notify the
Company promptly of any claim made by any third Party in relation to the assets
of the Company and will send to the Company any notice, claim, summons or writ
served on the Manager concerning the Company.

            (b) The Manager will not without the express written consent of the
Board of Directors of the Company purport to accept any claims or liabilities of
which it receives notification pursuant to Section 13.1(a) above on behalf of
the Company or any Managed Subsidiaries or make any settlement or compromise
with any third Party in respect of the Company.

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

            Section 14.1 Obligation of Good Faith; No Fiduciary Duties. The
Manager must perform its duties under this Agreement in good faith and for the
benefit of the Company. The relationship of the Manager to the Company and the
Managed Subsidiaries is as an independent contractor and nothing in this
Agreement shall be construed to impose on the Manager an express or implied
fiduciary duty.

the Manager under this Agreement.

            (b) The Manager must maintain management systems, policies,
procedures and internal contracts that reasonably ensure that the Manager
observes its duties and obligations under this Agreement.

            Section 14.3 Effect of Termination. Termination of this Agreement

balance of the compensation described in Article VII hereof earned prior to such
termination and for any additional period during which the Manager serves as
such for the Company or the Managed Subsidiaries or to receive reimbursement of
expenses pursuant to Article IX hereof, in each case subject to applicable law
or (ii) the obligations of the parties hereto under Sections 10.3 and 10.5.

            Section 14.4 Notices. Any notice under this Agreement shall be
sufficient in all respects if given in writing and delivered by commercial
courier providing proof of delivery or sent by facsimile and addressed as

            Section 2.03 Initial Issuance of Shares

            On April 13, 2004, the Sponsor issued to the Trust, as Member of the
Sponsor, one hundred (100) Sponsor Shares representing all of the issued and
outstanding Sponsor Shares as of such date. The then Regular Trustees
acknowledged receipt of such Sponsor Shares in trust from the Sponsor, which
constitute the Trust Property. In exchange for the Sponsor Shares, the then
Regular Trustees caused the Trust to issue one hundred (100) Shares of the Trust
to the Sponsor. At all times, the Trust will have outstanding the identical
number of Shares as the number of Sponsor Shares that have been issued and are
outstanding. At all times, the Sponsor Shares shall comprise the Trust Property.

            Section 2.04 Trust to Be Sole Member of Sponsor

            The Trust shall be the sole owner of the ownership interests of the
Sponsor represented by one hundred percent (100%) of the Sponsor Shares. For so
long as the Trust remains in existence, the Trust shall not sell or otherwise
transfer any of its Sponsor Shares to any Person. Every holder of Share
Certificates, by holding and receiving the same, agrees with the Trust to be
bound by the terms of this Agreement.

            Section 2.05 Authorized Shares

            The Trust shall be authorized to issue one class of Shares in an
aggregate amount of up to five hundred million (500,000,000) of such Shares. The
Trust is prohibited from issuing any other class of equity securities, any debt
securities or any derivative securities. The aggregate number of Shares that are
authorized may be increased from time to time by the Sponsor, by an amendment of
this Agreement upon the adoption of a resolution by the affirmative vote of at
least a majority of the Board of Directors declaring such amendment to be
advisable and the approval of such amendment by the affirmative vote of the
holders of a majority of the Shares present in person or represented by proxy at
a meeting of the Shareholders.

            Section 2.06 Issuance of Additional Shares

            The Sponsor shall have authority to authorize the issuance, from
time to time, of authorized but unissued Shares and cause the Trust to issue
such additional Shares in exchange for and upon receipt of an equal number of
Sponsor Shares. Upon the issuance of such additional Shares, the Regular Trustee
shall execute in accordance with Section 4.02 one or more Share Certificates in
certificated, fully registered form and shall deliver such Share Certificates to
the Transfer Agent. The Sponsor may sell or distribute the Shares in any manner,
subject to applicable law, that the Board of Directors in its sole discretion
deems appropriate and advisable.

            Section 2.07 Repurchase of Shares at Direction of the Sponsor

            (a) From time to time and at the direction of the Sponsor, acting
through the Board of Directors, the Trust shall conduct a capital reduction,
including the repurchase of any number of Shares issued and outstanding, on
similar terms to the capital reduction simultaneously conducted by the Sponsor
and shall ensure that an identical number of Sponsor Shares and Shares are
issued and outstanding at any one time.

<PAGE>

            (b) Any Shares tendered and repurchased by the Trust in accordance
with this Section 2.07 shall be deemed to be authorized and issued, but not
outstanding, and may subsequently be sold or transferred for due consideration.

            Section 2.08 Agreement of Trust

            The purposes of the Trust are to (i) issue Shares represented by the
Share Certificates, each such Share representing an undivided beneficial
interest in one underlying Sponsor Share owned by the Trust, in exchange for
Sponsor Shares, (ii) own the Sponsor Shares and (iii) engage in such other
activities as are set forth in this Agreement. Each person or entity in whose
name a Share is registered on the books of the Trust shall be a "beneficial
owner" within the meaning of the Delaware Statutory Trust Act. It is intended
that the Trust shall qualify as a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax
purposes; consistent with such treatment the Trustees shall have no power under
this Agreement to vary the investment of the beneficial owners of the Trust.
There shall be no implied duties or obligations of the Trustees hereunder. Any
action by the Trustees in accordance with their respective powers shall
constitute the act of and serve to bind the Trust. The Delaware Trustee shall be
a trustee for purposes of fulfilling the requirements of Section 3807 of the
Delaware Statutory Trust Act. Notwithstanding any other provision of this
Agreement, the Delaware Trustee shall not be entitled to exercise any of the
powers, nor shall the Delaware Trustee have any of the duties and
responsibilities, of the Regular Trustee, the Manager or the Board of Directors
described in this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
the Delaware Trustee shall not be liable for the acts or omissions of the Trust,
the Regular Trustee, the Manager or the Board of Directors.

            Section 2.09 Authorization to Enter into Certain Transactions

            (a) The Sponsor is hereby authorized and directed, on behalf of the

      case on behalf of the Trust, (a) a Registration Statement on Form S-1,

      including any pre-effective or post-effective amendments thereto, relating
      to the registration of the Shares under the Securities Act, and (b) as
      applicable, a Registration Statement on Form 8-A (a "1934 Act Registration
      Statement") (including any pre-effective or post-effective amendments
      thereto) relating to the registration of the Shares under Section 12(b) or
      (g) of the Exchange Act;

            (ii) to prepare and file with the New York Stock Exchange and/or any
      other exchange or quotation service and execute, in each case on behalf of
      the Trust, an application therewith and all other applications,
      statements, certificates, agreements and other instruments as shall be
      necessary or desirable to cause the Shares to be listed on the New York
      Stock Exchange and/or any other exchange or quotation service;

            (iii) to prepare and file and execute, in each case on behalf of the
      Trust, such applications, reports, surety bonds, irrevocable consents,
      appointments of attorney for service of process and other papers and
      documents as shall be necessary or desirable to

<PAGE>

      register the Shares under the securities or "blue sky" laws of such
      jurisdictions as the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, may deem necessary
      or desirable;

            (iv) to negotiate the terms of, and execute on behalf of the Trust,
      any underwriting agreements, purchase agreements or other agreements
      relating to the initial public offering or any future issuance of the
      Shares in exchange for Sponsor shares;

            (v) to execute and deliver, in each case on behalf of the Trust,
      such certifications or reports required by the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002
      from time to time as may be necessary or proper to the conduct of the
      business of the Trust; and

            (vi) to execute and deliver, in each case on behalf of the Trust,
      such agreements, instruments, certificates and documents, and to make
      filings with or representations on behalf of the Trust, to the City of
      Chicago as may be necessary in connection with the potential acquisition
      of Macquarie District Energy Holdings LLC.

            (b) It is hereby acknowledged and agreed that in connection with any
execution, filing or document referred to in clauses (i) - (vi) above, (A) the
Regular Trustee (or his or her attorneys-in-fact and agents or the Sponsor as
permitted herein) is authorized on behalf of the Trust to file and execute such
document on behalf of the Trust and (B) the Delaware Trustee shall not be
required to join in any such filing or execute on behalf of the Trust any such
document.

            Section 2.10 Title to Trust Property

            Legal title to all Trust Property shall be vested at all times in
the Trust and shall be held and administered by the Regular Trustee for the
benefit of the Trust and the Shareholders in accordance with this Agreement.
Each Shareholder shall not have legal title to any part of the Trust Property,
but shall have an undivided beneficial interest in the Sponsor Shares owned by
the Trust.

            Section 2.11 Certain Covenants of the Sponsor

            The Sponsor will use its best efforts, consistent with the terms and
provisions of this Agreement, to cause the Trust to remain classified as a
"grantor trust" for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

                                   ARTICLE III

                           DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

            Section 3.01 Dividends

            (a) The Regular Trustee shall distribute to the Shareholders all
distributions or dividends received by the Trust with respect to the Sponsor
Shares from the Sponsor within two (2) Business Days of receipt. Any such
distributions or dividends shall be allocated to Shareholders in the same
amounts as any such allocations were made per Sponsor Share by the Sponsor.

<PAGE>

            (b) Dividends or distributions on the Shares shall be payable to the
Shareholders thereof as they appear on the Share Register for the Shares on the
relevant record date.

            Section 3.02 Payment Procedures

            Payments of Dividends in respect of the Shares shall be made by (i)
check mailed to the address of the Person entitled thereto as such address shall
appear on the Share Register or (ii) wire transfer of immediately available
funds to an account maintained by the Person entitled thereto as specified in
the Share Register.

            Section 3.03 Tax Returns and Reports

            The Sponsor shall prepare (or cause to be prepared), at the
Sponsor's expense, and file or provide (or cause to be filed or provided) all
U.S. federal, state and local tax and information returns and reports required
to be filed or provided to Shareholders by or in respect of the Trust. In this
regard, the Sponsor shall (a) prepare and file (or cause to be prepared or
filed) Form 1041 or the appropriate Internal Revenue Service form required to be
filed in respect of the Trust in each taxable year of the Trust and (b) prepare
and furnish (or cause to be prepared and furnished) a tax information statement
or such other form or statement, if any, required to be furnished in respect of
the Trust in each taxable year of the Trust. The Sponsor shall use all
reasonable efforts to comply in all material respects with U.S. federal, state
and local withholding and backup withholding tax laws and information reporting
requirements with respect to any payments to Shareholders upon the Shares. To
the extent that the Trust is required to withhold and pay over any amounts to
any authority with respect to Dividends or allocations to any Shareholder, the
amount withheld shall be deemed to be a distribution in the amount of the
withholding to the Shareholder. In the event of any claimed over-withholding,
Shareholders shall be limited to an action against the applicable taxing
jurisdiction. If the amount required to be withheld was not withheld from actual
Dividends paid, the Trust must reduce subsequent Dividends by the amount of such
withholding (but not by the amount of any liability imposed on the Trust as
withholding agent).

                                   ARTICLE IV

appropriate and advisable.

            Section 4.02 Share Certificates

            The Share Certificates shall be issued substantially in the form of
Exhibit A hereto. Each Share Certificate shall bear a serial number, shall
exhibit the Shareholder's name and the number of Shares evidenced thereby and

the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were, at the time when
such signatures shall have been affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of the
Trust or the Transfer Agent or Registrar shall be validly issued and entitled to
the benefit of this Agreement, notwithstanding that such individuals or any of
them shall have ceased to be so authorized prior to the delivery of such Share
Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of delivery of such Share
Certificates. A transferee of a Share Certificate shall become a Shareholder,
and shall be entitled to the rights and subject to the obligations of a
Shareholder hereunder, upon due registration of such Share Certificate in such
transferee's name pursuant to Section 4.04.

            Section 4.03 Share Register

            The Sponsor shall retain the Transfer Agent to keep a register or

such capacity shall be known as the Registrar, in which shall be recorded the
name and address of each Person owning the Shares evidenced by each Share
Certificate evidencing Shares issued by the Trust, the number of Shares
evidenced by each such Share Certificate, the date of issuance thereof and, in
the case of cancellation, the date of cancellation. Except as otherwise
expressly required by law, the Person in whose name Shares stand on the Share
Register of the Trust shall be deemed the owner and Shareholder of record
thereof for all purposes.

            Section 4.04 Transfer of Shares

            Registration of transfers of Shares shall be made only in the Share
Register of the Trust upon request of the registered Shareholder of such Shares,
or of his attorney thereunto authorized by power of attorney duly executed and
filed with Registrar, and upon the surrender of the Share Certificate or Share
Certificates evidencing such Shares properly endorsed or accompanied by a stock
power duly executed, together with such proof of authenticity of signatures as
the Registrar may reasonably require. All Share Certificates surrendered for
transfer shall be cancelled before new Share Certificates for the transferred
Shares shall be issued. Upon surrender for registration of transfer, and
cancellation, of any Share Certificate, the Regular Trustee shall execute in the
name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Share
Certificates.

            Section 4.05 Mutilated, Lost, Destroyed or Stolen Share Certificates

            Each Shareholder of record of Shares shall promptly notify the Trust
of any mutilation, loss or destruction of any Share Certificate of which such
Shareholder is the recordholder. The Sponsor may, in its discretion, cause the
Transfer Agent to issue a new Share Certificate in place of any Share
Certificate theretofore issued by it and alleged to have been mutilated, lost,
stolen or destroyed, upon surrender of the mutilated Share Certificate or, in
the case of loss, theft or destruction of the Share Certificate, upon
satisfactory proof of such loss, theft or destruction, and the Sponsor may, in
its discretion, require the Shareholder of record of the Shares evidenced by the
lost, stolen or destroyed Share Certificate, or his legal representative, to
give the Transfer Agent a bond sufficient to indemnify the Transfer Agent
against any claim made against it on account of the alleged loss, theft or
destruction of any such Share Certificate or the issuance of such new Share
Certificate.

            Section 4.06 Rights of Shareholders

            The legal title to the Trust Property is vested exclusively in the
Trust in accordance with Section 2.10, and the Shareholders shall not have any
right or title therein other than the undivided beneficial interest in the
Sponsor Shares owned by the Trust conferred by their Shares and they shall have
no right to call for any partition or division of property, profits or rights of
the Trust except as described below. The Shares shall be personal property
giving only the rights specifically set forth therein and in this Agreement. The
Shares shall have no preemptive or similar rights and, when issued and delivered
to Shareholders against payment of the purchase price therefor and otherwise in
accordance with this Agreement, shall be deemed validly issued, fully paid and
nonassessable undivided beneficial interests in the Sponsor Shares owned by the
Trust. Shareholders, in their capacities as such, shall be entitled to the
benefits provided in this Agreement and to the same limitation of personal
liability extended to stockholders of private corporations for profit organized
under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware. Members of the Board
of Directors shall owe the same duties to Shareholders, in their capacities as
such, as they owe to the Trust, as Member of the Sponsor pursuant to the Sponsor
Agreement.

resolution of the Board of Directors.

            Section 5.02 Special Meetings of Shareholders

            Special meetings of Shareholders shall be held on such date, at such
time and at such place (if any) within or without the State of Delaware as shall
be designated from time to time by the Board of Directors and stated in the
notice of the meeting. Special meetings of Shareholders may be called at any
time only by the Secretary either at the direction of the Board of Directors
pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of
the Board.

            Section 5.03 Place of Meeting

            The Board of Directors may designate the place (if any) of meeting
for any meeting of Shareholders. If no designation is made by the Board of
Directors, the place of meeting shall be the principal office of the Sponsor. In
lieu of holding any meeting of Shareholders at a designated place, the Board of
Directors may, in its sole discretion, determine that any meeting of
Shareholders may be held solely by means of remote communication.

            Section 5.04 Notice of Meeting

            (a) A notice of meeting, stating the place (if any), day and hour of
the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which
Shareholders and proxy

<PAGE>

holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting, shall be
prepared and delivered by the Sponsor not less than twenty (20) days and not
more than sixty (60) days before the date of the meeting, either personally, by
mail or, to the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law,
electronically, to each Shareholder of record. In the case of special meetings,
the notice shall state the purpose or purposes for which such special meeting is
called. Such further notice shall be given as may be required by law. Only such
business shall be conducted at a special meeting of Shareholders as shall have
been brought before the meeting pursuant to the Trust's notice of meeting. Any
previously scheduled meeting of the Shareholders may be postponed, and (unless
this Agreement otherwise provides) any special meeting of the Shareholders may
be cancelled, by resolution of the Board of Directors upon public notice given
prior to the time previously scheduled for such meeting of Shareholders.

            (b) Notice to Shareholders shall be given personally, by mail or, to
the extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, electronically to each
Shareholder of record. If mailed, such notice shall be delivered by postage
prepaid envelope directed to each holder at such Shareholder's address as it
appears in the records of the Trust and shall be deemed given when deposited in
the United States mail. Notice given by electronic transmission pursuant to this
subsection shall be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when
directed to a facsimile telecommunication number at which the Shareholder has
consented to receive notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an
electronic mail address at which the Shareholder has consented to receive
notice; (3) if by posting on an electronic network together with separate notice
to the Shareholder of such specific posting, upon the later of (A) such posting
and (B) the giving of such separate notice; and (4) if by any other form of
electronic transmission, when directed to the Shareholder. An affidavit of the
Secretary or an assistant Secretary or of the Transfer Agent or other agent of
the Sponsor that the notice has been given by personal delivery, mail or a form
of electronic transmission shall, in the absence of fraud, be prima facie
evidence of the facts stated therein.

            (c) Notice of any meeting of Shareholders need not be given to any
Shareholder if waived by such Shareholder either in a writing signed by such
Shareholder or by electronic transmission, whether such waiver is given before
or after such meeting is held. If such a waiver is given by electronic
transmission, the electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted
with information from which it can be determined that the electronic
transmission was authorized by the Shareholder.

            (d) In order that the Trust may determine the Shareholders entitled
to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Shareholders or any adjournment
thereof, the Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall
not precede the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted
by the Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty
(60) or fewer than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record
date is fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining
Shareholders entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Shareholders or
any adjournment thereof shall be at the close of business on the day next
preceding the day on which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close
of business on the day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

            Section 5.05 Quorum and Adjournment

there is such a quorum. The Shareholders present at a duly organized meeting at
which a quorum is present in person or by proxy may continue to transact
business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal of enough
Shareholders to leave less than a quorum.

            When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, if any,
unless otherwise provided by this Agreement, notice need not be given of the
reconvened meeting if the date, time and place, if any, thereof and the means of
remote communication, if any, by which Shareholders and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such reconvened meeting are announced
at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the reconvened meeting, the
Shareholders may transact any business that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. A determination of Shareholders of record entitled to notice
of or to vote at a meeting of Shareholders shall apply to any adjournment of
such meeting; provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new
record date for the reconvened meeting. If an adjournment is for more than
thirty (30) days or if, after an adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the
reconvened meeting, a notice of the reconvened meeting shall be given to each
Shareholder entitled to vote at the meeting.

            Section 5.06 Voting

            (a) Subject to the provisions of this Section 5.06 and Section 5.07,
the Shareholders shall have the exclusive and absolute right to direct the
Regular Trustee with respect to voting of the Trust, as Member of the Sponsor,
with respect to the Sponsor Shares at all times during the term of the Trust.

            (b) When the Trust is required or permitted to vote with respect to
the Sponsor Shares, the Sponsor shall prepare and deliver to the Trustees the
form of proxy materials to enable the Regular Trustee to solicit from the
Shareholders the manner in which they direct the Regular Trustee to vote their
Shares. Shareholders shall be entitled to one vote for each Share in respect of
any matter as to which Members are entitled to vote as provided in the Sponsor
Agreement.

            (c) All Shares shall to the extent practicable under the
circumstances be voted or deemed to have been voted (to the extent that Shares
are not voted) in the same proportion as the Shares are directed to be voted by
the Shareholders, including for purposes of determining a quorum, in favor of,
in opposition to or abstaining from the matter. If such calculation of votes
would require a fractional vote, the Regular Trustee shall vote the next lower
number of whole Shares.

            Section 5.07 Proxies

            At all meetings of Shareholders, a Shareholder may vote by proxy as
provided by the Exchange Act; provided that no proxy shall be voted after three
(3) years from its date, unless

<PAGE>

the proxy provides for a longer period in accordance with this Agreement. Any
proxy to be used at a meeting of Shareholders must be filed with the Secretary
of the Sponsor or his or her representative at or before the time of the
meeting.

            Section 5.08 Notice of Shareholder Business and Nominations

            (a) Annual Meetings of Shareholders

            (i) Except in the case of the Initial Board, nominations of
      individuals for election to the Board of Directors of the Sponsor, other
      than the Chairman, for so long as the Manager is entitled to appoint a
      director of the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman pursuant to the
      terms of the Management Services Agreement, and the proposal of business
      to be considered by Shareholders, may be made at an annual meeting of
      Shareholders (A) pursuant to the Trust's notice of meeting delivered
      pursuant to Section 5.04 hereof, (B) by or at the direction of the Board
      of Directors or (C) by any Shareholder who is entitled to vote at the

            In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination
      for election of a director to be made by a Shareholder or for business to
      be properly brought before an annual meeting by a Shareholder, such
      Shareholder must (A) be a Shareholder of record on both (1) the date of
      the delivery of such nomination or the date of the giving of the notice
      provided for in this Section 5.08(a) and (2) the record date for the
      determination of Shareholders entitled to vote at such annual meeting and
      (B) have given timely notice thereof in proper written form in accordance
      with the requirements of this Section 5.08 (a) to the Secretary.

            (ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before
      an annual meeting by a Shareholder pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph
      (a)(i) of this Section 5.08, a Shareholder must have given timely notice
      thereof in writing to the Secretary and, in the case of business other
      than nominations, such other business must otherwise be a proper matter
      for Shareholder action. To be timely, a Shareholder's notice shall be
      delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the
      Sponsor not less than one hundred and twenty (120) days nor more than one
      hundred and fifty (150) days prior to the first anniversary of the
      preceding year's annual meeting; provided, however, that, in the case of
      the first annual meeting of Shareholders, a Shareholder's notice shall be
      timely if it is delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
      offices of the Sponsor not earlier than the one hundred and twentieth
      (120th) day prior to such annual meeting and not later than the close of
      business on the later of the ninetieth (90th) day prior to such annual
      meeting or the tenth (10th) day following the day on which public
      announcement of the date of such meeting is first made. In no event shall
      the public announcement or an adjournment or postponement of an annual
      meeting commence a new time period for the giving of a Shareholder's
      notice as described in this Section 5.08(a).

            Subject to Section 5.08(a)(i), such Shareholder's notice shall set
forth: (A) as to each individual whom such Shareholder proposes to nominate for
election or reelection as a director, all information relating to such
individual that is required to be disclosed in solicitations of proxies for
election of directors in an election contest, or is otherwise required, in

<PAGE>

14A under the Exchange Act, including such individual's written consent to being
named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a director if
elected; (B) as to any other business that such Shareholder proposes to bring
before the meeting, a brief description of the business desired to be brought
before the meeting, the reasons for conducting such business at the meeting and
any material interest in such business of such Shareholder and the beneficial
owner or holder of Shares, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made; and (C)
as to such Shareholder giving the notice and the beneficial owner, if any, on
whose behalf the nomination or proposal is made, (1) the name and address of
such Shareholder as they appear on the Trust's books and of such beneficial
owner and (2) the number of Shares which are owned beneficially and of record by
such Shareholder and such beneficial owner.

            Notwithstanding anything in the second sentence of clause (ii) of
this Section 5.08(a) to the contrary, in the event that the number of directors
to be elected to the Board of Directors is increased and there is no public
announcement naming all of the nominees for director or specifying the size of
the increased Board of Directors made by the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust at
least one hundred (100) days prior to the first anniversary of the preceding
year's annual meeting, a Shareholder's notice required by this Section 5.08
shall also be considered timely, but only with respect to nominees for any new
positions created by such increase, if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at
the principal executive offices of the Sponsor not later than the close of
business on the tenth (10th) day following the day on which such public
announcement is first made by the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust.

            (b) Special Meeting of Shareholders

            Only such business shall be conducted at a special meeting of
Shareholders as shall have been brought before the meeting pursuant to the
Trust's notice of meeting pursuant to Section 5.04 of this Agreement.
Nominations of individuals for election to the Board of Directors, other than
the Chairman, for so long as the Manager is entitled to appoint a director of
the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman pursuant to the terms of the
Management Services Agreement, may be made at a special meeting of Shareholders
at which directors are to be elected pursuant to the Trust's notice of meeting
(i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors or (ii) by any Shareholder
who is entitled to vote at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures
set forth in this Section 5.08.

            In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination
for election of a director to be made by a Shareholder, such Shareholder must
(A) be a Shareholder of record on both (1) the date of the delivery of such
nomination and (2) the record date for the determination of Shareholders
entitled to vote at such special meeting and (B) have given timely notice
thereof in proper written form in accordance with the requirements of this
Section 5.08(b) to the Secretary.

            In the event the Sponsor on behalf of the Trust calls a special
meeting of Shareholders for the purpose of electing one or more directors to the
Board of Directors, any such Shareholder may nominate such number of individuals
for election to such position(s) as are specified in the Trust's Notice of
Meeting, if Shareholder's notice as required by clause (ii) of Section 5.08(a)
of this Agreement shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
offices of the Sponsor not earlier than the one hundred and twentieth (120th)
day prior to such

<PAGE>

special meeting and not later than the close of business on the later of the
ninetieth (90th) day prior to such special meeting or the tenth (10th) day
following the day on which public announcement is first made of the date of the
special meeting and of the nominees proposed by the Board of Directors to be
elected at such meeting. In no event shall the public announcement of an
adjournment or postponement of a special meeting commence a new time period for
the giving of a Shareholder's notice as described above.

            (c) General

            (i) Only individuals who are nominated in accordance with the
      procedures set forth in this Section 5.08 shall be eligible to be elected
      as directors at a meeting of Shareholders and only such business shall be
      conducted at a meeting of Shareholders as shall have been brought before
      the meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section
      5.08. Except as otherwise provided by applicable law or this Section 5.08,
      the Chairman shall have the power and duty to determine whether a
      nomination or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was
      made in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 5.08 and,
      if any proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this
      Section 5.08, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall
      be disregarded.

            (ii) For purposes of this Section 5.08, "public announcement" shall
      mean disclosure in a press release reported by the Dow Jones News Service,
      Associated Press or comparable national news service or in a document
      publicly filed by the Trust with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

            (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 5.08,
      a Shareholder shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
      Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations thereunder with respect to the
      matters set forth in this Section 5.08. Nothing in this Section 5.08 shall
      be deemed to affect any rights of Shareholders to request inclusion of
      proposals in the Trust's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under the
      Exchange Act.

            Section 5.09 Procedure for Election of Directors; Voting

            The election of directors submitted to Shareholders at any meeting
shall be decided by a plurality of the votes cast thereon. Except as otherwise
provided by law or this Agreement, all matters other than the election of
directors submitted to Shareholders at any meeting shall be decided by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Shares present in person or represented by
proxy at the meeting of Shareholders.

            The vote on any matter at a meeting, including the election of
directors, shall be by written ballot. Each ballot shall be signed by
Shareholder voting, or by such Shareholder's proxy, and shall state the number
of Shares voted.

<PAGE>

            Section 5.10 Inspectors of Elections; Opening and Closing the Polls

            The Board of Directors by resolution shall appoint one or more
inspectors, which inspector or inspectors shall not be directors, officers or
employees of the Sponsor, to act at the meeting and make a written report
thereof. One or more individuals may be designated as alternate inspectors to
replace any inspector who fails to act. If no inspector or alternate has been so
appointed to act, or if all inspectors or alternates who have been appointed are
unable to act, at a meeting of Shareholders, the Chairman of the Board shall
appoint one or more inspectors to act at the meeting. Each such inspector,
before discharging his or her duties, shall take and sign an oath faithfully to
execute the duties of inspector with strict impartiality and according to the
best of his or her ability. The inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by
the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as if the Trust were a
Delaware corporation.

            Section 5.11 Confidential Shareholder Voting

            All proxies, ballots and votes, in each case to the extent they
disclose the specific vote of an identified Shareholder, shall be tabulated and
certified by an independent tabulator, inspector of elections and/or other
independent parties and shall not be disclosed to any director, officer or
employee of the Sponsor or Trustee; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the
foregoing, any and all proxies, ballots and voting tabulations may be disclosed:
(a) as necessary to meet legal requirements or to assist in the pursuit or
defense of legal action; (b) if the Sponsor concludes in good faith that a bona
fide dispute exists as to the authenticity of one or more proxies, ballots or
votes, or as to the accuracy of any tabulation of such proxies, ballots or
votes; (c) in the event of a proxy, consent or other solicitation in opposition
to the voting recommendation of the Board of Directors; and (d) if a Shareholder
requests or consents to disclosure of such Shareholder's vote or writes comments
on such Shareholder's proxy card or ballot.

            Section 5.12 Waiver of Notice

            Whenever any notice is required to be given to any Shareholder by
the terms of this Agreement, a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the Person
or Persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver thereof by electronic
transmission by the Person or Persons entitled to notice, whether before or
after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such
notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any annual
or special meeting of Shareholders need be specified in any written waiver of
notice or any waiver by electronic transmission of such meeting.

            Section 5.13 Remote Communication

            For the purposes of this Agreement, if authorized by the Board of
Directors in its sole discretion, and subject to such guidelines and procedures
as the Board of Directors may adopt, Shareholders and proxyholders may, by means
of remote communication:

            (a) participate in a meeting of Shareholders; and

            (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of
      Shareholders, whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or
      solely by means of remote communication,

<PAGE>

provided, however, that (i) the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, shall implement
reasonable measures to verify that each Person deemed present and permitted to
vote at the meeting by means of remote communication is a Shareholder or
proxyholder, (ii) the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, shall implement
reasonable measures to provide such Shareholders and proxyholders a reasonable
opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters submitted to
Shareholders, including an opportunity to read or hear the proceedings of the
meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and (iii) if any
Shareholder or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by means
of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be
maintained by the Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust.

            Section 5.14 Inspection of Records

            (a) The Sponsor, on behalf of the Trust, shall keep or cause to be
kept at the principal place of business of the Trust appropriate books and
records with respect to the Trust, including, without limitation, all books and
records necessary to provide to the Shareholders any information, lists and
copies of documents required to be provided pursuant to applicable law. Any
books and records maintained by or on behalf of the Trust in the regular course
of its business, including, without limitation, the record of the Shareholders,
books of account and records of Trust proceedings, may be kept in electronic or
any other form, provided that the books and records so maintained are
convertible into clearly legible written form within a reasonable period of
time.

            (b) The Sponsor shall make, at least ten (10) days before every
meeting of Shareholders, a complete list of the Shareholders entitled to vote at
the meeting, arranged in alphabetical order, and showing the address of each
Shareholder and the number of Shares registered in the name of each Shareholder.
Such list shall be open to the examination of any Shareholder, for any purpose
germane to the meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the
meeting: (i) on a reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the
information required to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of
the meeting, or (ii) during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of
business of the Trust. In the event that the Sponsor determines to make the list
available on an electronic network, the Sponsor may take reasonable steps to
ensure that such information is available only to Shareholders. The list shall
be produced and kept at the time and place of the meeting during the whole time
thereof, and may be inspected by any Shareholder who is present.

            Any Shareholder, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall,
upon written demand stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual
business hours to inspect for any proper purpose, and to make copies and
extracts from: (1) the Trust's Share Register, a list of the Shareholders, and
its other books and records; (2) the Sponsor's books and records; or (3) a
Subsidiary's books and records or copies thereof in electronic form; to the
extent that (i) the Sponsor has actual possession and control of such records of
such Subsidiary or (ii) the Sponsor could obtain such records through the
exercise of control over such Subsidiary, provided that as of the date of the
making of the demand (A) Shareholder inspection of such books and records of the
Subsidiary of the Sponsor would not constitute a breach of an agreement between
the Sponsor or the Subsidiary and a Person or Persons not Affiliated with the
Sponsor, and (B) the Subsidiary would not have the right under the law
applicable to it to deny the Sponsor access to such books and records upon
demand by the Sponsor. In every instance where the beneficial holder of Shares
is not a holder of record, the demand shall state the Person's status as a

<PAGE>

beneficial holder of Shares, be accompanied by documentary evidence of
beneficial ownership of Shares, and state that such documentary evidence is a
true and correct copy of what it purports to be. A proper purpose shall mean a
purpose reasonably related to such Person's interest as a Shareholder or
beneficial holder of Shares.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                 DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR TEN PERCENT HOLDERS

            To ensure the Trust's compliance with its obligations under the Use
Agreement, in the event the Sponsor or any Subsidiary, or both, is required to
obtain the approval of the City of Chicago (or any department or agency thereof)
for any specific matter, including, but not limited to, the amendment of the Use
Agreement, or otherwise determines to request that the City of Chicago (or any
department or agency thereof) take action with respect to any matter, the
Sponsor shall deliver to the Transfer Agent notice of such approval requirement
or request for action and a copy of the then current form of the City of Chicago
Economic Disclosure Statement and Affidavit and cause the Transfer Agent to mail
a copy of such notice to any Beneficial Holder holding ten percent or more of
the then issued and outstanding Shares (each, a "Ten Percent Holder"). Within
thirty (30) days of the mailing of such notice, each Ten Percent Holder shall
provide to the Sponsor for filing with the City of Chicago a completed City of
Chicago Economic Disclosure Statement and Affidavit, a standard form of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit B. Each Ten Percent Holder shall provide any
supplemental statements, affidavits or material required to update any Economic
Disclosure Statement and Affidavit filed with the City of Chicago as required by
the City of Chicago and as requested by the Sponsor from time to time.

                     AGREEMENTS AND BRING DERIVATIVE ACTION

                                  THE TRUSTEES

            Section 9.01 Certain Duties and Responsibilities

            (a) In addition to the duties and responsibilities provided for in
Sections 3.01 and 5.05, the Regular Trustee shall have the following exclusive
duties:

            (i) to maintain bank accounts, brokerage accounts and other custody
      accounts that receive Trust income and receipts from which Trust
      expenditures and distributions are disbursed;

            (ii) to maintain evidence of intangible Trust assets;

            (iii) to maintain Trust records;

<PAGE>

            (iv) to maintain an office for Trust business;

            (v) to originate, facilitate and review Trust reports and other
      Trust communications;

            (vi) to execute documents and authorize Trust account transactions;

            (vii) to retain accountants, attorneys, agents and other advisors in
      connection with its duties under this Agreement;

            (viii) to file reports and returns on behalf of the Trust with
      government agencies to the extent required by law and as specifically
      directed in writing by the Sponsor; and

            (ix) to perform such other actions as are necessary to effect any of
      the foregoing duties; provided, however, that no action may be taken by
      the Regular Trustee to the extent that such action would cause the Regular
      Trustee to be considered to have the power to vary the investment of the
      beneficial owners or otherwise to cause the Trust no longer to qualify as
      a grantor trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes.

            (b) The duties and responsibilities of the Trustees shall be as
provided by this Agreement. Except as provided in Section 2.09(a), the Sponsor
hereby acknowledges and agrees that the Trustees are authorized, directed and
instructed to act, only as specifically authorized in writing by the Sponsor.

            Any written instructions, notwithstanding any error in the
transmission thereof or that such instructions may not be genuine, shall, as
against the Sponsor and in favor of the Trustees, be conclusively deemed to be
valid instructions from the Sponsor to the Trustees for the purposes of this
Agreement, if reasonably believed by the Trustees to be genuine and if not
otherwise insufficient on the face of such written instructions; provided,
however, that a Trustee in its discretion may decline to act upon any
instructions where they are not received by such Trustee in sufficient time for
such Trustee to act upon or in accordance with such instructions, where such
Trustee has reasonable grounds for concluding that the same have not been
accurately transmitted or are not genuine or where such Trustee believes in good
faith that complying with such instructions is contrary to law or might subject
such Trustee to any liability. If a Trustee declines to act upon any
instructions for any reason set out in the preceding sentence, it shall notify
the Sponsor and the other Trustees in writing forthwith after it so declines.

            (c) The Trustees shall not be liable for any act or omission in the
course of or connected with their performance hereunder, except only that each
Trustee shall be subject to liability and assume the entire responsibility for
direct damages suffered by the Sponsor or any other Person occasioned by such
Trustee's own gross negligence or willful misconduct or the gross negligence or
willful misconduct of any of such Trustee's directors, officers or employees in
the rendering of its performance hereunder, as determined by a court of
competent jurisdiction.

            (d) The Trustees shall incur no liability to anyone in acting upon
any document reasonably believed by them to be genuine (which is not
insufficient on its face) and to have been signed by the proper Person or
Persons. The Trustees may accept a certified copy of a

<PAGE>

resolution of the board of directors or other governing body of any corporate
party as conclusive evidence that such resolution has been duly adopted by such
body and that the same is in full force and effect. As to any fact or matter the
manner of ascertainment of which is not specifically prescribed herein, the
Trustees may for all purposes hereof rely on a certificate, signed by the
Sponsor, as to such fact or matter, and such certificate, if relied upon by the
Trustees in good faith, shall constitute full protection to the Trustees for any
action taken or omitted to be taken by them in good faith in reliance thereon.

            In no event shall the Trustees be liable for (A) acting in
accordance with instructions from the Sponsor, (B) special or consequential
damages or (C) the acts or omissions of their nominees, correspondents,
designees, agents or subagents appointed by them in good faith.

            (e) In the event that the Trustees are unsure of the course of
action to be taken by them hereunder, the Trustees may request instructions from
the Sponsor and, to the extent the Trustees follow such instructions in good
faith, they shall not be liable to any Person. In the event that no instructions
are provided within the time requested by the Trustees, they shall have no duty
or liability for their failure to take any action or for any action they take in
good faith and in accordance with the terms hereof.

            Section 9.02 Not Responsible for Recitals or Issuance of Shares

            The recitals contained herein and in the Share Certificates shall
not be taken as the statements of the Trustees, and the Trustees do not assume
any responsibility for their correctness.

            Section 9.03 May Hold Shares

            Any Trustee or any other agent of any Trustee or the Trust, in its
individual or any other capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Shares and
may otherwise deal with the Trust with the same rights it would have if it were
not a Trustee or such other agent.

            Section 9.04 Compensation; Indemnity; Fees

            The Sponsor agrees:

            (a) to pay the Delaware Trustee from time to time such compensation
      for all services rendered by them hereunder as the parties shall agree
      from time to time in writing (which compensation shall not be limited by
      any provision of law in regard to the compensation of a trustee of an
      express trust);

            (b) except as otherwise expressly provided herein, to reimburse the
      Delaware Trustee upon request for all reasonable expenses, disbursements
      and advances incurred or made by the Delaware Trustee in accordance with
      any provision of this Agreement (including the reasonable compensation and
      the expenses and disbursements of its agents and counsel), except any such
      expense, disbursement or advance determined by a court of competent
      jurisdiction to have been caused by its own gross negligence or willful
      misconduct; and

<PAGE>

            (c) the Sponsor agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by
      applicable law, to indemnify and hold harmless (i) the Trustees, (ii) any
      officer, director, shareholder, employee, representative or agent of the
      Trustees, and (iii) any employee or agent of the Trust (referred to herein
      as an "Indemnified Person") from and against any loss, damage, liability,
      tax, penalty, expense or claim of any kind or nature whatsoever incurred
      by such Indemnified Person by reason of the creation, operation or
      termination of the Trust or any act or omission performed or omitted by
      such Indemnified Person in good faith on behalf of the Trust and in a
      manner such Indemnified Person reasonably believed to be within the scope
      of authority conferred on such Indemnified Person by this Agreement,
      except that no Indemnified Person shall be entitled to be indemnified in
      respect of any loss, damage or claim incurred by such Indemnified Person
      by reason of gross negligence or willful misconduct with respect to such
      acts or omissions.

            Section 9.05 Delaware Trustee Required; Eligibility of Trustees

            (a) There shall at all times be a Delaware Trustee hereunder with
respect to the Shares. The Delaware Trustee shall be either (i) a natural person

a legal entity with its principal place of business in the State of Delaware and
that otherwise meets the requirements of applicable Delaware law that shall act
through one or more persons authorized to bind such entity. If at any time the
Delaware Trustee with respect to the Shares shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 9.05, it shall resign immediately
in the manner and with the effect hereinafter specified in this Article IX.

            (b) There shall at all times be one Regular Trustee hereunder with
respect to the Shares. The Regular Trustee shall be either a natural person who

            (a) Subject to Sections 9.06(b) and 9.06(c), any Trustee (the
"Relevant Trustee") may be appointed or removed without cause at any time by the
Sponsor.

            (b) The Trustee that acts as Delaware Trustee shall not be removed
in accordance with Section 9.06(a) until a successor possessing the
qualifications to act as Delaware Trustee under Section 9.05 (a "Successor
Delaware Trustee") has been appointed and has accepted such appointment by
instrument executed by such Successor Delaware Trustee and delivered to the
Trust, the Sponsor and the removed Delaware Trustee.

            (c) A Trustee appointed to office shall hold office until his, her
or its successor shall have been appointed or until his, her or its death,
removal, resignation, dissolution or liquidation. Any Trustee may resign from
office (without need for prior or subsequent accounting) by an instrument in
writing with thirty (30) days' notice signed by the Trustee and delivered to the
Sponsor and the Trust, which resignation shall take effect upon such later date
as is specified therein; provided, however, that no such resignation of the
Trustee that acts as the Delaware Trustee shall be effective until a Successor
Delaware Trustee has been appointed and has accepted such appointment by
instrument executed by such Successor Delaware Trustee and delivered to the
Trust, the Sponsor and the resigning Delaware Trustee.

<PAGE>

            (d) If no Successor Delaware Trustee shall have been appointed and
accepted appointment as provided in this Section 9.06 within sixty (60) days
after delivery pursuant to this Section 9.06 of an instrument of resignation or
removal, the Delaware Trustee resigning or being removed, as applicable, may
petition, at the expense of the Sponsor, any court of competent jurisdiction for
appointment of a Successor Delaware Trustee. Such court may thereupon, after
prescribing such notice, if any, as it may deem proper, appoint a Successor
Delaware Trustee.

            (e) No Delaware Trustee shall be liable for the acts or omissions to
act of any Successor Delaware Trustee, as the case may be.

            (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this
Agreement, in the event a Regular Trustee or a Delaware Trustee who is a natural
person dies or becomes, solely in the opinion of the Sponsor, incompetent or
incapacitated, the vacancy created by such death, incompetence or incapacity may
be filled by the Sponsor (with the successor in each case being a Person who
satisfies the eligibility requirement for the Regular Trustee or the Delaware
Trustee, as the case may be, set forth in Section 9.05).

            (g) The indemnity provided to a Trustee under Section 9.04 shall
survive any Trustee's resignation or removal and the termination of this
Agreement.

            Section 9.07 Acceptance of Appointment by Successor

            (a) In case of the appointment hereunder of a Successor Trustee,
such Successor Trustee so appointed shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to
the Trust and to the retiring Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment,
and thereupon the resignation or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become
effective and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights, powers and duties of the
retiring Trustee; but, on the request of the Sponsor or the Successor Trustee,
such retiring Trustee shall, upon payment of its charges, execute and deliver an
instrument transferring to such Successor Trustee all the rights and powers of
the retiring Trustee.

            (b) No Successor Trustee shall accept its appointment unless at the
time of such acceptance such Successor Trustee shall be qualified and eligible
under this Article IX.

            Section 9.08 Merger, Conversion, Consolidation or Succession to

consolidation to which such Relevant Trustee shall be a party, or any Person
succeeding to all or substantially all the corporate trust business of such
Relevant Trustee, shall be the successor of such Relevant Trustee hereunder,
provided that such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible under this
Article IX, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto.

            Section 9.09 Number of Trustees

            (a) The number of Trustees shall be two, provided that the Sponsor

of Regular Trustees is not reduced pursuant to Section 9.09(a), or if the number
of Trustees is increased pursuant to Section 9.09(a), a vacancy shall occur. The
vacancy shall be filled by a Successor Trustee appointed in accordance with
Section 9.06.

            (c) The death, resignation, retirement, removal, bankruptcy,
incompetence or incapacity to perform the duties of a Trustee shall not operate
to annul the Trust.

            Section 9.10 Delegation of Power

            (a) Any Regular Trustee may, by power of attorney consistent with
applicable law, delegate to any other natural person over the age of 21 his or
her power for the purpose of executing any documents contemplated in Section

            (b) The Regular Trustee shall have power to delegate from time to
time to such of their number or to the Sponsor the doing of such things and the
execution of such instruments either in the name of the Trust or the names of
the Regular Trustee or otherwise as the Regular Trustee may deem expedient, to
the extent such delegation is not prohibited by applicable law or contrary to
the provisions of the Trust, as set forth herein.

office, if any, regardless of their number (and not withstanding any other
provision of this Agreement), shall have all the powers granted to the Regular
Trustee and shall discharge all the duties imposed upon the Regular Trustee by
this Agreement.

            In the event that the Sponsor, acting through the Board of
Directors, (i) determines that either (A) the Trust or the Sponsor, or both, is,

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

            Section 11.01 Limitation of Rights of Shareholders

            The death or incapacity of any person having an interest, beneficial
or otherwise, in Shares shall not operate to terminate this Agreement, nor

any court for a partition or winding-up of the arrangements contemplated hereby,
nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the parties
hereto or any of them.

            Section 11.02 Amendment

            This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Sponsor,
acting through the Board of Directors, and by the Regular Trustee at the
direction of the Sponsor, acting through the Board of Directors; provided,
however, that no such amendment shall alter the rights, powers or immunities of
the Delaware Trustee without its written consent. Notwithstanding any other
provisions of this Agreement, the Sponsor shall not, and no Trustee shall, (i)
enter into or consent to any amendment to this Agreement which would cause the

"investment company" under the 1940 Act or be classified as other than a grantor
trust for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (ii) cause the Trust to issue a
class of equity securities other than the Shares or issue any debt securities or
any derivative securities or amend the provision of Section 2.05 of this
Agreement prohibiting such issuance or (iii) enter into or consent to any
amendment to this Agreement that would affect the exclusive and absolute right
of the Shareholders to direct the voting of the Trust, as Member of the Sponsor,
pursuant to Section 5.05 of this Agreement, with respect to all matters reserved
for the vote of Members pursuant to the provisions of the Sponsor Agreement;
provided, however, that Article VIII, Section 2.05 and this Section 11.02 of
this Agreement may not be amended

represented by proxy at a meeting of Shareholders.

            Section 11.03 Separability

            In case any provision in this Agreement or in the Share Certificates
shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable, the validity, legality and
enforceability of the remaining provisions shall not in any way be affected or
impaired thereby.

            Section 11.04 Specific Performance

            The Sponsor and the Trustees agree that each party to this Agreement
would be irreparably damaged if any of the provisions of this Agreement were not
performed in accordance with their specific terms and that monetary damages
would not provide an adequate remedy in such event. Accordingly, it is agreed
that, in addition to any other remedy to which the nonbreaching party may be
entitled, at law or in equity, each nonbreaching party shall be entitled to
injunctive relief to prevent breaches of the provisions of this Agreement and
specifically to enforce the terms and provisions hereof in any action instituted
in any court of the United States or any state thereof having subject matter
jurisdiction thereof.

      asset) from the disposition of such asset and shall be taken into account
      for purposes of computing Profits or Losses;

            (iv) gain or loss resulting from any disposition of Property with
      respect to which gain or loss is recognized for U.S. federal income tax

      Property differs from its Gross Asset Value;

            (v) to the extent an adjustment to the adjusted tax basis of any
      Company asset pursuant to Code Section 734(b) is required, pursuant to
      Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into account in
      determining Capital Accounts as a result of a distribution other than in
      liquidation of a Member's interest in the Company, the amount of such
      adjustment shall be treated as an item of gain (if the adjustment

      account for purposes of computing Profits or Losses; and

            (vi) notwithstanding any other provision of this definition, any
      items which are specially allocated pursuant to Section 4.3 or Section 4.4

            Section 2.1 Trust to Be Sole Member. Simultaneously with the
execution of the Original Operating Agreement, the Company issued one hundred
(100) fully paid and nonassessable LLC Interests to the Trust as Original
Member, which was admitted as a Member of the Company in respect thereof.
Following such issuance, the Trust was and on the date hereof continues to be

shall be the sole owner of one hundred percent (100%) of the LLC Interests and

Trust Stock represents one undivided beneficial interest in the Trust and each
share of Trust Stock corresponds to one underlying LLC Interest. At all times,

            Section 2.3 Circumstances Under Which Trust Stock Will Be Exchanged
for LLC Interests. In the event: (i) the Board of Directors (A) determines that

treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income tax purposes, (2) the Trust is,
or is reasonably likely to be, required to issue Schedules K-1 to holders of
Trust Stock, or (3) the existence of the Trust otherwise results, or is
reasonably likely to result, in a material tax detriment to the Trust, the
holders of Trust Stock, the Company or any of the Members, and (B) obtains an
opinion of counsel of national reputation to such effect, or (ii) a Dissolution
Event occurs, the Board of Directors (a) shall declare a record date and deliver
a mandatory instruction to the Regular Trustee, together with any opinions of
counsel or certificates of officers of the Company as the Regular Trustee may
reasonably request, directing the Regular Trustee to (i) deliver LLC Interests
to each holder of record of shares of Trust Stock on such record date in
exchange for such outstanding shares of Trust Stock (the "MANDATORY EXCHANGE"),
and (ii) dissolve the Trust, and (b) shall deliver to the Transfer Agent notice
of such Mandatory Exchange and shall cause the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of
such notice to the holders of record of the Trust Stock at least thirty (30)
days prior to the Mandatory Exchange. Simultaneously with the completion of such
Mandatory Exchange, each holder of shares of Trust Stock immediately prior to
the completion of the Mandatory Exchange shall be admitted to the Company as a
Member in respect of an equal number of LLC Interests previously held by the
Trust and each holder of record shall be issued an LLC Interest Certificate
evidencing the same pursuant to Section 3.1, immediately whereafter the Trust

shares of Trust Stock (the "ACQUIRER"), such Acquirer shall then have the right
to direct the Board of Directors to (i) declare a record date and deliver a
mandatory instruction to the Regular Trustee directing the Regular Trustee to
(A) deliver the LLC Interests to the holders of record of the Trust Stock,
including the Acquirer, in exchange for all of the outstanding shares of Trust
Stock (the "ACQUISITION EXCHANGE"), and (B) dissolve the Trust, and (ii) deliver
to the Transfer Agent notice of such Acquisition Exchange and cause the Transfer
Agent to mail a copy of such notice to the holders of record of the Trust Stock
at least thirty (30) days prior to the Acquisition Exchange. Simultaneously with
the completion of such Acquisition Exchange, each holder of record of shares of
Trust Stock immediately prior to the completion of the Acquisition Exchange
shall be admitted to the Company as a Member in respect of an equal number of
LLC Interests previously held by the Trust and each holder of record shall be
issued an LLC Interest Certificate evidencing the same pursuant to Section 3.1,
immediately whereafter the Trust shall be deemed to have withdrawn from the
Company as a Member in respect of such LLC Interest(s), and the Trust shall
tender its LLC Interest Certificates to the Company for cancellation.

            (b) Right to Acquire LLC Interests of Remaining Holders for Cash.
Following the completion of an Acquisition Exchange, the Acquirer shall have the
right to purchase, solely for cash, and Members other than the Acquirer shall be
required to sell, all, but not less than all, of the outstanding LLC Interests
not then held by the Acquirer, at the Offer Price (as defined below). The
Acquirer may exercise its right to effect such purchase by delivering written
notice to the Company and the Transfer Agent of its election to make the
purchase not less than sixty (60) days prior to the date which it selects for
such purchase. Promptly after receipt of such notice the Board of Directors
shall declare a record date. The Company will use reasonable efforts to cause
the Transfer Agent to mail a copy of such notice to the Members at least thirty
(30) days prior to such purchase.

      last reported sale price) of a share of Trust Stock or an LLC Interest, as
      applicable (regular way), on the NYSE on such date;

            (ii) if the Trust Stock or the LLC Interests are not listed for
      trading on the NYSE on any such date, the closing sale price as reported
      in the composite transactions for the principal U.S. securities exchange
      on which the Trust Stock or the LLC Interests, as applicable, are so
      listed;

      not so listed on a U.S. national or regional securities exchange, the
      price as reported by the Nasdaq National Market;

            (iv) if the Trust Stock or the LLC Interests, as applicable, are not
      so reported, the last quoted bid price for the Trust Stock or the LLC
      Interests, as applicable, in the over-the-counter market as reported by
      the National Quotation Bureau or a similar organization; or

            (v) if the Trust Stock or the LLC Interests, as applicable, are not
      so quoted, the average of the midpoint of the last bid and ask prices for
      the Trust Stock or the LLC Interests, as applicable, from at least three
      nationally recognized investment firms that the Company selects for such
      purpose.

this Amended Agreement and Bring Derivative Action.

each holder of record of Trust Stock, shall have the right to institute any
legal proceeding against the Company to enforce the provisions of this Amended
Agreement.

<PAGE>

            (b) For so long as the Trust remains the sole Member, holders of
record holding at least ten percent (10%) or more of the shares of Trust Stock
shall have the right to cause the Trust to institute any legal proceeding for
any remedy available to the Trust as the sole Member of the Company, including
bringing a derivative action under the Act, and such holders of Trust Stock may
direct the time, method and place of conducting any such legal proceeding
brought by the Trust.

            (c) Nothing in this Amended Agreement, express or implied, shall
give to any Person, other than a Member and a holder of the Trust Stock, if any,
any benefit or any legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under this Amended
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 3

                              ADMISSION OF MEMBERS

            Section 3.1 LLC Interests. The Company shall be authorized to issue
one class of limited liability company interests (the "LLC INTERESTS") in an
aggregate amount of up to five hundred million (500,000,000) of such LLC
Interests. The aggregate number of LLC Interests that are authorized may be
increased, from time to time, by an amendment of this Amended Agreement upon the
adoption of a resolution by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the
Entire Board of Directors declaring such amendment to be advisable and the
approval of such amendment by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority
of the LLC Interests present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting of
the Members.

            Section 3.2 Issuance of Additional LLC Interests. The Board of
Directors shall have authority to authorize the issuance, from time to time
without any vote or other action by the Members, of any or all LLC Interests of
the Company at any time authorized. While the Trust remains the sole holder of
the LLC Interests, the Company will issue additional LLC Interests to the Trust
in exchange for an equal number of shares of Trust Stock which the Company may
sell or distribute in any manner, subject to applicable law, that the Board of
Directors in its sole discretion deems appropriate and advisable.

            Section 3.3 LLC Interest Certificates; Admission of Additional
Members. The LLC Interests shall be represented by certificates in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit A (the "LLC INTEREST CERTIFICATES"). The LLC Interest
Certificates shall be conclusive evidence of ownership of the related LLC
Interests. Every holder of record of LLC Interests of the Company shall be
entitled to one or more LLC Interest Certificates representing the number of LLC
Interests held by such holder of record. The LLC Interest Certificates of the
Company shall be issued under the seal of the Company, or a facsimile thereof,
and shall be numbered and shall be entered in the books of the Company as they
are issued. Each LLC Interest Certificate shall bear a serial number, shall
exhibit the holder's name and the number of LLC Interests evidenced thereby and
shall be signed by the Chief Executive Officer or the Chief Financial Officer.
Any or all of the signatures on the LLC Interest Certificates may be facsimiles.
If any officer, Transfer Agent or Registrar who has signed or whose facsimile
signature has been placed upon an LLC Interest Certificate shall have ceased to
be such officer, Transfer Agent or Registrar before such LLC Interest
Certificate is issued, the LLC Interest Certificate may be issued by the
<PAGE>

Company with the same effect as if such Person or entity were such officer,
Transfer Agent or Registrar at the date of issue. From the time of the closing
of the initial public offering of the Trust Stock by the Trust, the Company
shall retain the Transfer Agent to maintain a register of the LLC Interests (the
"REGISTER"), the Transfer Agent, in such capacity shall be known as the
Registrar, and cause such Registrar to register thereon any transfer of LLC
Interest Certificates. Transfer of LLC Interests of the Company shall be made on
the Register only upon surrender to the Transfer Agent of the LLC Interest
Certificates duly endorsed or accompanied by proper evidence of succession,
assignment or authority to transfer; provided, however, that such succession,
assignment or transfer is not prohibited by the LLC Interest Certificates, this
Amended Agreement, applicable law or contract. Thereupon, the Company shall
issue a new LLC Interest Certificate (if requested) to the Person entitled
thereto, cancel the old LLC Interest Certificate, and shall instruct the
Registrar to record the transaction upon the Register.

            Section 3.4 Repurchase of LLC Interests by the Company.

            (a) The Board of Directors shall have authority to cause the Company
to conduct a capital reduction, including the repurchase of any number of issued
and outstanding LLC Interests; provided, however, that the Company shall not
purchase or redeem its LLC Interests for cash or other property if any such
purchase or redemption would be inconsistent with the requirements of Section
18-607 or Section 18-804 of the Act and provided further that so long as the
Trust remains the sole Member, the Company, as sponsor of the Trust, acting
through its Board of Directors, shall cause the Trust to conduct a capital
reduction on similar terms and shall ensure that an identical number of LLC
Interests and shares of Trust Stock are issued and outstanding at any one time.

            (b) At any time after the closing of the initial public offering of
the Trust Stock by the Trust, in the event the Board of Directors determines
that the Company shall make an offer to repurchase any number of issued and
outstanding LLC Interests, the Board of Directors shall deliver to the Transfer
Agent notice of such offer to repurchase and shall cause the Transfer Agent to
mail a copy of such notice to the Members and holders of Trust Stock, as the
case may be, at least thirty (30) days prior to such offer to repurchase. Any
LLC Interests tendered and repurchased by the Company, in accordance with this
Section 3.4, shall be deemed to be authorized and issued, but not outstanding
and, subject to Section 2.1, may subsequently be sold or Transferred for due
consideration.

      Nonrecourse Debt, determined in accordance with Regulations Section
      1.704-2(i)(4). Allocations pursuant to the previous sentence shall be made

      Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(4), 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(5) or
      1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d)(6) of the Regulations, items of Company income and

      Adjusted Capital Account Deficit of the Member as quickly as possible,
      provided that an allocation pursuant to this Section 4.3(c) shall be made
      only if and to the extent that the Member would have an Adjusted Capital
      Account Deficit after all other allocations provided for in this Article 4
      have been tentatively made as if this Section 4.3(c) were not in this
      Amended Agreement.

            (d) Gross Income Allocation. In the event any Member has a deficit
      Capital Account at the end of any Allocation Year which is in excess of
      the sum of the amount such Member is obligated to restore pursuant to the
      penultimate sentence of each of Regulations Sections 1.704-2(g)(1) and
      1.704-2(i)(5), each such Member shall be

<PAGE>

      specially allocated items of Company income and gain in the amount of such
      excess as quickly as possible, provided that an allocation pursuant to
      this Section 4.3(d) shall be made only if and to the extent that such
      Member would have a deficit Capital Account in excess of such sum after
      all other allocations provided for in this Article 4 have been made as if
      Section 4.3(c) hereof and this Section 4.3(d) were not in this Amended
      Agreement.

            (e) Nonrecourse Deductions. Nonrecourse Deductions for any
      Allocation Year shall be specially allocated to the Members in proportion
      to their respective Percentage Interests.

            (f) Member Nonrecourse Deductions. Any Member Nonrecourse Deductions
      for any Allocation Year shall be specially allocated to the Member who
      bears the economic risk of loss with respect to the Member Nonrecourse
      Debt to which such Member Nonrecourse Deductions are attributable in
      accordance with Regulations Section 1.704-2(i)(1).

            (g) Section 754 Adjustments. To the extent an adjustment to the
      adjusted tax basis of any Company asset, pursuant to Code Section 734(b)
      or Code Section 743(b), is required, pursuant to Regulations Section
      1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2) or 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4), to be taken into
      account in determining Capital Accounts as the result of a distribution to
      a Member in complete liquidation of such Member's interest in the Company,
      the amount of such adjustment to Capital Accounts shall be treated as an
      item of gain (if the adjustment increases the basis of the asset) or loss
      (if the adjustment decreases such basis) and such gain or loss shall be
      specially allocated to the Members in accordance with their interests in
      the Company in the event Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(2)
      applies or to the Member to whom such distribution was made in the event
      Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(iv)(m)(4) applies.

            (h) Allocations Relating to Taxable Issuance of Company LLC
      Interests. Any income, gain, loss or deduction realized as a direct or
      indirect result of the issuance of LLC Interests by the Company to a
      Member (the "ISSUANCE ITEMS") shall be allocated among the Members so
      that, to the extent possible, the net amount of such Issuance Items,
      together with all other allocations made under this Amended Agreement to
      each Member, shall be equal to the net amount that would have been
      allocated to each such Member if the Issuance Items had not been realized.

            Section 4.4 Curative Allocations. The allocations set forth in
Sections 4.3(a), 4.3(b), 4.3(c), 4.3(d), 4.3(e), 4.3(f), 4.3(g) and 4.5 hereof
(the "REGULATORY ALLOCATIONS") are intended to comply with certain requirements
of the Regulations. It is the intent of the Members that, to the extent
possible, all Regulatory Allocations shall be offset either with other
Regulatory Allocations or with special allocations of other items of Company
income, gain, loss or deduction pursuant to this Section 4.4. Therefore,
notwithstanding any other provision of this Article 4 (other than the Regulatory
Allocations), the Board of Directors shall make such offsetting special
allocations of Company income, gain, loss or deduction in whatever manner it
determines appropriate so that, after such offsetting allocations are made, each
Member's Capital Account balance is, to the extent possible, equal to the
Capital Account balance such Member

<PAGE>

would have had if the Regulatory Allocations were not part of this Amended
Agreement and all Company items were allocated pursuant to Sections 4.1, 4.2 and
4.3(h) hereof.

            Section 4.5 Loss Limitation. Losses allocated pursuant to Section
4.2 hereof shall not exceed the maximum amount of Losses that can be allocated
without causing any Member to have an Adjusted Capital Account Deficit at the
end of any Allocation Year. In the event some but not all of the Members would
have Adjusted Capital Account Deficits as a consequence of an allocation of
Losses pursuant to Section 4.2 hereof, the limitation set forth in this Section
4.5 shall be applied on a Member-by-Member basis, and Losses not allocable to
any Member as a result of such limitation shall be allocated to the other
Members in accordance with the positive balances in such Members' Capital
Accounts so as to allocate the maximum permissible Losses to each Member under
Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(d) of the Regulations.

            Section 4.6 Other Allocation Rules.

            (a) For purposes of determining the Profits and Losses or any other
items allocable to any period, Profits, Losses, and any other such items shall
be determined on a monthly or other basis, as determined by the Company using
any method permissible under Code Section 706 and the Regulations thereunder.

            (b) The Members are aware of the income tax consequences of the
allocations made by this Article 4 and hereby agree to be bound by the
provisions of this Article 4 in reporting their shares of Company income and
loss for income tax purposes.

            (c) Solely for purposes of determining a Member's proportionate
share of the "excess nonrecourse liabilities" of the Company within the meaning
of Regulations Section 1.752-3(a)(3), the Members' interests in Company profits
are in proportion to their Percentage Interests.

            (d) To the extent permitted by Section 1.704-2(h)(3) of the
Regulations, the Manager shall endeavor to treat distributions as having been
made from the proceeds of a Nonrecourse Liability or a Member Nonrecourse Debt
only to the extent that such distributions would cause or increase an Adjusted
Capital Account Deficit for any Member.

            Section 4.7 Tax Allocations: Code Section 704(c). In accordance with
Code Section 704(c) and the Regulations thereunder, income, gain, loss and
deduction with respect to any Property contributed to the capital of the Company
shall, solely for tax purposes, be allocated among the Members so as to take
account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such Property to the
Company for U.S. federal income tax purposes and its initial Gross Asset Value
(computed in accordance with the definition of Gross Asset Value) using a
method, selected in the discretion of the Board of Directors in accordance with
Section 1.704-3 of the Regulations.

            In the event the Gross Asset Value of any Company asset is adjusted
pursuant to subparagraph (ii) of the definition of Gross Asset Value, subsequent
allocations of income, gain, loss and deduction with respect to such asset shall
take account of any variation between the adjusted basis of such asset for U.S.
federal income tax purposes and its Gross Asset Value in the same manner as
under Code Section 704(c) and the Regulations thereunder.

<PAGE>

            Any elections or other decisions relating to such allocations shall
be made by the Company in any manner that reasonably reflects the purpose and
intention of this Amended Agreement. Allocations pursuant to this Section 4.7
are solely for purposes of U.S. federal, state and local taxes and shall not
affect, or in any way be taken into account in computing, any Member's Capital
Account or share of Profits, Losses, other items or distributions pursuant to
any provision of this Amended Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 5

                           DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTIONS

            Section 5.1 Net Cash Flow. Except as otherwise provided in Section
5.3 and Section 14 hereof, the Board of Directors may, in its sole discretion
and at any time, declare and pay dividends and make and pay distributions with
respect to the LLC Interests from Net Cash Flow to the Members in proportion to
their Percentage Interests.

            Section 5.2 Amounts Withheld. All amounts withheld pursuant to the
Code or any provision of any state, local or foreign tax law with respect to any
payment, dividend or other distribution or allocation to the Company or the
Members shall be treated as amounts paid, as the case may be, to the Members
with respect to which such amounts were withheld pursuant to this Article 5.2
for all purposes under this Amended Agreement. The Company is authorized to
withhold from payments or with respect to allocations to the Members, and to pay
over to any U.S. federal, state and local government or any foreign government,
any amounts required to be so withheld pursuant to the Code or any provisions of
any other U.S. federal, state or local law or any foreign law, and shall
allocate any such amounts to the Members with respect to which such amounts were
withheld. For so long as the Trust is a Member, all amounts withheld in
accordance with this Section 5.2 will be treated as amounts paid, as the case
may be, to holders of the Trust Stock and any such amounts shall be allocated to
the holders of the Trust Stock in the same amounts as any such allocations were
made per LLC Interest.

            Section 5.3 Limitations on Dividends and Distributions.

            (a) The Company shall make no dividend or other distributions to the
Members except as provided in this Article 5 and Section 14 hereof.

            (b) A Member may not receive dividends or other distributions from
the Company to the extent such dividend or other distribution is inconsistent
with, or in violation of, the Act or any provision of this Amended Agreement.

                                    ARTICLE 6

                               BOARD OF DIRECTORS

            Section 6.1 Initial Board. Initially, the Board of Directors shall
be comprised of the following individuals: John Roberts, Peter Stokes and
Shemara Wikramanayake (each, an "INITIAL DIRECTOR" and, collectively, the
"INITIAL BOARD"). Each Initial Director shall hold office

<PAGE>

until his successor is elected or appointed and qualified, or until his or her
earlier death, resignation or removal in accordance with this Article 6. The
Initial Board shall have all of the powers and authorities accorded to the Board
of Directors, and each Initial Director shall have all of the powers and
authorities accorded the directors of the Company under the terms of this
Amended Agreement.

            Section 6.2 General Powers. The business and affairs of the Company
shall be managed by or under the direction of its Board of Directors. Each
director of the Company, when acting in such capacity, is a manager within the
meaning of Section 18-402 of the Act and as such is vested with the powers and
authorities necessary for the management of the Company, subject to the terms of
this Amended Agreement and the Management Services Agreement and provided that
no director is authorized to act individually on behalf of the Company and the
Board of Directors shall only take action in accordance with the quorum and
other requirements provided by this Amended Agreement. In addition to the powers
and authorities expressly conferred upon it by this Amended Agreement, the Board
of Directors may exercise all such powers of the Company and do all such lawful
acts and things as are not by applicable law, including the Rules and
Regulations, or by this Amended Agreement required to be exercised or done by
the Members. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, it shall be the
responsibility of the Board of Directors to establish broad objectives and the
general course of the business, determine basic policies, appraise the adequacy
of overall results, and generally represent and further the interests of the
Members.

            Section 6.3 Duties of Directors. Except as provided in this Amended
Agreement and the Management Services Agreement, the fiduciary duties of the
directors of the Company are intended to be consistent with the fiduciary duties
applicable to directors of a corporation incorporated under the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware, as if such directors were directors of
a corporation incorporated under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware. Except as provided in this Amended Agreement and the Management
Services Agreement, the fiduciary duties of the directors of the Company shall
be interpreted consistently with the jurisprudence regarding such fiduciary
duties of directors of a corporation under the General Corporation Law of the
State of Delaware. It shall be expressly understood that no director of the
Company has any fiduciary duties with respect to any action or inaction of the
Manager pursuant to the terms of the Management Services Agreement, and that any
actions or inactions of the directors of the Company, to cause the Company to
act in compliance or in accordance with the Management Services Agreement, are
consistent with the fiduciary duties of such directors. For the avoidance of
doubt, the directors of the Company shall have no additional fiduciary duties by
virtue of their status as managers under the Act.

            Section 6.4 Number, Tenure and Qualifications. As provided by
Section 6.1, the Initial Board shall be comprised of three (3) Initial Directors
and at all times from and after the closing of the initial public offering of
the shares of Trust Stock by the Trust the composition of the Board of Directors
shall consist of at least a majority of Independent Directors. Subject to this
Section 6.4, the number of directors shall be fixed from time to time
exclusively pursuant to a resolution adopted by the Board of Directors, but
shall consist of not less than four (4) nor more than twelve (12) directors.
However, no decrease in the number of directors constituting the Board of
Directors shall shorten the term of any incumbent director. The term of each
director shall be the period from the effective date of such director's election
to the next annual

<PAGE>

meeting of Members until such director's successor is duly elected and qualified
or until such director's earlier death, resignation or removal. Directors need
not be residents of the State of Delaware or Members.

            Section 6.5 Election of Directors. Except as provided in Sections
6.1 and 6.8 and with respect to any director to be appointed by the Manager to
serve as Chairman, or Alternate Chairman (defined below), in accordance with
Section 6.9, the directors shall be elected at the annual meeting of Members. At
any meeting of Members duly called and held for the election of directors at
which a quorum is present, directors shall be elected by a plurality of the LLC
Interests present in person or represented by proxy at the meeting of Members.

            Section 6.6 Removal. With the exception of the director appointed by
the Manager to serve as the Chairman of the Company pursuant to the Management
Services Agreement, any director may be removed from office, but only for cause,
by the affirmative vote of the Members holding at least sixty-six and two-thirds
percent (66 2/3%) of the issued and outstanding LLC Interests. If any directors
are so removed, new directors may be elected by the Members at the same meeting
in accordance with Section 6.5 hereof. For so long as the Manager is entitled to
appoint a director of the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman pursuant to
the terms of the Management Services Agreement, the Manager may, it its sole
discretion, remove the Chairman from office and as a director, with or without
cause. If the Chairman is so removed, a new Chairman shall be appointed in
accordance with Section 6.9.

            Section 6.7 Resignations. Any director, whether elected or
appointed, may resign at any time upon notice of such resignation to the
Company. An Independent Director who ceases to be independent shall promptly
resign to the extent required for the Company or the Manager to comply with
applicable laws, rules and regulations.

            Section 6.8 Vacancies and Newly Created Directorships. Subject to
Section 6.9, and except as otherwise provided in Section 6.6, vacancies and
newly created directorships resulting from any increase in the authorized number
of directors may be filled by a majority vote of the directors then in office,
although less than a quorum, or by a sole remaining director. Unless otherwise
provided in this Amended Agreement, when one or more directors, other than a
director appointed by the Manager pursuant to Section 6.9 hereof, shall resign
from the Board, a majority of directors then in office shall have the power to
fill such vacancy or vacancies, the vote thereon to take effect when such
resignation or resignations shall become effective. For so long as the Manager
is entitled to appoint a director of the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman
pursuant to the terms of the Management Services Agreement, the Manager shall be
entitled to appoint the successor to the Chairman upon resignation or removal by
the Manager of the Chairman.

            Section 6.9 Appointment of or Nomination and Election of Chairman;
Appointment of Alternate Chairman. For so long as the Manager is entitled to
appoint a director of the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman pursuant to
the terms of the Management Services Agreement, the Manager shall appoint one
director of the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman, and one alternate
therefor to serve in such capacity in the absence of the appointed Chairman (the
"ALTERNATE CHAIRMAN"). The Alternate Chairman shall be entitled to attend all
regular and special meetings of the Board of Directors and, in the absence of
the Chairman, shall

<PAGE>

have all the rights, privileges and responsibilities, including the voting
rights, of the Chairman and shall have all the rights, privileges and
responsibilities of a director of the Board of Directors. In all other cases,
the nomination of a director to serve as Chairman of the Board of Directors and
the election of such director by the Members at a Members' meeting shall be
conducted in accordance with Sections 9.8 and 9.9.

            Section 6.10 Chairman of the Board. The Chairman of the Board shall
be a member of the Board of Directors. The Chairman is not required to be an
employee of the Company. The Chairman of the Board, if present, or the Alternate
Chairman, shall preside at all meetings of the Board of Directors. For so long
as the Manager is entitled to appoint the director of the Board of Directors to
serve as Chairman pursuant to the terms of the Management Services Agreement and
if the appointed Chairman and any Alternative Chairman is unavailable for any
reason, the duties of the Chairman of the Board shall be performed, and the
Chairman of the Board's authority may be exercised, by a director designated for
this purpose by the remaining members of the Board of Directors. The Chairman of
the Board shall perform such other duties and have such other powers as may be
prescribed by the Board of Directors or this Amended Agreement, all in
accordance with basic policies as may be established by the Company, and subject
to the approval and oversight of the Board of Directors.

            Section 6.11 Regular Meetings. A regular meeting of the Board of
Directors shall be held without any other notice than this Amended Agreement,
immediately after, and at the same place (if any) as, each annual meeting of
Members. The Board of Directors may, by resolution, provide the time and place
(if any) for the holding of additional regular meetings without any other notice
than such resolution. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of Directors, the
Secretary of the Company shall act as Secretary at all regular meetings of the
Board of Directors and in the Secretary's absence a temporary Secretary shall be
appointed by the chairman of the meeting.

            Section 6.12 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the Board of
Directors shall be called at the request of the Chief Executive Officer, the
Chairman of the Board or a majority of the Board of Directors. The Person or
Persons authorized to call special meetings of the Board of Directors may fix
the place and time of the meetings. Unless otherwise determined by the Board of
Directors, the Secretary of the Company shall act as Secretary at all special
meetings of the Board of Directors and in the Secretary's absence a temporary
Secretary shall be appointed by the chairman of the meeting.

            Section 6.13 Notice for Special Meetings. Notice of any special
meeting of the Board of Directors shall be mailed by first class mail, postage
paid, to each director at his or her business or residence not later than three
(3) days before the day on which such meeting is to be held or shall be sent to
either of such places by telegraph, express courier service (including, without
limitation, Federal Express) or facsimile (directed to the facsimile number to
which the director has consented to receive notice) or other electronic
transmission (including, but not limited to, an e-mail address at which the
director has consented to receive notice), or be communicated to each director
personally or by telephone not later than one (1) day before such day of
meeting; provided, however, that if the business to be transacted at such
special meeting includes a proposed amendment to this Amended Agreement, notice
shall be communicated to each director personally or by telephone not later than
three (3) days before such day of meeting.

<PAGE>

Except in the case where the business to be transacted at such special meeting
includes a proposed amendment to this Amended Agreement, neither the business to
be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any regular or special meeting of the
Board of Directors need be specified in the notice of such meeting. A meeting
may be held at any time without notice if all the directors are present or if
those not present waive notice of the meeting in accordance with Section 9.12
hereof, either before or after such meeting.

            Section 6.14 Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be
given to any director of the Company under the terms of this Amended Agreement,
a waiver thereof in writing, signed by the Person or Persons entitled to such
notice, or a waiver thereof by electronic transmission by the Person or Persons
entitled to notice, whether before or after the time stated in such notice,
shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. Neither the business to
be transacted at, nor the purpose of, any meeting of the Board of Directors or
committee thereof need be specified in any written waiver of notice or any
waiver by electronic transmission of notice of such meeting.

            Section 6.15 Action Without Meeting. Any action required or
permitted to be taken at any meeting by the Board of Directors or any committee
or subcommittee thereof, as the case may be, may be taken without a meeting if a
consent thereto is signed or transmitted electronically, as the case may be, by
all members of the Board or of such committee or subcommittee, as the case may
be, and the writing or writings or electronic transmission or transmissions are
filed with the minutes of proceedings of the Board of Directors or such
committee or subcommittee; provided, however, that such electronic transmission
or transmissions must either set forth or be submitted with information from
which it can be determined that the electronic transmission or transmissions
were authorized by the director. Such filing shall be in paper form if the
minutes are maintained in paper form and shall be in electronic form if the
minutes are maintained in electronic form.

            Section 6.16 Conference Telephone Meetings. Members of the Board of
Directors, or any committee or subcommittee thereof, may participate in a
meeting of the Board of Directors or such committee or subcommittee by means of
conference telephone or other communications equipment by means of which all
Persons participating in the meeting can hear each other, and such participation
in a meeting shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

            Section 6.17 Quorum. At all meetings of the Board of Directors, at
least fifty percent (50%) of the then total number of directors in office (such
total number of directors, the "ENTIRE BOARD OF DIRECTORS") shall constitute a
quorum for the transaction of business. At all meetings of any committee of the
Board of Directors, the presence of a majority of the total number of members of
such committee (assuming no vacancies) shall constitute a quorum. The act of a
majority of the directors or committee members present at any meeting at which
there is a quorum shall be the act of the Board of Directors or such committee,
as the case may be. If a quorum shall not be present at any meeting of the Board
of Directors or any committee, a majority of the directors or members, as the
case may be, present thereat may adjourn the meeting from time to time without
further notice other than announcement at the meeting. The members of the Board
of Directors present at a duly organized meeting at which a quorum is

<PAGE>

present may continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough members of the Board of Directors to leave less than a
quorum.

            Section 6.18 Committees.

            (a) Following the election of the successors to each of the members
of the Initial Board, the Company shall have three standing committees: the
Nominating and Governance Committee, the Audit Committee and the Compensation
Committee, as set out below. Each of the Nominating and Governance Committee,
the Audit Committee and the Compensation Committee shall adopt by resolution a
charter to establish the rules and responsibilities of such committee in
accordance with applicable law, including the Rules and Regulations and the
Applicable Listing Rules.

            (i) Nominating and Governance Committee. The Board of Directors, by
      resolution adopted by a majority of the Entire Board of Directors, will
      designate a Nominating and Governance Committee comprised solely of
      Independent Directors, which Committee shall oversee the Company's
      commitment to good corporate governance and develop and recommend to the
      Board a set of corporate governance principles and oversee the evaluation
      of the performance of the Board of Directors.

            In addition, the Nominating and Governance Committee shall recommend
      to the Board of Directors specific policies or guidelines concerning
      criteria for directors and shall also recommend to the Board of Directors
      nominees for election to the Board in connection with any meeting of
      Members at which directors are to be elected or in connection with any
      meeting of the Board of Directors to fill any vacancy which the Board of
      Directors is authorized under this Amended Agreement to fill. The
      Nominating and Governance Committee will solicit recommendations for
      director nominees from the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer of the
      Company. The Nominating and Governance Committee may also recommend to the
      Board specific policies or guidelines concerning the structure and
      composition of the Board of Directors or committees of the Board of
      Directors, the size and composition of the Board of Directors and the
      selection, tenure and retirement of directors and matters related thereto.

            (ii) Audit Committee. The Board of Directors, by resolution adopted
      by a majority of the Entire Board of Directors, will designate an Audit
      Committee comprised of not fewer than three (3) nor more than seven (7)
      Independent Directors, all of whom meet the financial literacy
      requirements of law and of the Applicable Listing Rules. At least one
      member of the Audit Committee will meet the accounting or related
      financial management expertise required to be established by the Board of
      Directors. The Audit Committee shall review and make recommendations to
      the Board of Directors with respect to: the independence, qualifications
      and services of the independent public accountants employed by the Company
      from time to time to audit the books of the Company, the scope of their
      audits, the adequacy of their audit reports, and recommendations made by
      them. The Audit Committee shall also make such reviews of internal
      financial audits and controls as the Audit Committee considers desirable.

<PAGE>

            The Audit Committee, in its capacity as a committee of the Board of
      Directors, shall be directly responsible for the appointment,
      compensation, retention and oversight of the work of any registered public
      accounting firm engaged for the purposes of preparing or issuing an audit
      report or performing any other audit review (including resolution of
      disagreements between management, including the Manager, and the auditor
      regarding financial reporting), or attestation services for the Company,
      and each such registered public accounting firm shall report directly to
      the Audit Committee.

            The Audit Committee shall review the Company's financial disclosure
      documents, significant developments in accounting principles and
      significant proposed changes in financial statements and any auditors'
      attestation report on management's assessment of the Company's internal
      controls and financial reporting to be included in the Company's annual
      report to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in
      accordance with the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations. The Audit
      Committee shall also review and monitor the Company's codes of conduct to
      guard against significant conflicts of interest and dishonest, unethical
      or illegal activities. The Audit Committee shall review periodically the
      performance of the Company's accounting and financial personnel and shall
      review material litigation and regulatory proceedings and other issues
      relating to potentially significant corporate liability.

            The Audit Committee will also be designated as and serve as the
      qualified legal compliance committee for the Company in accordance with
      the provisions of Section 307 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and the
      Rules and Regulations and will be responsible, upon receipt of a report of
      evidence of a material legal violation, for notifying the Chief Executive
      Officer or General Counsel of such report, investigating and recommending
      appropriate measures to the Board of Directors and, if the Company does
      not appropriately respond, taking further appropriate action, including
      notification to the Securities and Exchange Commission.

            The Audit Committee shall establish procedures for: (a) the receipt,
      retention and treatment of complaints received by the Company regarding
      accounting, internal accounting controls or auditing matters, and (b) the
      submission by employees of the Company and others, on a confidential and
      anonymous basis, of concerns regarding questionable accounting or auditing
      matters.

            The Audit Committee shall have the authority to engage independent
      counsel and other advisors, as it determines necessary, to carry out its
      duties.

            The Company shall provide appropriate funding, as determined by the
      Audit Committee, in its capacity as a committee of the Board of Directors
      for payment of:

                  (A)   compensation to any registered public accounting firm
                        engaged for the purpose of preparing or issuing an audit
                        report or performing other audit, review or attest
                        services for the Company;

                  (B)   compensation to independent counsel and other advisors
                        engaged pursuant to the above paragraph; and

<PAGE>

                  (C)   ordinary administrative expenses of the Audit Committee
                        that are necessary or appropriate in carrying out its
                        duties.

            (iii) Compensation Committee. The Board of Directors, by resolution
      adopted by a majority of the Entire Board of Directors, will designate a
      Compensation Committee comprised solely of Independent Directors. The
      Compensation Committee shall be responsible for reviewing the performance
      of the Manager pursuant to the terms of the Management Services Agreement,
      the remuneration of the Manager and the compensation of directors elected
      by the Members.

            (b) In addition, the Board of Directors may designate one or more
additional committees or subcommittees, with each such committee or subcommittee
consisting of such number of directors of the Company and having such powers and
authority as shall be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors.

            (c) All acts done by any committee or subcommittee within the scope
of its powers and authority pursuant to this Amended Agreement and the
resolutions adopted by the Board of Directors in accordance with the terms
hereof shall be deemed to be, and may be certified as being, done or conferred
under authority of the Board of Directors. The Secretary is empowered to certify
that any resolution duly adopted by any such committee is binding upon the
Company and to execute and deliver such certifications from time to time as may
be necessary or proper to the conduct of the business of the Company.

            (d) Regular meetings of committees shall be held at such times as
may be determined by resolution of the Board of Directors or the committee or
subcommittee in question and no notice shall be required for any regular meeting
other than such resolution. A special meeting of any committee or subcommittee
shall be called by resolution of the Board of Directors or by the Secretary upon
the request of the Chief Executive Officer, the Chairman or a majority of the
members of any committee. Notice of special meetings shall be given to each
member of the committee in the same manner as that provided for in Section 6.13
hereof.

            Section 6.19 Committee Members.

            (a) Each member of any committee of the Board of Directors shall
hold office until such member's successor is elected and has qualified, unless
such member sooner dies, resigns or is removed.

            (b) For so long as the Manager is entitled to appoint the director
of the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman pursuant to the terms of the
Management Services Agreement, and subject to the applicable qualifications or
requirements of the membership of any committee, the Manager may designate one
director to serve as the Chairman of such committee if the appointed Chairman,
and any Alternate Chairman, is unavailable for any reason. In all other cases,
the Board of Directors may designate one or more directors as alternate members
of any committee to fill any vacancy on a committee and to fill a vacant
chairmanship of a committee, occurring as a result of a member or chairman
leaving the committee, whether through death, resignation, removal or otherwise.

            Section 6.20 Committee Secretary. The Secretary of the Company shall
act as Secretary of any committee or subcommittee, unless otherwise provided by
the Board of Directors or the committee or subcommittee, as applicable.

            Section 6.21 Compensation. The directors may be paid their expenses,
if any, incurred with respect to their attendance at each meeting of the Board
of Directors and may be paid compensation as director or chairman of any
committee or subcommittee, as the case may be, as determined by the Initial
Board or the Compensation Committee, as the case may be. Members of special or
standing committees may be allowed like compensation and payment of expenses for
attending committee meetings. For so long as the Manager is entitled to appoint
a director of the Board of Directors to serve as Chairman pursuant to the terms
of the Management Services Agreement, the Chairman shall not receive any
compensation from the Company for his or her service as Chairman of the Board,
but shall be entitled to the payment of all out-of-pocket expenses incurred in
attending regular or special meetings of the Board of Directors.

            Section 6.22 Indemnification, Advances and Insurance.

            (a) Each Person who was or is made a party or is threatened to be
made a party to or is involved in any manner in any threatened, pending or
completed action, suit or proceeding, whether civil, criminal, administrative or
investigative (hereinafter, a "PROCEEDING"), by reason of the fact that he, she
or a Person of whom he or she is the legal representative is or was a director
or officer of the Company, or is or was serving at the request of the Company as
a director or officer of a Subsidiary of the Company, if the Person acted in
good faith and in a manner the Person reasonably believed to be in or not
opposed to the best interests of the Company, and, with respect to any criminal
action or proceeding, had no reasonable cause to believe the Person's conduct
was unlawful, shall be indemnified against expenses (including attorneys' fees),
judgments, fines and amounts paid in settlement actually and reasonably incurred
by the Person in connection with such proceeding, and held harmless by the
Company to the fullest extent permitted from time to time by the General
Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as the same exists or may hereafter be
amended (but, if permitted by applicable law, in the case of any such amendment,
only to the extent that such amendment permits the Company to provide broader
indemnification rights than said law permitted the Company to provide prior to
such amendment) or any other applicable laws as presently or hereafter in
effect, and such indemnification shall continue as to a Person who has ceased to
be a director or officer and shall inure to the benefit of his or her heirs,
executors and administrators; provided, however, that the Company shall
indemnify any such Person seeking indemnification in connection with a
proceeding (or part thereof) initiated by such Person only if such proceeding
(or part thereof) was authorized by the Board of Directors or is a proceeding to
enforce such Person's claim to indemnification pursuant to the rights granted by
this Amended Agreement. The Company shall pay the expenses (including attorneys'
fees) incurred by such Person in defending any such proceeding in advance of its
final disposition upon receipt (unless the Company upon authorization of the
Board of Directors waives such requirement to the extent permitted by applicable
law) of an undertaking by or on behalf of such Person to repay such amount if it
shall ultimately be determined by final judicial decision from which there is no
further right of appeal that such Person is not entitled to be indemnified by
the Company as authorized in this Amended Agreement or otherwise.

<PAGE>

            With respect to any Person who is a present or former director of
the Company, the undertaking required by this Section 6.22(a) shall be an
unlimited general obligation but need not be secured and shall be accepted
without reference to financial ability to make repayment, provided, however,
that such present or former director of the Company does not transfer assets
with the intent of avoiding such repayment. With respect to any Person who is a
present or former director of the Company, the provisions of Section 6.22(b)
relating to a determination that indemnification is proper in the circumstances
shall not be a condition to such Person's right to receive advances pursuant to
this Section 6.22(a).

            (b) Any indemnification of a present or former director or officer
under this Section 6.22 shall be made by the Company only as authorized in the
specific case upon a determination that indemnification of the present or former
director or officer is proper in the circumstances because the Person has met
the applicable standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.3 or the applicable
section of Article 7, as the case may be, and acted in good faith and in a
manner the Person reasonably believed to be in, or not opposed to, the best
interests of the Company and, with respect to any criminal action or proceeding,
had no reasonable cause to believe that its conduct was unlawful. Such
determination shall be made, with respect to a Person who is a director or
officer at the time of such determination, (1) by a majority vote of the
directors who are not parties to such action, suit or proceeding, even though
less than a quorum, (2) by a committee of such directors designated by a
majority vote of such directors, even though less than a quorum, (3) if there
are no such directors, or if a majority, even though less than a quorum, of such
directors so direct, by independent legal counsel in a written opinion, or (4)
by the Members. The indemnification and the advancement of expenses incurred in
defending a proceeding prior to its final disposition provided by or granted
pursuant to this Amended Agreement shall not be exclusive of any other right
which any Person may have or hereafter acquire under any statute, provision of
the Certificate, other provision of this Amended Agreement, vote of Members or
Disinterested Directors (as defined below) or otherwise. No repeal, modification
or amendment of, or adoption of any provision inconsistent with, this Section
6.22, nor, to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, any modification
of law, shall adversely affect any right or protection of any Person granted
pursuant hereto existing at, or with respect to any events that occurred prior
to, the time of such repeal, amendment, adoption or modification.

            (c) The Company may maintain insurance, at its expense, to protect
itself and any Person who is or was a director, officer, partner, Member,
employee or agent of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company or of another
corporation, partnership, limited liability company, joint venture, trust or
other enterprise against any expense, liability or loss, whether or not the
Company would have the power to indemnify such Person against such expense,
liability or loss under the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware or
the Act.

            (d) The Company may, to the extent authorized from time to time by
the Board of Directors, grant rights to indemnification, and rights to be paid
by the Company the expenses incurred in defending any proceeding in advance of
its final disposition, to any Person who is or was an employee or agent of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company (other than those Persons indemnified
pursuant to clause (a) of this Section 6.22) and to any Person who is or was
serving at the request of the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company as a
director, officer, partner, member, employee or agent of another corporation,
partnership, limited

<PAGE>

liability company, joint venture, trust or other enterprise, including service
with respect to employee benefit plans maintained or sponsored by the Company or
a Subsidiary of the Company, to the fullest extent of the provisions of this
Amended Agreement with respect to the indemnification and advancement of
expenses of directors and officers of the Company. The payment of any amount to
any Person pursuant to this clause (d) shall subrogate the Company to any right
such Person may have against any other Person or entity.

            (e) The indemnification provided in this Section 6.22 is intended to
comply (subject to the limitations expressly provided in this Amended Agreement)
with the requirements of the General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware as
it relates to the indemnification of officers, directors, employees and agents
of a Delaware corporation and, as such (except as expressly provided in this
Amended Agreement), should be interpreted consistently with the provisions of,
and jurisprudence regarding, the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware.

            (f) Any notice, request or other communications required or
permitted to be given to the Company under this Section 6.22 shall be in writing
and either delivered in person or sent by facsimile, telex, telegram, overnight
mail or courier service, or certified or registered mail, postage prepaid,
return receipt requested, to the General Counsel or the Secretary of the Company
and shall be effective only upon receipt by the General Counsel or the
Secretary, as the case may be.

            (g) To the fullest extent permitted by the law of the State of
Delaware, each Member, director, officer, employee and agent of the Company
agrees that all actions for the advancement of expenses or indemnification
brought under this Section 6.22 or under any vote of Members or Disinterested
Directors or otherwise shall be a matter to which Section 18-111 of the Act
shall apply and which shall be brought in the Court of Chancery of the State of
Delaware. The Court of Chancery may summarily determine the Company's
obligations to advance expenses (including attorneys' fees).

            (h) For purposes of this Section 6.22, "DISINTERESTED DIRECTOR"
means a director of the Company who is not and was not a party to the proceeding
or matter in respect of which indemnification is sought by the claimant.

            Section 6.23 Reliance; Limitations in Liability.

            (a) Each director of the Company shall, in the performance of such
director's duties, be fully protected in relying in good faith upon the records
of the Company and upon such information, opinions, reports or statements
presented to the Company by the Manager, or employees of the Manager, or any of
the officers of the Company, or committees of the Board of Directors, or by any
other Person as to matters the director reasonably believes are within such
other Person's professional or expert competence and who has been selected with
reasonable care by or on behalf of the Company, including, without limitation,
information, opinions, reports or statements as to the value and amount of the
assets, liabilities, profits or losses of the Company or any other facts
pertinent to the existence and amount of the assets, liabilities, profits or
losses of the Company from which distributions to Members might properly be
paid.

<PAGE>

            (b) No director shall be liable to the Company or the Members for
monetary damages for any breach of fiduciary duty by such director as a
director; provided, however, that a director shall be liable to the same extent
as if he or she were a director of a Delaware corporation pursuant to the
General Corporation Law of the State of Delaware (i) for breach of the
director's duty of loyalty to the Company or its Members, (ii) for acts or
omissions not in good faith or a knowing violation of applicable law, or (iii)
for any transaction for which the director derived an improper benefit.

            (c) A director of the Company shall not be liable to the Company,
the Manager, any Member, the Trust or any other Person for: (i) any action taken
or not taken as required by this Amended Agreement; (ii) any action taken or not
taken as permitted by this Amended Agreement and, with respect to which, such
director acted on an informed basis, in good faith and with the honest belief
that such action, taken or not taken, was in the best interests of the Company;
or (iii) the Company's compliance with an obligation incurred or the performance
of any agreement entered into prior to such director having become a director of
the Company.

            (d) Any director shall not be liable to the Company or to any other
director or Member of the Company or any such other Person for the director's
good faith reliance on the provisions of this Amended Agreement.

            (e) The debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company shall be
solely the debts, obligations and liabilities of the Company and no director
shall be obligated personally for any such debt, obligation or liability of the
Company solely by reason of being a director.

interpreted consistently with the jurisprudence regarding such fiduciary duties
of officers of a corporation under the General Corporation Law of the State of
Delaware. It shall be expressly understood that no officer of the Company owes

            Section 9.1 Rights or Powers. The Members shall not have any right
or power to take part in the management or control of the Company or its
business and affairs or to act for or bind the Company in any way.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Members have all the rights and powers
specifically set forth in this Amended Agreement, including, without limitation,
those rights and powers set forth in Section 12.1 and, to the extent not
inconsistent with this Amended Agreement, in the Act.

            Section 9.2 Annual Meetings of Members. The annual meeting of the
Members of the Company shall be held at such date, at such time and at such
place (if any) within or without the State of Delaware as may be fixed by

            Section 9.3 Special Meetings of Members. Special meetings of the
Members of the Company shall be held on such date, at such time and at such
place (if any) within or without the State of Delaware as shall be designated

Secretary, either at the direction of the Board of Directors pursuant to a
resolution adopted by the Board of Directors or by the Chairman of the Board.

            Section 9.4 Place of Meeting. The Board of Directors may designate
the place (if any) of meeting for any meeting of the Members. If no designation

meeting of Members may be held solely by means of remote communication.

            Section 9.5 Notice of Meeting.

            (a) A notice of meeting, stating the place (if any), day and hour of
the meeting, and the means of remote communication, if any, by which Members and
proxy holders may be deemed to be present in person and vote at such meeting,
shall be prepared and delivered

<PAGE>

by the Company not less than twenty (20) days and not more than sixty (60) days
before the date of the meeting, either personally, by mail or, to the extent and
in the manner permitted by applicable law, electronically, to each Member of
record. In the case of special meetings, the notice shall state the purpose or
purposes for which such special meeting is called. Such further notice shall be
given as may be required by law. Only such business shall be conducted at a
special meeting of Members as shall have been brought before the meeting
pursuant to the Company's notice of meeting. Any previously scheduled meeting of
the Members may be postponed, and (unless this Amended Agreement otherwise
provides) any special meeting of the Members may be canceled, by resolution of
the Board of Directors upon public notice given prior to the time previously
scheduled for such meeting of Members.

            (b) Notice to Members shall be given personally, by mail or, to the
extent and in the manner permitted by applicable law, electronically to each
Member of record. If mailed, such notice shall be delivered by postage prepaid
envelope directed to each holder at such Member's address as it appears in the
records of the Company and shall be deemed given when deposited in the United
States mail. Notice given by electronic transmission pursuant to this subsection
shall be deemed given: (1) if by facsimile telecommunication, when directed to a
facsimile telecommunication number at which the Member has consented to receive
notice; (2) if by electronic mail, when directed to an electronic mail address
at which the Member has consented to receive notice; (3) if by posting on an
electronic network together with separate notice to the Member of such specific
posting, upon the later of (A) such posting and (B) the giving of such separate
notice; and (4) if by any other form of electronic transmission, when directed
to the Member. An affidavit of the Secretary or an assistant Secretary or of the
Transfer Agent or other agent of the Company that the notice has been given by
personal delivery, mail or a form of electronic transmission shall, in the
absence of fraud, be prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein.

            (c) Notice of any meeting of Members need not be given to any Member
if waived by such Member either in a writing signed by such Member or by
electronic transmission, whether such waiver is given before or after such
meeting is held. If such a waiver is given by electronic transmission, the
electronic transmission must either set forth or be submitted with information
from which it can be determined that the electronic transmission was authorized
by the Member.

            (d) In order that the Company may determine the Members entitled to
notice of or to vote at any meeting of Members or any adjournment thereof, the
Board of Directors may fix a record date, which record date shall not precede
the date upon which the resolution fixing the record date is adopted by the
Board of Directors, and which record date shall not be more than sixty (60) or
fewer than ten (10) days before the date of such meeting. If no record date is
fixed by the Board of Directors, the record date for determining Members
entitled to notice of or to vote at any meeting of Members or any adjournment
thereof shall be at the close of business on the day next preceding the day on
which notice is given or, if notice is waived, at the close of business on the
day next preceding the day on which the meeting is held.

            Section 9.6 Quorum and Adjournment. Except as otherwise provided by
law or by the Certificate or this Amended Agreement, the Members present in
person or by proxy holding a majority of the outstanding LLC Interests entitled
to vote, shall constitute a quorum at

<PAGE>

a meeting of Members. The Chairman of the Board or the holders of a majority of
the LLC Interests entitled to vote so represented may adjourn the meeting from
time to time, whether or not there is such a quorum. The Members present at a
duly organized meeting at which a quorum is present in person or by proxy may
continue to transact business until adjournment, notwithstanding the withdrawal
of enough Members to leave less than a quorum.

            When a meeting is adjourned to another time and place, if any,
unless otherwise provided by this Amended Agreement, notice need not be given of
the reconvened meeting if the date, time and place, if any, thereof and the
means of remote communication, if any, by which Members and proxyholders may be
deemed to be present in person and vote at such reconvened meeting are announced
at the meeting at which the adjournment is taken. At the reconvened meeting, the
Members may transact any business that might have been transacted at the
original meeting. A determination of Members of record entitled to notice of or
to vote at a meeting of Members shall apply to any adjournment of such meeting;
provided, however, that the Board of Directors may fix a new record date for the
reconvened meeting. If an adjournment is for more than thirty (30) days or if,
after an adjournment, a new record date is fixed for the reconvened meeting, a
notice of the reconvened meeting shall be given to each Member entitled to vote
at the meeting.

            Section 9.7 Proxies. For so long as the Trust is the sole Member,
actions by Members required to be taken hereunder will be taken by the Trust
pursuant to instructions given to the Trust by the holders of the Trust Stock in
accordance with the Trust Agreement or otherwise pursuant to terms set forth in
the Trust Agreement. At all meetings of Members, a Member may vote by proxy as
may be permitted by law; provided that no proxy shall be voted after three (3)
years from its date, unless the proxy provides for a longer period in accordance
with the Trust Agreement. Any proxy to be used at a meeting of Members must be
filed with the Secretary of the Company or his or her representative at or
before the time of the meeting.

            (a) Annual Meetings of Members.

            (i) Except in the case of the Initial Board, nominations of
      individuals for election to the Board of Directors of the Company, other

      the meeting, who complies with the notice procedures set forth in clauses
      (ii) and (iii) of this Section 9.8(a).

            In addition to any other applicable requirements, for a nomination
      for election of a director to be made by a Member or for business to be
      properly brought before an annual meeting by a Member, such Member must
      (A) be a Member of record on both (1) the date of the delivery of such
      nomination or the date of the giving of the notice provided for in this
      Section 9.8(a) and (2) the record date for the determination of Members

<PAGE>

      entitled to vote at such annual meeting, and (B) have given timely notice
      thereof in proper written form in accordance with the requirements of this
      Section 9.8 (a) to the Secretary.

            (ii) For nominations or other business to be properly brought before
      an annual meeting by a Member pursuant to clause (C) of paragraph (a)(i)
      of this Section 9.8, the Member must have given timely notice thereof in
      writing to the Secretary of the Company and, in the case of business other
      than nominations, such other business must otherwise be a proper matter

      for director or specifying the size of the increased Board of Directors
      made by the Company at least one hundred (100) days prior to the first
      anniversary of the preceding year's annual meeting, a Member's notice
      required by this Section 9.8 shall also be considered timely, but only

      if it shall be delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive
      offices of the Company not later than the close of business on the

purpose of electing one or more directors to the Board of Directors, any such
Member may nominate such number of individuals for election to such position(s)
as are specified in the Company's Notice of Meeting, if the Member's notice as
required by clause (ii) of Section 9.8(a) of this Amended Agreement shall be
delivered to the Secretary at the principal executive offices of the Company not
earlier than the one hundred and twentieth (120th) day prior to such special

            (c) General.

            (i) Only individuals who are nominated in accordance with the
      procedures set forth in this Section 9.8 shall be eligible to be elected

      meeting in accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.8.
      Except as otherwise provided by applicable law or this Section 9.8, the
      Chairman shall have the power and duty to determine whether a nomination
      or any business proposed to be brought before the meeting was made in
      accordance with the procedures set forth in this Section 9.8 and, if any
      proposed nomination or business is not in compliance with this Section
      9.8, to declare that such defective proposal or nomination shall be

      publicly filed by the Company with the Securities and Exchange Commission
      pursuant to Section 13, 14 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.

            (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 9.8,
      a Member shall also comply with all applicable requirements of the
      Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations thereunder with respect to the
      matters set forth in this Section 9.8. Nothing in this Section 9.8 shall

      proposals in the Company's proxy statement pursuant to Rule 14a-8 under
      the Exchange Act.

            Section 9.9 Procedure for Election of Directors; Voting. The
election of directors submitted to Members at any meeting shall be decided by a
plurality of the votes cast thereon. Except as otherwise provided by law or this
Amended Agreement, all matters other than the election of directors submitted to
the Members at any meeting shall be decided by the affirmative vote of a
majority of the LLC Interests present in person or represented by proxy at the
meeting of Members.

            The vote on any matter at a meeting, including the election of

voting, or by such Member's proxy, and shall state the number of LLC Interests
voted.

            Section 9.10 Inspectors of Elections; Opening and Closing the Polls.

            (a) If the Trust is not the sole owner of LLC Interests, the Board
of Directors by resolution shall appoint one or more inspectors, which inspector
or inspectors shall not be directors, officers or employees of the Company, to
act at the meeting and make a written report thereof. One or more individuals
may be designated as alternate inspectors to replace any inspector who fails to
act. If no inspector or alternate has been so appointed to act, or if all
inspectors or alternates who have been appointed are unable to act, at a meeting
of Members, the Chairman of the Board shall appoint one or more inspectors to
act at the meeting. Each such inspector, before discharging his or her duties,
shall take and sign an oath faithfully to execute the duties of inspector with
strict impartiality and according to the best of his or her ability. The
inspectors shall have the duties prescribed by the General Corporation Law of
the State of Delaware as if the Company were a Delaware corporation.

            (b) If the Trust is not the sole owner of LLC Interests, the
Chairman of the Board shall fix and announce at the meeting the date and time of
the opening and the closing of the polls for each matter upon which the Members
will vote at the meeting.

            Section 9.11 Confidential Member Voting. If the Trust is not the
sole owner of the LLC Interests, all proxies, ballots and votes, in each case to
the extent they disclose the specific vote of an identified Member, shall be
tabulated and certified by an independent tabulator, inspector of elections
and/or other independent parties and shall not be disclosed to any director,
officer or employee of the Company; provided, however, that, notwithstanding the

<PAGE>

foregoing, any and all proxies, ballots and voting tabulations may be disclosed:
(a) as necessary to meet legal requirements or to assist in the pursuit or
defense of legal action; (b) if the Company concludes in good faith that a bona
fide dispute exists as to the authenticity of one or more proxies, ballots or
votes, or as to the accuracy of any tabulation of such proxies, ballots or
votes; (c) in the event of a proxy, consent or other solicitation in opposition
to the voting recommendation of the Board of Directors; and (d) if a Member
requests or consents to disclosure of such Member's vote or writes comments on
such Member's proxy card or ballot.

            Section 9.12 Waiver of Notice. Whenever any notice is required to be
given to any Member by the terms of this Amended Agreement, a waiver thereof in
writing, signed by the Person or Persons entitled to such notice, or a waiver
thereof by electronic transmission by the Person or Persons entitled to notice,
whether before or after the time stated therein, shall be deemed equivalent to
the giving of such notice. Neither the business to be transacted at, nor the
purpose of, any annual or special meeting of the Members need be specified in
any written waiver of notice or any waiver by electronic transmission of such
meeting.

            Section 9.13 Remote Communication. For the purposes of this Amended
Agreement, if authorized by the Board of Directors in its sole discretion, and
subject to such guidelines and procedures as the Board of Directors may adopt,
Members and proxyholders may, by means of remote communication:

            (a) participate in a meeting of Members; and

            (b) be deemed present in person and vote at a meeting of Members,
      whether such meeting is to be held at a designated place or solely by
      means of remote communication,

provided, however, that (i) the Company shall implement reasonable measures to
verify that each Person deemed present and permitted to vote at the meeting by
means of remote communication is a Member or proxyholder, (ii) the Company shall
implement reasonable measures to provide such Members and proxyholders a
reasonable opportunity to participate in the meeting and to vote on matters
submitted to the Members, including an opportunity to read or hear the
proceedings of the meeting substantially concurrently with such proceedings, and
(iii) if any Member or proxyholder votes or takes other action at the meeting by
means of remote communication, a record of such vote or other action shall be
maintained by the Company.

            Section 9.14 Member Action Without a Meeting. For so long as the
Trust remains the sole Member of the Company, the Trust shall take any action
required or permitted to be taken at any meeting of Members, by executing a
written consent that shall reflect the vote of the holders of Trust Stock as
required by the terms of the Trust Agreement, without such meeting, without
prior notice, and without a vote. Upon request by the Company, proxy materials
completed by the holders of Trust Stock with at least the minimum number of
votes required to constitute an affirmative vote of the holders of Trust Stock
under the Trust Agreement shall be delivered to the Company indicating the vote
or action being approved or disapproved by such holders with respect to those
matters reserved to the Members of the Company by this Amended Agreement. If the
Trust is not the sole owner of the LLC Interests,
<PAGE>

Members of the Company shall take any action required or permitted only at a
meeting of Members duly called and noticed.

            Section 9.15 Return on Capital Contribution. Except as otherwise
provided in Article 14 hereof, no Member shall demand a return on or of its

Agreement.

            Section 9.17 Member Liability. No Member shall be liable under a
judgment, decree or order of a court, or in any other manner, for the Debts or
any other obligations or liabilities of the Company. A Member shall be liable
only to make its Capital Contributions and shall not be required to restore a
deficit balance in its Capital Account or to lend any funds to the Company or,
after its Capital Contributions have been made, to make any additional
contributions, assessments or payments to the Company, provided, however, that a
Member may be required to repay any dividend or other distribution made to it in
contravention of Section 5.3 hereof or Sections 18-607 or 18-804 of the Act. The
Manager shall not have any personal liability for the repayment of any Capital
Contributions of any Member.

            Section 9.18 Disclosure Requirements for Members Holding Ten Percent
or More of the Outstanding LLC Interests. To ensure the Company's compliance
with its obligations under the Use Agreement, in the event the Company or any
Subsidiary thereof, or both, is required to obtain the approval of the City of
Chicago (for any department or agency thereof) for any specific matter,
including, but not limited to, the amendment of the Use Agreement, or otherwise
determines to request that the City of Chicago (or any department or agency
thereof) take action with respect to any matter, the Company shall deliver to
the Transfer Agent notice of such approval requirement or request for action and

the mailing of such notice, each Ten Percent Holder shall provide to the Company
for filing with the City of Chicago a completed City of Chicago Economic
Disclosure Statement and Affidavit, a standard form of which is attached hereto
as Exhibit B. Each Ten Percent Holder shall provide any supplemental statements,
affidavits or material required to update any Economic Disclosure Statement and
Affidavit filed with the City of Chicago as required by the City of Chicago and

and the number of LLC Interests registered in the name of each Member. Such list
shall be open to the examination of any Member, for any purpose germane to the
meeting for a period of at least ten (10) days prior to the meeting: (i) on a
reasonably accessible electronic network, provided that the information required
to gain access to such list is provided with the notice of the meeting, or (ii)
during ordinary business hours, at the principal place of business of the
Company. In the event that the Company determines to make the list available on
an electronic network, the Company may take reasonable steps to ensure that such
information is available only to Members. The list shall be produced and kept at
the time and place of the meeting during the whole time thereof, and may be
inspected by any Member who is present.

            Any Member, in person or by attorney or other agent, shall, upon
written demand stating the purpose thereof, have the right during the usual
business hours to inspect for any proper purpose, and to make copies and
extracts from: (1) the Register, a list of the Members, and its other books and
records; and (2) a Subsidiary of the Company's books and records or copies
thereof in electronic form, to the extent that (i) the Company has actual
possession and control of such records of such Subsidiary, or (ii) the Company
could obtain such records through the exercise of control over such Subsidiary,
provided that as of the date of the making of the demand (A) Member inspection
of such books and records of such Subsidiary would not constitute a breach of an
agreement between the Company or such Subsidiary and a Person or Persons not
Affiliated with the Company, and (B) such Subsidiary would not have the right
under the law applicable to it to deny the Company access to such books and
records upon demand by the Company. In every instance where the beneficial
holder of LLC Interests is not a holder of record, the demand shall state the
Person's status as a beneficial holder of LLC Interests, be accompanied by
documentary evidence of beneficial ownership of LLC Interests,
<PAGE>

and state that such documentary evidence is a true and correct copy of what it
purports to be. A proper purpose shall mean a purpose reasonably related to such
Person's interest as a Member or beneficial holder of LLC Interests.

      supporting schedules, all of which shall be audited and certified by the
      Company's accountants, and in each case, to the extent the Company was in
      existence, setting forth in comparative form the corresponding figures for
      the immediately preceding Fiscal Year end (in the case of the balance
      sheet) and the two (2) immediately preceding Fiscal Years (in the case of
      the statements); and

to the Company's U.S. federal, state, local or foreign tax returns; and (y) to
the extent provided in Code Sections 6221 through 6231 and similar provisions of

to file any tax returns and execute any agreements or other documents relating
to or affecting such tax matters, including agreements or other documents that
bind the Members with respect to such tax matters or otherwise affect the rights
of the Company and the Members. The Manager is specifically authorized to act as
the "TAX MATTERS MEMBER" under the Code and in any similar capacity under state
or local law.

            (b) In circumstances where the Trust has been dissolved, the Board
of Directors may, by the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the Entire
Board of Directors, and without any further consent of the Members being
required, cause the Company to elect to be treated as a corporation for U.S.
federal income tax purposes, provided, however, that such action shall be taken
only if (i) the Board of Directors first obtains an opinion from a nationally
recognized financial advisor to the effect that it expects the market valuation
of the Company to be significantly lower as a result of the Company continuing
to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes than if the
Company instead elected to be treated as a corporation for U.S. federal income
tax purposes and (ii) the effective date for such election is no earlier than
the date on which the Trust has been dissolved pursuant to clause (i) of Section
10.02 of the Trust Agreement.

                                   AMENDMENTS

            Section 12.1 Amendments. The Board of Directors is authorized to
amend the terms of this Amended Agreement by resolution adopted by the
affirmative vote of a majority of the Entire Board of Directors; provided,
however, that Sections 1.3, 2.4, 2.5, 3.1, 8.6, 14.1(a)(i), this Section 12.1
and Article 10 hereof may not be amended without the affirmative vote of a
<PAGE>

majority of the LLC Interests present in person or represented by proxy at a
meeting of Members; provided further, however, that for so long as the
Management Services Agreement is in effect, Section 6.9 and Article 8 and this
Section 12.1 may not be amended without the prior written consent of the
Manager.

                                   ARTICLE 13

                         TRANSFERS; MONTHLY ALLOCATIONS

            Section 13.1 Distributions and Allocations in Respect of LLC
Interests. Profits, Losses, each item thereof and all other items attributable
to LLC Interests for any Allocation Year shall, for U.S. federal income tax
purposes, be determined on an annual basis and prorated on a monthly basis and
the pro rata portion for each month shall be allocated to those Persons who are
Members as of the close of the NYSE on the last day of the preceding month. With
respect to any LLC Interest that was not treated as outstanding as of the close
of the NYSE on the last day of the preceding month, the first Person who is
treated as the Member with respect to such LLC Interest will be treated as the
Member with respect to such LLC Interest for this purpose as of the close of the
NYSE on the last day of the preceding month. All dividends or other
distributions on or before the date of a Transfer of LLC Interests shall be made
to the transferor, and all dividends or other distributions thereafter shall be
made to the transferee. The Board of Directors may revise, alter or otherwise
modify such methods of allocation as it determines necessary, to the extent
permitted or required by Code Section 706 and the Regulations or rulings
promulgated thereunder.

                                   ARTICLE 14

                           DISSOLUTION AND WINDING-UP

            Section 14.1 Dissolution Events.

            (a) Dissolution. The Company shall dissolve and shall commence
winding up and liquidating upon the first to occur of any of the following (each
a "DISSOLUTION EVENT"):

            (i) the Board of Directors adopts a resolution, by the affirmative
      vote of at least a majority of the Entire Board of Directors, approving
      the dissolution, winding-up and liquidation of the Company and such action
      has been approved by the affirmative vote of the holders of a majority of
      the LLC Interests outstanding and entitled to vote thereon;

            (ii) the unanimous vote of the Members to dissolve, wind up and
      liquidate the Company; or

            (iii) a judicial determination that an event has occurred that makes
      it unlawful, impossible or impractical to carry on the business of the
      Company as then currently operated as determined in accordance with
      Section 18-802 of the Act.
<PAGE>

The Members hereby agree that, notwithstanding any provision of the Act, the
Company shall not dissolve prior to the occurrence of a Dissolution Event.

            (b) Reconstitution. If it is determined by a court of competent
jurisdiction that the Company has dissolved prior to the occurrence of a
Dissolution Event, then, within an additional ninety (90) days after such
determination (the "RECONSTITUTION PERIOD"), all of the Members may elect to
reconstitute the Company and continue its business on the same terms and
conditions set forth in this Amended Agreement by forming a new limited
liability company on terms identical to those set forth in this Amended
Agreement. Unless such an election is made within the Reconstitution Period, the
Company shall liquidate and wind up its affairs in accordance with Section 14.2
hereof. If such an election is made within the Reconstitution Period, then:

            (i) the reconstituted limited liability company shall continue until
      the occurrence of a Dissolution Event as provided in Section 14.1(a)
      hereof; and

            (ii) unless otherwise agreed to by a majority of the Members, the
      Certificate, and this Amended Agreement shall automatically constitute the
      Certificate and Amended Agreement of such new Company; all of the assets
      and liabilities of the dissolved Company shall be deemed to have been
      automatically assigned, assumed, conveyed and transferred to the new
      Company; and no bond, collateral, assumption or release of any Member's or
      the Company's liabilities shall be required;

provided that the right of the Members to select replacement managers and to
reconstitute and continue the business shall not exist and may not be exercised
unless the Company has received an opinion of counsel that the exercise of such
right would not result in the loss of limited liability of any Member and
neither the Company nor the reconstituted limited liability company would cease
to be treated as a partnership for U.S. federal income tax purposes upon the
exercise of such right to continue.

            Section 14.2 Winding-Up. Upon the occurrence of (i) a Dissolution
Event or (ii) the determination by a court of competent jurisdiction that the
Company has dissolved prior to the occurrence of a Dissolution Event (unless the
Company is reconstituted pursuant to Section 14.1(b) hereof), the Company shall
continue solely for the purposes of winding up its affairs in an orderly manner,
liquidating its assets, and satisfying the claims of its creditors and Members,
and no Member shall take any action that is inconsistent with, or not necessary
to or appropriate for, the winding-up of the Company's business and affairs,
provided, however, that all covenants contained in this Amended Agreement and
obligations provided for in this Amended Agreement shall continue to be fully
binding upon the Members until such time as the Property has been distributed
pursuant to this Section 14.2 and the Certificate has been canceled pursuant to
the Act. The Liquidator shall be responsible for overseeing the winding-up and
dissolution of the Company, which winding-up and dissolution shall be completed
no later than ninety (90) days after the later of (i) the occurrence of the
Dissolution Event and (ii) the last day on which the Company may be
reconstituted pursuant to Section 14.1(b) hereof. The Liquidator shall take full
account of the Company's liabilities and Property and shall cause the Property
or the proceeds from the sale thereof (as determined pursuant to Section 14.9
hereof), to the extent
<PAGE>

sufficient therefor, to be applied and distributed, to the maximum extent
permitted by law, in the following order:

            (a) First, to creditors (including the Manager and the Members who
      are creditors, to the extent otherwise permitted by law) in satisfaction
      of all of the Company's Debts and other liabilities (whether by payment or
      the making of reasonable provision for payment thereof), other than
      liabilities for which reasonable provision for payment has been made and
      liabilities for distribution to Members under Section 18-601 or 18-604 of
      the Act;

            (b) Second, except as provided in this Amended Agreement, to Members
      and former Members of the Company in satisfaction of liabilities for
      distribution under Section 18-601 or 18-604 of the Act; and

            (c) The balance, if any, to the Members in accordance with the
      positive balance in their Capital Accounts, after giving effect to all
      contributions, distributions and allocations for all periods.

No Member or Manager shall receive additional compensation for any services
performed pursuant to this Article 14.

            Section 14.3 Compliance with Certain Requirements of Regulations;
Deficit Capital Accounts. In the event the Company is "liquidated" within the
meaning of Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g), distributions shall be made
pursuant to this Article 14 to the Members who have positive Capital Accounts in
compliance with Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(b)(2). If any Member has a
deficit balance in its Capital Account (after giving effect to all
contributions, distributions and allocations for all Allocation Years, including
the Allocation Year during which such liquidation occurs), such Member shall
have no obligation to make any contribution to the capital of the Company with
respect to such deficit, and such deficit shall not be considered a debt owed to
the Company or to any other Person for any purpose whatsoever. In the discretion
of the Liquidator, a pro rata portion of the distributions that would otherwise
be made to the Members pursuant to this Article 14 may be:

            (a) Distributed to a trust established for the benefit of the
      Members for the purposes of liquidating Company assets, collecting amounts
      owed to the Company, and paying any contingent or unforeseen liabilities
      or obligations of the Company; the assets of any such trust shall be
      distributed to the Members from time to time, in the reasonable discretion
      of the Liquidator, in the same proportions as the amount distributed to
      such trust by the Company would otherwise have been distributed to the
      Members pursuant to Section 14.2 hereof; or

            (b) Withheld to provide a reasonable reserve for Company liabilities
      (contingent or otherwise) and to reflect the unrealized portion of any
      installment obligations owed to the Company, provided, however, that such
      withheld amounts shall be distributed to the Members as soon as
      practicable.

            Section 14.4 Deemed Distribution and Recontribution. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Article 14, in the event the Company is liquidated
within the meaning of
<PAGE>

Regulations Section 1.704-1(b)(2)(ii)(g) but no Dissolution Event has occurred,
the Property shall not be liquidated, the Company's Debts and other Liabilities
shall not be paid or discharged, and the Company's affairs shall not be wound
up. Instead, solely for U.S. federal income tax purposes, the Company shall be
deemed to have contributed all its Property and liabilities to a new limited
liability company in exchange for an interest in such new company and,
immediately thereafter, the Company will be deemed to liquidate by distributing
interests in the new company to the Members.

            Section 14.5 Rights of Members. Except as otherwise provided in this
Amended Agreement, each Member shall look solely to the Property of the Company
for the return of its Capital Contribution and has no right or power to demand
or receive Property other than cash from the Company. If the assets of the
Company remaining after payment or discharge of the debts or liabilities of the
Company are insufficient to return such Capital Contribution, the Members shall
have no recourse against the Company or any other Member or the Manager.

            Section 14.6 Notice of Dissolution/Termination.

            (a) In the event a Dissolution Event occurs or an event occurs that
would, but for the provisions of Section 14.1 hereof, result in a dissolution of
the Company, the Board of Directors shall, within thirty (30) days thereafter,
provide written notice thereof to each of the Members and to all other parties
with whom the Company regularly conducts business (as determined in the
discretion of the Board of Directors) and shall publish notice thereof in a
newspaper of general circulation in each place in which the Company regularly
conducts business (as determined in the discretion of the Board of Directors).

            (b) Upon completion of the distribution of the Company's Property as
provided in this Article 14, the Company shall be terminated, and the Board of
Directors shall cause the filing of the Certificate of Cancellation pursuant to
Section 18-203 of the Act and shall take all such other actions as may be
necessary to terminate the Company.

            Section 14.7 Allocations During Period of Liquidation. During the
period commencing on the first day of the Fiscal Year during which a Dissolution
Event occurs and ending on the date on which all of the assets of the Company
have been distributed to the Members pursuant to Section 14.2 hereof (the
"LIQUIDATION PERIOD"), the Members shall continue to share Profits, Losses,
gain, loss and other items of Company income, gain, loss or deduction in the
manner provided in Article 4 hereof.

            Section 14.8 Character of Liquidating Distributions. All payments
made in liquidation of the interest of a Member in the Company shall be made in
exchange for the interest of such Member in Property pursuant to Section
736(b)(1) of the Code, including the interest of such Member in Company
goodwill.

            Section 14.9 The Liquidator.

            (a) Definition. The "LIQUIDATOR" shall mean a Person appointed by
the Board of Directors to oversee the liquidation of the Company.

<PAGE>

            (b) Fees. The Company is authorized to pay a reasonable fee to the
Liquidator for its services performed pursuant to this Article 14 and to
reimburse the Liquidator for its reasonable costs and expenses incurred in
performing those services.

            (c) Indemnification. The Company shall indemnify, hold harmless and
pay all judgments and claims against the Liquidator or any officers, directors,
agents or employees of the Liquidator relating to any liability or damage
incurred by reason of any act performed or omitted to be performed by the
Liquidator or any officers, directors, agents or employees of the Liquidator in
connection with the liquidation of the Company, including reasonable attorneys'
fees incurred by the Liquidator, officer, director, agent or employee in
connection with the defense of any action based on any such act or omission,
which attorneys' fees may be paid as incurred, except to the extent such
liability or damage is caused by the fraud or intentional misconduct of, or a
knowing violation of the laws by, the Liquidator which was material to the cause
of action.

            Section 14.10 Form of Liquidating Distributions. For purposes of
making distributions required by Section 14.2 hereof, the Liquidator may
determine whether to distribute all or any portion of the Property in kind or to
sell all or any portion of the Property and distribute the proceeds therefrom.

                                   SECTION 2
                      REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT

            2.1 The Company agrees to file under the Securities Act, as soon as
reasonably possible after the first anniversary of the closing of the Offering
or, with respect to the offer and sale of the Formation Shares, the Additional
Initial Investment or any Management Fee Investments, at such earlier time as
the Manager reasonably requests, a Shelf Registration Statement (the "Initial

continuous or delayed basis (including through brokers and dealers) by the
Manager, of the Registrable Shares it owns on such filing date, pursuant to Rule
415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission. The Company
agrees to use its best efforts to cause the Initial Shelf Registration Statement

Initial Shelf Registration Statement and to keep the Initial Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective throughout the Effective Period subject to
Section 4.2.

subsequent Shelf Registration Statements (each, a "Subsequent Shelf Registration
Statement") (which may include Registrable Securities covered by a prior Shelf
Registration Statement) providing for the registration, and the sale on a
continuous or delayed basis (including through brokers and dealers) by the
Manager, of all such Registrable Shares, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar
rule that may be adopted by the Commission;

                                        5
<PAGE>

provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file more than
four (4) such subsequent Shelf Registration Statements in any twelve-month
period. The Company agrees to use its best efforts to cause each Subsequent
Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective as soon as
possible after the filing of the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement and to
keep the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective
throughout the Effective Period subject to Section 4.2.

            The Manager shall be named as a selling security holder in such
Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus in such a manner as to
permit the Manager to deliver such Prospectus to purchasers of Registrable
Shares in accordance with applicable law.

            2.2 The Company further agrees that it shall cause each Shelf
Registration Statement and the related Prospectus, and any amendment or
supplement thereto, as of the effective date of such Shelf Registration
Statement or such amendment or supplement, (i) to comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act; and (ii) not to
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein (in the case of the related Prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading. If any Shelf Registration Statement,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, ceases to be effective for any
reason at any time during an Effective Period (other than because all
Registrable Shares registered thereunder shall have been sold pursuant thereto
or shall have otherwise ceased to be Registrable Shares), the Company shall use
its best efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness thereof.

            2.3 The Manager agrees that if it wishes to sell Registrable Shares
pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus, it will do so
only in accordance with this Section 2.3. The Manager agrees to deliver a Notice
and Questionnaire, a form of which is attached as Schedule 1 to this Agreement
(the "Notice and Questionnaire"), to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the filing of any Shelf Registration Statement.

                                   SECTION 3
                             PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION

            3.1 Right to Piggyback.

            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at any time after
the closing of the Offering, whenever the Company proposes to register, either
for its own account or the account of a security holder or holders, any shares
of Trust Stock under the Securities Act and the form of registration statement
(the "Company Registration Statement") to be used, may be used for the
registration of Registrable Shares (a "Piggyback Registration"), the Company
shall give prompt written notice to the Manager of the Company's intention to
effect such a registration and shall include in the Company Registration
Statement all Registrable Shares with respect to which the Manager has provided
the Company with a written request for inclusion therein within twenty (20)
calendar days after the receipt of the Company's notice.

                                        6
<PAGE>

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required
to notify the Manager or include Registrable Shares in any registration on (i)
Form S-1, S-3 or S-8, or their successor forms, under the Securities Act
relating solely to stock purchase or other equity plans, (ii) Form S-4 or
successor forms relating solely to a transaction within the scope of Rule 145,
or (iii) any other form (other than Form S-1, S-2, S-3, SB-1 or SB-2, or their
successor forms) that does not include substantially the same information as
would be required to be included in a Shelf Registration Statement covering a
registration pursuant to Section 2 above.

            (c) The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any
Company Registration Statement initiated by it under this Section 3 prior to the
effectiveness of such Company Registration Statement, whether or not the Manager
has elected to include securities in such Company Registration Statement.

            3.2 Underwriting.

            If the Company Registration Statement with respect to which the
Company gives notice is for a public offering involving an underwriting, the
Company shall so advise the Manager as a part of the written notice given
pursuant to Section 3.1(a). In such event, the right of the Manager to be named
selling security holder in a Company Registration Statement pursuant to this
Section 3 shall be conditioned upon the Manager's participation in such
underwriting and the inclusion of the Manager's Registrable Shares in the
underwriting to the extent provided herein. The Company and the Manager shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form, with the underwriters
selected by the Company.

            3.3 Cutback.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3 to the
contrary, if the representative of the underwriters determines that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the
underwriters and the Company may limit the number of Registrable Shares to be
included in the Company Registration Statement and underwriting. In the event of
any such limitation of the number of shares of Trust Stock to be underwritten,
the Company shall so advise the Manager, and the number of shares included in
such Company Registration Statement and underwriting shall be allocated first to
the Company for securities being sold for its own account and thereafter to the
Manager. If the Manager disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, it
may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the
underwriter, and such Registrable Shares shall be withdrawn from such Company
Registration Statement.

                                   SECTION 4
                             REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

            The following provisions shall apply to any Registration Statement
filed pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 hereof.

            (i) prepare and file with the Commission a Registration Statement on
      any form that may be utilized by the Company and that shall permit the
      disposition of the Registrable Shares in accordance with the intended
      method or methods thereof, as specified in writing by the Manager;

            (ii) before filing any Registration Statement or related Prospectus

      delivery of such copies to the Manager;

            (iii) (A) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
      post-effective amendments to any Registration Statement and file with the
      Commission any other required document that may be necessary to keep such
      Registration Statement continuously effective until the expiration of the
      Effective Period, subject to Section 4.2, (B) cause the related Prospectus
      to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement and, as so
      supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions
      then in force) under the Securities Act, and (C) comply with the
      provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with respect to the
      disposition of all Registrable Shares covered by a Registration Statement
      during the Effective Period in accordance with the intended methods of
      disposition by the Manager set forth in a Registration Statement as so
      amended or such Prospectus as so supplemented;

            (iv) promptly notify the Manager (A) when each Registration
      Statement or the Prospectus included therein, or any amendment or
      supplement to the Prospectus or post-effective amendment, has been filed
      with the Commission, and, with respect to each Registration Statement or
      any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (B) of
      any request, following the effectiveness of each Registration Statement,
      by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority for
      amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related
      Prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the issuance by the
      Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
      Registration Statement or the initiation or written threat of any
      proceedings for that purpose, (D) of the receipt by the Company of any
      notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
      Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
      written threat of any proceeding for such purpose, (E) of the occurrence
      of (but not the nature of or details concerning) any event or the
      existence of any fact (a "Material Event") as a result of which any
      Registration Statement shall contain any untrue statement of a material
      fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
      necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or any Prospectus
      shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
      material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
      statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
      were made, not misleading (provided, however, that no notice by the
      Company shall be required pursuant to this clause (E) in the event that
      the Company either promptly files a Prospectus supplement to update the

                                        8

      Prospectus or a Form 8-K or other appropriate Exchange Act report that is
      incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement, which, in either
      case, contains the requisite information with respect to such Material
      Event that results in such Registration Statement no longer containing any
      untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact
      necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading), (F) of
      the determination by the Company that a post-effective amendment to a
      Registration Statement will be filed with the Commission, which notice
      may, at the discretion of the Company (or as required pursuant to Section
      4.2), state that it constitutes a Deferral Notice, in which event the
      provisions of Section 4.2 shall apply or (G) at any time during which a
      Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, that a
      Registration Statement, Prospectus, Prospectus amendment or supplement or
      post-effective amendment does not conform in all material respects to the
      applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
      regulations of the Commission thereunder;

            (v) prior to any public offering of the Registrable Shares pursuant
      to a Registration Statement, use its best efforts to register or qualify
      or cooperate with the Manager in connection with the registration or
      qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of
      such Registrable Shares for offer and sale under the securities or "blue
      sky" laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Manager
      reasonably requests in writing (which request may be included in the
      Notice and Questionnaire);

            (vi) prior to any public offering of the Registrable Shares pursuant
      to a Registration Statement, use its best efforts to keep each such
      registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during
      the Effective Period in connection with the Manager's offer and sale of
      Registrable Shares pursuant to such registration or qualification (or
      exemption therefrom) and do any and all other acts or things necessary or
      advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of such
      Registrable Shares in the manner set forth in the Registration Statement
      and the related Prospectus; provided that the Company will not be required
      to (A) qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in
      any jurisdiction in which it would not otherwise be required to qualify
      but for this Agreement, (B) take any action that would subject it to
      general service of process in suits or to taxation in any such
      jurisdiction in which it is not then so subject, or (C) become subject to
      the reporting requirements of such jurisdiction;

            (vii) use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of and, if
      issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness
      of a Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment thereto, and
      to lift any suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable
      Shares for sale in any jurisdiction in which they have been qualified for
      sale, in each case at the earliest practicable date;

            (viii) upon reasonable notice, for a reasonable period prior to the
      filing of a Registration Statement, and throughout the applicable
      Effective Period, make available at reasonable times at the Company's
      principal place of business or such other reasonable place for inspection
      by a representative of any underwriter, placement agent or counsel

                                        9
<PAGE>

      appointed by the Manager in connection with an underwritten offering, such
      financial and other information and books and records of the Company, and
      cause the officers, directors, trustees and independent certified public
      accountants of the Company to respond to such inquiries, as shall be
      reasonably necessary, in the judgment of the counsel to the Manager, to
      conduct a reasonable "due diligence" investigation; provided, however,
      that each such representative appointed by the Manager in connection with
      an underwritten offering shall be required to maintain in confidence and
      not to disclose to any other person any information or records reasonably
      designated by the Company in writing as being confidential, subject to
      customary exceptions;

            (ix) if reasonably requested by the Manager, promptly incorporate in
      a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration
      Statement such information as the Manager shall, on the basis of a written
      opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters,
      determine to be required to be included therein by applicable law and make
      any required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective
      amendment; provided that the Company shall not be required to take any
      actions under this Section 4.1(viii) that are not, in the reasonable
      opinion of counsel for the Company, in compliance with applicable law;

            (x) promptly furnish to the Manager, upon its request and without
      charge, at least one (1) conformed copy of each Registration Statement and
      any amendments thereto, including financial statements but excluding
      schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
      by reference and all exhibits (unless requested in writing to the Company
      by the Manager); and

            (xi) during each Effective Period, deliver to the Manager in
      connection with any sale of Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration
      Statement, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus relating to
      such Registrable Shares (including each preliminary Prospectus) and any
      amendment or supplement thereto as the Manager may reasonably request; and
      the Company hereby consents (except during such periods in which a
      Deferral Notice is outstanding and has not been revoked or during any
      period that is not a "trading window" as defined in the Company's Insider
      Trading Policy) to the use of such Prospectus or each amendment or
      supplement thereto by the Manager in connection with any offering and sale
      of the Registrable Shares covered by such Prospectus or any amendment or
      supplement thereto in the manner set forth therein.

            4.2 Upon (i) the issuance by the Commission of a stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of
proceedings with respect to a Registration Statement under Section 8(d) or 8(e)
of the Securities Act or (ii) the occurrence of any event or the existence of
any Material Event as a result of which a Registration Statement shall contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or any Prospectus shall contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Company will (A) in the case of clause
(ii) above, subject to the third sentence of this provision, as promptly as
practicable, prepare and

                                       10
<PAGE>

file a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement
to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or
file any other required document that would be incorporated by reference into
such Registration Statement and Prospectus so that such Registration Statement
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and such Prospectus does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Shares being sold thereunder,
and, in the case of a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement, use
best efforts to cause it to be declared effective as promptly as practicable,
and (B) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, give notice to the Manager
that the availability of a Registration Statement is suspended (a "Deferral
Notice"). Upon receipt of any Deferral Notice, the Manager agrees not to sell
any Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement until the Manager's
receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided for in
clause (A) above, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the
Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in such Prospectus. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use
of the Prospectus may be resumed (x) in the case of clause (i) above, as
promptly as practicable, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, as soon as, in
the sole judgment of the Company, public disclosure of such Material Event would
not be prejudicial to or contrary to the interests of the Company or, if
necessary to avoid unreasonable burden or expense, as soon as practicable
thereafter.

            4.3 The Manager agrees that, upon receipt of any Deferral Notice
from the Company, the Manager shall forthwith discontinue (and cause any
placement or sales agent or underwriters acting on their behalf to discontinue)
the disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement
applicable to such Registrable Shares until the Manager (i) shall have received
copies of such amended or supplemented Prospectus and, if so directed by the
Company, deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other
than permanent file copies, then in the Manager's possession of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Shares at the time of receipt of such notice or (ii)
shall have received notice from the Company that the disposition of Registrable
Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement may continue.

            4.4 The Company may require the Manager in connection with the
Registrable Shares as to which any Registration Statement pursuant to Section
2.1 or 3 is being effected to furnish to the Company such information regarding
the Manager and the Manager's intended method of distribution of such
Registrable Shares as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in
writing, but only to the extent that such information is required in order to
comply with the Securities Act. The Manager agrees to notify the Company as
promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously
furnished by the Manager to the Company or of the occurrence of any event in
either case as a result of which any Prospectus relating to such Registration
Statement contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact
regarding the Manager or the Manager's intended method of disposition of such
Registrable Shares or omits to state any material fact regarding the Manager or
the Manager's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Shares required
to be stated therein or

                                       11
<PAGE>

necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and promptly to furnish
to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any
previously furnished information or required so that such Prospectus shall not
contain, with respect to the Manager or the disposition of such Registrable
Shares, an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

            4.5 The Company shall comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission and timely file such reports pursuant to the
Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its
security holders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes
of, and to provide the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act.

            4.6 The Company shall provide CUSIP numbers for all Registrable
Shares covered by a Registration Statement no later than the effective date of
such Registration Statement.

            4.7 The Company and the Manager shall provide such information as is
required for any filings required to be made with the NASD.

            4.8 From the period beginning with the termination of the Management
Services Agreement and ending two years after the last Management Fee
Investment, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its "affiliates"
(as defined in Rule 144) to, resell any of the Securities that have been
reacquired by any of them except pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act.

            4.9 The Company shall enter into such customary agreements and take
all such other necessary and lawful actions in connection therewith in order to
expedite or facilitate disposition of such Registrable Shares.

            4.10 Upon (i) the filing of the Initial Shelf Registration Statement
and (ii) the effectiveness of the Initial Shelf Registration Statement, the
Company shall issue a press release to announce the same.

                                   SECTION 5
                              MANAGER'S OBLIGATIONS

            The Manager agrees, by acquisition of the Registrable Shares, that
it shall not be entitled to sell any of such Registrable Shares pursuant to a
Registration Statement or to receive a Prospectus relating thereto, unless it
has furnished the Company with a Notice and Questionnaire as required pursuant
to Section 2.3 hereof (including the information required to be included in such
Notice and Questionnaire) and the information set forth in the next sentence.
The Manager agrees promptly to furnish to the Company all information required
to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished by it to
the Company not misleading and any other information regarding the Manager and
the distribution of the Registrable Shares that may be required to be disclosed
in a Registration Statement under applicable law or pursuant to

                                       12
<PAGE>

Commission comments. The Manager agrees, so long as the Management Services
Agreement is in effect, to comply with the Company's Insider Trading Policy. The
Manager further agrees not to sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to a
Registration Statement without delivering, or causing to be delivered, a
Prospectus to the purchaser thereof and, within ten (10) Business Days of a
request by the Company confirm the amount of Registrable Shares sold pursuant to
any Registration Statement. In the absence of a response, the Company may assume
that all of the Manager's Registrable Shares were so sold.

                                   SECTION 6
                              REGISTRATION EXPENSES

            The Company agrees to bear and to pay or cause to be paid promptly
upon request being made therefor all expenses incident to the Company's
performance of or compliance with this Agreement, including (i) all Commission
and any NASD registration and filing fees and expenses, (ii) all fees and
expenses in connection with the qualification of the Registrable Shares for
offering and sale under the state securities and blue sky laws referred to in
Section 4.1(v) hereof, including reasonable fees and disbursements of one
counsel for the placement agent or underwriters, if any, in connection with such
qualifications, (iii) all expenses relating to the preparation, printing,
distribution and reproduction of a Registration Statement, the related
Prospectus, each amendment or supplement to each of the foregoing, the
certificates representing the Registrable Shares and all other documents
relating hereto, (iv) fees and expenses of the registrar and transfer agent for
the Trust Stock, (v) fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel and independent
certified public accountants of the Company (including the expenses of any
opinions or "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance
and compliance) and (f) reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of one
counsel for the Manager retained in connection with any underwritten offering of
the Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement, as selected by the
Manager and reasonably acceptable to the Company (including the expenses of any
opinion), and fees, expenses and disbursements of any other persons, including
special experts, retained by the Company in connection with such registration
(collectively, the "Registration Expenses"). To the extent that any Registration
Expenses are incurred, assumed or paid by the Manager or any placement agent
therefor or underwriter thereof, the Company shall promptly after receipt of a
documented request therefor reimburse such person for the full amount of the
Registration Expenses so incurred, assumed or paid. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Manager shall pay all placement agent fees and commissions and
underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of the
Registrable Shares being registered and the fees and disbursements of any
counsel or other advisors or experts retained by the Manager, other than the
counsel and experts specifically referred to above.

                                    SECTION 7
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

            7.1 Indemnification by the Company.

            The Company will indemnify the Manager, each of its officers,
directors and partners, each person controlling the Manager within the meaning
of either the Securities Act of

                                       13
<PAGE>

the Exchange Act, each underwriter of public offerings effected pursuant to this
Agreement, if any, and each person who controls any such underwriter within the
meaning of either the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against all claims,
losses, expenses, damages and liabilities (or actions, proceedings or
settlements with respect thereto) arising out of or based on any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in
any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any Registration Statement,
or amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or based on any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statement therein not misleading (in the case of any
preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made), or any violation or alleged violation by the
Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law
applicable to the Company or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any such state law and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such Registration
Statement as originally filed or any amendment thereof, preliminary Prospectus
or Prospectus. The Company will reimburse the Manager, each of its officers,
directors and partners, and each person controlling the Manager, each such
underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter for any reasonable
legal and any other expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending or settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.1
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim, loss, damage,
liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further
that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
claim, loss, damage or liability arises out of or is based on any untrue
statement or omission based upon written information furnished to the Company by
the Manager or underwriter specifically for use therein. The foregoing indemnity
agreement with respect to any preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of the Manager or underwriter, or any person controlling the Manager, or
underwriter, from whom the persons asserting any such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities purchased shares in the offering, if a copy of the Prospectus (as
then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments
or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Manager or
underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale
of the shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or
supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim,
damage or liability.

            7.2 Indemnification by the Manager.

            The Manager will, as to each registration in which the Manager
participates, indemnify the Company, each of its directors and officers, each
underwriter and each person who controls the Company or such underwriter within
the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and the Manager,
each of its officers, directors and partners and each person controlling the
Manager, against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and liabilities (or
actions, proceedings or settlements in respect thereof) arising out of or based
on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment
thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any omission (or
alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any
preliminary

                                       14
<PAGE>

Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made), and will reimburse the Company, and each of its directors, officers,
partners, underwriters and controlling persons for any reasonable legal and any
other expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or settling
any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement)
or omission (or alleged omission) is made in any such Registration Statement as
originally filed or any amendment thereof, preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus,
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by the Manager specifically for use therein; provided, however, that (i)
the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.2 shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action if such
settlement is effected without the consent of the Manager (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) that the total amount for which the
Manager shall be liable under this Section 7.2. shall not in any event exceed
the aggregate net proceeds received by the Manager from the sale of Registrable
Shares held by the Manager in such registration.

            7.3 Indemnification Procedures.

            Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 7 (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party
proposed to conduct the defense of such claim or litigation shall be approved by
the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and
the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified
Party's election and expense; provided further, that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, unless such failure resulted in
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party; and provided further, that an Indemnified
Party (together with all other Indemnified Parties which may be represented
without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate
counsel, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the
Indemnifying Party, if representation of such Indemnified Party by the counsel
retained by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between such Indemnified Party and any other party
represented by counsel for the Indemnifying Party in such proceeding. No
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall,
except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to all Indemnified Parties
of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

            7.4 Survival; Contribution.

            (a) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of securities. If the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any
losses,

                                       15
<PAGE>

claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the Indemnifying Party, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Party, on the other, in connection
with the circumstances that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability,
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by a
court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified
Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the contrary, to
the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in
the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten
public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions of
the underwriting agreement shall control.

                                    SECTION 8
                   PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATIONS

            8.1 No person may participate in any registration hereunder which is
underwritten unless the person (i) agrees to accept the terms of the
underwriting agreement as agreed upon by the Company and the underwriters
selected in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

                                    SECTION 9
                        REPORTS UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS

            9.1 With a view to making available to the Manager the benefits of
Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time
permit the Manager to sell shares of Trust Stock to the public without
registration, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

            (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
      understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times subsequent to ninety (90)
      days after the effective date of any registration statement covering an
      underwritten public offering filed under the Securities Act by the
      Company;

            (b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and
      other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
      Exchange Act at any time after it is subject to the reporting requirements
      thereof; and

            (c) furnish to the Manager upon request a written statement by the
      Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
      (at any time after ninety

                                       16
<PAGE>

      (90) days after the effective date of the registration statement filed by
      the Company), and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time
      after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), a copy of the
      most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other
      reports and documents so filed by the Company as may be reasonably
      requested by the Manager in availing itself of any rule or regulation of
      the Commission permitting the selling of any of the securities without
      registration.

                                   SECTION 10
                         TRANSFER OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS

            Provided that the Company is given written notice by the Manager at
the time of any transfer of Registrable Shares by the Manager stating the name
and address of the transferee of such Registrable Shares and identifying the
securities with respect to which the rights under this Agreement are being
assigned, the rights of the Manager under Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement may
be assigned to a transferee or assignee who (i) receives the number of shares
equal to the number of shares acquired by the Manager in the Additional Initial
Investment (as adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations and
the like that occur after the date of this Agreement) or (ii) is a subsidiary,
affiliate, parent, general partner, limited partner or retired partner of the
Manager, so long as such transfer of securities is in accordance with the LLC
Agreement and any other agreements with the Company regarding transfer of
Registrable Shares and all applicable state and federal securities laws and
regulations, and provided further that the transferee or assignee of such rights
assumes in writing the obligations of the Manager under this Agreement. The
Company may prohibit the transfer of the Manager's rights under this Section to
any proposed transferee or assignee who the Company reasonably believes is a
competitor of the Company.

                                   SECTION 11
                      INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THE MANAGER

            The Manager shall furnish to the Company such information regarding
the Manager and the distribution proposed by the Manager as the Company may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection
with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this
Agreement.

                        FORM OF NOTICE AND QUESTIONNAIRE

                            SHARES OF TRUST STOCK OF
                     MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY TRUST

            Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc. (the "Manager"),
beneficial holder of [_______] shares of beneficial interest (the "Registrable
Shares") of Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust (the "Trust"), understands
that Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (the "LLC", and together with the
Trust, the "Company") and the Trust have filed or intend to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement
on Form S-3 (the "Shelf Registration Statement") for the registration and resale
under Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
of the Registrable Shares in accordance with the terms of the Trust Stock
Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") to be dated
as of [______], 2004 between the Company and the Manager. All capitalized terms
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the
Registration Rights Agreement.

            The Manager, as a beneficial owner of Registrable Shares, is
entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement. In order to sell
or otherwise dispose of any Registrable Shares pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement, the Manager generally will be required to be named as a
selling security holder in the related Prospectus and to deliver a Prospectus to
purchasers of Registrable Shares. If the Manager does not complete this Notice
and Questionnaire and deliver it to the Company as provided below, the Manager
will not be named as a selling security holder in the Prospectus and therefore
will not be permitted to sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a completed Notice and Questionnaire
from the Manager following the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company will, as promptly as practicable but in any event within
five Business Days of such receipt, file such amendments to the Shelf
Registration Statement or supplements to the related Prospectus as are necessary
to permit the Manager to deliver such Prospectus to purchasers of Registrable
Shares.

            Certain legal consequences arise from being named as a selling
security holder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus.
Accordingly, the Manager, as a holder and beneficial owner of Registrable
Shares, is advised to consult its own securities law counsel regarding the
consequences of being named or not being named as a selling security holder in
the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus.

                                     NOTICE

            The Manager hereby gives notice to the Company of its intention to
sell or otherwise dispose of Registrable Shares beneficially owned by it and
listed below in Item 3 (unless otherwise specified under Item 3) pursuant to a
Shelf Registration Statement. The Manager, by signing and returning this Notice
and Questionnaire, understands that it will be

                                    Sch-1-1
<PAGE>

bound by the terms and conditions of this Notice and Questionnaire and the
Registration Rights Agreement.

            Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Manager has
agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Company's directors and officers and
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either the
Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), from and against certain losses arising in connection with statements
concerning the undersigned made in a Shelf Registration Statement or the related
Prospectus in reliance upon the information provided in this Notice and
Questionnaire.

      or agents' commissions. Such Registrable Shares may be sold in one or more

      The Manager acknowledges that it understands its obligation to comply with
the provisions of the Exchange Act, and the rules thereunder relating to stock

beneficial owner and received by the Company, the terms of this Notice and
Questionnaire, and the representations and warranties contained herein, shall be
binding on, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
respective successors, heirs, personal representatives and assigns of the
