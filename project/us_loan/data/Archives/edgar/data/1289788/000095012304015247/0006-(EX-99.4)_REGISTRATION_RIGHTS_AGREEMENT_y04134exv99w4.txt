                                   SECTION 2
                      REGISTRATION UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT

            2.1 The Company agrees to file under the Securities Act, as soon as
reasonably possible after the first anniversary of the closing of the Offering
or, with respect to the offer and sale of the Formation Shares, the Additional
Initial Investment or any Management Fee Investments, at such earlier time as
the Manager reasonably requests, a Shelf Registration Statement (the "Initial

continuous or delayed basis (including through brokers and dealers) by the
Manager, of the Registrable Shares it owns on such filing date, pursuant to Rule
415 or any similar rule that may be adopted by the Commission. The Company
agrees to use its best efforts to cause the Initial Shelf Registration Statement
to become or be declared effective as soon as possible after the filing of the
Initial Shelf Registration Statement and to keep the Initial Shelf Registration
Statement continuously effective throughout the Effective Period subject to
Section 4.2.

subsequent Shelf Registration Statements (each, a "Subsequent Shelf Registration
Statement") (which may include Registrable Securities covered by a prior Shelf
Registration Statement) providing for the registration, and the sale on a
continuous or delayed basis (including through brokers and dealers) by the
Manager, of all such Registrable Shares, pursuant to Rule 415 or any similar
rule that may be adopted by the Commission;

                                        5
<PAGE>

provided, however, that the Company shall not be obligated to file more than
four (4) such subsequent Shelf Registration Statements in any twelve-month
period. The Company agrees to use its best efforts to cause each Subsequent
Shelf Registration Statement to become or be declared effective as soon as
possible after the filing of the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement and to
keep the Subsequent Shelf Registration Statement continuously effective
throughout the Effective Period subject to Section 4.2.

            The Manager shall be named as a selling security holder in such
Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus in such a manner as to
permit the Manager to deliver such Prospectus to purchasers of Registrable
Shares in accordance with applicable law.

            2.2 The Company further agrees that it shall cause each Shelf
Registration Statement and the related Prospectus, and any amendment or
supplement thereto, as of the effective date of such Shelf Registration
Statement or such amendment or supplement, (i) to comply in all material
respects with the applicable requirements of the Securities Act; and (ii) not to
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make the statements
therein (in the case of the related Prospectus, in light of the circumstances
under which they were made) not misleading. If any Shelf Registration Statement,
as amended or supplemented from time to time, ceases to be effective for any
reason at any time during an Effective Period (other than because all
Registrable Shares registered thereunder shall have been sold pursuant thereto
or shall have otherwise ceased to be Registrable Shares), the Company shall use
its best efforts to obtain the prompt withdrawal of any order suspending the
effectiveness thereof.

            2.3 The Manager agrees that if it wishes to sell Registrable Shares
pursuant to a Shelf Registration Statement and related Prospectus, it will do so
only in accordance with this Section 2.3. The Manager agrees to deliver a Notice
and Questionnaire, a form of which is attached as Schedule 1 to this Agreement
(the "Notice and Questionnaire"), to the Company at least ten (10) Business Days
prior to the filing of any Shelf Registration Statement.

                                   SECTION 3
                             PIGGYBACK REGISTRATION

            3.1 Right to Piggyback.

            (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, at any time after
the closing of the Offering, whenever the Company proposes to register, either
for its own account or the account of a security holder or holders, any shares
of Trust Stock under the Securities Act and the form of registration statement
(the "Company Registration Statement") to be used, may be used for the
registration of Registrable Shares (a "Piggyback Registration"), the Company
shall give prompt written notice to the Manager of the Company's intention to
effect such a registration and shall include in the Company Registration
Statement all Registrable Shares with respect to which the Manager has provided
the Company with a written request for inclusion therein within twenty (20)
calendar days after the receipt of the Company's notice.

                                        6
<PAGE>

            (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company shall not be required
to notify the Manager or include Registrable Shares in any registration on (i)
Form S-1, S-3 or S-8, or their successor forms, under the Securities Act
relating solely to stock purchase or other equity plans, (ii) Form S-4 or
successor forms relating solely to a transaction within the scope of Rule 145,
or (iii) any other form (other than Form S-1, S-2, S-3, SB-1 or SB-2, or their
successor forms) that does not include substantially the same information as
would be required to be included in a Shelf Registration Statement covering a
registration pursuant to Section 2 above.

            (c) The Company shall have the right to terminate or withdraw any
Company Registration Statement initiated by it under this Section 3 prior to the
effectiveness of such Company Registration Statement, whether or not the Manager
has elected to include securities in such Company Registration Statement.

            3.2 Underwriting.

            If the Company Registration Statement with respect to which the
Company gives notice is for a public offering involving an underwriting, the
Company shall so advise the Manager as a part of the written notice given
pursuant to Section 3.1(a). In such event, the right of the Manager to be named
selling security holder in a Company Registration Statement pursuant to this
Section 3 shall be conditioned upon the Manager's participation in such
underwriting and the inclusion of the Manager's Registrable Shares in the
underwriting to the extent provided herein. The Company and the Manager shall
enter into an underwriting agreement in customary form, with the underwriters
selected by the Company.

            3.3 Cutback.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Section 3 to the
contrary, if the representative of the underwriters determines that marketing
factors require a limitation of the number of shares to be underwritten, the
underwriters and the Company may limit the number of Registrable Shares to be
included in the Company Registration Statement and underwriting. In the event of
any such limitation of the number of shares of Trust Stock to be underwritten,
the Company shall so advise the Manager, and the number of shares included in
such Company Registration Statement and underwriting shall be allocated first to
the Company for securities being sold for its own account and thereafter to the
Manager. If the Manager disapproves of the terms of any such underwriting, it
may elect to withdraw therefrom by written notice to the Company and the
underwriter, and such Registrable Shares shall be withdrawn from such Company
Registration Statement.

                                   SECTION 4
                             REGISTRATION PROCEDURES

            The following provisions shall apply to any Registration Statement
filed pursuant to Sections 2 and 3 hereof.

      any form that may be utilized by the Company and that shall permit the
      disposition of the Registrable Shares in accordance with the intended

            (ii) before filing any Registration Statement or related Prospectus

      delivery of such copies to the Manager;

            (iii) (A) prepare and file with the Commission such amendments and
      post-effective amendments to any Registration Statement and file with the

      to be supplemented by any required Prospectus supplement and, as so
      supplemented, to be filed pursuant to Rule 424 (or any similar provisions
      then in force) under the Securities Act, and (C) comply with the
      provisions of the Securities Act applicable to it with respect to the
      disposition of all Registrable Shares covered by a Registration Statement
      during the Effective Period in accordance with the intended methods of
      disposition by the Manager set forth in a Registration Statement as so
      amended or such Prospectus as so supplemented;

            (iv) promptly notify the Manager (A) when each Registration
      Statement or the Prospectus included therein, or any amendment or
      supplement to the Prospectus or post-effective amendment, has been filed
      with the Commission, and, with respect to each Registration Statement or
      any post-effective amendment, when the same has become effective, (B) of
      any request, following the effectiveness of each Registration Statement,
      by the Commission or any other federal or state governmental authority for
      amendments or supplements to a Registration Statement or related
      Prospectus or for additional information, (C) of the issuance by the
      Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
      Registration Statement or the initiation or written threat of any
      proceedings for that purpose, (D) of the receipt by the Company of any
      notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
      Registrable Shares for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or
      written threat of any proceeding for such purpose, (E) of the occurrence
      of (but not the nature of or details concerning) any event or the
      existence of any fact (a "Material Event") as a result of which any

      fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
      necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or any Prospectus
      shall contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
      material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
      statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
      were made, not misleading (provided, however, that no notice by the
      Company shall be required pursuant to this clause (E) in the event that
      the Company either promptly files a Prospectus supplement to update the

                                        8
<PAGE>

      Prospectus or a Form 8-K or other appropriate Exchange Act report that is
      incorporated by reference into a Registration Statement, which, in either
      case, contains the requisite information with respect to such Material
      Event that results in such Registration Statement no longer containing any
      untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material fact
      necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading), (F) of
      the determination by the Company that a post-effective amendment to a

      provisions of Section 4.2 shall apply or (G) at any time during which a
      Prospectus is required to be delivered under the Securities Act, that a
      Registration Statement, Prospectus, Prospectus amendment or supplement or
      post-effective amendment does not conform in all material respects to the
      applicable requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and
      regulations of the Commission thereunder;

            (v) prior to any public offering of the Registrable Shares pursuant

      qualification (or exemption from such registration or qualification) of
      such Registrable Shares for offer and sale under the securities or "blue
      sky" laws of such jurisdictions within the United States as the Manager
      reasonably requests in writing (which request may be included in the
      Notice and Questionnaire);

            (vi) prior to any public offering of the Registrable Shares pursuant
      to a Registration Statement, use its best efforts to keep each such
      registration or qualification (or exemption therefrom) effective during
      the Effective Period in connection with the Manager's offer and sale of
      Registrable Shares pursuant to such registration or qualification (or
      exemption therefrom) and do any and all other acts or things necessary or
      advisable to enable the disposition in such jurisdictions of such
      Registrable Shares in the manner set forth in the Registration Statement
      and the related Prospectus; provided that the Company will not be required
      to (A) qualify as a foreign corporation or as a dealer in securities in
      any jurisdiction in which it would not otherwise be required to qualify
      but for this Agreement, (B) take any action that would subject it to
      general service of process in suits or to taxation in any such
      jurisdiction in which it is not then so subject, or (C) become subject to
      the reporting requirements of such jurisdiction;

            (vii) use its best efforts to prevent the issuance of and, if
      issued, to obtain the withdrawal of any order suspending the effectiveness
      of a Registration Statement, or any post-effective amendment thereto, and
      to lift any suspension of the qualification of any of the Registrable
      Shares for sale in any jurisdiction in which they have been qualified for
      sale, in each case at the earliest practicable date;

            (viii) upon reasonable notice, for a reasonable period prior to the
      filing of a Registration Statement, and throughout the applicable
      Effective Period, make available at reasonable times at the Company's
      principal place of business or such other reasonable place for inspection
      by a representative of any underwriter, placement agent or counsel

                                        9
<PAGE>

      appointed by the Manager in connection with an underwritten offering, such
      financial and other information and books and records of the Company, and
      cause the officers, directors, trustees and independent certified public
      accountants of the Company to respond to such inquiries, as shall be
      reasonably necessary, in the judgment of the counsel to the Manager, to
      conduct a reasonable "due diligence" investigation; provided, however,
      that each such representative appointed by the Manager in connection with
      an underwritten offering shall be required to maintain in confidence and
      not to disclose to any other person any information or records reasonably
      designated by the Company in writing as being confidential, subject to
      customary exceptions;

      a Prospectus supplement or post-effective amendment to a Registration
      Statement such information as the Manager shall, on the basis of a written
      opinion of nationally recognized counsel experienced in such matters,
      determine to be required to be included therein by applicable law and make
      any required filings of such Prospectus supplement or such post-effective
      amendment; provided that the Company shall not be required to take any
      actions under this Section 4.1(viii) that are not, in the reasonable
      opinion of counsel for the Company, in compliance with applicable law;

            (x) promptly furnish to the Manager, upon its request and without
      charge, at least one (1) conformed copy of each Registration Statement and
      any amendments thereto, including financial statements but excluding
      schedules, all documents incorporated or deemed to be incorporated therein
      by reference and all exhibits (unless requested in writing to the Company
      by the Manager); and

            (xi) during each Effective Period, deliver to the Manager in
      connection with any sale of Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration
      Statement, without charge, as many copies of the Prospectus relating to
      such Registrable Shares (including each preliminary Prospectus) and any
      amendment or supplement thereto as the Manager may reasonably request; and
      the Company hereby consents (except during such periods in which a
      Deferral Notice is outstanding and has not been revoked or during any
      period that is not a "trading window" as defined in the Company's Insider
      Trading Policy) to the use of such Prospectus or each amendment or
      supplement thereto by the Manager in connection with any offering and sale
      of the Registrable Shares covered by such Prospectus or any amendment or
      supplement thereto in the manner set forth therein.

            4.2 Upon (i) the issuance by the Commission of a stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a Registration Statement or the initiation of
proceedings with respect to a Registration Statement under Section 8(d) or 8(e)
of the Securities Act or (ii) the occurrence of any event or the existence of
any Material Event as a result of which a Registration Statement shall contain
any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading, or any Prospectus shall contain any untrue statement of a material
fact or omit to state any material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading, the Company will (A) in the case of clause
(ii) above, subject to the third sentence of this provision, as promptly as
practicable, prepare and

                                       10
<PAGE>

file a post-effective amendment to such Registration Statement or a supplement
to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated therein by reference or
file any other required document that would be incorporated by reference into
such Registration Statement and Prospectus so that such Registration Statement
does not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements
therein not misleading, and such Prospectus does not contain any untrue
statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the
circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, as thereafter
delivered to the purchasers of the Registrable Shares being sold thereunder,
and, in the case of a post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement, use
best efforts to cause it to be declared effective as promptly as practicable,
and (B) in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, give notice to the Manager
that the availability of a Registration Statement is suspended (a "Deferral
Notice"). Upon receipt of any Deferral Notice, the Manager agrees not to sell
any Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement until the Manager's
receipt of copies of the supplemented or amended Prospectus provided for in
clause (A) above, or until it is advised in writing by the Company that the
Prospectus may be used, and has received copies of any additional or
supplemental filings that are incorporated or deemed incorporated by reference
in such Prospectus. The Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use
of the Prospectus may be resumed (x) in the case of clause (i) above, as
promptly as practicable, (y) in the case of clause (ii) above, as soon as, in
the sole judgment of the Company, public disclosure of such Material Event would
not be prejudicial to or contrary to the interests of the Company or, if
necessary to avoid unreasonable burden or expense, as soon as practicable
thereafter.

            4.3 The Manager agrees that, upon receipt of any Deferral Notice
from the Company, the Manager shall forthwith discontinue (and cause any
placement or sales agent or underwriters acting on their behalf to discontinue)
the disposition of Registrable Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement
applicable to such Registrable Shares until the Manager (i) shall have received
copies of such amended or supplemented Prospectus and, if so directed by the
Company, deliver to the Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other
than permanent file copies, then in the Manager's possession of the Prospectus
covering such Registrable Shares at the time of receipt of such notice or (ii)
shall have received notice from the Company that the disposition of Registrable
Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement may continue.

            4.4 The Company may require the Manager in connection with the
Registrable Shares as to which any Registration Statement pursuant to Section
2.1 or 3 is being effected to furnish to the Company such information regarding
the Manager and the Manager's intended method of distribution of such
Registrable Shares as the Company may from time to time reasonably request in
writing, but only to the extent that such information is required in order to
comply with the Securities Act. The Manager agrees to notify the Company as
promptly as practicable of any inaccuracy or change in information previously
furnished by the Manager to the Company or of the occurrence of any event in
either case as a result of which any Prospectus relating to such Registration
Statement contains or would contain an untrue statement of a material fact
regarding the Manager or the Manager's intended method of disposition of such
Registrable Shares or omits to state any material fact regarding the Manager or
the Manager's intended method of disposition of such Registrable Shares required
to be stated therein or

                                       11
<PAGE>

necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and promptly to furnish
to the Company any additional information required to correct and update any
previously furnished information or required so that such Prospectus shall not
contain, with respect to the Manager or the disposition of such Registrable
Shares, an untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
required to be stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

            4.5 The Company shall comply with all applicable rules and
regulations of the Commission and timely file such reports pursuant to the
Exchange Act as are necessary in order to make generally available to its
security holders as soon as practicable an earnings statement for the purposes
of, and to provide the benefits contemplated by, the last paragraph of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act.

            4.6 The Company shall provide CUSIP numbers for all Registrable
Shares covered by a Registration Statement no later than the effective date of
such Registration Statement.

            4.7 The Company and the Manager shall provide such information as is
required for any filings required to be made with the NASD.

            4.8 From the period beginning with the termination of the Management
Services Agreement and ending two years after the last Management Fee
Investment, the Company will not, and will not permit any of its "affiliates"
(as defined in Rule 144) to, resell any of the Securities that have been
reacquired by any of them except pursuant to an effective registration statement
under the Securities Act.

            4.9 The Company shall enter into such customary agreements and take
all such other necessary and lawful actions in connection therewith in order to
expedite or facilitate disposition of such Registrable Shares.

            4.10 Upon (i) the filing of the Initial Shelf Registration Statement
and (ii) the effectiveness of the Initial Shelf Registration Statement, the
Company shall issue a press release to announce the same.

                                   SECTION 5
                              MANAGER'S OBLIGATIONS

            The Manager agrees, by acquisition of the Registrable Shares, that
it shall not be entitled to sell any of such Registrable Shares pursuant to a
Registration Statement or to receive a Prospectus relating thereto, unless it
has furnished the Company with a Notice and Questionnaire as required pursuant
to Section 2.3 hereof (including the information required to be included in such
Notice and Questionnaire) and the information set forth in the next sentence.
The Manager agrees promptly to furnish to the Company all information required
to be disclosed in order to make the information previously furnished by it to
the Company not misleading and any other information regarding the Manager and
the distribution of the Registrable Shares that may be required to be disclosed
in a Registration Statement under applicable law or pursuant to

                                       12
<PAGE>

Commission comments. The Manager agrees, so long as the Management Services
Agreement is in effect, to comply with the Company's Insider Trading Policy. The
Manager further agrees not to sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to a
Registration Statement without delivering, or causing to be delivered, a
Prospectus to the purchaser thereof and, within ten (10) Business Days of a
request by the Company confirm the amount of Registrable Shares sold pursuant to
any Registration Statement. In the absence of a response, the Company may assume
that all of the Manager's Registrable Shares were so sold.

                                   SECTION 6
                              REGISTRATION EXPENSES

            The Company agrees to bear and to pay or cause to be paid promptly
upon request being made therefor all expenses incident to the Company's
performance of or compliance with this Agreement, including (i) all Commission
and any NASD registration and filing fees and expenses, (ii) all fees and
expenses in connection with the qualification of the Registrable Shares for
offering and sale under the state securities and blue sky laws referred to in
Section 4.1(v) hereof, including reasonable fees and disbursements of one
counsel for the placement agent or underwriters, if any, in connection with such
qualifications, (iii) all expenses relating to the preparation, printing,
distribution and reproduction of a Registration Statement, the related
Prospectus, each amendment or supplement to each of the foregoing, the
certificates representing the Registrable Shares and all other documents
relating hereto, (iv) fees and expenses of the registrar and transfer agent for
the Trust Stock, (v) fees, disbursements and expenses of counsel and independent
certified public accountants of the Company (including the expenses of any
opinions or "cold comfort" letters required by or incident to such performance
and compliance) and (f) reasonable fees, disbursements and expenses of one
counsel for the Manager retained in connection with any underwritten offering of
the Registrable Shares pursuant to a Registration Statement, as selected by the
Manager and reasonably acceptable to the Company (including the expenses of any
opinion), and fees, expenses and disbursements of any other persons, including
special experts, retained by the Company in connection with such registration
(collectively, the "Registration Expenses"). To the extent that any Registration
Expenses are incurred, assumed or paid by the Manager or any placement agent
therefor or underwriter thereof, the Company shall promptly after receipt of a
documented request therefor reimburse such person for the full amount of the
Registration Expenses so incurred, assumed or paid. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Manager shall pay all placement agent fees and commissions and
underwriting discounts and commissions attributable to the sale of the
Registrable Shares being registered and the fees and disbursements of any
counsel or other advisors or experts retained by the Manager, other than the
counsel and experts specifically referred to above.

                                    SECTION 7
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

            7.1 Indemnification by the Company.

            The Company will indemnify the Manager, each of its officers,
directors and partners, each person controlling the Manager within the meaning
of either the Securities Act of

                                       13
<PAGE>

the Exchange Act, each underwriter of public offerings effected pursuant to this
Agreement, if any, and each person who controls any such underwriter within the
meaning of either the Securities Act and the Exchange Act against all claims,
losses, expenses, damages and liabilities (or actions, proceedings or
settlements with respect thereto) arising out of or based on any untrue
statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact contained in any
Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment thereof, or in
any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or in any Registration Statement,
or amendment thereof or supplement thereto, or based on any omission (or alleged
omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statement therein not misleading (in the case of any
preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances
under which they were made), or any violation or alleged violation by the
Company of the Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any state securities law
applicable to the Company or any rule or regulation promulgated under the
Securities Act, the Exchange Act or any such state law and relating to action or
inaction required of the Company in connection with any such Registration
Statement as originally filed or any amendment thereof, preliminary Prospectus
or Prospectus. The Company will reimburse the Manager, each of its officers,
directors and partners, and each person controlling the Manager, each such
underwriter and each person who controls any such underwriter for any reasonable
legal and any other expenses incurred in connection with investigating,
defending or settling any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action;
provided, however, that the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.1
shall not apply to amounts paid in settlement of any such claim, loss, damage,
liability or action if such settlement is effected without the consent of the
Company (which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld); and provided further
that the Company will not be liable in any such case to the extent that any such
claim, loss, damage or liability arises out of or is based on any untrue
statement or omission based upon written information furnished to the Company by
the Manager or underwriter specifically for use therein. The foregoing indemnity
agreement with respect to any preliminary Prospectus shall not inure to the
benefit of the Manager or underwriter, or any person controlling the Manager, or
underwriter, from whom the persons asserting any such losses, claims, damages or
liabilities purchased shares in the offering, if a copy of the Prospectus (as
then amended or supplemented if the Company shall have furnished any amendments
or supplements thereto) was not sent or given by or on behalf of the Manager or
underwriter to such person at or prior to the written confirmation of the sale
of the shares to such person, and if the Prospectus (as so amended or
supplemented) would have cured the defect giving rise to such loss, claim,
damage or liability.

            7.2 Indemnification by the Manager.

            The Manager will, as to each registration in which the Manager
participates, indemnify the Company, each of its directors and officers, each
underwriter and each person who controls the Company or such underwriter within
the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act, and the Manager,
each of its officers, directors and partners and each person controlling the
Manager, against all claims, losses, expenses, damages and liabilities (or
actions, proceedings or settlements in respect thereof) arising out of or based
on any untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement) of a material fact
contained in any Registration Statement as originally filed or in any amendment
thereof, or in any preliminary Prospectus or the Prospectus, or any omission (or
alleged omission) to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading (in the case of any
preliminary

                                       14
<PAGE>

Prospectus or the Prospectus, in the light of the circumstances under which they
were made), and will reimburse the Company, and each of its directors, officers,
partners, underwriters and controlling persons for any reasonable legal and any
other expenses incurred in connection with investigating, defending or settling
any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action, in each case to the extent,
but only to the extent, that such untrue statement (or alleged untrue statement)
or omission (or alleged omission) is made in any such Registration Statement as
originally filed or any amendment thereof, preliminary Prospectus or Prospectus,
in reliance upon and in conformity with written information furnished to the
Company by the Manager specifically for use therein; provided, however, that (i)
the indemnity agreement contained in this Section 7.2 shall not apply to amounts
paid in settlement of any such claim, loss, damage, liability or action if such
settlement is effected without the consent of the Manager (which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld) and (ii) that the total amount for which the
Manager shall be liable under this Section 7.2. shall not in any event exceed
the aggregate net proceeds received by the Manager from the sale of Registrable
Shares held by the Manager in such registration.

            7.3 Indemnification Procedures.

            Each party entitled to indemnification under this Section 7 (the
"Indemnified Party") shall give notice to the party required to provide
indemnification (the "Indemnifying Party") promptly after such Indemnified Party
has actual knowledge of any claim as to which indemnity may be sought, and shall
permit the Indemnifying Party to assume the defense of any such claim or any
litigation resulting therefrom; provided that counsel for the Indemnifying Party
proposed to conduct the defense of such claim or litigation shall be approved by
the Indemnified Party (whose approval shall not be unreasonably withheld), and
the Indemnified Party may participate in such defense at such Indemnified
Party's election and expense; provided further, that the failure of any
Indemnified Party to give notice as provided herein shall not relieve the
Indemnifying Party of its obligations hereunder, unless such failure resulted in
prejudice to the Indemnifying Party; and provided further, that an Indemnified
Party (together with all other Indemnified Parties which may be represented
without conflict by one counsel) shall have the right to retain one separate
counsel, with the fees and expenses of such counsel to be paid by the
Indemnifying Party, if representation of such Indemnified Party by the counsel
retained by the Indemnifying Party would be inappropriate due to actual or
potential differing interests between such Indemnified Party and any other party
represented by counsel for the Indemnifying Party in such proceeding. No
Indemnifying Party, in the defense of any such claim or litigation, shall,
except with the consent of each Indemnified Party, consent to entry of any
judgment or enter into any settlement which does not include as an unconditional
term thereof the giving by the claimant or plaintiff to all Indemnified Parties
of a release from all liability in respect to such claim or litigation.

            7.4 Survival; Contribution.

            (a) The indemnification provided for under this Agreement shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Indemnified Party or any officer, director or controlling person
of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of securities. If the
indemnification provided for in this Section 7 is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be unavailable to an Indemnified Party with respect to any
losses,

                                       15
<PAGE>

claims, damages or liabilities referred to herein, the Indemnifying Party, in
lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Party hereunder, shall, to the extent
permitted by applicable law, contribute to the amount paid or payable by such
Indemnified Party as a result of such loss, claim, damage or liability in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Indemnifying
Party on the one hand, and of the Indemnified Party, on the other, in connection
with the circumstances that resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability,
as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of
the Indemnifying Party and of the Indemnified Party shall be determined by a
court of law by reference to, among other things, whether the untrue or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact or the omission to state a material fact
relates to information supplied by the Indemnifying Party or by the Indemnified
Party and the parties' relative intent, knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission.

            (b) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 7 to the contrary, to
the extent that the provisions on indemnification and contribution contained in
the underwriting agreement entered into in connection with the underwritten
public offering are in conflict with the foregoing provisions, the provisions of
the underwriting agreement shall control.

                                    SECTION 8
                   PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATIONS

            8.1 No person may participate in any registration hereunder which is
underwritten unless the person (i) agrees to accept the terms of the
underwriting agreement as agreed upon by the Company and the underwriters
selected in accordance with this Agreement, and (ii) completes and executes all
questionnaires, powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and
other documents required under the terms of such underwriting arrangements.

                                    SECTION 9
                        REPORTS UNDER THE SECURITIES LAWS

            9.1 With a view to making available to the Manager the benefits of
Rule 144 and any other rule or regulation of the Commission that may at any time
permit the Manager to sell shares of Trust Stock to the public without
registration, the Company agrees to use its commercially reasonable efforts to:

            (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms are
      understood and defined in Rule 144, at all times subsequent to ninety (90)
      days after the effective date of any registration statement covering an
      underwritten public offering filed under the Securities Act by the
      Company;

            (b) file with the Commission in a timely manner all reports and
      other documents required of the Company under the Securities Act and the
      Exchange Act at any time after it is subject to the reporting requirements
      thereof; and

            (c) furnish to the Manager upon request a written statement by the
      Company that it has complied with the reporting requirements of Rule 144
      (at any time after ninety

                                       16
<PAGE>

      (90) days after the effective date of the registration statement filed by
      the Company), and of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act (at any time
      after it has become subject to such reporting requirements), a copy of the
      most recent annual or quarterly report of the Company, and such other
      reports and documents so filed by the Company as may be reasonably
      requested by the Manager in availing itself of any rule or regulation of
      the Commission permitting the selling of any of the securities without
      registration.

                                   SECTION 10
                         TRANSFER OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS

            Provided that the Company is given written notice by the Manager at
the time of any transfer of Registrable Shares by the Manager stating the name
and address of the transferee of such Registrable Shares and identifying the
securities with respect to which the rights under this Agreement are being
assigned, the rights of the Manager under Sections 2 and 3 of this Agreement may
be assigned to a transferee or assignee who (i) receives the number of shares
equal to the number of shares acquired by the Manager in the Additional Initial
Investment (as adjusted for stock dividends, stock splits, recapitalizations and
the like that occur after the date of this Agreement) or (ii) is a subsidiary,
affiliate, parent, general partner, limited partner or retired partner of the
Manager, so long as such transfer of securities is in accordance with the LLC
Agreement and any other agreements with the Company regarding transfer of
Registrable Shares and all applicable state and federal securities laws and
regulations, and provided further that the transferee or assignee of such rights
assumes in writing the obligations of the Manager under this Agreement. The
Company may prohibit the transfer of the Manager's rights under this Section to
any proposed transferee or assignee who the Company reasonably believes is a
competitor of the Company.

                                   SECTION 11
                      INFORMATION FURNISHED BY THE MANAGER

            The Manager shall furnish to the Company such information regarding
the Manager and the distribution proposed by the Manager as the Company may
reasonably request in writing and as shall be reasonably required in connection
with any registration, qualification or compliance referred to in this
Agreement.

                                   SECTION 12

                        FORM OF NOTICE AND QUESTIONNAIRE

                            SHARES OF TRUST STOCK OF
                     MACQUARIE INFRASTRUCTURE COMPANY TRUST

            Macquarie Infrastructure Management (USA) Inc. (the "Manager"),
beneficial holder of [_______] shares of beneficial interest (the "Registrable
Shares") of Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust (the "Trust"), understands
that Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (the "LLC", and together with the
Trust, the "Company") and the Trust have filed or intend to file with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") a registration statement
on Form S-3 (the "Shelf Registration Statement") for the registration and resale
under Rule 415 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Securities Act"),
of the Registrable Shares in accordance with the terms of the Trust Stock
Registration Rights Agreement (the "Registration Rights Agreement") to be dated
as of [______], 2004 between the Company and the Manager. All capitalized terms
not otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the
Registration Rights Agreement.

            The Manager, as a beneficial owner of Registrable Shares, is
entitled to the benefits of the Registration Rights Agreement. In order to sell
or otherwise dispose of any Registrable Shares pursuant to the Shelf
Registration Statement, the Manager generally will be required to be named as a
selling security holder in the related Prospectus and to deliver a Prospectus to
purchasers of Registrable Shares. If the Manager does not complete this Notice
and Questionnaire and deliver it to the Company as provided below, the Manager
will not be named as a selling security holder in the Prospectus and therefore
will not be permitted to sell any Registrable Shares pursuant to a Shelf
Registration Statement. Upon receipt of a completed Notice and Questionnaire
from the Manager following the effectiveness of any Shelf Registration
Statement, the Company will, as promptly as practicable but in any event within
five Business Days of such receipt, file such amendments to the Shelf
Registration Statement or supplements to the related Prospectus as are necessary
to permit the Manager to deliver such Prospectus to purchasers of Registrable
Shares.

            Certain legal consequences arise from being named as a selling
security holder in the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus.
Accordingly, the Manager, as a holder and beneficial owner of Registrable
Shares, is advised to consult its own securities law counsel regarding the
consequences of being named or not being named as a selling security holder in
the Shelf Registration Statement and the related Prospectus.

                                     NOTICE

            The Manager hereby gives notice to the Company of its intention to
sell or otherwise dispose of Registrable Shares beneficially owned by it and
listed below in Item 3 (unless otherwise specified under Item 3) pursuant to a
Shelf Registration Statement. The Manager, by signing and returning this Notice
and Questionnaire, understands that it will be

                                    Sch-1-1
<PAGE>

bound by the terms and conditions of this Notice and Questionnaire and the
Registration Rights Agreement.

            Pursuant to the Registration Rights Agreement, the Manager has
agreed to indemnify and hold harmless the Company's directors and officers and
each person, if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of either the
Securities Act or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange
Act"), from and against certain losses arising in connection with statements
concerning the undersigned made in a Shelf Registration Statement or the related
Prospectus in reliance upon the information provided in this Notice and
Questionnaire.

      If the Registrable Shares are sold through underwriters or broker-dealers,

      or agents' commissions. Such Registrable Shares may be sold in one or more
      transactions at fixed prices, at prevailing market prices at the time of

            agreement of the Company.

      The Manager acknowledges that it understands its obligation to comply with
the provisions of the Exchange Act, and the rules thereunder relating to stock
manipulation, particularly Regulation M thereunder (or any successor rules or
regulations), and the provisions of the Securities Act relating to Prospectus

beneficial owner and received by the Company, the terms of this Notice and
Questionnaire, and the representations and warranties contained herein, shall be
binding on, shall inure to the benefit of and shall be enforceable by the
respective successors, heirs, personal representatives and assigns of the
