ITEM 4.01 CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.

(a) Changing accountants.

      On December 22, 2004, Macquarie Infrastructure Company Trust (the
"Trust") and Macquarie Infrastructure Company LLC (together with the Trust, the
"Company") replaced WithumSmith+Brown, P.C. ("WSB"), who was previously engaged
as the principal accountant to audit the Company's financial statements.

      The report issued by WSB on the financial statements for the period from
inception to June 30, 2004 did not contain an adverse opinion or a disclaimer of
opinion, nor was it qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope, or
accounting principles.

      During the period from inception to June 30, 2004 and subsequent interim
periods through December 22, 2004, there were no disagreements between the
Company and WSB on any matter of accounting principles or practices, financial
statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which disagreement(s), if
not resolved to the satisfaction of WSB would have caused it to make reference
to the subject matter of the disagreement(s) in connection with its reports.
Furthermore, there were no "reportable events," as that term is used in Item
304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K, for the period from inception to June 30, 2004
and the subsequent interim periods through December 22, 2004.

      The decision to change independent accountants was recommended and
approved by the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors.

      On December 23, 2004, the Company provided a draft copy of the foregoing
disclosures to WSB and requested that WSB provide a letter addressed to the
Securities and Exchange Commission stating whether WSB agree with such
disclosures. The confirming letter from WSB is attached hereto as Exhibit 16.1.

(b) New independent accountants.

      On December 22, 2004, the Company engaged KPMG LLP as the Company's new
independent registered public accountants to audit the Company's financial
statements for the fiscal years ending December 31, 2004 and 2005. The
appointment for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2005 will be submitted to the
shareholders of the Trust for ratification at the 2005 Annual Meeting.

      Prior to the engagement of KPMG LLP, neither the Company nor anyone on the
Company's behalf consulted with KPMG LLP regarding the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial statements.
