December 20, 2004, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (&#147;PSEG&#148;) and
Exelon Corporation (&#147;Exelon&#148;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;). Concurrently therewith, PSEG Nuclear LLC entered into an
Operating Services Contract with Exelon Generation Company, LLC relating to the provision
of operating services by Exelon Generation Company, LLC in respect of PSEG&#146;s Salem
and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations. In addition, concurrently therewith, PSEG (1)
entered into a second amendment to its employment agreement with E. James Ferland, the
current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PSEG, (2) adopted the Key Executive
Severance Plan of PSEG (the &#147;Severance Plan&#148;) and (3) adopted the Retention

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Merger Agreement provides for a business combination whereby PSEG will be merged with and
into Exelon, with Exelon surviving (the &#147;Merger&#148;). At the effective time of and
as a result of the Merger, (i) each share of PSEG common stock (other than shares owned by
Exelon or PSEG) will be converted into the right to receive 1.225 shares of Exelon common
stock (the &#147;Exchange Ratio&#148;) and (ii) each share of Exelon common stock will
remain outstanding. All outstanding PSEG stock options will be converted into options to
purchase the number of shares of Exelon common stock determined by multiplying (a) the
number of shares of PSEG common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to
the effective time by (b) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Exelon
common stock equal to the exercise price per share of PSEG common stock under such stock
option immediately prior to the effective time divided by the Exchange Ratio. </FONT></P>

board of directors, which will include six members nominated by PSEG and twelve members
nominated by Exelon. E. James Ferland, the current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PSEG, will become
the non-executive Chairman of the Board of the surviving corporation. John W. Rowe, the current Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon, will become the President and Chief Executive
Officer of the surviving corporation. </FONT></P>

Agreement, including, among others, covenants (i) by PSEG not to (A) solicit proposals
relating to alternative business combination transactions or (B) subject to certain
exceptions, enter into discussions concerning alternative business combination
transactions, (ii) by PSEG and Exelon to cause stockholder meetings to be held to consider
approval of the Merger and related transactions, (iii) subject to PSEG&#146;s right to
terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal (as described in the Merger
Agreement), for the board of directors of PSEG to recommend adoption and approval by
PSEG&#146;s stockholders of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and (iv) subject

continue as the license holder with exclusive legal authority to operate and maintain the
plants, will retain responsibility for management oversight and will have full authority
with respect to the marketing of its share of the output from the facilities. Exelon

continue to provide services under the Operating Services Contract for a transition period
of at least 180 days and up to two years at the election of PSEG Nuclear LLC. This period

Amendment to Employment Agreement</B></FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Indent Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December 20, 2004, PSEG and E. James Ferland, the current Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of PSEG, entered into a Second Amendment (the &#147;Second Amendment&#148;) to Mr.
Ferland&#146;s Employment Agreement dated June 16, 1998, as amended as of November 20,
2001 (the &#147;Original Employment Agreement&#148;). The Second Amendment provides that,
as of the consummation of the Merger, Mr. Ferland will serve solely as Exelon&#146;s
Chairman. Mr. Ferland will not have any executive duties after the effective time of the
Merger. Mr. Ferland&#146;s term of employment continues through March 31, 2007, at which
time he has agreed to retire. During the term of employment, Mr. Ferland&#146;s annual
salary, target annual incentive bonus and target long-term incentive bonus will be set by
the Board of Directors of Exelon, but will not be less than the amounts paid to him or the
targets set for him immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Mr. Ferland
waives his right to resign his employment for &#147;good reason&#148; as a result of the
Merger because: (1) of the changes to his title, authority, duties, responsibilities and
reporting lines; (2) he is not appointed to the position of Chief Executive Officer of
Exelon; or (3) another individual is appointed to the position of Chief Executive Officer
of Exelon. Further, Mr. Ferland acknowledges that the changes in his title, authority,
duties, responsibilities and reporting lines do not constitute a termination of his
employment without &#147;cause&#148;. Otherwise, the provisions of Mr. Ferland&#146;s
Original Employment Agreement, as amended, providing for severance payments on the
termination of his employment without &#147;cause&#148; or on the resignation of his
employment for &#147;good reason&#148;, remain in effect. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When
Mr. Ferland retires at the end of his term of employment on March 31, 2007, he will be
fully vested in any outstanding shares of restricted stock and any other equity awards he
received as a long-term incentive bonus, and he will be paid any previously deferred
compensation. He will not receive any special severance payments on retirement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>employment for &#147;good
reason&#148; within two years after a change in control, which would include the
consummation of the Merger. The officers who are eligible to participant in the Severance
Plan were selected by PSEG&#146;s Organization and Compensation Committee (the
&#147;Committee&#148;) on December 19, 2004 and were designated as either Schedule A or
Schedule B participants, in accordance with the Severance Plan. The Schedule A
participants include 29 Vice Presidents of PSEG who are not parties to individual
employment or change in control agreements. There is one Schedule B participant, R. Edwin
Selover, who is a direct report to the Chief Executive Officer of PSEG and who also is not
a party to an individual employment or change in control agreement. Eligibility of
Schedule A and Schedule B participants to participate in the Severance Plan is conditioned
on the participants&#146; execution within 30 days after being selected as a participant
of a written agreement to be bound by the terms of the Confidentiality, Non-Compete and
Non-Solicitation covenants described in Article VI of the Severance Plan. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Severance Plan provides that, if a Schedule A participant is terminated without
&#147;cause&#148; or resigns his or her employment for &#147;good reason&#148; within two
years after a change in control, the Schedule A participant will receive (1) a pro rata
bonus based on the participant&#146;s target annual incentive compensation, (2) two times
the sum of the participant&#146;s salary and target incentive bonus, (3) accelerated
vesting of equity-based awards, (4) a lump sum payment equal to the actuarial equivalent
of the participant&#146;s benefits under all of PSEG&#146;s retirement plans in which the
participant participates calculated as though the participant remained employed for two
years beyond the date his or her employment terminates less the actuarial equivalent of
such benefits on the date his or her employment terminates, (5) two years continued
welfare benefits (the first 18 months of which will be provided through PSEG-paid COBRA
continuation coverage), (6) one year of PSEG-paid outplacement services and (7) vesting of
any compensation previously deferred. </FONT></P>

target incentive bonus, retirement plan accruals and continuation of welfare benefits is
three years instead of two. </FONT></P>

is defined in the Severance Plan as a participant&#146;s: (1) willful and continued
failure to substantially perform his or her duties; (2) willful engagement in gross
misconduct that materially injures PSEG; (3) willful violation of PSEG&#146;s Standards of
Integrity or other applicable corporate code of conduct; or (4) felony conviction.
&#147;Good reason&#148; is defined with respect to a participant as: (1) a reduction in
the participant&#146;s salary or target incentive bonuses, other than reductions pursuant
to a broad-based compensation reduction program affecting similarly situated PSEG
employees; (2) an adverse change in the participant&#146;s titles, authority, duties,
responsibilities or reporting lines; (3) PSEG&#146;s failure to have a successor assume
the Severance Plan; or (4) any other material breach by PSEG of the terms of Severance
Plan that is not promptly remedied after receipt of notice from the participant. </FONT></P>

severance benefits are payable to a participant under the Severance Plan unless the
participant executes, within 45 days after the participant&#146;s termination date, a
general release of all employment-related claims against PSEG and its affiliates.
Severance benefits payable under the Severance Plan to a Schedule A participant will be
capped at an amount that would not cause PSEG to lose its deduction under Section 280G of

Code. Severance benefits payable to the Schedule B participant are not similarly capped
and, in the event any payments to the Schedule B participant are subject to the excise tax
under Section 4999 of the Code, the Schedule B participant will be entitled to an
additional gross-up payment so that the participant remains in the same after-tax position

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Retention Program, effective as of December 20, 2004, provides for payments to be made to
certain officers and key employees of PSEG who remain employed from the date of execution
of the Merger Agreement through the date that is 90 days after the consummation of the
Merger. The Committee will select any officers and has authorized the Committee or the
chief executive officer of PSEG to select other key employees that may receive retention
payments under the Retention Program. The Committee, in the case of any officers, and the
Committee or the chief executive officer of PSEG, in the case of non-officers, will determine the amount of
each participant&#146;s retention payment. The amount of a participant&#146;s retention
payment may not be less than 40% or more than 150% of the participant&#146;s annual base
salary. Retention payments under the Retention Program may not exceed $10 million in the
aggregate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSEG
will pay the first installment, equal to half of a participant&#146;s total retention
payment, within 60 days after the first anniversary of the date of execution of the Merger
Agreement. PSEG will pay the participant&#146;s remaining retention payment on the
business day following the date that is 90 days after the consummation of the Merger. No
participant whose employment terminates for any reason other than involuntary termination
without &#147;cause&#148; will receive any subsequent installment of the retention
payment. A participant whose employment is terminated without &#147;cause&#148; on or
prior to the consummation of the Merger will be treated as if he or she remained employed
through the date that is 90 days after the consummation of the Merger for all purposes
under the Retention Program. </FONT></P>

board fixes a new record date for the adjourned meeting or the Business
Corporation Law requires notice of the business to be transacted and such

otherwise failed to provide the corporation with a current address. Whenever
the shareholder provides the corporation with a current address, the
corporation shall recommence sending notices and other communications to the
shareholder in the manner provided by these bylaws.

business day). Failure to hold such meeting at the designated time or on the
designated date or to elect some or all of the members of the board at such
meeting or any adjournment thereof shall not affect otherwise valid corporate
acts or work a forfeiture or dissolution of the corporation. If the annual
meeting shall not have been called and held within six months after the
designated time, any shareholder may call the meeting at any time thereafter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.03 Special Meetings. Special meetings of the shareholders may be
called at any time by resolution of the board of directors, which may fix the
date, time and place of the meeting, and shall be called as provided in the
terms of the Preferred Stock. If the board does not fix the date, time or place
of the meeting, it shall be the duty of the secretary to do so. A date fixed by
the secretary shall not be more than 60 calendar days after the date of the
action calling the special meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.04 Quorum and Adjournment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;General Rule. A meeting of the shareholders of the corporation duly
called shall not be organized for the transaction of business unless a quorum
is present. Except as otherwise provided in the terms of the Preferred Stock,
the presence of shareholders entitled to cast at least a majority of the votes
that all shareholders are entitled to cast on a particular matter to be acted
upon at the meeting shall constitute a quorum for the purposes of consideration
and action on the matter. Shares of the corporation owned, directly or
indirectly, by it shall not be counted in determining the total number of
outstanding shares for quorum purposes at any given time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Withdrawal of a Quorum. The shareholders present at a duly organized
meeting can continue to do business until adjournment notwithstanding the
withdrawal of enough shareholders to leave less than a quorum.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Adjournments Generally. Any regular or special meeting of the
shareholders, including one at which directors are to be elected and one which
cannot be organized because a quorum has not attended, may be adjourned, except
as otherwise provided by the Business Corporation Law, for such period and to
such place as the shareholders present and entitled to vote shall direct.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Electing Directors at Adjourned Meeting. Those shareholders entitled

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;Other Action in Absence of Quorum. Those shareholders entitled to vote
who attend a meeting of shareholders that has been previously adjourned for one
or more periods aggregating at least 15 calendar days because of an absence of
a quorum, although less than a quorum as fixed in this Section of these bylaws,
shall nevertheless constitute a quorum for the purpose of acting upon any
matter set forth in the notice of the meeting if the notice states that those
shareholders who attend the adjourned meeting shall nevertheless constitute a
quorum for the purpose of acting upon the matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.05 Action by Shareholders.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;General Rule. Except as otherwise provided in the Business Corporation
Law or the articles or these bylaws, whenever any corporate action is to be
taken by vote of the shareholders of the corporation, it shall be authorized
upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes cast by all
shareholders entitled to vote thereon and, if any shareholders are entitled to
vote thereon as a class, upon receiving the affirmative vote of a majority of
the votes cast by the shareholders entitled to vote as a class, in each case at
a duly organized meeting of shareholders. Except as otherwise provided in the
terms of the Preferred Stock or when acting by unanimous consent to remove a
director or directors, the shareholders of the corporation may act only at a
duly organized meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Conduct of Business. Only such business will be conducted at an annual
or special meeting of shareholders as shall have been properly brought before
the meeting by or at the direction of the board of directors, or with respect
to an annual meeting, by any shareholder who complies with the procedures set
forth in this Section.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(1) For business to be properly brought before an annual meeting by
a shareholder, the shareholder must have given to the secretary of the
corporation timely written notice of the shareholder&#146;s intention to make
a proposal, in the manner and form prescribed herein.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) To be timely, a shareholder&#146;s notice with respect to an
annual meeting of shareholders must be addressed to the secretary
of the corporation at the principal executive offices of the
corporation and received by the secretary not less than 120
calendar days in advance of the first anniversary of the date on
which the corporation first mailed its proxy materials to
shareholders for the prior year&#146;s annual meeting of shareholders,
and this notice requirement shall not be affected by any
adjournment of said meeting; provided, however, that in the event
public announcement of the date of the annual meeting is not made
at least 75 calendar days prior to the date of the annual meeting,
notice by the shareholder to be timely must be so received not
later than the close of

public announcement is first made of the date of the annual
meeting.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(ii) A shareholder&#146;s notice to the secretary must set forth as
to each matter the shareholder proposes to bring before the annual
meeting (A)&nbsp;a description in reasonable detail of the business
desired to be brought before the annual meeting and the reasons for
conducting such business at the annual meeting, (B)&nbsp;the name and
address, as they appear on the corporation&#146;s books, of the
shareholder proposing such business and of the beneficial owner, if
any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, (C)&nbsp;the class and number
of shares of the corporation that are owned beneficially and of
record by the shareholder proposing such business and by the
beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the proposal is made, and
(D)&nbsp;any material interest of such shareholder proposing such
business and the beneficial owner, if any, on whose behalf the
proposal is made in such business.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of these
bylaws, a shareholder must also comply with all applicable
requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange
Act&#148;) and the rules and regulations thereunder with respect to the
matters set forth in this Section. For purposes of this Section,
&#147;public announcement&#148; means disclosure in a press release reported
by the Dow Jones News Service, Bloomberg Business News, or Reuters
Economic Services or in a document publicly filed by the
corporation with the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
Section&nbsp;13, 14, or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, or publicly filed by
the corporation with any national securities exchange or quotation
service through which the corporation&#146;s stock is listed or traded,
or furnished by the corporation to its shareholders.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no notice of the date of the annual
meeting is required for the advance notice provision of this
Section&nbsp;3.05 (b)&nbsp;to be effective if the annual meeting is held on
such date as specified in Section&nbsp;3.02 of these bylaws. Nothing in
this Section will be deemed to affect any rights of shareholders to
request inclusion of proposals in the corporation&#146;s proxy statement
pursuant to Rule&nbsp;14a-8 under the Exchange Act.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) At a special meeting of shareholders, only such business may be
conducted or considered as is properly brought before the meeting. To be
properly brought before a special meeting, business must be (i)&nbsp;specified
in the notice of the meeting (or any supplement thereto) given in
accordance with Section&nbsp;2.03 of these bylaws or (ii)&nbsp;otherwise brought
before the meeting by the presiding officer or by or at the direction of
a majority of the total number of directors that the corporation would
have if there were no vacancies on the board of directors (the &#147;Whole
Board&#148;).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.06 Organization.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Presiding Officer and Secretary of Meeting. At every meeting of the
shareholders, the chief executive officer, or such other officer of the
corporation designated by a majority of the Whole Board, will call meetings of
shareholders to order or, in the case of vacancy in office and absence of
action of the Whole Board, one of the following officers present in the order
stated: The president, if there be one, the vice presidents in their order of
rank and seniority shall act as &#147;presiding officer&#148; of the meeting. The term
&#147;presiding officer&#148; means an officer who presides over a meeting of
shareholders. The secretary or, in the absence of the secretary, an assistant
secretary, or, in the absence of both the secretary and assistant secretaries,
a person appointed by the presiding officer of the meeting, shall act as
secretary of the meeting.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Rules of Conduct. Unless otherwise determined by the board of
directors prior to the meeting, the presiding officer of the meeting of
shareholders will determine the order of business and have the authority to
make such rules or regulations for the conduct of meetings of shareholders as
such presiding officer deems necessary, appropriate or convenient for the
proper conduct of the meeting, including, without limitation, establishing an
agenda or order of business for the meeting, rules and procedures for
maintaining order at the meeting and the safety of those present, limitations
on participation in such meeting to shareholders of record of the corporation

the board of directors or the presiding officer shall permit, restrictions on
entry to the meeting after the time fixed for the commencement thereof,
limitations on the time allotted to questions or comment by participants and
regulation of the opening and closing of the polls for balloting on matters
which are to be voted on by ballot. Unless, and to the extent determined by the

shareholders need not be conducted in accordance with rules of parliamentary
procedure.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.07 Voting Rights of Shareholders. Unless otherwise provided in

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(2) The presence of, or vote or other action at a meeting of
shareholders by a proxy of a shareholder shall constitute the presence
of, or vote or action by, the shareholder.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(3) Where two or more proxies of a shareholder are present, the
corporation shall, unless otherwise expressly provided in the proxy,
accept as the vote of all shares represented thereby the vote cast by a
majority of them and, if a majority of the proxies cannot agree whether
the shares represented shall be voted, or upon the manner of voting the shares, the voting of the shares shall be divided equally among those
persons.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Form of Proxy. Every proxy shall be in a form approved by the
secretary of the corporation or as otherwise provided by the Business
Corporation Law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Revocation. A proxy, unless coupled with an interest, shall be
revocable at will, notwithstanding any other agreement or any provision in the
proxy to the contrary, but the revocation of a proxy shall not be effective
until written notice thereof has been given to the secretary of the
corporation. An unrevoked proxy shall not be valid after three years from the
date of its execution unless a longer time is expressly provided therein. A
proxy shall not be revoked by the death or incapacity of the maker unless,
before the vote is counted or the authority is exercised, written notice of the
death or incapacity is given to the secretary of the corporation.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Expenses. The corporation shall pay the reasonable expenses of
solicitation of votes or proxies of shareholders by or on behalf of the board
of directors or its nominees for election to the board, including solicitation
by professional proxy solicitors and otherwise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3.09 Voting by Fiduciaries and Pledgees. Shares of the corporation
standing in the name of a trustee or other fiduciary and shares held by an
assignee for the benefit of creditors or by a receiver may be voted by the
trustee, fiduciary, assignee or receiver. A shareholder whose shares are
pledged shall be entitled to vote the shares until the shares have been
transferred into the name of the pledgee, or a nominee of the pledgee, but
nothing in this Section shall affect the validity of a proxy given to a pledgee
or nominee.

appointing them or of an order of court directing the voting of the shares, the

accordance therewith.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Voting by Corporate Shareholders. Any domestic or foreign corporation
for profit or not-for-profit that is a shareholder of this corporation may vote
at meetings of shareholders of this corporation by any of its officers or
agents, or by proxy appointed by any officer or agent, unless some other
person, by resolution of the board of directors of the other corporation or a
provision of its articles or bylaws, a copy of which resolution or provision
certified to be correct by one of its officers has been filed with the
secretary of this corporation, is appointed its general or special proxy in
which case that person shall be entitled to vote the shares.

the shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, the meeting, which time,
except as otherwise provided in the articles or in the case of an adjourned
meeting, shall be not more than 90 calendar days prior to the date of the
meeting of shareholders. Only shareholders of record on the date fixed shall be
so entitled notwithstanding any transfer of shares on the books of the

board of directors may similarly fix a record date for the determination of
shareholders of record for any other purpose, except that the record date fixed
to determine the holders of Preferred Stock entitled to receive dividends
thereon shall not precede the respective dividend payment date by more than 40
calendar days. When a determination of shareholders of record has been made as
provided in this Section for purposes of a meeting, the determination shall

proceeding in advance of its final disposition (hereinafter an &#147;advancement of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that, as of the date hereof, I may be deemed to be an
&#147;affiliate&#148; of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated, a New Jersey
corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), as such term is defined for purposes of paragraphs
(c)&nbsp;and (d)&nbsp;of Rule&nbsp;145 of the Rules and Regulations (the &#147;Rules and
Regulations&#148;) of the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;)
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement and Plan of Merger, dated as of
December&nbsp;20, 2004 (as it may be amended, supplemented or modified from time to
time, the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), between the Company and Exelon Corporation, a
Pennsylvania corporation (&#147;Parent&#148;), the Company will be merged with and into
Parent (the &#147;Merger&#148;). Capitalized terms used herein but not defined herein
shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Merger Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have been advised that the issuance of Parent Shares pursuant to the
Merger will be registered with the Commission under the Securities Act on a
Registration Statement on Form S-4. I have also been advised, however, that
since I may be deemed to be an affiliate of the Company at the time the Merger
Agreement is submitted to a vote of the shareholders of the Company, my ability
to sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares that I receive in exchange for
any shares of Common Stock, no par value per share, of the Company (&#147;Company
Common Stock&#148;) pursuant to the Merger may be restricted unless such sale,
assignment or transfer is registered under the Securities Act or an exemption
from such registration is available. I understand that such exemptions are
limited and I have obtained advice of counsel as to the nature and conditions
of such exemptions, including information with respect to the applicability to
the sale of such Parent Shares of Rules&nbsp;144 and 145(d) promulgated under the
Securities Act.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hereby represent and warrant to and covenant with Parent that I will not
sell, assign or transfer any Parent Shares except (i)&nbsp;pursuant to an effective
registration statement under the Securities Act, (ii)&nbsp;by a sale made in
conformity with the volume and other limitations of Rule&nbsp;145 (and otherwise in
accordance with Rule&nbsp;144 under the Securities Act, if I am an affiliate of
Parent and if so required at the time) or (iii)&nbsp;in a transaction which, in the
opinion of independent counsel reasonably satisfactory to Parent or as
described in a &#147;no-action&#148; or interpretive letter from the Staff of the
Commission reasonably satisfactory to Parent, is not required to be registered
under the Securities Act. In the event of a sale of Parent Shares pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;145, I will supply Parent with evidence of compliance with such Rule, in
the form of customary seller&#146;s and broker&#146;s Rule&nbsp;145 representation letters or
as Parent may otherwise reasonably request.

to make compliance with an exemption from such registration available solely as
a result of the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I acknowledge and agree that appropriate legends will be placed on
certificates representing Parent Shares delivered to me or held by a transferee
thereof, which legends will be removed (i)&nbsp;by delivery of substitute

opinion of counsel in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to Parent, to
the effect that such legends are no longer required for the purposes of the
Securities Act and the rules and regulations thereunder or (ii)&nbsp;in the event of
a sale of Parent Shares which has been registered under the Securities Act or
made in conformity with the provisions of Rule&nbsp;145.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I further understand and agree that Parent may instruct the registrar for
the Parent Shares not to register the transfer of any Parent Shares held by me
unless any such transfer is made in accordance with this letter agreement.

This Key Executive Severance Plan was established by the Company to provide severance benefits to certain key executive-level employees of the Company and its Affiliates who terminate employment with an Employer after a Change in Control under the circumstances described herein. </font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.36in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;), which became law on October 22, 2004, added new section 409A to the Code and imposes new restrictions on deferred compensation, including certain severance arrangements. It further provides that payments upon a separation from service will meet the requirements of Code Section 409A only to the extent provided by guidance issued by the Department of Treasury where such payments are made due to a change in the ownership or effective control of the Company. The AJCA and any Treasury guidance issued to implement the AJCA may result in additional restrictions on a Participant&#146;s rights relating to compensation considered to be deferred under this Plan. This Plan automatically incorporates all applicable restrictions of the AJCA and such regulations, and the Company will amend the Plan to the extent necessary to comply with those requirements.
The timing under which a Participant will have a right to receive any payment under this Plan will be deemed to be automatically modified, and a Participant&#146;s rights under the Plan limited to conform to any requirements under the AJCA and such regulations.</font></p>

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.72in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Retention Program for Key Employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated is intended to reward selected officers and key employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (&#147;Enterprise&#148;) who continue to provide services to Enterprise after the date of the Merger Agreement between Exelon Corporation and Enterprise. This Program automatically incorporates all applicable restrictions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;) and guidance issued by the Department of Treasury under the AJCA, and Enterprise will amend the Program to the extent necessary to comply with such requirements. The AJCA, which became law on October 22, 2004, provides that payments due to a change in the ownership or effective control of the employer must comply with guidance issued by the Department of Treasury. The AJCA and any Treasury guidance issued to implement the AJCA may
result in additional restrictions on a Key Employee&#146;s rights relating to compensation considered to be deferred under this Program. The timing under which a Key Employee has a right to receive any payment under the Program will automatically be modified, and a Key Employee&#146;s rights under the Program shall be limited as necessary to conform to any requirements under the AJCA and such guidance.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.72in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Subject to the foregoing, the Program shall be operated and administered in accordance with the following terms and conditions:</font></p>

No act or failure to act on the part of a Key Employee shall be considered &#147;willful&#148; unless it is done or omitted by the Key Employee in bad faith or without reasonable belief that the Key Employee&#146;s action or omission was in the best interest of Enterprise.</font></p>

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>CHICAGO and NEWARK (December 20, 2004)&#151;Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) and Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE: PEG) announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to create Exelon Electric &amp; Gas, the nation&#146;s largest utility. The merger, which has been unanimously approved by both companies&#146; boards of directors, will create a combined company with total assets of approximately $79 billion, serving seven million electric customers and two million gas customers in Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The
combination of three utility franchises in three different states with service areas encompassing more than 18 million people will also allow for improved service and reliability with greater earnings predictability. The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to both companies&#146; earnings per share after closing.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The new company will have approximately $27 billion in annual revenues and $3.2 billion in annual net income. With a generation portfolio of approximately 52 thousand megawatts of domestic capacity, including long-term contracts, the combined company will be the nation&#146;s largest power generator and will be a leading U.S. wholesale power marketer.

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>practices, the merger will enhance operations and create efficiencies at all levels of the new company, including generation, transmission, distribution and power marketing.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Under the merger agreement, each common share of PSEG will be converted into 1.225 shares of Exelon. Following the merger, PSEG stockholders will own approximately 32%, or 306 million of Exelon Electric &amp; Gas&#146; pro-forma shares outstanding, and Exelon shareholders will own approximately 68%, or 650 million shares.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>John W. Rowe, currently chairman, president and chief executive officer of Exelon, will become the president and chief executive officer of Exelon Electric &amp; Gas upon completion of the merger and will be responsible for all operations of the combined company. Upon completion of the merger, E. James Ferland, currently chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG, will become non-executive chairman of the board of Exelon Electric &amp; Gas until his planned retirement in the spring of 2007. The new board will be comprised initially of 12 members nominated by Exelon and 6 members nominated by PSEG.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Mr.&nbsp;Rowe said: &#147;The combination of Exelon and PSEG is a compelling transaction that satisfies our stated criteria for a merger. It is accretive with sound returns, it can be accomplished without compromising our financial integrity, and it creates a strategic mix of assets. With complementary skills and common regulatory frameworks in three competitive state jurisdictions, all within the same regional transmission organization, we can create additional scale and scope that will provide operational synergies well into the future. This combination is a natural next step on the part of two companies whose assets, geography and strategies complement one another and whose partnership history is already established.&#148;</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Mr.&nbsp;Ferland said: &#147;This is a truly unique opportunity for two major companies. Exelon is the leader in the nuclear generation business and will have an immediate positive impact on our operations. By contrast, we are highly regarded for our expertise in transmission and distribution operations and retail auctions, which will be a valuable addition to Exelon&#146;s business. John Rowe will bring a wealth of executive experience and success to the new and larger organization. He is a good, strong leader who understands how to accomplish what we both envision: the creation of the ideal business model for the utility industry. Together with the talented employees of both companies, John will build a new business that will grow shareholder value and serve all our constituencies well.&#148;</font></p>

This will reduce all-in power  generation and marketing costs and create a more balanced portfolio in  terms of geography, fuel mix, dispatch, and load-serving capability.

The merger will provide customer benefits by enhancing operations and strengthening reliability. The merged company will draw upon the intellectual capital, technical expertise and experience of a deeper and more diverse workforce. The combined company will also be better able to invest in and deploy new technologies to improve service. Exelon and PSEG have strong and improving records of safety, reliability and customer satisfaction, and the merged company will build on that success. Moreover, the companies will maintain their substantial presence in the cities and communities they serve, and will sustain their record of significant charitable and civic contributions
and promotion of economic development. These improvements will benefit customers and their communities in terms of the quality and cost of service they receive.</font></td></tr></table>

With its combination of regulated utility businesses and a large, unregulated, low-cost and low-emissions generation business, the new company will provide investors with strong and stable earnings and cash flow growth. About half of the combined company&#146;s earnings and cash flow will come from the three regulated utilities and half from the unregulated generation business. Operating in multiple states and geographic regions will further diversify risks and increase consistency of earnings, as will the larger, more diverse generation platform. This balanced strategy will enable the new company to prosper through changing energy markets and regulatory
conditions. The improved nuclear operations will result in greater and more predictable output. Finally, the combined gas distribution businesses will complement the electric side of the regulated utilities, further balancing overall earnings and cash flow. PSEG&#146;s strategy to cease additional capital investments in PSEG Energy Holdings and to pursue sales of its international investments will be continued pending the closing of the merger and thereafter.</font></td></tr></table>

Increased scale and scope will also strengthen the balance sheet of the combined company, improving financial flexibility and better positioning it to meet the changing landscape of the energy industry into the future. This sound financial structure will provide the basis for continued investment in technology and other drivers of long-term growth. Exelon and PSEG have informed both Moody&#146;s and Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s regarding today&#146;s announcement, and each of the rating agencies will issue its own press release regarding the merger. Exelon and PSEG believe, based on their own analysis, that Exelon Electric &amp; Gas and its subsidiaries will have solid

Approximately 70% of the synergies will come from the unregulated businesses, with the remaining 30% from the regulated utilities. A portion of any job losses will be offset by anticipated retirements and normal attrition. In addition, Exelon Electric &amp; Gas will reduce the
impact of the merger on the workforce through appropriate severance plans. Reductions due to the merger are estimated at approximately 5% of the consolidated workforce of approximately 28,000 employees. Approximately 38% of the post-merger workforce will be located in New Jersey. All union contracts will be honored.</font></td></tr></table>

Given Exelon&#146;s strong, successful performance in running the nation&#146;s largest nuclear fleet, the companies expect to realize improved stability, higher capacity utilization rates and lower costs from combining nuclear operations under one management. The companies have entered into a Nuclear Operating Services Contract (&#147;NOSC&#148;) commencing on January 17, 2005 under which Exelon will provide personnel to work full time in the PSEG nuclear organization. Under the agreement, Exelon will supply senior personnel to oversee daily plant operations and to implement the Exelon Nuclear Management Model, which defines proven practices that Exelon has used to
manage its successful nuclear performance improvement program. This will assist PSEG in improving the operations of the Salem nuclear facility, which is jointly owned with Exelon, and the adjacent Hope Creek nuclear facility. PSEG will remain license holder and retain responsibility for management oversight until the close of the merger, and will have full authority with respect to marketing of its share of the output from the facilities. This agreement should result in benefits to both companies in 2005.</font></td></tr></table>

New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois all have passed legislation bringing competition to the electric industry, and are in varying phases of the transition to full competition. The regulatory knowledge and experience of each company will enhance the merged company&#146;s ability to manage the transition to competition for the benefit of both customers and shareholders. In particular, PSEG&#146;s experience with the New Jersey auction process for procurement of power for regulated utility customers will be an important asset for ComEd as it nears the end of its transition period in Illinois, where a similar auction process is expected. In addition, Exelon
and PSEG have been staunch advocates for competitive retail and wholesale markets in electricity and gas. This shared vision will allow the new company to be even more active in the promotion of competitive markets and the development of energy-related services.</font></td></tr></table>

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>Dividend Policy</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>It is anticipated that the new company&#146;s Board of Directors will maintain Exelon&#146;s current dividend payout policy of 50% to 60% of earnings. The merger agreement stipulates that at closing, after giving effect to the exchange ratio in the merger, PSEG shareholders receive the same aggregate cash dividends on the Exelon Electric &amp; Gas shares that they were receiving on their position in PSEG shares prior to the merger. In order to reflect a consistent payout, assuming a 4-cent annual dividend increase by PSEG in 2005 to $2.24 per share, Exelon would expect to raise its annual dividend from $1.60 to approximately $1.83 per share in 2005 immediately prior to the close of the merger, assuming a year-end 2005 close.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>Headquarters</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Following the merger, Exelon Electric &amp; Gas will have its corporate headquarters in Chicago, the current location of Exelon&#146;s headquarters, and the company&#146;s energy trading operations and nuclear headquarters will be located in Pennsylvania. The headquarters of the combined generation company will be located in Newark, as will the PSE&amp;G headquarters. This latter arrangement is similar to Exelon&#146;s continued significant presence in Philadelphia following the merger of Unicom Corporation (then parent company of ComEd) and PECO Energy in 2000.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>Approvals and Timing</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the approval by shareholders of both companies, antitrust clearance and a number of regulatory approvals or reviews by federal and state energy authorities. These include the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the Illinois Commerce Commission (notice filing only), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and either the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending upon which agency reviews the transaction. The companies intend to register the new company as a holding company with the SEC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The companies anticipate that the regulatory approvals can be obtained within 12-15 months and intend to seek shareholder approval in the second quarter of 2005.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The FERC and antitrust agency reviews will encompass a detailed review of the effect of the merger on wholesale competition and regulation. The company will work to secure necessary government approvals consistent with FERC&#146;s Merger Policy Statement and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.</font></p>
