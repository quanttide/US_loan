<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt;text-align:center; margin-top:16pt;'><b><font SIZE=2>RETENTION PROGRAM FOR KEY EMPLOYEES OF PUBLIC SERVICE ENTERPRISE GROUP INCORPORATED</font></b></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.72in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The Retention Program for Key Employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated is intended to reward selected officers and key employees of Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (&#147;Enterprise&#148;) who continue to provide services to Enterprise after the date of the Merger Agreement between Exelon Corporation and Enterprise. This Program automatically incorporates all applicable restrictions of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004 (the &#147;AJCA&#148;) and guidance issued by the Department of Treasury under the AJCA, and Enterprise will amend the Program to the extent necessary to comply with such requirements. The AJCA, which became law on October 22, 2004, provides that payments due to a change in the ownership or effective control of the employer must comply with guidance issued by the Department of Treasury. The AJCA and any Treasury guidance issued to implement the AJCA may
result in additional restrictions on a Key Employee&#146;s rights relating to compensation considered to be deferred under this Program. The timing under which a Key Employee has a right to receive any payment under the Program will automatically be modified, and a Key Employee&#146;s rights under the Program shall be limited as necessary to conform to any requirements under the AJCA and such guidance.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0.72in; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Subject to the foregoing, the Program shall be operated and administered in accordance with the following terms and conditions:</font></p>
