the PS organization on behalf of, and subject to the direction of the PS Chief
Executive Officer or other PS Executive Officer as designated by PS. The
specific positions to be filled, the duration of assignments and the general
scopes of responsibilities will be established from time to time by mutual
agreement of PS and Exelon. The individuals assigned to fill such positions
shall be selected by Exelon, subject to PS&#146;s right to approve such selections,
which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Parties anticipate that
one of the individuals providing On-Site Operating Services will be designated
to function as the &#147;Chief Nuclear Office (CNO)&#148;, as that term is recognized by
the NRC, and will be duly authorized and empowered to perform the duties
associated with that position. The CNO shall have the full authority to manage
operation of the PS Nuclear Facilities on a day-to-day basis and PS shall
provide full cooperation, assistance and support in that effort; provided that
PS shall have all authority over marketing of the output of its ownership
shares the PS Nuclear Facilities and, subject to the right of the on-site
operating management to take action that they consider necessary for protection
of property or of the public safety, over dispatch of the PS Nuclear Facilities
and over decisions to remove any facility from, or return any facility to
service. The CNO, together with additional personnel provided by Exelon, shall
have the responsibility and authority to implement the Nuclear Management Model
and to make changes in PS Nuclear management, staff, organization, procedures
and processes to improve safety margins and performance at the PS Nuclear
Facilities. The CNO and additional personnel shall serve under this
Agreement on a full time basis, shall be devoted exclusively to their duties
under this Agreement and shall have no employment duties at Exelon. During
the Term of this Agreement, Exelon will not withdraw an individual assigned to
fill an On-Site Operating Services position without the prior consent of the
President of PSEG Power or the Chief Executive Officer of PSEG, which consent
shall not be unreasonably withheld. PS reserves the right to request and
demand that an individual assigned to provide On-Site Management Service be
removed with or without cause.
