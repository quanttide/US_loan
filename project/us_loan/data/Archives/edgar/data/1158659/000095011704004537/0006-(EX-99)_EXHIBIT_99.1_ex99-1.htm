<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; text-indent:0; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>CHICAGO and NEWARK (December 20, 2004)&#151;Exelon Corporation (NYSE: EXC) and Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (NYSE: PEG) announced today that they have entered into a definitive merger agreement to create Exelon Electric &amp; Gas, the nation&#146;s largest utility. The merger, which has been unanimously approved by both companies&#146; boards of directors, will create a combined company with total assets of approximately $79 billion, serving seven million electric customers and two million gas customers in Illinois, New Jersey and Pennsylvania. The
combination of three utility franchises in three different states with service areas encompassing more than 18 million people will also allow for improved service and reliability with greater earnings predictability. The transaction is anticipated to be immediately accretive to both companies&#146; earnings per share after closing.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The new company will have approximately $27 billion in annual revenues and $3.2 billion in annual net income. With a generation portfolio of approximately 52 thousand megawatts of domestic capacity, including long-term contracts, the combined company will be the nation&#146;s largest power generator and will be a leading U.S. wholesale power marketer.

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>practices, the merger will enhance operations and create efficiencies at all levels of the new company, including generation, transmission, distribution and power marketing.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Under the merger agreement, each common share of PSEG will be converted into 1.225 shares of Exelon. Following the merger, PSEG stockholders will own approximately 32%, or 306 million of Exelon Electric &amp; Gas&#146; pro-forma shares outstanding, and Exelon shareholders will own approximately 68%, or 650 million shares.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>John W. Rowe, currently chairman, president and chief executive officer of Exelon, will become the president and chief executive officer of Exelon Electric &amp; Gas upon completion of the merger and will be responsible for all operations of the combined company. Upon completion of the merger, E. James Ferland, currently chairman, president and chief executive officer of PSEG, will become non-executive chairman of the board of Exelon Electric &amp; Gas until his planned retirement in the spring of 2007. The new board will be comprised initially of 12 members nominated by Exelon and 6 members nominated by PSEG.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Mr.&nbsp;Rowe said: &#147;The combination of Exelon and PSEG is a compelling transaction that satisfies our stated criteria for a merger. It is accretive with sound returns, it can be accomplished without compromising our financial integrity, and it creates a strategic mix of assets. With complementary skills and common regulatory frameworks in three competitive state jurisdictions, all within the same regional transmission organization, we can create additional scale and scope that will provide operational synergies well into the future. This combination is a natural next step on the part of two companies whose assets, geography and strategies complement one another and whose partnership history is already established.&#148;</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Mr.&nbsp;Ferland said: &#147;This is a truly unique opportunity for two major companies. Exelon is the leader in the nuclear generation business and will have an immediate positive impact on our operations. By contrast, we are highly regarded for our expertise in transmission and distribution operations and retail auctions, which will be a valuable addition to Exelon&#146;s business. John Rowe will bring a wealth of executive experience and success to the new and larger organization. He is a good, strong leader who understands how to accomplish what we both envision: the creation of the ideal business model for the utility industry. Together with the talented employees of both companies, John will build a new business that will grow shareholder value and serve all our constituencies well.&#148;</font></p>

This will reduce all-in power  generation and marketing costs and create a more balanced portfolio in  terms of geography, fuel mix, dispatch, and load-serving capability.

The merger will provide customer benefits by enhancing operations and strengthening reliability. The merged company will draw upon the intellectual capital, technical expertise and experience of a deeper and more diverse workforce. The combined company will also be better able to invest in and deploy new technologies to improve service. Exelon and PSEG have strong and improving records of safety, reliability and customer satisfaction, and the merged company will build on that success. Moreover, the companies will maintain their substantial presence in the cities and communities they serve, and will sustain their record of significant charitable and civic contributions
and promotion of economic development. These improvements will benefit customers and their communities in terms of the quality and cost of service they receive.</font></td></tr></table>

With its combination of regulated utility businesses and a large, unregulated, low-cost and low-emissions generation business, the new company will provide investors with strong and stable earnings and cash flow growth. About half of the combined company&#146;s earnings and cash flow will come from the three regulated utilities and half from the unregulated generation business. Operating in multiple states and geographic regions will further diversify risks and increase consistency of earnings, as will the larger, more diverse generation platform. This balanced strategy will enable the new company to prosper through changing energy markets and regulatory
conditions. The improved nuclear operations will result in greater and more predictable output. Finally, the combined gas distribution businesses will complement the electric side of the regulated utilities, further balancing overall earnings and cash flow. PSEG&#146;s strategy to cease additional capital investments in PSEG Energy Holdings and to pursue sales of its international investments will be continued pending the closing of the merger and thereafter.</font></td></tr></table>

Increased scale and scope will also strengthen the balance sheet of the combined company, improving financial flexibility and better positioning it to meet the changing landscape of the energy industry into the future. This sound financial structure will provide the basis for continued investment in technology and other drivers of long-term growth. Exelon and PSEG have informed both Moody&#146;s and Standard &amp; Poor&#146;s regarding today&#146;s announcement, and each of the rating agencies will issue its own press release regarding the merger. Exelon and PSEG believe, based on their own analysis, that Exelon Electric &amp; Gas and its subsidiaries will have solid

Approximately 70% of the synergies will come from the unregulated businesses, with the remaining 30% from the regulated utilities. A portion of any job losses will be offset by anticipated retirements and normal attrition. In addition, Exelon Electric &amp; Gas will reduce the
impact of the merger on the workforce through appropriate severance plans. Reductions due to the merger are estimated at approximately 5% of the consolidated workforce of approximately 28,000 employees. Approximately 38% of the post-merger workforce will be located in New Jersey. All union contracts will be honored.</font></td></tr></table>

Given Exelon&#146;s strong, successful performance in running the nation&#146;s largest nuclear fleet, the companies expect to realize improved stability, higher capacity utilization rates and lower costs from combining nuclear operations under one management. The companies have entered into a Nuclear Operating Services Contract (&#147;NOSC&#148;) commencing on January 17, 2005 under which Exelon will provide personnel to work full time in the PSEG nuclear organization. Under the agreement, Exelon will supply senior personnel to oversee daily plant operations and to implement the Exelon Nuclear Management Model, which defines proven practices that Exelon has used to
manage its successful nuclear performance improvement program. This will assist PSEG in improving the operations of the Salem nuclear facility, which is jointly owned with Exelon, and the adjacent Hope Creek nuclear facility. PSEG will remain license holder and retain responsibility for management oversight until the close of the merger, and will have full authority with respect to marketing of its share of the output from the facilities. This agreement should result in benefits to both companies in 2005.</font></td></tr></table>

New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Illinois all have passed legislation bringing competition to the electric industry, and are in varying phases of the transition to full competition. The regulatory knowledge and experience of each company will enhance the merged company&#146;s ability to manage the transition to competition for the benefit of both customers and shareholders. In particular, PSEG&#146;s experience with the New Jersey auction process for procurement of power for regulated utility customers will be an important asset for ComEd as it nears the end of its transition period in Illinois, where a similar auction process is expected. In addition, Exelon
and PSEG have been staunch advocates for competitive retail and wholesale markets in electricity and gas. This shared vision will allow the new company to be even more active in the promotion of competitive markets and the development of energy-related services.</font></td></tr></table>

<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>Dividend Policy</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>It is anticipated that the new company&#146;s Board of Directors will maintain Exelon&#146;s current dividend payout policy of 50% to 60% of earnings. The merger agreement stipulates that at closing, after giving effect to the exchange ratio in the merger, PSEG shareholders receive the same aggregate cash dividends on the Exelon Electric &amp; Gas shares that they were receiving on their position in PSEG shares prior to the merger. In order to reflect a consistent payout, assuming a 4-cent annual dividend increase by PSEG in 2005 to $2.24 per share, Exelon would expect to raise its annual dividend from $1.60 to approximately $1.83 per share in 2005 immediately prior to the close of the merger, assuming a year-end 2005 close.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>Headquarters</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>Following the merger, Exelon Electric &amp; Gas will have its corporate headquarters in Chicago, the current location of Exelon&#146;s headquarters, and the company&#146;s energy trading operations and nuclear headquarters will be located in Pennsylvania. The headquarters of the combined generation company will be located in Newark, as will the PSE&amp;G headquarters. This latter arrangement is similar to Exelon&#146;s continued significant presence in Philadelphia following the merger of Unicom Corporation (then parent company of ComEd) and PECO Energy in 2000.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:12pt;'><font size=2>Approvals and Timing</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The merger is conditioned upon, among other things, the approval by shareholders of both companies, antitrust clearance and a number of regulatory approvals or reviews by federal and state energy authorities. These include the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities, the Pennsylvania Public Utility Commission, the Illinois Commerce Commission (notice filing only), the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and either the Department of Justice (DOJ) or the Federal Trade Commission (FTC), depending upon which agency reviews the transaction. The companies intend to register the new company as a holding company with the SEC under the Public Utility Holding Company Act. The companies anticipate that the regulatory approvals can be obtained within 12-15 months and intend to seek shareholder approval in the second quarter of 2005.</font></p>
<p style=' margin-bottom:0pt; margin-top:8pt;'><font size=2>The FERC and antitrust agency reviews will encompass a detailed review of the effect of the merger on wholesale competition and regulation. The company will work to secure necessary government approvals consistent with FERC&#146;s Merger Policy Statement and the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act.</font></p>
