December 20, 2004, Public Service Enterprise Group Incorporated (&#147;PSEG&#148;) and
Exelon Corporation (&#147;Exelon&#148;) entered into an Agreement and Plan of Merger (the
&#147;Merger Agreement&#148;). Concurrently therewith, PSEG Nuclear LLC entered into an
Operating Services Contract with Exelon Generation Company, LLC relating to the provision
of operating services by Exelon Generation Company, LLC in respect of PSEG&#146;s Salem
and Hope Creek nuclear generating stations. In addition, concurrently therewith, PSEG (1)
entered into a second amendment to its employment agreement with E. James Ferland, the
current Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of PSEG, (2) adopted the Key Executive
Severance Plan of PSEG (the &#147;Severance Plan&#148;) and (3) adopted the Retention

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Merger Agreement provides for a business combination whereby PSEG will be merged with and
into Exelon, with Exelon surviving (the &#147;Merger&#148;). At the effective time of and
as a result of the Merger, (i) each share of PSEG common stock (other than shares owned by
Exelon or PSEG) will be converted into the right to receive 1.225 shares of Exelon common
stock (the &#147;Exchange Ratio&#148;) and (ii) each share of Exelon common stock will
remain outstanding. All outstanding PSEG stock options will be converted into options to
purchase the number of shares of Exelon common stock determined by multiplying (a) the
number of shares of PSEG common stock subject to such stock option immediately prior to
the effective time by (b) the Exchange Ratio, at an exercise price per share of Exelon
common stock equal to the exercise price per share of PSEG common stock under such stock
option immediately prior to the effective time divided by the Exchange Ratio. </FONT></P>

board of directors, which will include six members nominated by PSEG and twelve members
nominated by Exelon. E. James Ferland, the current Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer of PSEG, will become
the non-executive Chairman of the Board of the surviving corporation. John W. Rowe, the current Chairman,
President and Chief Executive Officer of Exelon, will become the President and Chief Executive
Officer of the surviving corporation. </FONT></P>

relating to alternative business combination transactions or (B) subject to certain
exceptions, enter into discussions concerning alternative business combination
transactions, (ii) by PSEG and Exelon to cause stockholder meetings to be held to consider
approval of the Merger and related transactions, (iii) subject to PSEG&#146;s right to
terminate the Merger Agreement to accept a superior proposal (as described in the Merger
Agreement), for the board of directors of PSEG to recommend adoption and approval by
PSEG&#146;s stockholders of the Merger Agreement and related transactions and (iv) subject

December 20, 2004, PSEG and E. James Ferland, the current Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer of PSEG, entered into a Second Amendment (the &#147;Second Amendment&#148;) to Mr.
Ferland&#146;s Employment Agreement dated June 16, 1998, as amended as of November 20,
2001 (the &#147;Original Employment Agreement&#148;). The Second Amendment provides that,
as of the consummation of the Merger, Mr. Ferland will serve solely as Exelon&#146;s
Chairman. Mr. Ferland will not have any executive duties after the effective time of the
Merger. Mr. Ferland&#146;s term of employment continues through March 31, 2007, at which
time he has agreed to retire. During the term of employment, Mr. Ferland&#146;s annual
salary, target annual incentive bonus and target long-term incentive bonus will be set by
the Board of Directors of Exelon, but will not be less than the amounts paid to him or the
targets set for him immediately prior to the effective time of the Merger. Mr. Ferland
waives his right to resign his employment for &#147;good reason&#148; as a result of the
Merger because: (1) of the changes to his title, authority, duties, responsibilities and
reporting lines; (2) he is not appointed to the position of Chief Executive Officer of
Exelon; or (3) another individual is appointed to the position of Chief Executive Officer
of Exelon. Further, Mr. Ferland acknowledges that the changes in his title, authority,
duties, responsibilities and reporting lines do not constitute a termination of his
employment without &#147;cause&#148;. Otherwise, the provisions of Mr. Ferland&#146;s
Original Employment Agreement, as amended, providing for severance payments on the
termination of his employment without &#147;cause&#148; or on the resignation of his
employment for &#147;good reason&#148;, remain in effect. </FONT></P>

received as a long-term incentive bonus, and he will be paid any previously deferred
compensation. He will not receive any special severance payments on retirement. </FONT></P>

Plan were selected by PSEG&#146;s Organization and Compensation Committee (the
&#147;Committee&#148;) on December 19, 2004 and were designated as either Schedule A or

employment or change in control agreements. There is one Schedule B participant, R. Edwin
Selover, who is a direct report to the Chief Executive Officer of PSEG and who also is not
a party to an individual employment or change in control agreement. Eligibility of
Schedule A and Schedule B participants to participate in the Severance Plan is conditioned

of a written agreement to be bound by the terms of the Confidentiality, Non-Compete and
Non-Solicitation covenants described in Article VI of the Severance Plan. </FONT></P>

vesting of equity-based awards, (4) a lump sum payment equal to the actuarial equivalent
of the participant&#146;s benefits under all of PSEG&#146;s retirement plans in which the
participant participates calculated as though the participant remained employed for two
years beyond the date his or her employment terminates less the actuarial equivalent of
such benefits on the date his or her employment terminates, (5) two years continued
welfare benefits (the first 18 months of which will be provided through PSEG-paid COBRA
continuation coverage), (6) one year of PSEG-paid outplacement services and (7) vesting of
any compensation previously deferred. </FONT></P>

misconduct that materially injures PSEG; (3) willful violation of PSEG&#146;s Standards of
Integrity or other applicable corporate code of conduct; or (4) felony conviction.

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Retention Program, effective as of December 20, 2004, provides for payments to be made to
certain officers and key employees of PSEG who remain employed from the date of execution
of the Merger Agreement through the date that is 90 days after the consummation of the
Merger. The Committee will select any officers and has authorized the Committee or the
chief executive officer of PSEG to select other key employees that may receive retention
payments under the Retention Program. The Committee, in the case of any officers, and the
Committee or the chief executive officer of PSEG, in the case of non-officers, will determine the amount of
each participant&#146;s retention payment. The amount of a participant&#146;s retention
payment may not be less than 40% or more than 150% of the participant&#146;s annual base
salary. Retention payments under the Retention Program may not exceed $10 million in the
aggregate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PSEG
will pay the first installment, equal to half of a participant&#146;s total retention
payment, within 60 days after the first anniversary of the date of execution of the Merger
Agreement. PSEG will pay the participant&#146;s remaining retention payment on the
business day following the date that is 90 days after the consummation of the Merger. No
participant whose employment terminates for any reason other than involuntary termination
without &#147;cause&#148; will receive any subsequent installment of the retention
payment. A participant whose employment is terminated without &#147;cause&#148; on or
prior to the consummation of the Merger will be treated as if he or she remained employed
through the date that is 90 days after the consummation of the Merger for all purposes
under the Retention Program. </FONT></P>
