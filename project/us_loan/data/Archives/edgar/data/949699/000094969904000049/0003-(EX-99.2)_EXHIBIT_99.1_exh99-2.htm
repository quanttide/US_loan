<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">B.&#9;Participant is to render valuable services to the
Company (or a Subsidiary), and this Agreement is executed pursuant to, and is
intended to carry out the purposes of, the Plan in connection with the Company's
grant of an option to Participant.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">C.&#9;All capitalized terms in this Agreement shall have the
meaning assigned to them in the attached Appendix.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<B><P>NOW, THEREFORE</B>, it is hereby agreed as follows:</P>
<OL>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<OL>

<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Grant of Option</B></U>.  The Company hereby grants
to Participant, as of the Grant Date, a Non-Qualified Stock Option to purchase
up to the number of Option Shares specified in the Grant Notice.  The Option
Shares shall be purchasable from time to time during the option term specified
in Paragraph 2 at the Exercise Price.</LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Option Term</B></U>.  This option shall have a term
of ten (10) years measured from the Grant Date and shall accordingly expire at
the close of business on the Expiration Date, unless sooner terminated in
accordance with Paragraph 5 or 6. </LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Limited Transferability</B></U>.  This option shall
be neither transferable nor assignable by Participant other than by will or by
the laws of descent and distribution following Participant's death and may be
exercised, during Participant's lifetime, only by Participant.  This option may,
in connection with the Participant's estate plan, be assigned in whole or in
part during Participant's lifetime to one or more members of the Participant's
family or to a trust established for the exclusive benefit of one or more such
family members.  The assigned portion shall be exercisable only by the person or
persons who acquire a proprietary interest in the option pursuant to such
assignment.  The term applicable to the assigned portion shall be the same as
those in effect for this option immediately prior to such assignment and shall
be set forth in such documents issued to the assignee as the Committee may deem
appropriate. </LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Dates of Exercise</B></U>.  This option shall
become exercisable for the Option Shares in one or more installments as
specified in the Grant Notice.  As the option becomes exercisable for such
installments, those installments shall accumulate and the option shall remain
exercisable for the accumulated installments until the Expiration Date or sooner
termination of the option term under Paragraph 5 or 6. </LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Cessation of Service</B></U>.  The option term
specified in Paragraph 2 shall terminate (and this option shall cease to be
outstanding) prior to the Expiration Date should any of the following provisions
become applicable:</LI></P><OL TYPE="a">

<OL TYPE="i">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Should Participant be terminated from employment or
Service for any reason (other than death or Disability) while this option is
outstanding, then Participant shall have a period of thirty-six (36) months
(commencing with the date of such cessation of Service) during which to exercise
this option, but in no event shall this option be exercisable at any time after
the Expiration Date.  </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Should Participant cease Service by reason of death or
Disability, then, in the case of Death, the personal representative of
Participant's estate or the person or persons to whom the option is transferred
pursuant to Participant's will or in accordance with the laws of descent and
distribution, and in the case of Disability, the Participant, shall have the
right to exercise this option.  Such right shall lapse and this option shall
cease to be outstanding from the earlier of (a)&nbsp;the expiration of the
thirty-six (36)-month period measured from the date of Participant's death or
Disability or (b)&nbsp;the Expiration date.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Should Participant cease Service by reason of Disability
while this option is outstanding, then Participant shall have a period of
thirty-six (36) months (commencing with the date of such cessation of Service)
during which to exercise this option.  In no event shall this option be
exercisable at any time after the Expiration Date.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Should Participant's Service be terminated for
Misconduct, then this option shall terminate immediately and cease to remain
outstanding.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>During the limited period of post-Service exercisability,
this option may not be exercised in the aggregate for more than the number of
vested Option Shares for which the option is exercisable at the time of
Participant's cessation of Service.  However, in the event of the Optionee's
cessation of Service, by reason of death or Disability, each outstanding option,
which is not otherwise vested or remains subject to forfeiture shall
automatically accelerate so that each such option shall, immediately upon such
cessation of Service, by reason of death or Disability, become vested and
exercisable with regard to one hundred percent (100%) of the shares of Common
Stock which are at the time subject to such option and unvested and may be
exercised for all or any portion of such shares as fully-vested shares of Common
Stock, if applicable and one hundred percent (100%) of the forfeiture
restrictions on such options, if applicable, will lapse.  Upon the expiration of
such limited exercise period or (if earlier) upon the Expiration Date, this
option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding for any vested Option Shares
for which the option has not been exercised.  To the extent Participant is not
vested in the Option Shares at the time of Participant's cessation of Service,
this option shall immediately terminate and cease to be outstanding with respect
to those shares.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In the event of a Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control, the provisions of Paragraph 6 shall govern the period for which this
option is to remain exercisable following Participant's cessation of Service and
shall supersede any provisions to the contrary in this paragraph. </LI></P></OL>
</OL>

<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Special Acceleration of Option</B></U>.</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In the event of any Corporate Transaction or Change in
Control, all Option Shares at the time subject to this option but not otherwise
vested shall automatically vest so that this option shall, immediately prior to
the specified effective date for the Corporate Transaction, become fully
exercisable for all of the Option Shares at the time subject to this option and
may be exercised for all or any portion of such shares as fully-vested shares of
Common Stock.  Immediately following the consummation of the Corporate
Transaction, this option shall terminate and cease to be outstanding, except to
the extent assumed by the successor corporation or its parent company.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>If this option is assumed in connection with a Corporate
Transaction, then this option shall be appropriately adjusted, immediately after
such Corporate Transaction, to apply to the number and class of securities which
would have been issuable to Participant in consummation of such Corporate
Transaction had the option been exercised immediately prior to such Corporate
Transaction, and appropriate adjustments shall also be made to the Exercise
Price, <U>provided</U> the aggregate Exercise Price shall remain the
same.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>This Agreement shall not in any way affect the right of
the Company to adjust, reclassify, reorganize or otherwise change its capital or
business structure or to merge, consolidate, dissolve, liquidate or sell or
transfer all or any part of its business or assets.</LI></P></OL>

<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Adjustment in Option Shares</B></U>.  Should any
change be made to the Common Stock by reason of any stock split, stock dividend,
recapitalization, combination of shares, exchange of shares or other change
affecting the outstanding Common Stock as a class without the Company's receipt
of consideration, appropriate adjustments shall be made to (i) the total number
and/or class of securities subject to this option and (ii) the Exercise Price in
order to reflect such change and thereby preclude a dilution or enlargement of
benefits hereunder.</LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Stockholder Rights</B></U>.  The holder of this
option shall not have any stockholder rights with respect to the Option Shares
until such person shall have exercised the option, paid the Exercise Price and
become a holder of record of the purchased shares.</LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Manner of Exercising Option</B></U>.</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In order to exercise this option with respect to all or
any part of the Option Shares for which this option is at the time exercisable,
Participant (or any other person or persons exercising the option) must take the
following actions:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="i">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Execute and deliver to the Company a Notice of Exercise
for the Option Shares for which the option is exercised.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Pay the aggregate Exercise Price for the purchased shares
in one or more of the following forms:</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="A">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>cash or check made payable to the Company; </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>shares of Common Stock held by Participant (or any other
person or persons exercising the option) for the requisite period necessary to
avoid a charge to the Company's earnings for financial reporting purposes and
valued at Fair Market Value on the Exercise Date; or </LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>through a special sale and remittance procedure pursuant
to which Participant (or any other person or persons exercising the option)
shall concurrently provide irrevocable written instructions (a) to a Company-
designated brokerage firm to effect the immediate sale of the purchased shares
and remit to the Company, out of the sale proceeds available on the settlement
date, sufficient funds to cover the aggregate Exercise Price payable for the
purchased shares plus all applicable Federal, state and local income and
employment taxes required to be withheld by the Company by reason of such
exercise and (b) to the Company to deliver the certificates for the purchased
shares directly to such brokerage firm in order to complete the sale
transaction.</LI></P></OL>

<P>Except to the extent the sale and remittance procedure is utilized in
connection with the option exercise, payment of the Exercise Price must
accompany the Notice of Exercise delivered to the Company in connection with the
option exercise. </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Furnish to the Company appropriate documentation that the
person or persons exercising the option (if other than Participant) have the
right to exercise this option.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Make appropriate arrangements with the Company (or
Subsidiary employing or retaining Participant) for the satisfaction of all
Federal, state and local income and employment tax withholding requirements
applicable to the option exercise.</LI></P></OL>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>As soon as practical after the Exercise Date, the Company
shall issue to or on behalf of Participant (or any other person or persons
exercising this option) a certificate for the purchased Option Shares, with the
appropriate legends affixed thereto.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>In no event may this option be exercised for any
fractional shares.</LI></P></OL>

<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Compliance with Laws and Regulations</B></U>.
</LI></P>
<OL TYPE="a">

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The exercise of this option and the issuance of the
Option Shares upon such exercise shall be subject to compliance by the Company
and Participant with all applicable requirements of law relating thereto and
with all applicable regulations of any stock exchange (or the Nasdaq National
Market, if applicable) on which the Common Stock may be listed for trading at
the time of such exercise and issuance.</LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>The inability of the Company to obtain approval from any
regulatory body having authority deemed by the Company to be necessary to the
lawful issuance and sale of any Common Stock pursuant to this option shall
relieve the Company of any liability with respect to the non-issuance or sale of
the Common Stock as to which such approval shall not have been obtained.  The
Company, however, shall use its best efforts to obtain all such
approvals.</LI></P></OL>

<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Successors and Assigns</B></U>.  Except to the
extent otherwise provided in Paragraphs 3 and 6, the provisions of this
Agreement shall inure to the benefit of, and be binding upon, the Company and
its successors and assigns and Participant, Participant's assigns and the legal
representatives, heirs and legatees of Participant's estate.</LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Notices</B></U>.  Any notice required to be given
or delivered to the Company under the terms of this Agreement shall be in
writing and addressed to the Company at its principal corporate offices.  Any
notice required to be given or delivered to Participant shall be in writing and
addressed to Participant at the address indicated below Participant's signature
line on the Grant Notice.  All notices shall be deemed effective upon personal
delivery or upon deposit in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid and properly
addressed to the party to be notified. </LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Construction</B></U>.  This Agreement and the
option evidenced hereby are made and granted pursuant to the Plan and are in all
respects limited by and subject to the terms of the Plan.  All decisions of the
Committee with respect to any question or issue arising under the Plan or this
Agreement shall be conclusive and binding on all persons having an interest in
this option.</LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Governing Law</B></U>.  The interpretation,
performance and enforcement of this Agreement shall be governed by the laws of
the State of California without resort to that State's conflict-of-laws
rules.</LI></P>
<B><U><P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI></LI></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><LI>Excess Shares</B></U>.  If the Option Shares covered by
this Agreement exceed, as of the Grant Date, the number of shares of Common
Stock which may without stockholder approval be issued under the Plan, then this
option shall be void with respect to such excess shares, unless stockholder
approval of an amendment sufficiently increasing the number of shares of Common
Stock issuable under the Plan is obtained in accordance with the provisions of
the Plan.</LI></P></OL>
