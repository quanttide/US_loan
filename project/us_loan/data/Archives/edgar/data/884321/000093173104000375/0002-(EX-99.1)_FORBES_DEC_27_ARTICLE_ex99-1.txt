                            A Rose With Another Name


Flower  porn--it's more of a problem than you might think. Or at least it is for
Blaine Harris, chief executive of Speaking Roses International, a Salt Lake City
company that has patented a technology to laser-print  almost any word, image or
logo on a  flower's  petals.  Almost.  "We had a guy  send in a  picture  of his
girlfriend in a suggestive--more than suggestive--pose," he says.

"And we would not print that.  Even for  personal  use."  Though  encumbered  by
scruples,  Speaking Roses faces what ought to be a rosy future.  In November the
firm licensed its technology to flower giant Dole Fresh Flowers,  which sells 50
million bouquets annually.  Harris fantasizes that someday all of those could be
embossed.  His firm also sells flowers through FTD.com.  He boldly predicts that
Speaking  Roses'  (wholesale)  sales will top $20  million  in 2005,  up from $2
million  (with zero  profit) for 2004.  For now  Speaking  Roses'  bouquets  are
available  nationwide in more than 200 Albertsons  and Jewel-Osco  supermarkets.
Roses have been customized for the 2005 Kentucky  Derby,  for the opening of the
Clinton  Library and for the  Kerry-Edwards  campaign  (bouquets  bedecked  with
presidential  seals were delivered on election eve).  Speaking of funerals,  the
bereaved are expected to be a huge market.  Mortuaries should account for 25% of
sales in 2005.  "Some  people  like to put it on a mantel to  remember  when Mom
died," Harris says. You know, tasteful.
