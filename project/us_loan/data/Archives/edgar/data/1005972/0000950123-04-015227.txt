<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry Into A Material Definitive Agreement.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;23, 2004, Party City Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) entered into
an employment agreement (the &#147;Employment Agreement&#148;), effective January&nbsp;12,
2004, with Nancy Pedot defining the terms of her employment with the Company as
Chief Executive Officer. A copy of the Employment Agreement is attached hereto
as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<I>Employment Agreement. </I>The Employment Agreement provides for Ms.&nbsp;Pedot to
serve the Company as Chief Executive Officer for a three-year term, which
commenced January&nbsp;12, 2004, which term will automatically renew for one-year
periods thereafter unless either party gives written notice of non-renewal at
least 90&nbsp;days prior to the expiration of the then current term. The Employment
Agreement provides for an annual minimum base salary of $500,000 and an annual
non-compete stipend of $100,000 (together with the annual minimum base salary,
the &#147;Salary&#148;). The Employment Agreement further provides that Ms.&nbsp;Pedot be
granted stock options to acquire 600,000 shares of common stock of the Company;
these stock options were granted on January&nbsp;12, 2004 with an exercise price of
$12.34 per share. The stock options have a term of ten years from the date of
the grant and they shall vest and become exercisable, provided Ms.&nbsp;Pedot is
employed by the Company on such vesting date, as follows: 150,000 options
vested and became exercisable on January&nbsp;12, 2004; 150,000 options shall vest
and become exercisable on January&nbsp;12, 2005; 150,000 options shall vest and
become exercisable on January&nbsp;12, 2006; and 150,000 options shall vest and
become exercisable on January&nbsp;11, 2007. Notwithstanding anything described
below, if Ms.&nbsp;Pedot&#146;s employment is terminated prior to January&nbsp;11, 2007 either
by the Company without cause or by Ms.&nbsp;Pedot for Good Reason (as defined in the
Employment Agreement), then a pro-rata portion of the 150,000 options that were
scheduled to vest in the twelve months following the termination date shall
immediately vest, become fully exercisable and remain exercisable in accordance
with the post-employment exercise terms applicable to other senior executives
of the Company generally.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, Ms.&nbsp;Pedot is entitled to receive an annual incentive bonus
based upon the attainment of performance criteria under the Company&#146;s annual
incentive bonus plan then in effect. The target amount for such annual
incentive bonus is 60% of Ms.&nbsp;Pedot&#146;s Salary as of the last day of the
respective fiscal year, although the actual amount of the annual incentive
bonus will depend on the satisfaction of the reasonable performance goals
established by the Company&#146;s Board of Directors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Pedot Agreement provides that in the event of the termination of Ms.
Pedot&#146;s employment on account of her death or disability, her resignation other
than for Good Reason (as defined in the Employment Agreement) or the Company&#146;s
termination of her employment for cause, the Company shall pay to Ms.&nbsp;Pedot, or
her estate on account of her death, in a lump sum within 10 business days
following her termination, all earned but unpaid then-existing Salary and
bonus; <I>provided</I>, <I>however</I>, that, whether any bonus is earned at the time of her
termination will be determined by reference to the terms of the Company&#146;s
respective bonus or performance-based compensation plans or programs, if any,
or, if not set forth therein, as determined by the Company in its sole
discretion. In the event of the termination of Ms.&nbsp;Pedot&#146;s employment by the
Company without cause, the end (without further extension) of the employment
period effective after January&nbsp;11, 2008 or her resignation for Good Reason
(which shall include a termination by change in control of the Company followed
by Ms.&nbsp;Pedot&#146;s resignation within 30&nbsp;days of such change in control), the
Company shall pay to Ms.&nbsp;Pedot, in a lump sum within 10 business days following
such termination, all earned compensation and continue to pay her then-existing
Salary, in accordance with the Company&#146;s regular payroll practices, for 52
weeks. In the event of an end (without further extension) of Ms.&nbsp;Pedot&#146;s
employment period on or before January&nbsp;11, 2008 by reason of a non-renewal by
the Company or Ms.&nbsp;Pedot, the Company shall pay to Ms.&nbsp;Pedot, in a lump sum
within 10

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THIS EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT (the &#147;Agreement&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;23,

Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), and Nancy Pedot (the &#147;Executive&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;WHEREAS, the Company wishes to employ the Executive, and the Executive
wishes to serve the Company, in the capacities and on the terms and conditions
set forth in this Agreement;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, it is hereby agreed as follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Employment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Agreement to Employ. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions of
this Agreement, the Company hereby agrees to employ the Executive and the
Executive hereby agrees to accept her employment by the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Employment Period. The Company shall employ the Executive and the
Executive shall serve the Company, on the terms and conditions set forth
herein, for an initial term of employment commencing on January&nbsp;12, 2004 (the

provided, that (i)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s term of employment will automatically be
extended for successive one year periods thereafter upon the terms and
conditions set forth herein (each, an &#147;Extension Period&#148; and, collectively with
the Initial Period, the &#147;Employment Period&#148;), unless either party gives the
other party written notice of such party&#146;s intention not to renew this
Agreement at least three months prior to the end of the Initial Period or any
Extension Period, and (ii)&nbsp;the Employment Period may be terminated earlier as
provided hereinafter.

Information, the Executive shall provide the Company with prompt written notice
of such requirement and shall assist the Company to seek a protective order or
other appropriate remedy protecting its interests. In any event, the Executive
will furnish only that part of the Confidential Information that is required to
be disclosed by the court order or subpoena and will use reasonable efforts to
obtain reliable assurances that confidential treatment will be accorded to any
Confidential Information so furnished.

the Executive&#146;s termination of employment or at any other time as the Board may

protection and whether or not reduced to tangible form, at any time during the

the Company. The Executive agrees to, and hereby does, assign to the Company,
without any further consideration, all of the Executive&#146;s right, title and
interest throughout the world in, and to, all Developments. The Executive
agrees that all such Developments that are copyrightable may constitute works
made for hire under the copyright laws of the United States and, as such,
acknowledges that the Company is the author of such Developments and owns all
of the rights comprised in the copyright of such Developments and the Executive
hereby assigns to the Company without any further consideration all of the
rights comprised in the copyright and other proprietary rights the Executive
may have in such Developments to the extent that it might not be considered a
work made for hire. The Executive shall make and maintain adequate and current
written records of all Developments and shall disclose all Developments fully,

any time upon request.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;Protection of Legitimate Business Interests. The Executive
acknowledges that (i)&nbsp;the Executive&#146;s position with the Company requires the
performance of services which are special, unique and extraordinary in
character and places her in a position of confidence and trust with the
customers and employees of the Company, through which, among other things, she
will obtain knowledge of the Company&#146;s technical information and know-how and
become acquainted with its customers, in which matters the Company has
substantial proprietary interests, (ii)&nbsp;the restrictive covenants in this
Paragraph&nbsp;8 are necessary in order to protect and maintain such proprietary
interests and other legitimate business interests of the Company, and (iii)&nbsp;the
Company would not have entered into this Agreement unless such covenants were
included herein.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;Injunctive Relief and Other Remedies with Respect to Covenants. The
Executive acknowledges and agrees that the covenants and obligations of the
Executive with respect to noncompetition, nonsolicitation, confidentiality,
Company property, developments and
nondisparagement relate to special, unique and extraordinary matters and
that a violation of any of the terms of such covenants and obligations will
cause the Company irreparable injury for which adequate remedies are not
available at law. Therefore, the Executive agrees that the Company shall (i)
be entitled to an injunction, restraining order or such other equitable relief
(without the requirement to post bond) restraining the Executive from
committing any violation of the covenants and obligations contained in this
Paragraph&nbsp;8 and (ii)&nbsp;have no further obligation to make any payments to the
Executive hereunder following any material violation of the covenants and
obligations contained in this Paragraph&nbsp;8. These remedies are cumulative and
are in addition to any other rights and remedies the Company may have at law or
in equity. The Executive (x)&nbsp;acknowledges and agrees that the covenants set
forth in Paragraph&nbsp;8 are reasonable and valid in geographical and temporal
scope and in all other respects and (y)&nbsp;represents that her economic means and
circumstances are such that such covenants will not prevent her from providing
for herself and her family on a basis satisfactory to her.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h)&nbsp;Non-Disparagement. The Executive shall not at any time after the date
hereof disparage the Company Group or any of its officers, directors,
shareholders or any of their respective affiliates. The Company agrees that
the Board and the executive officers of the Company shall not at any time after
the date hereof disparage the Executive. The obligations of Executive and the
Company under this Paragraph 8(h) shall not apply to truthful disclosures that
are required by applicable law, regulation or order of a court or governmental

by any entity during the Restriction Period, the Executive will (i)&nbsp;provide
notice to the Company of such employment and (ii)&nbsp;provide copies of Paragraphs
8(a), (b)&nbsp;and (c)&nbsp;to such prospective employer. The Executive further agrees
that the Company may provide notice to such prospective employer of the
Executive&#146;s obligations under this Agreement, including, without limitation,
the Executive&#146;s obligations pursuant to this Paragraph&nbsp;8.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;Survival. Paragraphs 7 (relating to early termination of employment),
8 (containing the restrictive covenants), and all the provisions of this
Paragraph&nbsp;9 shall survive the termination of this Agreement (and the
Executive&#146;s employment hereunder) in accordance with their terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Validity and Enforceability. The invalidity or unenforceability of
any provision or provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or
enforceability of any other provision or provisions of this Agreement, which
shall remain in full force and effect. If any provision of this Agreement is
held to be invalid, void or unenforceable in any jurisdiction, any court or
arbitrator so holding shall substitute a valid, enforceable provision that
preserves, to the maximum lawful extent, the terms and intent of such
provisions of this Agreement. If any of the provisions of, or covenants
contained in, this Agreement are hereafter construed to be invalid or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction, the same shall not affect the remainder of
the provisions or the enforceability thereof in any other jurisdiction, which
shall be given full effect, without regard to the invalidity or
unenforceability in such other jurisdiction. Any such holding shall
affect such provision of this Agreement, solely as to that jurisdiction,
without rendering that or any other provision of this Agreement invalid,
illegal, or unenforceable in any other jurisdiction. If any covenant should be
deemed invalid, illegal or unenforceable because its scope, either geographical
or temporal, is considered excessive, such covenant will be modified so that
the scope of the covenant is reduced only to the minimum extent necessary to
render the modified covenant valid, legal and enforceable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Arbitration. In the event that any dispute or controversy should
arise under or in connection with this Agreement the parties hereto shall first
attempt to resolve such dispute through mediation, the costs of which shall be
shared equally by the parties. In the event that such dispute is not resolved
in mediation, the parties agree that it shall be resolved by binding
arbitration; provided, that any dispute or controversy relating to Paragraph&nbsp;8
(including any claim for specific performance) may be brought by any party
hereto in any court of competent jurisdiction; provided, further, that, if the
state or federal courts of New Jersey have jurisdiction, such disputes or
controversies shall be litigated in New Jersey. The arbitration shall

Agreement, shall be conducted in accordance with the Labor Arbitration Rules of
the American Arbitration Association then in effect at the time of the
arbitration, and otherwise in accordance with principles which would be applied

Company and the Executive. If the parties cannot agree on an acceptable
arbitrator, the dispute shall be heard by a panel of three arbitrators, one
appointed by each of the parties and the third appointed by the other two
arbitrators. Judgments on any award may be entered in and enforced by any
court of appropriate jurisdiction. Each party shall pay her or its own costs
for the arbitration or litigation, as the case may be, with the cost of the
arbitrator, if applicable, to be equally divided between the parties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;Binding Effect. This Agreement shall be binding on, and shall inure

interest of the Company (regardless of whether such succession does or does not
occur by operation of law) by reason of the sale of all or a portion of the
Company&#146;s stock, a merger, consolidation or reorganization involving the
Company or a sale of the assets of the business of the Company (or portion
thereof) in which the Executive performs a majority of her services. This
Agreement shall also inure to the benefit of the Executive&#146;s heirs, executors,
administrators and legal representatives.

obligations hereunder, may not be assigned by the Executive. The Company may
assign its rights, together with its obligations, hereunder in connection with
any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all of the
business assets with respect to which the Executive is performing a majority of
her services at any such time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement
between the parties hereto with respect to the matters referred to herein. No
other agreement relating to the terms of the Executive&#146;s employment by the
Company, oral or otherwise, shall be binding between the parties unless it is
in writing and signed by the party against whom enforcement is sought. There
are no promises, representations, inducements or statements
between the parties relating to the terms of the Executive&#146;s employment
with the Company other than those that are expressly contained herein. The
Executive acknowledges that she is entering into this Agreement of her own free
will and accord, and with no duress, that she has read this Agreement and that
she understands it and its legal consequences.

other party of any of the terms of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver
of any other breach or default, whether similar to or different from the breach
or default waived. No waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
implied from any course of dealing between the parties hereto or from any
failure by either party hereto to assert its or her rights hereunder on any
occasion or series of occasions.

Agreement shall be in writing and shall be delivered personally, by courier
