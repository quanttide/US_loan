<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>REFINANCING CREDIT AGREEMENT</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;21, 2004, TRW Automotive Holdings Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;) announced that the Company
and its wholly owned subsidiaries, TRW Automotive Inc. (&#147;TAI&#148;) and TRW Automotive Intermediate
Holdings Corp. (&#147;Intermediate&#148;), and certain of the Company&#146;s foreign subsidiaries, entered into
its Fourth Amended and Restated Credit Agreement dated as of December&nbsp;17, 2004 with the lenders
party thereto and JPMorgan Chase Bank, as administrative agent, Bank of America, N.A. and Goldman
Sachs Credit Partners L.P., as co-syndication agents, and Credit Suisse First Boston and The Bank
of Nova Scotia, as co-documentation agents. The amended and restated credit agreement provides for
$1.9&nbsp;billion in senior secured credit facilities, consisting of (i)&nbsp;a 5-year $900.0&nbsp;million
Revolving Credit Facility (the &#147;Revolving Credit Facility&#148;), (ii)&nbsp;a 5-year $400.0&nbsp;million Term Loan
A Facility (the &#147;Term Loan A&#148;) and (iii)&nbsp;a 7.5-year $600.0&nbsp;million Term Loan B Facility (the &#147;Term
Loan B&#148;; combined with the Revolving Credit Facility and Term Loan A, the &#147;Facilities&#148;). Proceeds
from the Facilities will be used to refinance $1.7&nbsp;billion of existing senior secured credit
facilities and pay fees and expenses related to the refinancing. The initial draw under
the Facilities is expected to occur in January&nbsp;2005. The Company&#146;s existing $300&nbsp;million Term Loan
E will remain in place.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Borrowings under the Facilities will bear interest at a rate equal to an applicable margin
plus, at TAI&#146;s option, either (a)&nbsp;a base rate determined by reference to the higher of (1)&nbsp;JPMorgan
Chase Bank&#146;s prime rate and (2)&nbsp;the federal funds rate plus 1/2 of 1% or (b)&nbsp;a LIBOR or a
eurocurrency rate determined by reference to the costs of funds for deposits in the currency of
such borrowing for the interest period relevant to such borrowing adjusted for certain additional
costs. When the Facilities are drawn in January&nbsp;2005, the Term Loan A and the Revolving
Credit Facility will be priced at LIBOR plus 1.375 % and the Term Loan B will be priced at LIBOR
plus 1.50%. The commitment fee on the undrawn amounts under the Revolving Credit Facility will be .35%. The commitment fee on the Revolving Credit Facility and the applicable margin on the
Facilities will be subject to a leverage-based grid.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Term Loan A will amortize in equal quarterly amounts, beginning with 15% in the third year
after funding, 40% in the fourth year and 45% in the fifth year. The Term Loan B will amortize in
equal quarterly installments in an amount equal to 1% per annum during the first 7&nbsp;years and three
months and in one final installment on the maturity date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the previously existing senior credit facilities, all obligations of TAI will be
unconditionally guaranteed by the Company and substantially all existing and subsequently acquired
domestic subsidiaries of TAI. Obligations of the foreign subsidiary borrowers will be
unconditionally guaranteed by the Company, TAI and certain foreign subsidiaries of TAI.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Facilities, like the previously existing senior credit facilities, will be
secured by a perfected first priority security interest in, and mortgages on, substantially all
tangible and intangible assets of TAI and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries, including
a pledge of 100% of the stock of TAI and substantially all of its domestic subsidiaries and 65% of
the stock of foreign subsidiaries owned by domestic entities. In addition, like the previously
existing senior credit facilities, foreign borrowings under the Facilities will be
secured by assets of the foreign borrowers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Facilities, like the previously existing senior credit facilities, contain a number of
covenants that, among other things, restrict, subject to certain exceptions, the ability to incur
additional indebtedness or issue preferred stock, repay other indebtedness, pay dividends and
distributions or repurchase capital stock, create liens on assets, make investments, loans or
advances, make certain acquisitions, engage in mergers or consolidations, enter into sale and
leaseback transactions, engage in certain transactions with affiliates, amend certain material
agreements governing our indebtedness and change the business conducted by the Company and its
subsidiaries. In addition, the Facilities, like the previously existing senior credit facilities,
contain the following financial covenants: a maximum total leverage ratio and a minimum interest
coverage ratio and require certain prepayments from excess cash flows, as defined, and in
connection with certain asset sales and the incurrence of debt not permitted under the senior
credit facilities.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Facilities, like the previously existing senior credit facilities, generally restrict the
payment of dividends or other distributions by TAI, subject to specified exceptions. The
exceptions include, among others, the making of payments or distributions in respect of expenses
required for the Company and Intermediate to maintain their corporate existence, general corporate
overhead expenses, tax liabilities and legal and accounting fees. Since the Company is a holding
company without any independent operations, it does not have significant cash obligations, and is
able to meet its limited cash obligations under the exceptions to the debt covenants.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Facilities, like the previously existing senior credit facilities, also include customary
events of default.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>AMENDMENT TO EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2004, TAI or TRW Limited, another wholly owned subsidiary of the Company,
entered into amendments to the employment agreements with each of the Company&#146;s executive officers
(John Plant, Steve Lunn, David Bialosky, Joseph Cantie, Peter Lake and Neil Marchuk)(each, an
&#147;Executive&#148;). The employment agreements previously provided that the Executives&#146; annual bonuses
will be based upon the achievement of annual net income, EBITDA and cash flow targets established
by the board of directors within the first three months of each fiscal year. The amendments
revise the employment agreements to clarify that the objectives on which Executives&#146; annual bonuses
are based are defined measures of EBITDAP and cash flow. The

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">amendments also provide that twenty percent of Executives&#146; target bonuses will be based on
additional factors determined to be relevant by the compensation committee of the board of
directors, which may include industry-specific and general economic conditions as well as strategic
factors.
