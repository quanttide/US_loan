                  If any of the documents referred to in Section 2.01(ii), (iii)
or (iv) above has as of the Closing Date (or Subsequent Transfer Date, with
respect to Subsequent Mortgage Loans) been submitted for recording but either
(x) has not been returned from the applicable public recording office or (y) has
been lost or such public recording office has retained the original of such
document, the obligations of the Depositor to deliver such documents shall be
deemed to be satisfied upon (1) delivery to the Trustee or the Custodian no
later than the Closing Date (or Subsequent Transfer Date, with respect to
Subsequent Mortgage Loans), of a copy of each such document certified by the
Originator in the case of (x) above or the applicable public recording office in
the case of (y) above to be a true and complete copy of the original that was
submitted for recording and (2) if such copy is certified by the Originator,
delivery to the Trustee or the Custodian, promptly upon receipt thereof of
either the original or a copy of such document certified by the applicable
public recording office to be a true and complete copy of the original. If the
original lender's title insurance policy, or a certified copy thereof, was not
delivered pursuant to Section 2.01(v) above, the Depositor shall deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian, the original or a copy of
a written commitment or interim binder or preliminary report of title issued by
the title insurance or escrow company, with the original or a certified copy
thereof to be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian, promptly upon receipt
thereof. The Servicer or the Depositor shall deliver or cause to be delivered to
the Trustee or the Custodian promptly upon receipt thereof any other documents
constituting a part of a Mortgage File received with respect to any Mortgage
Loan, including, but not limited to, any original documents evidencing an
assumption or modification of any Mortgage Loan.

                  Upon discovery or receipt of notice of any materially
defective document in, or that a document is missing from, a Mortgage File, the
Trustee shall enforce the obligations of the Seller under the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement to cure such defect or deliver such missing document to the
Trustee or the Custodian within 120 days. If the Seller does not cure such
defect or deliver such missing document within such time period, the Trustee
shall enforce the obligations of the Seller to either repurchase or substitute
for such Mortgage Loan in accordance with Section 2.03.

                  The Trustee shall enforce the obligations of the Seller under
the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to cause the Assignments which were
delivered in blank to be completed



                                       60
<PAGE>



and to record all Assignments referred to in Section 2.01(iii) hereof and, to
the extent necessary, in Section 2.01(iv) hereof. The Trustee shall enforce the
obligations of the Seller under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to deliver
such assignments for recording within 180 days of the Closing Date. In the event
that any such Assignment is lost or returned unrecorded because of a defect
therein, the Trustee shall enforce the obligations of the Seller under the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to promptly have a substitute Assignment
prepared or have such defect cured, as the case may be, and thereafter cause
each such Assignment to be duly recorded.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for administrative convenience
and facilitation of servicing and to reduce closing costs, the Assignments of
Mortgage shall not be required to be submitted for recording (except with
respect to any Mortgage Loan located in Maryland) unless the Trustee and the
Depositor receive notice that such failure to record would result in a
withdrawal or a downgrading by any Rating Agency of the rating on any Class of
Certificates; provided, however, each Assignment shall be submitted for
recording by the Seller in the manner described above, at no expense to the
Trust Fund or Trustee, upon the earliest to occur of: (i) reasonable direction
by the Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights,
(ii) the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Termination, (iii) the occurrence of
a bankruptcy, insolvency or foreclosure relating to the Seller, (iv) the
occurrence of a servicing transfer as described in Section 7.02 hereof, (v) upon
receipt of notice from the Servicer, the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency
or foreclosure relating to the Mortgagor under the related Mortgage and (vi)
upon receipt of notice from the Servicer, any Mortgage Loan that is 90 days or
more Delinquent. In the event of (i) through (iv) set forth in the immediately
preceding sentence, and upon receipt of notice by a Responsible Officer of the
Trustee from the Servicer of the occurrence of (v) or (vi) set forth in the
immediately preceding sentence, the Trustee shall enforce the obligations of the
Seller to deliver such Assignments for recording as provided above, promptly and
in any event within 30 days following receipt of notice by the Seller from the
Trustee or the Servicer, as applicable. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the
Seller fails to pay the cost of recording the Assignments, such expense will be
paid by the Trustee and the Trustee shall be reimbursed for such expenses by the
Trust. The Servicer shall not be deemed to be in breach of its obligation to
service in accordance with the Servicing Standard by any delay in its servicing
activities resulting from the failure to submit the Assignments for recording.

                  In the event that any Mortgage Note is endorsed in blank as of
the Closing Date, promptly following the Closing Date, the Trustee shall cause
such endorsements to be completed (at the Seller's expense) as follows: "Pay to
the order of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee, without recourse."

                  The Servicer shall forward to the Custodian original documents
evidencing an assumption, modification, consolidation or extension of any
Mortgage Loan entered into in accordance with this Agreement within two weeks of
their execution; provided, however, that the Servicer shall provide the
Custodian with a certified true copy of any such document submitted for
recordation within two weeks of its execution, and shall provide the original of
any document submitted for recordation or a copy of such document certified by
the appropriate public recording office to be a true and complete copy of the
original within 365 days of its submission for recordation. In the event that
the Servicer cannot provide a copy of such document certified by the public
recording office within such 365 day period, the Servicer shall



                                       61
<PAGE>



deliver to the Custodian, within such 365 day period, an Officers' Certificate
of the Servicer which shall (A) identify the recorded document, (B) state that
the recorded document has not been delivered to the Custodian due solely to a
delay caused by the public recording office, (C) state the amount of time
generally required by the applicable recording office to record and return a
document submitted for recordation, if known and (D) specify the date the
applicable recorded document is expected to be delivered to the Custodian, and,
upon receipt of a copy of such document certified by the public recording
office, the Servicer shall immediately deliver such document to the Custodian.
In the event the appropriate public recording office will not certify as to the
accuracy of such document, the Servicer shall deliver a copy of such document
certified by an officer of the Servicer to be a true and complete copy of the
original to the Custodian.

                  The Depositor shall deliver or cause the Seller to deliver (by
regular mail) to the Servicer copies of all trailing documents required to be
included in the Mortgage File at the same time the originals or certified copies
thereof are delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian, such documents including
but not limited to the mortgagee policy of title insurance and any mortgage loan
documents upon return from the recording office. Except as provided in Section
3.17, the Servicer shall not be responsible for any Custodian fees or other
costs incurred in obtaining such documents or for any such costs it may incur in
connection with performing its obligations pursuant to this Agreement.

                  The parties hereto understand and agree that it is not
intended that any Mortgage Loan be included in the Trust that is a "High-Cost
Home Loan" as defined by the Homeownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 or
any other applicable predatory or abusive lending laws as further described in
the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement.

                  The Depositor hereby directs the Trustee to execute, deliver
and perform its obligations under the Cap Contract on the Closing Date and
thereafter on behalf of the Holders of the Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine
Certificates and the Class B Certificates. The Depositor, the Servicer and the
Holders of the Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates and the Class B
Certificates by their acceptance of such Certificates acknowledge and agree that
the Trustee shall execute, deliver and perform its obligations under the Cap
Contract and shall do so solely in its capacity as Trustee of the Trust Fund and
not in its individual capacity.

                  SECTION 2.02. Acceptance by Trustee.

                  Subject to the provisions of Section 2.01 and subject to the
review described below and any exceptions noted on the exception report
described in the next paragraph below, the Trustee acknowledges receipt of the
documents referred to in Section 2.01 above and all other assets included in the
definition of "Trust Fund" and declares that it holds and will hold such
documents and the other documents delivered to it constituting a Mortgage File,
and that it holds or will hold all such assets and such other assets included in
the definition of "Trust Fund" in trust for the exclusive use and benefit of all
present and future Certificateholders.

                  The Trustee agrees to execute and deliver (or cause the
Custodian to execute and deliver) to the Depositor and the Servicer on or prior
to the Closing Date (or Subsequent Transfer Date, with respect to Subsequent
Mortgage Loans) an acknowledgment of receipt of either (i) the



                                       62
<PAGE>



related original Mortgage Note or (ii) a Lost Note Affidavit, for each Mortgage
Loan (with any exceptions noted), substantially in the form attached as Exhibit
F-3 hereto.

                  The Trustee agrees, for the benefit of the Certificateholders,
to review, or that it has reviewed pursuant to Section 2.01 (or to cause the
Custodian to review or that it has caused the Custodian to have reviewed) each
Mortgage File on or prior to the Closing Date (or, with respect to any document
delivered after the Startup Day, within 45 days of receipt and with respect to
any Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, within 45 days after the assignment
thereof). The Trustee further agrees, for the benefit of the Certificateholders,
to certify to the Depositor and the Servicer in substantially the form attached
hereto as Exhibit F-1, within 45 days after the Closing Date (or, with respect
to any document delivered after the Startup Day, within 45 days of receipt and
with respect to any Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, within 45 days after the
assignment thereof) that, as to each Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan
Schedule (other than any Mortgage Loan paid in full or any Mortgage Loan
specifically identified in the exception report annexed thereto as not being
covered by such certification), (i) all documents required to be delivered to it
pursuant Section 2.01 of this Agreement are in its possession, (ii) such
documents have been reviewed by it and have not been mutilated, damaged or torn
and appear on their face to relate to such Mortgage Loan and (iii) based on its
examination and only as to the foregoing, the information set forth in the
Mortgage Loan Schedule that corresponds to items (1) and (3) of the Mortgage
Loan Schedule accurately reflects information set forth in the Mortgage File. It
is herein acknowledged that, in conducting such review, the Trustee (or the
Custodian, as applicable) is under no duty or obligation to inspect, review or
examine any such documents, instruments, certificates or other papers to
determine that they are genuine, legally enforceable, valid or binding or
appropriate for the represented purpose or that they have actually been recorded
or that they are other than what they purport to be on their face.

                  Prior to the first anniversary date of this Agreement the
Trustee shall deliver (or cause the Custodian to deliver) to the Depositor and
the Servicer a final certification in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit F-2,
with any applicable exceptions noted thereon.

                  If in the process of reviewing the Mortgage Files and making
or preparing, as the case may be, the certifications referred to above, the
Trustee (or the Custodian, as applicable) finds any document or documents
constituting a part of a Mortgage File to be missing or defective in any
material respect, at the conclusion of its review the Trustee shall so notify
the Seller, the Depositor and the Servicer. In addition, upon the discovery by
the Depositor or the Servicer (or upon receipt by the Trustee of written
notification of such breach) of a breach of any of the representations and
warranties made by the Seller in the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in respect
of any Mortgage Loan which materially adversely affects such Mortgage Loan or
the interests of the related Certificateholders in such Mortgage Loan, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other parties to
this Agreement.

                  The Depositor and the Trustee intend that the assignment and
transfer herein contemplated constitute a sale of the Mortgage Loans, the
related Mortgage Notes and the related documents, conveying good title thereto
free and clear of any liens and encumbrances, from the Depositor to the Trustee
in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders and that such property not be
part of the Depositor's estate or property of the Depositor in the event of any
insolvency by the Depositor. In the event that such conveyance is deemed to be,
or to be made as security



                                       63
<PAGE>



for, a loan, the parties intend that the Depositor shall be deemed to have
granted and does hereby grant to the Trustee a first priority perfected security
interest in all of the Depositor's right, title and interest in and to the
Mortgage Loans, the related Mortgage Notes and the related documents, and that
this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under applicable law.

                  SECTION 2.03. Repurchase or Substitution of Mortgage Loans by
                                the Seller.

                  (a) Upon discovery or receipt of written notice of any
materially defective document in, or that a document is missing from, a Mortgage
File or of the breach by the Seller of any representation, warranty or covenant
under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement in respect of any Mortgage Loan which
materially adversely affects the value of such Mortgage Loan or the interest
therein of the Certificateholders, the Trustee shall promptly notify the Seller
of such defect, missing document or breach and request that the Seller deliver
such missing document or that the Seller cure such defect or breach within 120
days from the date the Seller was notified of such missing document, defect or
breach, and if the Seller does not deliver such missing document or if the
Seller does not cure such defect or breach in all material respects during such
period, the Trustee shall enforce the Seller's obligation under the Mortgage
Loan Purchase Agreement and cause the Seller to repurchase such Mortgage Loan
from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price on or prior to the Determination Date
following the expiration of such 120 day period (subject to Section 2.03(e));
provided that, in connection with any such breach that could not reasonably have
been cured within such 120 day period, if the Seller has commenced to cure such
breach within such 120 day period, the Seller shall be permitted to proceed
thereafter diligently and expeditiously to cure the same within the additional
period provided under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement. The Purchase Price
for the repurchased Mortgage Loan shall be remitted to the Servicer for deposit
in the Collection Account, and the Trustee, upon receipt of written
certification from the Servicer of such deposit, shall release to the Seller the
related Mortgage File and shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer
or assignment, in each case without recourse, as the Seller shall furnish to it
and as shall be necessary to vest in the Seller any Mortgage Loan released
pursuant hereto and the Trustee shall have no further responsibility with regard
to such Mortgage File (it being understood that the Trustee shall have no
responsibility for determining the sufficiency of such assignment for its
intended purpose). In lieu of repurchasing any such Mortgage Loan as provided
above, the Seller may cause such Mortgage Loan to be removed from the Trust Fund
(in which case it shall become a Deleted Mortgage Loan) and substitute one or
more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in the manner and subject to the
limitations set forth in Section 2.03(d); provided, however, the Seller may not
substitute for any Mortgage Loan which breaches a representation or warranty
regarding abusive or predatory lending laws. It is understood and agreed that
the obligation of the Seller to cure or to repurchase (or to substitute for) any
Mortgage Loan as to which a document is missing, a material defect in a
constituent document exists or as to which such a breach has occurred and is
continuing shall constitute the sole remedy against the Seller respecting such
omission, defect or breach available to the Trustee on behalf of the
Certificateholders.

                  (b) Within 90 days of the earlier of discovery by the
Depositor or receipt of notice by the Depositor of the breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant of the Depositor set forth in Section 2.06,
which materially and adversely affects the interests of the



                                       64
<PAGE>



Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan, the Depositor shall cure such breach in
all material respects.

                  (c) Within 90 days of the earlier of discovery by the Servicer
or receipt of notice by the Servicer of the breach of any representation,
warranty or covenant of the Servicer set forth in Section 2.05 which materially
and adversely affects the interests of the Certificateholders in any Mortgage
Loan, the Servicer shall cure such breach in all material respects.

                  (d) Any substitution of Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans
for Deleted Mortgage Loans made pursuant to Section 2.03(a) must be effected
prior to the last Business Day that is within two years after the Closing Date.
As to any Deleted Mortgage Loan for which the Seller substitutes a Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, such substitution shall be effected by the
Seller delivering to the Trustee, for such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or
Loans, the Mortgage Note, the Mortgage and the Assignment to the Trustee, and
such other documents and agreements, with all necessary endorsements thereon, as
are required by Section 2.01, together with an Officers' Certificate providing
that each such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan satisfies the definition
thereof and specifying the Substitution Adjustment (as described below), if any,
in connection with such substitution. The Trustee shall acknowledge receipt for
such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and, within 45 days thereafter,
shall review such documents as specified in Section 2.02 and deliver to the
Depositor and the Servicer, with respect to such Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan or Loans, a certification substantially in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit F-1, with any applicable exceptions noted thereon. Within one year of
the date of substitution, the Trustee shall deliver to the Depositor and the
Servicer a certification substantially in the form of Exhibit F-2 hereto with
respect to such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, with any applicable
exceptions noted thereon. Monthly Payments due with respect to Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution are not part of the Trust
Fund and will be retained by the Seller. For the month of substitution,
distributions to Certificateholders will reflect the collections and recoveries
in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan in the Due Period preceding the month
of substitution and the Seller shall thereafter be entitled to retain all
amounts subsequently received in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan. The
Seller shall give or cause to be given written notice to the Trustee, who shall
forward such notice to the Certificateholders, that such substitution has taken
place, shall amend the Mortgage Loan Schedule to reflect the removal of such
Deleted Mortgage Loan from the terms of this Agreement and the substitution of
the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and shall deliver a copy of such
amended Mortgage Loan Schedule to the Trustee. Upon such substitution by the
Seller, such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans shall constitute part
of the Mortgage Pool and shall be subject in all respects to the terms of this
Agreement and the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, including all applicable
representations and warranties thereof included in the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement as of the date of substitution.

                  For any month in which the Seller substitutes one or more
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans for one or more Deleted Mortgage Loans, the
Servicer will determine the amount (the "Substitution Adjustment"), if any, by
which the aggregate Purchase Price of all such Deleted Mortgage Loans exceeds
the aggregate, as to each such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, of the Stated
Principal Balance thereof as of the date of substitution, together



                                       65
<PAGE>



with one month's interest on such Stated Principal Balance at the applicable
Mortgage Rate. On the date of such substitution, the Seller will deliver or
cause to be delivered to the Servicer for deposit in the Collection Account an
amount equal to the Substitution Adjustment, if any, and the Trustee, upon
receipt of the related Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans and
certification by the Servicer of such deposit, shall release to the Seller the
related Mortgage File or Files and shall execute and deliver such instruments of
transfer or assignment, in each case without recourse, as the Seller shall
deliver to it and as shall be necessary to vest therein any Deleted Mortgage
Loan released pursuant hereto.

                  In addition, the Seller shall obtain at its own expense and
deliver to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
substitution will not cause (a) any federal tax to be imposed on the Trust Fund,
including without limitation, any federal tax imposed on "prohibited
transactions" under Section 860F(a)(I) of the Code or on "contributions after
the startup date" under Section 860G(d)(I) of the Code or (b) any REMIC to fail
to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is outstanding. If such
Opinion of Counsel can not be delivered, then such substitution may only be
effected at such time as the required Opinion of Counsel can be given.

                  (e) Upon discovery by the Depositor, the Servicer or the
Trustee that any Mortgage Loan does not constitute a "qualified mortgage" within
the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code, the party discovering such fact
shall within two Business Days give written notice thereof to the other parties
hereto. In connection therewith, the Seller or the Depositor, as the case may
be, shall repurchase or, subject to the limitations set forth in Section
2.03(d), substitute one or more Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans for the
affected Mortgage Loan within 90 days of the earlier of discovery or receipt of
such notice with respect to such affected Mortgage Loan. Such repurchase or
substitution shall be made (i) by the Seller if the affected Mortgage Loan's
status as a non-qualified mortgage is or results from a breach of any
representation, warranty or covenant made by the Seller under the Mortgage Loan
Purchase Agreement or (ii) the Depositor, if the affected Mortgage Loan's status
as a non-qualified mortgage is a breach of any representation or warranty of the
Depositor set forth in Section 2.06, or if its status as a non-qualified
mortgage is a breach of no representation or warranty. Any such repurchase or
substitution shall be made in the same manner as set forth in Section 2.03(a) or
2.03(d), if made by the Seller, or Section 2.03(b), if made by the Depositor.
The Trustee shall reconvey to the Depositor or the Seller, as the case may be,
the Mortgage Loan to be released pursuant hereto in the same manner, and on the
same terms and conditions, as it would a Mortgage Loan repurchased for breach of
a representation or warranty.

                  SECTION 2.04. Intentionally Omitted.

                  SECTION 2.05. Representations, Warranties and Covenants of the
Servicer.

                  The Servicer hereby represents, warrants and covenants to the
Trustee, for the benefit of each of the Trustee and the Certificateholders, and
to the Depositor, that as of the Closing Date or as of such date specifically
provided herein:

                  (i) The Servicer is duly organized, validly existing, and in
         good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its formation and
         has all licenses necessary to carry



                                       66
<PAGE>



         on its business as now being conducted and is licensed, qualified and
         in good standing in the states where the Mortgaged Property is located
         (or is otherwise exempt under applicable law from such qualification)
         if the laws of such state require licensing or qualification in order
         to conduct business of the type conducted by the Servicer or to ensure
         the enforceability or validity of each Mortgage Loan; the Servicer has
         the power and authority to execute and deliver this Agreement and to
         perform in accordance herewith; the execution, delivery and performance
         of this Agreement (including all instruments of transfer to be
         delivered pursuant to this Agreement) and all documents and instruments
         contemplated hereby which are executed and delivered by the Servicer
         and the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been
         duly and validly authorized; this Agreement and all documents and
         instruments contemplated hereby which are executed and delivered by the
         Servicer, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the
         other parties hereto, evidences the valid, binding and enforceable
         obligation of the Servicer, subject to applicable bankruptcy,
         insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws affecting
         the enforcement of creditors' rights generally; and all requisite
         corporate action has been taken by the Servicer to make this Agreement
         and all documents and instruments contemplated hereby which are
         executed and delivered by the Servicer valid and binding upon the
         Servicer in accordance with its terms;

                  (ii) The consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement are in the ordinary course of business of the Servicer and
         will not result in the material breach of any term or provision of the
         charter or by-laws of the Servicer or result in the breach of any term
         or provision of, or conflict with or constitute a default under or
         result in the acceleration of any obligation under, any agreement,
         indenture or loan or credit agreement or other instrument to which the
         Servicer or its property is subject, or result in the violation of any
         law, rule, regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the Servicer
         or its property is subject;

                  (iii) The execution and delivery of this Agreement by the
         Servicer and the performance and compliance with its obligations and
         covenants hereunder do not require the consent or approval of any
         governmental authority or, if such consent or approval is required, it
         has been obtained;

                  (iv) [Reserved];

                  (v) The Servicer does not believe, nor does it have any reason
         or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every covenant
         contained in this Agreement;

                  (vi) There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation
         pending or, to its knowledge, threatened against the Servicer that,
         either individually or in the aggregate, (A) may result in any change
         in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets
         of the Servicer that might prohibit or materially and adversely affect
         the performance by such Servicer of its obligations under, or the
         validity or enforceability of, this Agreement, or (B) may result in any
         material impairment of the right or ability of the Servicer to carry on
         its business substantially as now conducted, or (C) would draw into
         question the validity or enforceability of this Agreement or of any
         action taken or to be



                                       67
<PAGE>



         taken in connection with the obligations of the Servicer contemplated
         herein, or (D) would otherwise be likely to impair materially the
         ability of the Servicer to perform under the terms of this Agreement;

                  (vii) Neither this Agreement nor any information, certificate
         of an officer, statement furnished in writing or report delivered to
         the Trustee by the Servicer in connection with the transactions
         contemplated hereby contains any untrue statement of a material fact;

                  (viii) The Servicer will not waive any Prepayment Charge
         unless it is waived in accordance with the standard set forth in
         Section 3.01; and

                  (ix) The Servicer has accurately and fully reported, and will
         continue to accurately and fully report on a monthly basis, its
         borrower credit files to each of the three national credit repositories
         in a timely manner.

                  It is understood and agreed that the representations,
warranties and covenants set forth in this Section 2.05 shall survive delivery
of the Mortgage Files to the Trustee and shall inure to the benefit of the
Trustee, the Depositor and the Certificateholders. Upon discovery by any of the
Depositor, the Servicer or the Trustee of a breach of any of the foregoing
representations, warranties and covenants which materially and adversely affects
the value of any Mortgage Loan, Prepayment Charge or the interests therein of
the Certificateholders, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt
written notice (but in no event later than two Business Days following such
discovery) to the Servicer and the Trustee. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
within 90 days of the earlier of discovery by the Servicer or receipt of notice
by the Servicer of the breach of the representation or covenant of the Servicer
set forth in Section 2.05(x) above which materially and adversely affects the
interests of the Holders of the Class P Certificates in any Prepayment Charge,
the Servicer must pay the amount of such waived Prepayment Charge, for the
benefit of the Holders of the Class P Certificates, by depositing such amount
into the Collection Account. The foregoing shall not, however, limit any
remedies available to the Certificateholders, the Depositor or the Trustee on
behalf of the Certificateholders, pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement respecting a breach of the representations, warranties and covenants
of the Originator made in its capacity as a party to the Mortgage Loan Purchase
Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.06. Representations and Warranties of the Depositor.

                  The Depositor represents and warrants to the Trust, the
Servicer and the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders as follows:

                  (i) This agreement constitutes a legal, valid and binding
         obligation of the Depositor, enforceable against the Depositor in
         accordance with its terms, except as enforceability may be limited by
         applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
         similar laws now or hereafter in effect affecting the enforcement of
         creditors' rights in general and except as such enforceability may be
         limited by general principles of equity (whether considered in a
         proceeding at law or in equity);

                  (ii) Immediately prior to the sale and assignment by the
         Depositor to the Trustee on behalf of the Trust of each Mortgage Loan,
         the Depositor had good and marketable title to each Mortgage Loan
         (insofar as such title was conveyed to it by the Seller) subject to no
         prior lien, claim, participation interest, mortgage, security interest,
         pledge, charge or other encumbrance or other interest of any nature;

                  (iii) As of the Closing Date, the Depositor has transferred
         all right, title and interest in the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee on
         behalf of the Trust;

                  (iv) The Depositor has not transferred the Mortgage Loans to
         the Trustee on behalf of the Trust with any intent to hinder, delay or
         defraud any of its creditors;

                  (v) The Depositor has been duly incorporated and is validly
         existing as a corporation in good standing under the laws of Delaware,
         with full corporate power and authority to own its assets and conduct
         its business as presently being conducted;

                  (vi) The Depositor is not in violation of its articles of
         incorporation or by-laws or in default in the performance or observance
         of any material obligation, agreement, covenant or condition contained
         in any contract, indenture, mortgage, loan agreement, note, lease or
         other instrument to which the Depositor is a party or by which it or
         its properties may be bound, which default might result in any material
         adverse changes in the financial condition, earnings, affairs or
         business of the Depositor or which might materially and adversely
         affect the properties or assets, taken as a whole, of the Depositor;

                  (vii) The execution, delivery and performance of this
         Agreement by the Depositor, and the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated thereby, do not and will not result in a material breach
         or violation of any of the terms or provisions of, or, to the knowledge
         of the Depositor, constitute a default under, any indenture, mortgage,
         deed of trust, loan agreement or other agreement or instrument to which
         the Depositor is a party or by which the Depositor is bound or to which
         any of the property or assets of the Depositor is subject, nor will
         such actions result in any violation of the provisions of the articles
         of incorporation or by-laws of the Depositor or, to the best of the
         Depositor's knowledge without independent investigation, any statute or
         any order, rule or regulation of any court or governmental agency or
         body having jurisdiction over the Depositor or any of its properties or
         assets (except for such conflicts, breaches, violations and defaults as
         would not have a material adverse effect on the ability of the
         Depositor to perform its obligations under this Agreement);

                  (viii) To the best of the Depositor's knowledge without any
         independent investigation, no consent, approval, authorization, order,
         registration or qualification of or with any court or governmental
         agency or body of the United States or any other jurisdiction is
         required for the issuance of the Certificates, or the consummation by
         the Depositor of the other transactions contemplated by this Agreement,
         except such consents, approvals, authorizations, registrations or
         qualifications as (a) may be required under State securities or Blue
         Sky laws, (b) have been previously obtained or (c) the failure of which
         to obtain would not have a material adverse effect on the performance
         by

         the Depositor of its obligations under, or the validity or
         enforceability of, this Agreement; and

                  (ix) There are no actions, proceedings or investigations
         pending before or, to the Depositor's knowledge, threatened by any
         court, administrative agency or other tribunal to which the Depositor
         is a party or of which any of its properties is the subject: (a) which
         if determined adversely to the Depositor would have a material adverse
         effect on the business, results of operations or financial condition of
         the Depositor; (b) asserting the invalidity of this Agreement or the
         Certificates; (c) seeking to prevent the issuance of the Certificates
         or the consummation by the Depositor of any of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement, as the case may be; or (d) which might
         materially and adversely affect the performance by the Depositor of its
         obligations under, or the validity or enforceability of, this
         Agreement.

                  SECTION 2.07. Issuance of Certificates.

                  The Trustee acknowledges the assignment to it of the Mortgage
Loans and the delivery to it of the Mortgage Files, subject to the provisions of
Sections 2.01 and 2.02, together with the assignment to it of all other assets
included in the Trust Fund, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged.
Concurrently with such assignment and delivery and in exchange therefor, the
Trustee, pursuant to the written request of the Depositor executed by an officer
of the Depositor, has executed, authenticated and delivered to or upon the order
of the Depositor, the Certificates in authorized denominations. The interests
evidenced by the Certificates constitute the entire beneficial ownership
interest in the Trust Fund.

                  SECTION 2.08. Conveyance of Subsequent Mortgage Loans.

in consideration of the Trustee's delivery on the Subsequent Transfer Dates to
or upon the order of the Depositor of all or a portion of the balance of funds
in the Pre-Funding Accounts, the Depositor shall on any Subsequent Transfer Date
sell, transfer, assign, set over and convey without recourse to the Trust Fund
but subject to the other terms and provisions of this Agreement all of the
right, title and interest of the Depositor in and to (i) the Subsequent Mortgage
Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule attached to the related
Subsequent Transfer Instrument delivered by the Depositor on such Subsequent
Transfer Date, (ii) all interest accruing thereon on and after the Subsequent
Cut-off Date and all collections in respect of interest and principal due after

the related Mortgage Files; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, that the Depositor reserves and
retains all right, title and interest in and to principal received and interest
accruing on the Subsequent Mortgage Loans prior to the related Subsequent
Cut-off Date. The transfer to the Trustee for deposit in the Mortgage Pool by
the Depositor of the Subsequent Mortgage Loans identified on the Mortgage Loan
Schedule shall be absolute and is intended by the Depositor, the Servicer, the
Trustee and the Certificateholders to constitute and to be treated as a sale of
the Subsequent Mortgage Loans by the Depositor to the Trust Fund. The related
Mortgage File for each Subsequent Mortgage Loan shall be delivered to the
Trustee at least three Business Days prior to the related Subsequent Transfer

Pre-Funding Account, as applicable, only upon the satisfaction of each of the

         recourse for the benefit of the Certificateholders all the right, title
         and interest of the Depositor, in, to and under the Subsequent Mortgage
         Loan Purchase Agreement, to the extent of the Subsequent Mortgage
         Loans; and

                                  ARTICLE III

                          ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING
                              OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS

                  SECTION 3.01. Servicer to Act as Servicer.

                  The Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans
on behalf of the Trust and in the best interests of and for the benefit of the
Certificateholders (as determined by the Servicer in its reasonable judgment) in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and the Mortgage Loans and, to the
extent consistent with such terms, in the same manner in which it services and
administers similar mortgage loans for its own portfolio, giving due
consideration to customary and usual standards of practice of mortgage lenders
and loan servicers administering similar mortgage loans but without regard to:

                  (i) any relationship that the Servicer, any Sub-Servicer or
         any Affiliate of the Servicer or any Sub-Servicer may have with the
         related Mortgagor;

                  (ii) the ownership or non-ownership of any Certificate by the
         Servicer or any Affiliate of the Servicer;

                  (iii) the Servicer's obligation to make Advances or Servicing
         Advances; or

                  (iv) the Servicer's or any Sub-Servicer's right to receive
         compensation for its services hereunder or with respect to any
         particular transaction.

                  To the extent consistent with the foregoing, the Servicer (a)
shall seek the timely and complete recovery of principal and interest on the
Mortgage Notes and (b) shall waive (or permit a Sub-Servicer to waive) a
Prepayment Charge only under the following circumstances: (i) such waiver is
standard and customary in servicing similar Mortgage Loans and (ii) such waiver
relates to a default or a reasonably foreseeable default and would, in the
reasonable judgment of the Servicer, maximize recovery of total proceeds taking
into account the value of such Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage Loan
or (iii) the collection of such Prepayment Charge would be in violation of
applicable laws. If a Prepayment Charge is waived as permitted by meeting the
standard described in clause (iii) above, then the Servicer shall make
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the Trustee's rights under the
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement including the obligation of the Seller to pay
the amount of such waived Prepayment Charge to the Servicer for deposit in the
Collection Account for the benefit of the Holders of the Class P Certificates.
If the Servicer makes a good faith determination, as evidenced by an officer's
certificate delivered by the Servicer to the Trustee, that the Servicer's
efforts are not reasonably expected to be successful in enforcing such rights,
it shall notify the Trustee of such failure, and the Trustee shall enforce the
obligation of the Seller under the Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement to pay to
the Servicer the amount of such waived Prepayment Charge. Subject only to the
above-described servicing standards and the terms of this Agreement and of the
Mortgage Loans, the Servicer shall have full power and authority, acting alone
or through Sub-Servicers as provided in Section 3.02, to do or cause to be done
any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration which it
may deem necessary



                                       75

or desirable. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer, in
the name of the Trust Fund, is hereby authorized and empowered by the Trustee
when the Servicer believes it appropriate in its best judgment in accordance
with the Servicing Standard, to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Certificateholders and the Trustee, any and all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release or discharge, and all other
comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the Mortgaged
Properties and to institute foreclosure proceedings or obtain a deed-in-lieu of
foreclosure so as to convert the ownership of such properties, and to hold or
cause to be held title to such properties, on behalf of the Trustee and
Certificateholders. The Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans
in accordance with applicable state and federal law and shall provide to the
Mortgagors any reports required to be provided to them thereby. The Servicer
shall also comply in the performance of this Agreement with all reasonable rules
and requirements of each insurer under any standard hazard insurance policy.
Subject to Section 3.17, within five (5) days of the Closing Date, the Trustee
shall execute and furnish to the Servicer and any Sub-Servicer any special or
limited powers of attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to
enable the Servicer or any Sub-Servicer to carry out their servicing and
administrative duties hereunder; PROVIDED, such limited powers of attorney or
other documents shall be prepared by the Servicer and submitted to the Trustee
for execution. The Trustee shall not be liable for the actions by the Servicer
or any Sub-Servicers under such powers of attorney.

                  Subject to Section 3.09 hereof, in accordance with the
standards of the preceding paragraph, the Servicer, on escrowed accounts, shall
advance or cause to be advanced funds as necessary for the purpose of effecting
the payment of taxes and assessments on the Mortgaged Properties, which advances
shall be Servicing Advances reimbursable in the first instance from related
collections from the Mortgagors pursuant to Section 3.09, and further as
provided in Section 3.11. Any cost incurred by the Servicer or by Sub-Servicers
in effecting the payment of taxes and assessments on a Mortgaged Property shall
not, for the purpose of calculating distributions to Certificateholders, be
added to the unpaid Stated Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan,
notwithstanding that the terms of such Mortgage Loan so permit.

                  Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary,
the Servicer may not make any future advances with respect to a Mortgage Loan
(except as provided in Section 4.04) and the Servicer shall not (i) permit any
modification with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage
Rate, reduce or increase the Stated Principal Balance (except for reductions
resulting from actual payments of principal) or change the final maturity date
on such Mortgage Loan (unless, in any such case, as provided in Section 3.07,
the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Mortgage Loan or such default
is, in the judgment of the Servicer, reasonably foreseeable) or (ii) permit any
modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan that would
both (A) effect an exchange or reissuance of such Mortgage Loan under Section
1001 of the Code (or Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder) and (B) cause
any REMIC created hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the Code or the
imposition of any tax on "prohibited transactions" or "contributions after the
startup date" under the REMIC Provisions.

                  The Servicer shall also undertake to defend, with respect to a
claim against the Trustee or the Trust, any claims against the Trust, the
Trustee or itself by a Mortgagor which relate to or affect the servicing of any
Mortgage Loan. This shall not be construed as an assumption of liability in such
matters. The Trustee shall notify the Servicer of any such claim



                                       76
<PAGE>



within ten (10) days of receiving notice of such claim. The Servicer shall not
be liable for any delay in responding to any claim of which it has not received
timely notice. The Trustee shall cooperate with the Servicer in all aspects of
the defense of such claims, including the timely delivery of all relevant
litigation files and other related information. In the event the Servicer acts
on behalf of the Trustee, the Trust or itself in any such litigation, the Trust
shall pay all costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees, court costs,
settlements and judgments) associated with the defense and management of such
claim; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be indemnified for any
such cost or expense relating to claims against the Servicer and incurred by
reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of
its duties hereunder.

                  SECTION 3.02. Sub-Servicing Agreements Between Servicer and
                                Sub-Servicers.

                  (a) The Servicer may enter into Sub-Servicing Agreements with
Sub-Servicers, which may be Affiliates of the Servicer, for the servicing and
administration of the Mortgage Loans; provided, however, such sub-servicing
arrangement and the terms of the related Sub-Servicing Agreement must provide
for the servicing of the Mortgage Loans in a manner consistent with the
servicing arrangement contemplated hereunder. The Trustee is hereby authorized
to acknowledge, at the request of the Servicer, any Sub-Servicing Agreement. No
such acknowledgment shall be deemed to imply that the Trustee has consented to
any such Sub-Servicing Agreement, has passed upon whether such Sub-Servicing
Agreement meets the requirements applicable to Sub-Servicing Agreements set
forth in this Agreement or has passed upon whether such Sub-Servicing Agreement
is otherwise permitted under this Agreement.

                  Each Sub-Servicer shall be (i) authorized to transact business
in the state or states where the related Mortgaged Properties it is to service
are situated, if and to the extent required by applicable law to enable the
Sub-Servicer to perform its obligations hereunder and under the Sub-Servicing
Agreement and (ii) a Freddie Mac or Fannie Mae approved mortgage servicer. Each
Sub-Servicing Agreement must impose on the Sub-Servicer requirements conforming
to the provisions set forth in Section 3.08 and provide for servicing of the
Mortgage Loans consistent with the terms of this Agreement. The Servicer will
examine each Sub-Servicing Agreement and will be familiar with the terms
thereof. The terms of any Sub-Servicing Agreement will not be inconsistent with
any of the provisions of this Agreement. Any variation in any Sub-Servicing
Agreements from the provisions set forth in Section 3.08 relating to insurance
or priority requirements of Sub-Servicing Accounts, or credits and charges to
the Sub-Servicing Accounts or the timing and amount of remittances by the
Sub-Servicers to the Servicer, are conclusively deemed to be inconsistent with
this Agreement and therefore prohibited. The Servicer shall deliver to the
Trustee copies of all Sub-Servicing Agreements, and any amendments or
modifications thereof, promptly upon the Servicer's execution and delivery of
such instruments.

                  (b) As part of its servicing activities hereunder, the
Servicer, for the benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders, shall
enforce the obligations of each Sub-Servicer under the related Sub-Servicing
Agreement, including, without limitation, any obligation to make advances in
respect of delinquent payments as required by a Sub-Servicing Agreement. Such
enforcement, including, without limitation, the legal prosecution of claims,
termination of Sub-



                                       77
<PAGE>



Servicing Agreements, and the pursuit of other appropriate remedies, shall be in
such form and carried out to such an extent and at such time as the Servicer, in
its good faith business judgment, would require were it the owner of the related
Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall pay the costs of such enforcement at its own
expense, and shall be reimbursed therefor only (i) from a general recovery
resulting from such enforcement, to the extent, if any, that such recovery
exceeds all amounts due in respect of the related Mortgage Loans, or (ii) from a
specific recovery of costs, expenses or attorneys' fees against the party
against whom such enforcement is directed.

                  SECTION 3.03. Successor Sub-Servicers.

                  The Servicer shall be entitled to terminate any Sub-Servicing
Agreement and the rights and obligations of any Sub-Servicer pursuant to any
Sub-Servicing Agreement in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
Sub-Servicing Agreement. In the event of termination of any Sub-Servicer, all
servicing obligations of such Sub-Servicer shall be assumed simultaneously by
the Servicer without any act or deed on the part of such Sub-Servicer or the
Servicer, and the Servicer either shall service directly the related Mortgage
Loans or shall enter into a Sub-Servicing Agreement with a successor
Sub-Servicer which qualifies under Section 3.02.

                  Any Sub-Servicing Agreement shall include the provision that
such agreement may be immediately terminated by the Servicer or the Trustee (if
the Trustee is acting as Servicer) without fee, in accordance with the terms of
this Agreement, in the event that the Servicer (or the Trustee, if such party is
then acting as Servicer) shall, for any reason, no longer be the Servicer
(including termination due to a Servicer Event of Termination).

                  SECTION 3.04. Liability of the Servicer.

                  Notwithstanding any Sub-Servicing Agreement or the provisions
of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements between the Servicer
and a Sub-Servicer or reference to actions taken through a Sub-Servicer or
otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated and primarily liable to the
Trustee and the Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the
Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions of Section 3.01 without
diminution of such obligation or liability by virtue of such Sub-Servicing
Agreements or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the Sub-Servicer
and to the same extent and under the same terms and conditions as if the
Servicer alone were servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
shall be entitled to enter into any agreement with a Sub-Servicer for
indemnification of the Servicer by such Sub-Servicer and nothing contained in
this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such indemnification.

                  SECTION 3.05. No Contractual Relationship Between
                                Sub-Servicers and the Trustee or
                                Certificateholders.

                  Any Sub-Servicing Agreement that may be entered into and any
transactions or services relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Sub-Servicer
in its capacity as such shall be deemed to be between the Sub-Servicer and the
Servicer alone, and the Trustee or Certificateholders shall not be deemed
parties thereto and shall have no claims, rights, obligations, duties or
liabilities with respect to the Sub-Servicer except as set forth in Section




                                       78
<PAGE>



3.06. The Servicer shall be solely liable for all fees owed by it to any
Sub-Servicer, irrespective of whether the Servicer's compensation pursuant to
this Agreement is sufficient to pay such fees.

                  SECTION 3.06. Assumption or Termination of Sub-Servicing
                                Agreements by Trustee.

                  In the event the Servicer shall for any reason no longer be
the servicer (including by reason of the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
Termination), the Trustee, pursuant to its duties under Section 7.02, shall
thereupon assume all of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under each
Sub-Servicing Agreement that the Servicer may have entered into, unless the
Trustee elects to terminate any Sub-Servicing Agreement in accordance with its
terms as provided in Section 3.03. Upon such assumption, the Trustee (or the
successor servicer appointed pursuant to Section 7.02) shall be deemed, subject
to Section 3.03, to have assumed all of the departing Servicer's interest
therein and to have replaced the departing Servicer as a party to each
Sub-Servicing Agreement to the same extent as if each Sub-Servicing Agreement
had been assigned to the assuming party, except that (i) the departing Servicer
shall not thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations under any
Sub-Servicing Agreement that arose before it ceased to be the Servicer and (ii)
neither the Trustee nor any successor Servicer shall be deemed to have assumed
any liability or obligation of the Servicer that arose before it ceased to be
the Servicer.

                  The Servicer at its expense shall, upon request of the
Trustee, deliver to the assuming party all documents and records relating to
each Sub-Servicing Agreement and the Mortgage Loans then being serviced and an
accounting of amounts collected and held by or on behalf of it, and otherwise
use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of the
Sub-Servicing Agreements to the assuming party. All Servicing Transfer Costs
shall be paid by the predecessor Servicer upon presentation of reasonable
documentation of such costs, and if such predecessor Servicer defaults in its
obligation to pay such costs, such costs shall be paid by the successor Servicer
or the Trustee (in which case the successor Servicer or the Trustee, as
applicable, shall be entitled to reimbursement therefor from the assets of the
Trust).

                  SECTION 3.07. Collection of Certain Mortgage Loan Payments.

                  The Servicer shall make reasonable efforts, in accordance with
the Servicing Standard, to collect all payments called for under the terms and
provisions of the Mortgage Loans and the provisions of any applicable insurance
policies provided to the Servicer. Consistent with the foregoing, the Servicer
may in its discretion (i) waive any late payment charge or, if applicable, any
penalty interest, or any provisions of any Mortgage Loan requiring the related
Mortgagor to submit to mandatory arbitration with respect to disputes arising
thereunder or (ii) extend the due dates for the Monthly Payments due on a
Mortgage Note for a period of not greater than 180 days; provided, however, that
any extension pursuant to clause (ii) above shall not affect the amortization
schedule of any Mortgage Loan for purposes of any computation hereunder, except
as provided below. In the event of any such arrangement pursuant to clause (ii)
above, the Servicer shall make timely Advances on such Mortgage Loan during such
extension pursuant to Section 4.04 and in accordance with the amortization
schedule of such Mortgage Loan without modification thereof by reason of such
arrangement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any Mortgage Loan
is in default or, in the judgment of the Servicer, such default is reasonably
foreseeable, the Servicer, consistent with the



                                       79
<PAGE>



standards set forth in Section 3.01, may also waive, modify or vary any term of
such Mortgage Loan (including modifications that would change the Mortgage Rate,
forgive the payment of principal or interest or extend the final maturity date
of such Mortgage Loan), accept payment from the related Mortgagor of an amount
less than the Stated Principal Balance in final satisfaction of such Mortgage
Loan, or consent to the postponement of strict compliance with any such term or
otherwise grant indulgence to any Mortgagor (any and all such waivers,
modifications, variances, forgiveness of principal or interest, postponements,
or indulgences collectively referred to herein as "forbearance"). The Servicer's
analysis supporting any forbearance and the conclusion that any forbearance
meets the standards of Section 3.01 shall be reflected in writing in the
Mortgage File.

                  SECTION 3.08. Sub-Servicing Accounts.

                  In those cases where a Sub-Servicer is servicing a Mortgage
Loan pursuant to a Sub- Servicing Agreement, the Sub-Servicer will be required
to establish and maintain one or more accounts (collectively, the "Sub-Servicing
Account"). The Sub-Servicing Account shall be an Eligible Account and shall
comply with all requirements of this Agreement relating to the Collection
Account. The Sub-Servicer shall deposit in the clearing account in which it
customarily deposits payments and collections on mortgage loans in connection
with its mortgage loan servicing activities on a daily basis, and in no event
more than one Business Day after the Sub-Servicer's receipt thereof, all
proceeds of Mortgage Loans received by the Sub-Servicer less its servicing
compensation to the extent permitted by the Sub-Servicing Agreement, and shall
thereafter deposit such amounts in the Sub-Servicing Account, in no event more
than two Business Days after the receipt of such amounts. The Sub-Servicer shall
thereafter deposit such proceeds in the Collection Account or remit such
proceeds to the Servicer for deposit in the Collection Account not later than
two Business Days after the deposit of such amounts in the Sub-Servicing
Account. For purposes of this Agreement, the Servicer shall be deemed to have
received payments on the Mortgage Loans when the Sub-Servicer receives such
payments.

                  SECTION 3.09. Collection of Taxes, Assessments and Similar
                                Items; Escrow Accounts.

                  To the extent required by the related Mortgage Note, the
Servicer shall establish and maintain, or cause to be established and
maintained, one or more accounts (the "Escrow Accounts"), into which all Escrow
Payments shall be deposited and retained. Escrow Accounts shall be Eligible
Accounts. The Servicer shall deposit in the clearing account in which it
customarily deposits payments and collections on mortgage loans in connection
with its mortgage loan servicing activities, all Escrow Payments collected on
account of the Mortgage Loans and shall deposit in the Escrow Accounts, in no
event more than two Business Days after the receipt of such Escrow Payments, all
Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage Loans for the purpose of
effecting the payment of any such items as required under the terms of this
Agreement. Withdrawals of amounts from an Escrow Account may be made only to (i)
effect payment of taxes, assessments, hazard insurance premiums, and comparable
items in a manner and at a time that assures that the lien priority of the
Mortgage is not jeopardized (or, with respect to the payment of taxes, in a
manner and at a time that avoids the loss of the Mortgaged Property due to a tax
sale or the foreclosure as a result of a tax lien); (ii) reimburse the Servicer
(or a Sub-Servicer to the extent provided in the related Sub-Servicing
Agreement)



                                       80
<PAGE>



out of related collections for any Servicing Advances made pursuant to Section
3.01 (with respect to taxes and assessments) and Section 3.14 (with respect to
hazard insurance); (iii) refund to Mortgagors any sums as may be determined to
be overages; (iv) pay interest, if required and as described below, to
Mortgagors on balances in the Escrow Account; or (v) clear and terminate the
Escrow Account at the termination of the Servicer's obligations and
responsibilities in respect of the Mortgage Loans under this Agreement in
accordance with Article X. In the event the Servicer shall deposit in a Escrow
Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time
withdraw such amount from such Escrow Account, any provision herein to the
contrary notwithstanding. The Servicer will be responsible for the
administration of the Escrow Accounts and will be obligated to make Servicing
Advances to such accounts when and as necessary to avoid the lapse of insurance
coverage on the Mortgaged Property, or which the Servicer knows, or in the
exercise of the required standard of care of the Servicer hereunder should know,
is necessary to avoid the loss of the Mortgaged Property due to a tax sale or
the foreclosure as a result of a tax lien. If any such payment has not been made
and the Servicer receives notice of a tax lien with respect to the Mortgage
being imposed, the Servicer will, within 10 Business Days of receipt of such
notice, advance or cause to be advanced funds necessary to discharge such lien
on the Mortgaged Property. As part of its servicing duties, the Servicer or any
Sub-Servicers shall pay to the Mortgagors interest on funds in the Escrow
Accounts, to the extent required by law and, to the extent that interest earned
on funds in the Escrow Accounts is insufficient, to pay such interest from its
or their own funds, without any reimbursement therefor. The Servicer may pay to
itself any excess interest on funds in the Escrow Accounts, to the extent such
action is in conformity with the Servicing Standard, is permitted by law and
such amounts are not required to be paid to Mortgagors or used for any of the
other purposes set forth above.

                  SECTION 3.10. Collection Account and Distribution Account.

                  (a) On behalf of the Trust Fund, the Servicer shall establish
and maintain, or cause to be established and maintained, one or more accounts
(such account or accounts, the "Collection Account"), held in trust for the
benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders. On behalf of the Trust Fund,
the Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the Collection Account,
in no event more than two Business Days after the Servicer's receipt thereof, as
and when received or as otherwise required hereunder, the following payments and
collections received or made by it subsequent to the Cut-off Date (other than in
respect of principal or interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or before the
Cut-off Date) or payments (other than Principal Prepayments) received by it on
or prior to the Cut-off Date but allocable to a Due Period subsequent thereto:

                  (i) all payments on account of principal, including Principal
         Prepayments (but not Prepayment Charges), on the Mortgage Loans;

                  (ii) all payments on account of interest (net of the Servicing
         Fee) on each Mortgage Loan;

                  (iii) all Insurance Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds, Subsequent
         Recoveries and condemnation proceeds (other than proceeds collected in
         respect of any particular REO Property and amounts paid in connection
         with a purchase of Mortgage Loans and REO Properties pursuant to
         Section 10.01);




                                       81
<PAGE>


                  (iv) any amounts required to be deposited pursuant to Section
         3.12 in connection with any losses realized on Permitted Investments
         with respect to funds held in the Collection Account;

                  (v) any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer
         pursuant to the second paragraph of Section 3.14(a) in respect of any
         blanket policy deductibles;

                  (vi) all proceeds of any Mortgage Loan repurchased or
         purchased in accordance with Section 2.03, Section 3.16(c) or Section
         10.01;

                  (vii) all amounts required to be deposited in connection with
         Substitution Adjustments pursuant to Section 2.03; and

                  (viii) all Prepayment Charges collected by the Servicer and
         any Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts in connection with the
         Principal Prepayment of any of the Mortgage Loans.

                  The foregoing requirements for deposit in the Collection
Account shall be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of Servicing
Fees, late payment charges, assumption fees, insufficient funds charges and
ancillary income (other than Prepayment Charges) need not be deposited by the
Servicer in the Collection Account and may be retained by the Servicer as
additional compensation. In the event the Servicer shall deposit in the
Collection Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at
any time withdraw such amount from the Collection Account, any provision herein
to the contrary notwithstanding.

                  (b) On behalf of the Trust Fund, the Trustee shall establish
and maintain one or more accounts (such account or accounts, the "Distribution
Account"), held in trust for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders. On behalf of the Trust Fund, the Servicer shall deliver to
the Trustee in immediately available funds for deposit in the Distribution
Account on or before 1:00 p.m. New York time on the Servicer Remittance Date,
that portion of the Available Funds (calculated without regard to the references
in the definition thereof to amounts that may be withdrawn from the Distribution
Account) for the related Distribution Date then on deposit in the Collection
Account, the amount of all Prepayment Charges collected during the applicable
Prepayment Period by the Servicer and Servicer Prepayment Charge Payment Amounts
in connection with the Principal Prepayment of any of the Mortgage Loans then on
deposit in the Collection Account, the amount of any funds reimbursable to an
Advancing Person pursuant to Section 3.29 (unless such amounts are to be
remitted in another manner as specified in the documentation establishing the
related Advance Facility).

                  If, by 1:00 p.m. New York time, on the Servicer Remittance
Date, the Servicer fails to remit to the Trustee for deposit into the
Distribution Account any amounts required to be so remitted by the Servicer
pursuant to this Agreement, the Servicer shall pay to the Trustee, for its own
account, interest on such amounts at the prime rate for such date (as set forth
in the WALL STREET JOURNAL) for the period commencing the Business Day following
such Servicer Remittance Date through the Business Day on which such failure is
remedied.




                                       82
<PAGE>


                  (c) Funds in the Collection Account and the Distribution
Account may be invested in Permitted Investments in accordance with the
provisions set forth in Section 3.12. The Servicer shall give notice to the
Trustee of the location of the Collection Account maintained by it when
established and prior to any change thereof. The Trustee shall give notice to
the Servicer and the Depositor of the location of the Distribution Account when
established and prior to any change thereof.

                  (d) Funds held in the Collection Account at any time may be
delivered by the Servicer to the Trustee for deposit in an account (which may be
the Distribution Account and must satisfy the standards for the Distribution
Account as set forth in the definition thereof) and for all purposes of this
Agreement shall be deemed to be a part of the Collection Account; provided,
however, that the Trustee shall have the sole authority to withdraw any funds
held pursuant to this subsection (d). In the event the Servicer shall deliver to
the Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account any amount not required to
be deposited therein, it may at any time request that the Trustee withdraw such
amount from the Distribution Account and remit to it any such amount, any
provision herein to the contrary notwithstanding. In addition, the Servicer,
with respect to items (i) through (iv) below, shall deliver to the Trustee from
time to time for deposit, and the Trustee, with respect to items (i) through
(iv) below, shall so deposit, in the Distribution Account:

                  (i) any Advances, as required pursuant to Section 4.04;

                  (ii) any amounts required to be deposited pursuant to Section
         3.23(d) or (f) in connection with any REO Property;

                  (iii) any amounts to be paid by the Servicer in connection
         with a purchase of Mortgage Loans and REO Properties pursuant to
         Section 10.01;

                  (iv) any Compensating Interest to be deposited pursuant to
         Section 3.24 in connection with any Prepayment Interest Shortfall; and

                  (v) any amounts required to be paid to the Trustee pursuant to
         the Agreement, including but not limited to Section 3.06 and Section
         7.02.

                  SECTION 3.11. Withdrawals from the Collection Account and
                                Distribution Account.

                  (a) The Servicer shall, from time to time, make withdrawals
from the Collection Account for any of the following purposes or as described in
Section 4.04:

                  (i) to remit to the Trustee for deposit in the Distribution
         Account the amounts required to be so remitted pursuant to Section
         3.10(b) or permitted to be so remitted pursuant to the first sentence
         of Section 3.10(d);

                  (ii) subject to Section 3.16(d), to reimburse the Servicer for
         (a) any unreimbursed Advances to the extent of amounts received which
         represent Late Collections (net of the related Servicing Fees),
         Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance Proceeds on Mortgage Loans or REO
         Properties with respect to which such Advances


                                       83
<PAGE>



         were made in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.04; or (b)
         without limiting any right of withdrawal set forth in clause (vi)
         below, any unreimbursed Advances that, upon a Final Recovery
         Determination with respect to such Mortgage Loan, are Nonrecoverable
         Advances, but only to the extent that Late Collections (net of the
         related Servicing Fees), Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance Proceeds
         received with respect to such Mortgage Loan are insufficient to
         reimburse the Servicer for such unreimbursed Advances;

                  (iii) subject to Section 3.16(d), to pay the Servicer or any
         Sub-Servicer (a) any unpaid Servicing Fees, (b) any unreimbursed
         Servicing Advances with respect to each Mortgage Loan, but only to the
         extent of any Late Collections, Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance
         Proceeds received with respect to such Mortgage Loan or REO Property,
         and (c) without limiting any right of withdrawal set forth in clause
         (vi) below, any Servicing Advances made with respect to a Mortgage Loan
         that, upon a Final Recovery Determination with respect to such Mortgage
         Loan are Nonrecoverable Advances, but only to the extent that Late
         Collections, Liquidation Proceeds and Insurance Proceeds received with
         respect to such Mortgage Loan are insufficient to reimburse the
         Servicer or any Sub-Servicer for Servicing Advances;

                  (iv) to pay to the Servicer as additional servicing
         compensation (in addition to the Servicing Fee) on the Servicer
         Remittance Date any interest or investment income earned on funds
         deposited in the Collection Account;

                  (v) to pay itself or the Seller with respect to each Mortgage
         Loan that has previously been purchased or replaced pursuant to Section
         2.03 or Section 3.16(c) all amounts received thereon subsequent to the
         date of purchase or substitution, as the case may be;

                  (vi) to reimburse the Servicer for any Advance or Servicing
         Advance previously made which the Servicer has determined to be a
         Nonrecoverable Advance in accordance with the provisions of Section
         4.04;

                  (vii) to pay, or to reimburse the Servicer for Servicing
         Advances in respect of, expenses incurred in connection with any
         Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 3.16(b);

                  (viii) to reimburse the Servicer for expenses incurred by or
         reimbursable to the Servicer pursuant to Section 6.03;

                  (ix) to pay itself any Prepayment Interest Excess;

                  (x) to reimburse itself for expenses incurred pursuant to
         Section 9.01(c)(i); and

                  (xi) to clear and terminate the Collection Account pursuant to
         Section 10.01.

                  The foregoing requirements for withdrawal from the Collection
Account shall be exclusive. In the event the Servicer shall deposit in the
Collection Account any amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at
any time withdraw such amount from the Collection Account, any provision herein
to the contrary notwithstanding.





                                       84
<PAGE>



                  The Servicer shall keep and maintain separate accounting, on a
Mortgage Loan by Mortgage Loan basis, for the purpose of justifying any
withdrawal from the Collection Account, to the extent held by or on behalf of
it, pursuant to subclauses (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi) and (vii) above. The
Servicer shall provide written notification to the Trustee, on or prior to the
next succeeding Servicer Remittance Date, upon making any withdrawals from the
Collection Account pursuant to subclause (vi) above; provided that an Officers'
Certificate in the form described under Section 4.04(d) shall suffice for such
written notification to the Trustee in respect hereof.

                  (b) The Trustee shall, from time to time, make withdrawals
from the Distribution Account, for any of the following purposes, without
priority:

                  (i) to make distributions in accordance with Section 4.01;

                  (ii) to pay itself the Trustee Fee pursuant to Section 8.05;

                  (iii) to pay any amounts in respect of taxes pursuant to
         Section 9.01(g);

                  (iv) to clear and terminate the Distribution Account pursuant
         to Section 10.01;

                  (v) to pay any amounts required to be paid to the Trustee
         pursuant to this Agreement, including but not limited to funds required
         to be paid pursuant to Section 3.06, Section 4.01, Section 7.02 and
         Section 8.05;

                  (vi) to pay to the Trustee, any interest or investment income
         earned on funds deposited in the Distribution Account; and

                  (vii) to pay to an Advancing Person reimbursements for
         Advances and/or Servicing Advances pursuant to Section 3.29.

                  SECTION 3.12. Investment of Funds in the Collection Account,
                                the Distribution Account and the Pre-Funding
                                Accounts.

                  (a) The Servicer may direct any depository institution
maintaining the Collection Account and any REO Account to invest the funds on
deposit in such accounts, the Depositor may direct any depository institution
maintaining the Pre-Funding Accounts and the Interest Coverage Accounts, if any
and the Trustee may invest the funds on deposit in the Distribution Account
(each such account, for the purposes of this Section 3.12, an "Investment
Account"). All investments pursuant to this Section 3.12 shall be in one or more
Permitted Investments bearing interest or sold at a discount, and maturing,
unless payable on demand, (i) no later than the Business Day immediately
preceding the date on which such funds are required to be withdrawn from such
account pursuant to this Agreement, if a Person other than the Trustee is the
obligor thereon or if such investment is managed or advised by a Person other
than the Trustee or an Affiliate of the Trustee, and (ii) no later than the date
on which such funds are required to be withdrawn from such account pursuant to
this Agreement, if the Trustee is the obligor thereon or if such investment is
managed or advised by the Trustee or any Affiliate. All such Permitted
Investments shall be held to maturity, unless payable on demand. Any investment
of funds in an Investment Account shall be made in the name of the Trustee (in
its capacity as



                                       85
<PAGE>



such), or in the name of a nominee of the Trustee. The Trustee shall be entitled
to sole possession (except with respect to investment direction of funds held in
the Collection Account, any REO Account and the Pre-Funding Accounts, and any
income and gain realized thereon) over each such investment, and any certificate
or other instrument evidencing any such investment shall be delivered directly
to the Trustee or its agent, together with any document of transfer necessary to
transfer title to such investment to the Trustee or its nominee. In the event
amounts on deposit in an Investment Account are at any time invested in a
Permitted Investment payable on demand, the Trustee shall:

                  (x) consistent with any notice required to be given
         thereunder, demand that payment thereon be made on the last day such
         Permitted Investment may otherwise mature hereunder in an amount equal
         to the lesser of (1) all amounts then payable thereunder and (2) the
         amount required to be withdrawn on such date; and

                  (y) demand payment of all amounts due thereunder promptly upon
         determination by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee that such
         Permitted Investment would not constitute a Permitted Investment in
         respect of funds thereafter on deposit in the Investment Account.

                  (b) All income and gain realized from the investment of funds
deposited in the Collection Account and any REO Account held by or on behalf of
the Servicer shall be for the benefit of the Servicer and shall be subject to
its withdrawal in accordance with Section 3.11 or Section 3.23, as applicable.
The Servicer shall deposit in the Collection Account or any REO Account, as
applicable, the amount of any loss of principal incurred in respect of any such
Permitted Investment made with funds in such Account immediately upon
realization of such loss.

                  All income and gain realized from the investment of funds
deposited in the Pre-Funding Accounts held by or on behalf of the Depositor
shall be for the benefit of the Depositor and shall be subject to its withdrawal
in accordance with Section 4.05. The Depositor shall deposit in the Pre-Funding
Accounts the amount of any loss of principal incurred in respect of any such
Permitted Investment made with funds in such accounts immediately upon
realization of such loss.

                  (c) All income and gain realized from the investment of funds
deposited in the Distribution Account shall be for the benefit of the Trustee.
The Trustee shall deposit in the Distribution Account the amount of any loss of
principal incurred in respect of any such Permitted Investment made with funds
in such Account immediately upon realization of such loss. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, the Trustee may at its discretion, and without liability, hold the
funds in the Distribution Account uninvested.

                  (d) Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement,
if any default occurs in the making of a payment due under any Permitted
Investment, or if a default occurs in any other performance required under any
Permitted Investment, the Trustee may and, subject to Section 8.01 and Section
8.02(a)(v), upon the request of the Holders of Certificates representing more
than 50% of the Voting Rights allocated to any Class of Certificates, shall take
such action



                                       86
<PAGE>



as may be appropriate to enforce such payment or performance, including the
institution and prosecution of appropriate proceedings.

                  SECTION 3.13. [Reserved].

                  SECTION 3.14. Maintenance of Hazard Insurance and Errors and
                                Omissions and Fidelity Coverage.

                  (a) The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each
Mortgage Loan hazard insurance with extended coverage on the Mortgaged Property
in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the current Principal
Balance of such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the amount necessary to fully compensate
for any damage or loss to the improvements that are a part of such property on a
replacement cost basis, in each case in an amount not less than such amount as
is necessary to avoid the application of any coinsurance clause contained in the
related hazard insurance policy. The Servicer shall also cause to be maintained
hazard insurance with extended coverage on each REO Property in an amount which
is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum insurable value of the
improvements which are a part of such property and (ii) the outstanding
Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan at the time it became an REO
Property. The Servicer will comply in the performance of this Agreement with all
reasonable rules and requirements of each insurer under any such hazard
policies. Any amounts to be collected by the Servicer under any such policies
(other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of the property
subject to the related Mortgage or amounts to be released to the Mortgagor in
accordance with the procedures that the Servicer would follow in servicing loans
held for its own account, subject to the terms and conditions of the related
Mortgage and Mortgage Note) shall be deposited in the Collection Account,
subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.11, if received in respect of a
Mortgage Loan, or in the REO Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section
3.23, if received in respect of an REO Property. Any cost incurred by the
Servicer in maintaining any such insurance shall not, for the purpose of
calculating distributions to Certificateholders, be added to the unpaid
Principal Balance of the related Mortgage Loan, notwithstanding that the terms
of such Mortgage Loan so permit. It is understood and agreed that no earthquake
or other additional insurance is to be required of any Mortgagor other than
pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in
force and as shall require such additional insurance. If the Mortgaged Property
or REO Property is at any time in an area identified in the Federal Register by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards and
flood insurance has been made available, the Servicer will cause to be
maintained a flood insurance policy in respect thereof. Such flood insurance
shall be in an amount equal to the lesser of (i) the unpaid Principal Balance of
the related Mortgage Loan and (ii) the maximum amount of such insurance
available for the related Mortgaged Property under the national flood insurance
program (assuming that the area in which such Mortgaged Property is located is
participating in such program).

                  In the event that the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a
blanket policy insuring against hazard losses on all of the Mortgage Loans, it
shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in
the first two sentences of this Section 3.14, it being understood and agreed
that such policy may contain a deductible clause on terms substantially
equivalent to those commercially available and maintained by competent
servicers, in which case the Servicer shall, in the event that there shall not
have been maintained on the related



                                       87
<PAGE>



Mortgaged Property or REO Property a policy complying with the first two
sentences of this Section 3.14, and there shall have been one or more losses
which would have been covered by such policy, deposit to the Collection Account
from its own funds the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy
because of such deductible clause. In connection with its activities as servicer
of the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of
itself, the Depositor, the Trustee and Certificateholders, claims under any such
blanket policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of such policy.

                  (b) The Servicer shall keep in force during the term of this
Agreement a policy or policies of insurance covering errors and omissions for
failure in the performance of the Servicer's obligations under this Agreement,
which policy or policies shall be in such form and amount that would meet the
requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac if it were the purchaser of the
Mortgage Loans, unless the Servicer has obtained a waiver of such requirements
from Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The Servicer shall also maintain a fidelity bond
in the form and amount that would meet the requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac, unless the Servicer has obtained a waiver of such requirements from Fannie
Mae or Freddie Mac. The Servicer shall be deemed to have complied with this
provision if an Affiliate of the Servicer has such errors and omissions and
fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such insurance policy or fidelity
bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to the Servicer. Any such errors
and omissions policy and fidelity bond shall by its terms not be cancelable
without thirty days' prior written notice to the Trustee. The Servicer shall
also cause each Sub-Servicer to maintain a policy of insurance covering errors
and omissions and a fidelity bond which would meet such requirements.

                  SECTION 3.15. Enforcement of Due-On-Sale Clauses; Assumption
                                Agreements.

                  The Servicer will, to the extent it has knowledge of any
conveyance or prospective conveyance of any Mortgaged Property by any Mortgagor
(whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or not the
Mortgagor remains or is to remain liable under the Mortgage Note and/or the
Mortgage), exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan
under the "due-on-sale" clause, if any, applicable thereto; provided, however,
that the Servicer shall not be required to take such action if in its sole
business judgment the Servicer believes it is not in the best interests of the
Trust Fund and shall not exercise any such rights if prohibited by law from
doing so. If the Servicer reasonably believes it is unable under applicable law
to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, or if any of the other conditions set
forth in the proviso to the preceding sentence apply, the Servicer will enter
into an assumption and modification agreement from or with the person to whom
such property has been conveyed or is proposed to be conveyed, pursuant to which
such person becomes liable under the Mortgage Note and, to the extent permitted
by applicable state law, the Mortgagor remains liable thereon. The Servicer is
also authorized, to the extent permitted under the related Mortgage Note, to
enter into a substitution of liability agreement with such person, pursuant to
which the original Mortgagor is released from liability and such person is
substituted as the Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note,
provided that no such substitution shall be effective unless such person
satisfies the current underwriting criteria of the Servicer for a mortgage loan
similar to the related Mortgage Loan. In connection with any assumption,
modification or substitution, the Servicer or an agent of the Servicer shall
apply such underwriting standards and follow such practices and procedures as
shall be normal and usual in



                                       88
<PAGE>



its general mortgage servicing activities and as it applies to other mortgage
loans owned solely by it. The Servicer shall not take or enter into any
assumption and modification agreement, however, unless (to the extent
practicable in the circumstances) it shall have received confirmation, in
writing, of the continued effectiveness of any applicable hazard insurance
policy. Any fee collected by the Servicer in respect of an assumption,
modification or substitution of liability agreement shall be retained by the
Servicer as additional servicing compensation. In connection with any such
assumption, no material term of the Mortgage Note (including but not limited to
the related Mortgage Rate and the amount of the Monthly Payment) may be amended
or modified, except as otherwise required pursuant to the terms thereof. The
Servicer shall notify the Trustee that any such substitution, modification or
assumption agreement has been completed by forwarding to the Trustee the
executed original of such substitution, modification or assumption agreement,
which document shall be added to the related Mortgage File and shall, for all
purposes, be considered a part of such Mortgage File to the same extent as all
other documents and instruments constituting a part thereof.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing paragraph or any other provision
of this Agreement, the Servicer shall not be deemed to be in default, breach or
any other violation of its obligations hereunder by reason of any assumption of
a Mortgage Loan by operation of law or by the terms of the Mortgage Note or any
assumption which the Servicer may be restricted by law from preventing, for any
reason whatsoever. For purposes of this Section 3.15, the term "assumption" is
deemed to also include a sale (of the Mortgaged Property) subject to the
Mortgage that is not accompanied by an assumption or substitution of liability
agreement.

                  SECTION 3.16. Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

                  (a) The Servicer shall use its reasonable efforts, consistent
with the Servicing Standard, to foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert
the ownership of properties securing such of the Mortgage Loans as come into and
continue in default and as to which no satisfactory arrangements can be made for
collection of delinquent payments pursuant to Section 3.07. Title to any such
property shall be taken in the name of the Trustee or its nominee, on behalf of
the Certificateholders, subject to applicable law. The Servicer shall be
responsible for all costs and expenses incurred by it in any such proceedings;
provided, however, that such costs and expenses will be recoverable as Servicing
Advances by the Servicer as contemplated in Section 3.11(a) and Section 3.23.
The foregoing is subject to the provision that, in any case in which a Mortgaged
Property shall have suffered damage from an Uninsured Cause, the Servicer shall
not be required to expend its own funds toward the restoration of such property
unless it shall determine in its discretion that such restoration will increase
the proceeds of liquidation of the related Mortgage Loan after reimbursement to
itself for such expenses.

                  (b) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
3.16 or any other provision of this Agreement, with respect to any Mortgage Loan
as to which the Servicer has received actual notice of, or has actual knowledge
of, the presence of any toxic or hazardous substance on the related Mortgaged
Property, the Servicer shall not, on behalf of the Trustee, either (i) obtain
title to such Mortgaged Property as a result of or in lieu of foreclosure or
otherwise, or (ii) otherwise acquire possession of, or take any other action
with respect to, such Mortgaged Property, if, as a result of any such action,
the Trustee, the Trust Fund or the Certificateholders would be considered to
hold title to, to be a "mortgagee-in-possession" of, or



                                       89
<PAGE>


to be an "owner" or "operator" of such Mortgaged Property within the meaning of
the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act of
1980, as amended from time to time, or any comparable law, unless the Servicer
has also previously determined, based on its reasonable judgment and a report
prepared by a Person who regularly conducts environmental audits using customary
industry standards, that:

                  (1) such Mortgaged Property is in compliance with applicable
         environmental laws or, if not, that it would be in the best economic
         interest of the Trust Fund to take such actions as are necessary to
         bring the Mortgaged Property into compliance therewith; and

                  (2) there are no circumstances present at such Mortgaged
         Property relating to the use, management or disposal of any hazardous
         substances, hazardous materials, hazardous wastes, or petroleum-based
         materials for which investigation, testing, monitoring, containment,
         clean-up or remediation could be required under any federal, state or
         local law or regulation, or that if any such materials are present for
         which such action could be required, that it would be in the best
         economic interest of the Trust Fund to take such actions with respect
         to the affected Mortgaged Property.

                  The cost of the environmental audit report contemplated by
this Section 3.16 shall be advanced by the Servicer, subject to the Servicer's
right to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as provided in
Section 3.11(a)(vii), such right of reimbursement being prior to the rights of
Certificateholders to receive any amount in the Collection Account received in
respect of the affected Mortgage Loan or other Mortgage Loans.

                  If the Servicer determines, as described above, that it is in
the best economic interest of the Trust Fund to take such actions as are
necessary to bring any such Mortgaged Property into compliance with applicable
environmental laws, or to take such action with respect to the containment,
clean-up or remediation of hazardous substances, hazardous materials, hazardous
wastes or petroleum-based materials affecting any such Mortgaged Property, then
the Servicer shall take such action as it deems to be in the best economic
interest of the Trust Fund; provided that any amounts disbursed by the Servicer
pursuant to this Section 3.16(b) shall constitute Servicing Advances, subject to
Section 4.04(d). The cost of any such compliance, containment, clean-up or
remediation shall be advanced by the Servicer, subject to the Servicer's right
to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as provided in Section
3.11(a)(vii), such right of reimbursement being prior to the rights of
Certificateholders to receive any amount in the Collection Account received in
respect of the affected Mortgage Loan or other Mortgage Loans.

                  (c) The Servicer may, at its option, purchase a Mortgage Loan
which has become 90 or more days delinquent or for which the Servicer has
accepted a deed in lieu of foreclosure. Prior to purchase pursuant to this
Section 3.16(c), the Servicer shall be required to continue to make Advances
pursuant to Section 4.04. The Servicer shall not use any procedure in selecting
Mortgage Loans to be repurchased which is materially adverse to the interests of
the Certificateholders. The Servicer shall purchase such delinquent Mortgage
Loan at a price equal to the Purchase Price of such Mortgage Loan. Any such
purchase of a Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Section 3.16(c) shall be
accomplished by deposit in the Collection Account of the amount




                                       90
<PAGE>



of the Purchase Price. Upon the satisfaction of the requirements set forth in
Section 3.17(a), the Trustee shall immediately deliver the Mortgage File and any
related documentation to the Servicer and will execute such documents provided
to it as are necessary to convey the Mortgage Loan to the Servicer.

                  (d) Proceeds received in connection with any Final Recovery
Determination, as well as any recovery resulting from a partial collection of
Insurance Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds or condemnation proceeds, in respect of
any Mortgage Loan, will be applied in the following order of priority: first, to
unpaid Servicing Fees; second, to reimburse the Servicer or any Sub-Servicer for
any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances pursuant to Section 3.11(a)(iii) and
Advances pursuant to Section 3.11(a)(ii); third, to accrued and unpaid interest
on the Mortgage Loan, to the date of the Final Recovery Determination, or to the
Due Date prior to the Distribution Date on which such amounts are to be
distributed if not in connection with a Final Recovery Determination; and
fourth, as a recovery of principal of the Mortgage Loan. The portion of the
recovery so allocated to unpaid Servicing Fees shall be reimbursed to the
Servicer or any Sub-Servicer pursuant to Section 3.11(a)(iii).

                  SECTION 3.17. Trustee to Cooperate; Release of Mortgage Files.

                  (a) Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the
receipt by the Servicer of a notification that payment in full shall be escrowed
in a manner customary for such purposes, the Servicer shall notify or cause to
be notified the Trustee by a certification and shall deliver to the Trustee, in
written or electronic format, which format is acceptable to the Custodian, two
executed copies of a Request for Release in the form of Exhibit E hereto (which
certification shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received
or to be received in connection with such payment which are required to be
deposited in the Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.10 have been or will
be so deposited) signed by a Servicing Officer (or in a mutually agreeable
electronic format that will, in lieu of a signature on its face, originate from
a Servicing Officer) and shall request delivery to it or its designee of the
Mortgage File. Upon receipt of such certification and request, the Trustee
shall, within three Business Days, release and send by overnight mail, at the
expense of the Servicer or the related Mortgagor, the related Mortgage File to
the Servicer or its designee. The Trustee agrees to indemnify the Servicer, out
of its own funds, for any loss, liability or expense (other than special,
indirect, punitive or consequential damages which will not be paid by the
Trustee) incurred by the Servicer as a proximate result of the Trustee's breach
of its obligations pursuant to this Section 3.17. No expenses incurred in
connection with any instrument of satisfaction or deed of reconveyance shall be
chargeable to the Collection Account or the Distribution Account.

                  (b) From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or
foreclosure of any Mortgage Loan, including, for this purpose, collection under
any insurance policy relating to the Mortgage Loans, the Trustee shall, upon any
request made by or on behalf of the Servicer and delivery to the Trustee of two
executed copies of a written Request for Release in the form of Exhibit E hereto
signed by a Servicing Officer (or in a mutually agreeable electronic format that
will, in lieu of a signature on its face, originate from a Servicing Officer),
release the related Mortgage File to the Servicer or its designee within three
Business Days, and the Trustee shall, at the direction of the Servicer, execute
such documents provided to it by the Servicer as shall be necessary to the
prosecution of any such proceedings. Such Request for Release shall obligate



                                       91
<PAGE>



the Servicer to return each and every document previously requested from the
Mortgage File to the Trustee when the need therefor by the Servicer no longer
exists, unless the Mortgage Loan has been liquidated and the Liquidation
Proceeds relating to the Mortgage Loan have been deposited in the Collection
Account or the Mortgage File or such document has been delivered to an attorney,
or to a public trustee or other public official as required by law, for purposes
of initiating or pursuing legal action or other proceedings for the foreclosure
of the Mortgaged Property either judicially or non-judicially, and the Servicer
has delivered, or caused to be delivered, to the Trustee an additional Request
for Release certifying as to such liquidation or action or proceedings. Upon the
request of the Trustee, the Servicer shall provide notice to the Trustee of the
name and address of the Person to which such Mortgage File or such document was
delivered and the purpose or purposes of such delivery. Upon receipt of a
Request for Release, in written (with two executed copies) or electronic format,
from a Servicing Officer stating that such Mortgage Loan was liquidated and that
all amounts received or to be received in connection with such liquidation that
are required to be deposited into the Collection Account have been so deposited,
or that such Mortgage Loan has become an REO Property, such Mortgage Loan shall
be released by the Trustee to the Servicer or its designee within three Business
Days.

                  (c) Upon written certification of a Servicing Officer, the
Trustee shall execute and deliver to the Servicer or the Sub-Servicer, as the
case may be, copies of any court pleadings, requests for trustee's sale or other
documents necessary to the foreclosure or trustee's sale in respect of a
Mortgaged Property or to any legal action brought to obtain judgment against any
Mortgagor on the Mortgage Note or Mortgage or to obtain a deficiency judgment,
or to enforce any other remedies or rights provided by the Mortgage Note or
Mortgage or otherwise available at law or in equity. Each such certification
shall include a request that such pleadings or documents be executed by the
Trustee and a statement as to the reason such documents or pleadings are
required and that the execution and delivery thereof by the Trustee will not
invalidate or otherwise affect the lien of the Mortgage, except for the
termination of such a lien upon completion of the foreclosure or trustee's sale.

                  SECTION 3.18. Servicing Compensation.

                  As compensation for its activities hereunder, the Servicer
shall be entitled to the Servicing Fee with respect to each Mortgage Loan
payable solely from payments of interest in respect of such Mortgage Loan,
subject to Section 3.24. In addition, the Servicer shall be entitled to recover
unpaid Servicing Fees out of Insurance Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds or
condemnation proceeds to the extent permitted by Section 3.11(a)(iii) and out of
amounts derived from the operation and sale of an REO Property to the extent
permitted by Section 3.23. Except as provided in Section 3.29, the right to
receive the Servicing Fee may not be transferred in whole or in part except in
connection with the transfer of all of the Servicer's responsibilities and
obligations under this Agreement; provided, however, that the Servicer may pay
from the Servicing Fee any amounts due to a Sub-Servicer pursuant to a
Sub-Servicing Agreement entered into under Section 3.02.

                  Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption
fees, late payment charges, insufficient funds charges, ancillary income or
otherwise (other than Prepayment Charges) shall be retained by the Servicer only
to the extent such fees or charges are received by



                                       92
<PAGE>



the Servicer. The Servicer shall also be entitled pursuant to Section
3.11(a)(iv) to withdraw from the Collection Account and pursuant to Section
3.23(b) to withdraw from any REO Account, as additional servicing compensation,
interest or other income earned on deposits therein, subject to Section 3.12 and
Section 3.24. The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it
in connection with its servicing activities hereunder (including premiums for
the insurance required by Section 3.14, to the extent such premiums are not paid
by the related Mortgagors or by a Sub-Servicer, and servicing compensation of
each Sub-Servicer) and shall not be entitled to reimbursement therefor except as
specifically provided herein.

                  The Servicer shall be entitled to any Prepayment Interest
Excess, which it may withdraw from the Collection Account pursuant to Section
3.11(a)(ix).

                  SECTION 3.19. Reports to the Trustee; Collection Account
                                Statements.

                  Not later than thirty days after each Distribution Date, the
Servicer shall forward, upon request, to the Trustee and the Depositor the most
current available bank statement for the Collection Account. Copies of such
statement shall be provided by the Trustee to any Certificateholder and to any
Person identified to the Trustee as a prospective transferee of a Certificate,
upon request at the expense of the requesting party, provided such statement is
delivered by the Servicer to the Trustee.

                  SECTION 3.20. Statement as to Compliance.

                  The Servicer will deliver to the Trustee and the Depositor not
later than March 15th of each calendar year, commencing in 2005, an Officers'
Certificate in the form attached hereto as Exhibit G stating, as to each
signatory thereof, that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during
the preceding calendar year and of performance under this Agreement has been
made under such officers' supervision and (ii) to the best of such officers'
knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all of its
obligations under this Agreement throughout such calendar year, or, if there has
been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such
default known to such officer and the nature and status thereof. Copies of any
such statement shall be provided by the Trustee to any Certificateholder and to
any Person identified to the Trustee as a prospective transferee of a
Certificate, upon request at the expense of the requesting party, provided such
statement is delivered by the Servicer to the Trustee. In addition to the
foregoing, the Servicer will, to the extent reasonable, give any other servicing
information required by the Securities and Exchange Commission pursuant to
applicable law.

                  SECTION 3.21. Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
                                Report.

                  Not later than March 15th of each calendar year, commencing in
2005, the Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a nationally recognized firm of
independent certified public accountants to furnish to the Servicer a report
stating that (i) it has obtained a letter of representation regarding certain
matters from the management of the Servicer which includes an assertion that the
Servicer has complied with certain minimum residential mortgage loan servicing
standards, identified in the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage
Bankers established by the Mortgage Bankers Association of America, with respect
to the servicing of residential mortgage loans during the most recently
completed calendar year and (ii) on the basis



                                       93
<PAGE>



of an examination conducted by such firm in accordance with standards
established by the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, such
representation is fairly stated in all material respects, subject to such
exceptions and other qualifications that may be appropriate. In rendering its
report such firm may rely, as to matters relating to the direct servicing of
residential mortgage loans by Sub-Servicers, upon comparable reports of firms of
independent certified public accountants rendered on the basis of examinations
conducted in accordance with the same standards (rendered within one year of
such report) with respect to those Sub-Servicers. Immediately upon receipt of
such report, the Servicer shall furnish a copy of such report to the Trustee and
each Rating Agency. Copies of such statement shall be provided by the Trustee to
any Certificateholder upon request at the Servicer's expense, provided that such
statement is delivered by the Servicer to the Trustee.

                  SECTION 3.22. Access to Certain Documentation; Filing of
                                Reports by Trustee.

                  (a) The Servicer shall provide to the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the FDIC, and any other federal or state banking or insurance
regulatory authority that may exercise authority over any Certificateholder,
access to the documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans required by applicable
laws and regulations. Such access shall be afforded without charge, but only
upon reasonable request and during normal business hours at the offices of the
Servicer designated by it. In addition, access to the documentation regarding
the Mortgage Loans will be provided to the Trustee and to any Person identified
to the Servicer as a prospective transferee of a Certificate, upon reasonable
request during normal business hours at the offices of the Servicer designated
by it, at the expense of the Person requesting such access.

                  (b) (i) The Trustee and the Servicer shall reasonably
cooperate with the Depositor in connection with the Trust's satisfying the
reporting requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the "Exchange Act"). The Trustee shall prepare on behalf of the Trust any Forms
8-K (or other comparable required Form containing the same or comparable
information or other information mutually agreed upon) and 10-K customary for
similar securities as required by the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations
of the Securities and Exchange Commission thereunder, and the Depositor shall
sign (or shall cause another entity acceptable to the Securities and Exchange
Commission to sign) and the Trustee shall file (via the Securities and Exchange
Commission's Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval System) such forms on
behalf of the Depositor (or such other entity). The Depositor hereby grants to
the Trustee a limited power of attorney to execute any Form 8-K and file each
such document on behalf of the Depositor. Such power of attorney shall continue
until the earlier of (i) receipt by the Trustee from the Depositor of written
termination of such power of attorney and (ii) the termination of the Trust.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Depositor, and not the
Trustee, shall be responsible for executing each Form 10-K filed on behalf of
the Trust.

                  (ii) Each Form 8-K shall be filed by the Trustee within 10
days after each Distribution Date, with a copy of the statement to the
Certificateholders for such Distribution Date as an exhibit thereto. Subject to
Section 3.22(b)(v), prior to March 30th of each year (or such earlier date as
may be required by the Exchange Act and the Rules and Regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission), the Trustee shall file a Form 10-K, in
substance as



                                       94
<PAGE>



required by applicable law or applicable Security and Exchange Commission
interpretations. The Trustee shall prepare such Form 10-K and provide the
Depositor with such Form 10-K not later than March 20th of each year, subject to
Section 3.22(b)(v). Following its receipt thereof, the Depositor shall execute
such Form 10-K and provide the original of such Form 10-K to the Trustee not
later than March 25th (or, if the applicable March 25th is not a Business Day,
the next succeeding Business Day) of each year; provided, however, that if the
filing of such Form 10-K shall be required to occur on a date earlier than March
30th of each year as may be required by the Exchange Act and the Rules and
Regulations of the Securities and Exchange Commission, then the time periods for
preparation and execution of such Form 10-K set forth in this sentence shall be
adjusted accordingly. Such Form 10-K when filed shall include as exhibits the
Servicer's annual statement of compliance described under Section 3.20 and the
accountant's report described under Section 3.21, in each case to the extent
they have been timely delivered to the Trustee. If they are not so timely
delivered, the Trustee shall file an amended Form 10-K including such documents
as exhibits reasonably promptly after they are delivered to the Trustee. The
Trustee shall have no liability with respect to any failure to properly prepare
or file such periodic reports resulting from or relating to the Trustee's
inability or failure to obtain any information not resulting from its own
negligence or willful misconduct. The Form 10-K shall also include a
certification in the form attached hereto as Exhibit N-1 (the "Certification"),
which shall be signed by the senior officer of the Depositor in charge of
securitization.

                  (iii) In addition, (x) the Trustee shall sign a certification
(in the form attached hereto as Exhibit N-2) for the benefit of the Depositor
and its officers, directors and Affiliates regarding certain aspects of the
Certification (the "Trustee Certification"); provided, however, that the Trustee
shall not undertake an analysis of the accountant's report attached as an
exhibit to the Form 10-K, and (y) the Servicer shall sign a certification (in
the form attached hereto as Exhibit N-3) for the benefit of the Depositor, the
Trustee and their officers, directors and Affiliates regarding certain aspects
of the Certification (the "Servicer Certification"). The Servicer Certification
shall be delivered to the Depositor and the Trustee no later than March 15th or
if such day is not a Business Day, the preceding Business Day, each year
(subject to Section 3.22(b)(v) hereof).

                  In addition, (A) the Trustee shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Depositor and its officers, directors and Affiliates from and against any
actual losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary
legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses arising out
of third party claims based upon a breach of the Trustee's obligations under
this Section 3.22(b) or any material misstatement or omission contained in the
Trustee Certification, and (B) the Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless
the Depositor, the Trustee and their respective officers, directors and
Affiliates from and against any actual losses, damages, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments
and other costs and expenses that such Person may sustain arising out of third
party claims based upon a breach of the Servicer's obligations under this
Section 3.22(b)(iii), any material misstatement or omission contained in the
Servicer's Certification or any information correctly derived by the Trustee and
included in a Form 8-K or Form 10-K from information provided to the Trustee by
the Servicer under this Agreement. If the indemnification provided for herein is
unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the Depositor, then (i) the Trustee
agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the Depositor
as a result of the losses, claims, damages or liabilities of the Depositor in
such proportion as is appropriate to



                                       95
<PAGE>



reflect the relative fault of the Depositor on the one hand and the Trustee on
the other and (ii) the Servicer agrees that it shall contribute to the amount
paid or payable by the Depositor as a result of the losses, claims, damages or
liabilities of the Depositor in such proportion as is appropriate to reflect the
relative fault of the Depositor on the one hand and the Servicer on the other.

                  (iv) Upon any filing with the Securities and Exchange
Commission, the Trustee shall promptly deliver to the Depositor a copy of any
executed report, statement or information.

                  (v) Prior to January 30 of the first year in which the Trustee
is able to do so under applicable law, the Trustee shall file a Form 15
Suspension Notification with respect to the Trust.

                  (vi) To the extent that, following the Closing Date, the
Depositor certifies that reports and certifications differing from those
required under this Section 3.22(b) comply with the reporting requirements under
the Exchange Act, the Trustee and the Servicer hereby agree that they will
reasonably cooperate to amend the provisions of this Section 3.22(b) in order to
comply with such amended reporting requirements and such amendment of this
Section 3.22(b); provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be responsible
for executing any Form 10-K or the Certification. Any such amendment may result
in the reduction of the reports filed by the Depositor under the Exchange Act.

                  SECTION 3.23. Title, Management and Disposition of REO
                                Property.

                  (a) The deed or certificate of sale of any REO Property shall,
subject to applicable laws, be taken in the name of the Trustee, or its nominee,
in trust for the benefit of the Certificateholders. The Servicer, on behalf of
REMIC 1, shall sell any REO Property as soon as practicable and in any event no
later than the end of the third full taxable year after the taxable year in
which such REMIC acquires ownership of such REO Property for purposes of Section
860G(a)(8) of the Code or request from the Internal Revenue Service, no later
than 60 days before the day on which the three-year grace period would otherwise
expire, an extension of such three-year period, unless the Servicer shall have
delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to the Trustee and the
Depositor, to the effect that the holding by the REMIC of such REO Property
subsequent to three years after its acquisition will not result in the
imposition on the REMIC of taxes on "prohibited transactions" thereof, as
defined in Section 860F of the Code, or cause any of the REMICs created
hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC under Federal law at any time that any
Certificates are outstanding. The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and
operate each REO Property for the Certificateholders solely for the purpose of
its prompt disposition and sale in a manner which does not cause such REO
Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or result in the receipt by any of the REMICs
created hereunder of any "income from non-permitted assets" within the meaning
of Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code, or any "net income from foreclosure
property" which is subject to taxation under the REMIC Provisions.

                  (b) The Servicer shall separately account for all funds
collected and received in connection with the operation of any REO Property and
shall establish and maintain, or cause to be established and maintained, with
respect to REO Properties an account held in trust for the



                                       96
<PAGE>



Trustee for the benefit of the Certificateholders (the "REO Account"), which
shall be an Eligible Account. The Servicer shall be permitted to allow the
Collection Account to serve as the REO Account, subject to separate ledgers for
each REO Property. The Servicer shall be entitled to retain or withdraw any
interest income paid on funds deposited in the REO Account.

                  (c) The Servicer shall have full power and authority, subject
only to the specific requirements and prohibitions of this Agreement, to do any
and all things in connection with any REO Property as are consistent with the
manner in which the Servicer manages and operates similar property owned by the
Servicer or any of its Affiliates, all on such terms and for such period
(subject to the requirement of prompt disposition set forth in Section 3.23(a))
as the Servicer deems to be in the best interests of Certificateholders. In
connection therewith, the Servicer shall deposit, or cause to be deposited in
the REO Account, in no event more than two Business Days after the Servicer's
receipt thereof, all revenues received by it with respect to an REO Property and
shall withdraw therefrom funds necessary for the proper operation, management
and maintenance of such REO Property including, without limitation:

                  (i) all insurance premiums due and payable in respect of such
         REO Property;

                  (ii) all real estate taxes and assessments in respect of such
         REO Property that may result in the imposition of a lien thereon; and

                  (iii) all costs and expenses necessary to maintain, operate
         and dispose of such REO Property.

                  To the extent that amounts on deposit in the REO Account with
respect to an REO Property are insufficient for the purposes set forth in
clauses (i) through (iii) above with respect to such REO Property, the Servicer
shall advance from its own funds such amount as is necessary for such purposes
if, but only if, the Servicer would make such advances if the Servicer owned the
REO Property and if in the Servicer's judgment, the payment of such amounts will
be recoverable from the rental or sale of the REO Property.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither the Servicer nor the
Trustee shall:

                  (A) authorize the Trust Fund to enter into, renew or extend
         any New Lease with respect to any REO Property, if the New Lease by its
         terms will give rise to any income that does not constitute Rents from
         Real Property;

                  (B) authorize any amount to be received or accrued under any
         New Lease other than amounts that will constitute Rents from Real
         Property;

                  (C) authorize any construction on any REO Property, other than
         the completion of a building or other improvement thereon, and then
         only if more than ten percent of the construction of such building or
         other improvement was completed before default on the related Mortgage
         Loan became imminent, all within the meaning of Section 856(e)(4)(B) of
         the Code; or

                  (D) authorize any Person to Directly Operate any REO Property
         on any date more than 90 days after its date of acquisition by the
         Trust Fund;



                                       97
<PAGE>



unless, in any such case, the Servicer has obtained an Opinion of Counsel,
provided to the Trustee, to the effect that such action will not cause such REO
Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of
Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code at any time that it is held by the REMIC, in
which case the Servicer may take such actions as are specified in such Opinion
of Counsel.

                  The Servicer may contract with any Independent Contractor for
the operation and management of any REO Property, provided that:

                  (1) the terms and conditions of any such contract shall not be
         inconsistent herewith;

                  (2) any such contract shall require, or shall be administered
         to require, that the Independent Contractor pay all costs and expenses
         incurred in connection with the operation and management of such REO
         Property, including those listed above and remit all related revenues
         (net of such costs and expenses) to the Servicer as soon as
         practicable, but in no event later than thirty days following the
         receipt thereof by such Independent Contractor;

                  (3) none of the provisions of this Section 3.23(c) relating to
         any such contract or to actions taken through any such Independent
         Contractor shall be deemed to relieve the Servicer of any of its duties
         and obligations to the Trustee on behalf of the Certificateholders with
         respect to the operation and management of any such REO Property; and

                  (4) the Servicer shall be obligated with respect thereto to
         the same extent as if it alone were performing all duties and
         obligations in connection with the operation and management of such REO
         Property.

                  The Servicer shall be entitled to enter into any agreement
with any Independent Contractor performing services for it related to its duties
and obligations hereunder for indemnification of the Servicer by such
Independent Contractor, and nothing in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit
or modify such indemnification. The Servicer shall be solely liable for all fees
owed by it to any such Independent Contractor, irrespective of whether the
Servicer's compensation pursuant to Section 3.18 is sufficient to pay such fees;
provided, however, that to the extent that any payments made by such Independent
Contractor would constitute Servicing Advances if made by the Servicer, such
amounts shall be reimbursable as Servicing Advances made by the Servicer.

                  (d) In addition to the withdrawals permitted under Section
3.23(c), the Servicer may from time to time make withdrawals from the REO
Account for any REO Property: (i) to pay itself or any Sub-Servicer unpaid
Servicing Fees in respect of the related Mortgage Loan; and (ii) to reimburse
itself or any Sub-Servicer for unreimbursed Servicing Advances and Advances made
in respect of such REO Property or the related Mortgage Loan. On the Servicer
Remittance Date, the Servicer shall withdraw from each REO Account maintained by
it and deposit into the Distribution Account in accordance with Section
3.10(d)(ii), for distribution on the related Distribution Date in accordance
with Section 4.01, the



                                       98
<PAGE>



income from the related REO Property received during the prior calendar
month, net of any withdrawals made pursuant to Section 3.23(c) or this Section
3.23(d).

                  (e) Subject to the time constraints set forth in Section
3.23(a), each REO Disposition shall be carried out by the Servicer in a manner,
at such price and upon such terms and conditions as shall be normal and usual in
the Servicing Standard.

                  (f) The proceeds from the REO Disposition, net of any amount
required by law to be remitted to the Mortgagor under the related Mortgage Loan
and net of any payment or reimbursement to the Servicer or any Sub-Servicer as
provided above, shall be deposited in the Distribution Account in accordance
with Section 3.10(d)(ii) on the Servicer Remittance Date in the month following
the receipt thereof for distribution on the related Distribution Date in
accordance with Section 4.01. Any REO Disposition shall be for cash only (unless
changes in the REMIC Provisions made subsequent to the Startup Day allow a sale
for other consideration).

                  (g) The Servicer shall file information returns with respect
to the receipt of mortgage interest received in a trade or business, reports of
foreclosures and abandonments of any Mortgaged Property and cancellation of
indebtedness income with respect to any Mortgaged Property as required by the
Code. Such reports shall be in form and substance sufficient to meet the
reporting requirements of the Code.

                  SECTION 3.24. Obligations of the Servicer in Respect of
                                Prepayment Interest Shortfalls.

                  Not later than 1:00 p.m. New York time on each Servicer
Remittance Date, the Servicer shall remit to the Distribution Account an amount
("Compensating Interest") equal to the lesser of (A) the aggregate of the
Prepayment Interest Shortfalls for the related Distribution Date and (B) its
aggregate Servicing Fee received in the related Due Period. The Servicer shall
not have the right to reimbursement for any amounts remitted to the Trustee in
respect of Compensating Interest. Such amounts so remitted shall be included in
the Available Funds and distributed therewith on the next Distribution Date. The
Servicer shall not be obligated to pay Compensating Interest with respect to
Relief Act Interest Shortfalls.

                  SECTION 3.25. [Reserved].

                  SECTION 3.26. Obligations of the Servicer in Respect of
                                Mortgage Rates and Monthly Payments.

                  In the event that a shortfall in any collection on or
liability with respect to the Mortgage Loans in the aggregate results from or is
attributable to adjustments to Mortgage Rates, Monthly Payments or Stated
Principal Balances that were made by the Servicer in a manner not consistent
with the terms of the related Mortgage Note and this Agreement, the Servicer,
upon discovery or receipt of notice thereof, immediately shall deposit in the
Collection Account from its own funds the amount of any such shortfall and shall
indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Depositor and any
successor servicer in respect of any such liability. Such indemnities shall
survive the termination or discharge of this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, this Section 3.26 shall not limit the ability of the Servicer to seek


                                       99

recovery of any such amounts from the related Mortgagor under the terms of the
related Mortgage Note, as permitted by law.

                  SECTION 3.27. [Reserved].

                  SECTION 3.28. [Reserved].

                  SECTION 3.29. Advance Facility.

                  The Servicer is hereby authorized to enter into a financing or
other facility (any such arrangement, an "Advance Facility") under which (1) the
Servicer sells, assigns or pledges to another Person (together with such
Person's successors and assigns, an "Advancing Person") the Servicer's rights
under this Agreement to be reimbursed for any Advances or Servicing Advances
and/or (2) an Advancing Person agrees to fund some or all Advances and/or
Servicing Advances required to be made by the Servicer pursuant to this
Agreement. No consent of the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificateholders or
any other party shall be required before the Servicer may enter into an Advance
Facility. The Servicer shall notify each other party to this Agreement prior to
or promptly after entering into or terminating any Advance Facility.
Notwithstanding the existence of any Advance Facility under which an Advancing
Person agrees to fund Advances and/or Servicing Advances on the Servicer's
behalf, the Servicer shall remain obligated pursuant to this Agreement to make
Advances and Servicing Advances pursuant to and as required by this Agreement.
If the Servicer enters into an Advance Facility, and for so long as an Advancing
Person remains entitled to receive reimbursement for any Advances including
Nonrecoverable Advances ("Advance Reimbursement Amounts") and/or Servicing
Advances including Nonrecoverable Advances ("Servicing Advance Reimbursement
Amounts" and together with Advance Reimbursement Amounts, "Reimbursement
Amounts") (in each case to the extent such type of Reimbursement Amount is
included in the Advance Facility), as applicable, pursuant to this Agreement,
then the Servicer shall identify such Reimbursement Amounts consistent with the
reimbursement rights set forth in Section 3.11(a)(ii), (iii), (vi) and (vii) and
remit such Reimbursement Amounts in accordance with Section 3.10(b) or otherwise
in accordance with the documentation establishing the Advance Facility to such
Advancing Person or to a trustee, agent or custodian (an "Advance Facility
Trustee") designated by such Advancing Person. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if
so required pursuant to the terms of the Advance Facility, the Servicer may
direct, and if so directed the Trustee is hereby authorized to and shall pay to
the Advance Facility Trustee the Reimbursement Amounts identified pursuant to
the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, in no
event shall Advance Reimbursement Amounts or Servicing Advance Reimbursement
Amounts be included in the Available Funds or distributed to Certificateholders.

                  Reimbursement Amounts shall consist solely of amounts in
respect of Advances and/or Servicing Advances made with respect to the Mortgage
Loans for which the Servicer would be permitted to reimburse itself in
accordance with this Agreement, assuming the Servicer or the Advancing Person
had made the related Advance(s) and/or Servicing Advance(s). Notwithstanding the
foregoing, except with respect to reimbursement of Nonrecoverable Advances as
set forth in this Agreement, no Person shall be entitled to reimbursement from
funds held in the Collection Account for future distribution to
Certificateholders pursuant to this Agreement. None of the Depositor or the
Trustee shall have any duty or liability with respect to



                                      100
<PAGE>



the calculation of any Reimbursement Amount, nor shall the Depositor or the
Trustee have any responsibility to track or monitor the administration of the
Advance Facility and the Depositor shall not have any responsibility to track,
monitor or verify the payment of Reimbursement Amounts to the related Advancing
Person or Advance Facility Trustee. The Servicer shall maintain and provide to
any successor servicer and (upon request) the Trustee a detailed accounting on a
loan by loan basis as to amounts advanced by, sold, pledged or assigned to, and
reimbursed to any Advancing Person. The successor servicer shall be entitled to
rely on any such information provided by the predecessor servicer, and the
successor servicer shall not be liable for any errors in such information. Any
successor Servicer shall reimburse the predecessor Servicer and itself for
outstanding Advances and Servicing Advances, respectively, with respect to each
Mortgage Loan on a first in, first out ("FIFO") basis; provided that the
successor Servicer has received prior written notice from the predecessor
Servicer or the Advancing Person of reimbursement amounts owed to the
predecessor Servicer. Liquidation Proceeds with respect to a Mortgage Loan shall
be applied to reimburse Advances outstanding with respect to that Mortgage Loan
before being applied to reimburse Servicing Advances outstanding with respect to
that Mortgage Loan.

                  An Advancing Person who receives an assignment or pledge of
the rights to be reimbursed for Advances and/or Servicing Advances, and/or whose
obligations hereunder are limited to the funding or purchase of Advances and/or
Servicing Advances shall not be required to meet the criteria for qualification
of a subservicer set forth in this Agreement.

                  Upon the direction of and at the expense of the Servicer, the
Trustee agrees to execute such acknowledgments, certificates, and other
documents provided by the Servicer recognizing the interests of any Advance
Facility Trustee in such Reimbursement Amounts as the Servicer may cause to be
made subject to Advance Facilities pursuant to this Section 3.29.

                  The Servicer shall remain entitled to be reimbursed for all
Advances and Servicing Advances funded by the Servicer to the extent the related
rights to be reimbursed therefor have not been sold, assigned or pledged to an
Advancing Person.

                  The Servicer shall indemnify the Depositor, the Trustee, any
successor servicer and the Trust Fund for any loss, liability or damage
resulting from any claim by the related Advancing Person, except to the extent
that such claim, loss, liability or damage resulted from or arose out of
negligence, recklessness or willful misconduct or breach of its duties hereunder
on the part of the Depositor, the Trustee or any successor servicer.

                  Any amendment to this Section 3.29 or to any other provision
of this Agreement that may be necessary or appropriate to effect the terms of an
Advance Facility as described generally in this Section 3.29, including
amendments to add provisions relating to a successor servicer, may be entered
into by the Trustee, the Depositor and the Servicer without the consent of any
Certificateholder, provided such amendment complies with Section 11.01 hereof.
All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees) of each party
hereto of any such amendment shall be borne solely by the Servicer. Prior to
entering into an Advance Facility, the Servicer shall notify the Advancing
Person in writing that: (a) the Advances and/or Servicing Advances purchased,
financed by and/or pledged to the Advancing Person are obligations owed to the
Servicer on a non-recourse basis payable only from the cash flows and proceeds
received



                                      101
<PAGE>



under this Agreement for reimbursement of Advances and/or Servicing Advances
only to the extent provided herein, and the Trustee and the Trust are not
otherwise obligated or liable to repay any Advances and/or Servicing Advances
financed by the Advancing Person and (b) the Trustee shall not have any
responsibility to track or monitor the administration of the Advance Facility
between the Servicer and the Advancing Person.

the related Prepayment Period will be withdrawn from the Distribution Account
and distributed by the Trustee to the Holders of the Class P Certificates and
shall not be available for distribution to the Holders of any other Class of
Certificates. The payment of the foregoing amounts to the Holders of the Class P
Certificates shall not reduce the Certificate Principal Balances thereof.

                  (e) The Trustee shall make distributions in respect of a
Distribution Date to each Certificateholder of record on the related Record Date
(other than as provided in Section 10.01 respecting the final distribution), in
the case of Certificateholders of the Regular Certificates, by check or money
order mailed to such Certificateholder at the address appearing in the
Certificate Register, or by wire transfer if such Certificateholder has provided
to the Trustee wire transfer instructions by five Business Days prior to such
Record Date. Distributions among Certificateholders shall be made in proportion
to the Percentage Interests evidenced by the Certificates held by such
Certificateholders.

                  (f) Each distribution with respect to a Book-Entry Certificate
shall be paid to the Depository, which shall credit the amount of such
distribution to the accounts of its Depository Participants in accordance with
its normal procedures. Each Depository Participant shall be responsible for
disbursing such distribution to the Certificate Owners that it represents and to

                  In the case of information furnished pursuant to subclauses

requirements of the Code as are in force from time to time.

                  (c) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall make

obligation of the Trustee shall be deemed to have been satisfied to the extent
that substantially comparable information shall be prepared and furnished to
Certificateholders by the Trustee pursuant to any requirements of the Code as
from time to time in force.

                  SECTION 4.04. Remittance Reports; Advances.

                  (a) On the second Business Day following each Determination
Date, the Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee by telecopy or electronic mail
(or by such other means as the Servicer and the Trustee may agree from time to
time) a Remittance Report with respect to the related Distribution Date. Not
later than the second Business Day following each Determination Date, the
Servicer shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee in addition to
the information provided in the Remittance Report, such other information
reasonably available to it with respect to the Mortgage Loans as the Trustee may
reasonably require to perform the calculations necessary to make the
distributions contemplated by Section 4.01 and to prepare the statements to
Certificateholders contemplated by Section 4.03. The Trustee shall not be
responsible to recompute, recalculate or verify any information provided to it
by the Servicer.

                  (b) The amount of Advances to be made by the Servicer for any
Distribution Date shall equal, subject to Section 4.04(d), the sum of (i) the
aggregate amount of Monthly Payments (net of the related Servicing Fee), due
during the related Due Period in respect of the Mortgage Loans, which Monthly
Payments were delinquent on a contractual basis as of the Close of Business on
the related Determination Date provided however, that with respect to any
Balloon Mortgage Loan that is delinquent on its maturity date, the Servicer will
not be required



                                      112
<PAGE>



to advance the related Balloon Payment but will be required to continue to make
Advances in accordance with this Section 4.04(b) with respect to such Balloon
Mortgage Loan in an amount equal to an assumed scheduled interest that would
otherwise be due based on the original amortization schedule for that Balloon
Mortgage Loan (with interest at the Mortgage Rate less the Servicing Fee Rate)
and (ii) with respect to each REO Property, which REO Property was acquired
during or prior to the related Due Period and as to which REO Property an REO
Disposition did not occur during the related Due Period, an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the REO Imputed Interest on such REO Property for the most
recently ended calendar month, over the net income from such REO Property
transferred to the Distribution Account pursuant to Section 3.23 for
distribution on such Distribution Date.

                  On or before 1:00 p.m. New York time on the Servicer
Remittance Date, the Servicer shall remit in immediately available funds to the
Trustee for deposit in the Distribution Account an amount equal to the aggregate
amount of Advances, if any, to be made in respect of the Mortgage Loans and REO
Properties for the related Distribution Date either (i) from its own funds or
(ii) from the Collection Account, to the extent of funds held therein for future
distribution (in which case it will cause to be made an appropriate entry in the
records of the Collection Account that amounts held for future distribution have
been, as permitted by this Section 4.04, used by the Servicer in discharge of
any such Advance) or (iii) in the form of any combination of (i) and (ii)
aggregating the total amount of Advances to be made by the Servicer with respect
to the Mortgage Loans and REO Properties. Any amounts held for future
distribution used by the Servicer to make an Advance as permitted in the
preceding sentence shall be appropriately reflected in the Servicer's records
and replaced by the Servicer by deposit in the Collection Account on or before
any future Servicer Remittance Date to the extent that the Available Funds for
the related Distribution Date (determined without regard to Advances to be made
on the Servicer Remittance Date) shall be less than the total amount that would
be distributed to the Classes of Certificateholders pursuant to Section 4.01 on
such Distribution Date if such amounts held for future distributions had not
been so used to make Advances. The Trustee will provide notice to the Servicer
by telecopy by the Close of Business on any Servicer Remittance Date in the
event that the amount remitted by the Servicer to the Trustee on such date is
less than the Advances required to be made by the Servicer for the related
Distribution Date, as set forth in the related Remittance Report.

                  (c) The obligation of the Servicer to make such Advances is
mandatory, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement but subject to
(d) below, and, with respect to any Mortgage Loan, shall continue until the
Mortgage Loan is paid in full or until all Liquidation Proceeds thereon have
been recovered, or a Final Recovery Determination has been made thereon.

                  (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, no
Advance or Servicing Advance shall be required to be made hereunder by the
Servicer if such Advance or Servicing Advance would, if made, constitute a
Nonrecoverable Advance. The determination by the Servicer that it has made a
Nonrecoverable Advance or that any proposed Advance or Servicing Advance, if
made, would constitute a Nonrecoverable Advance, shall be evidenced by an
Officers' Certificate of the Servicer delivered to the Depositor and the
Trustee. Furthermore, the Servicer shall not be required to advance Relief Act
Interest Shortfalls.

                  SECTION 4.05. Pre-Funding Accounts.

                  (a) No later than the Closing Date, the Trustee shall
establish and maintain two segregated trust accounts that are each Eligible

N.A., as trustee for the registered holders of First Franklin Mortgage Loan
Trust 2004-FF11, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2004-FF11" (the "Group I

as trustee for the registered holders of First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust
2004-FF11, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2004-FF11" (the "Group II
Pre-Funding Account"). The Trustee shall, promptly upon receipt, deposit in the
applicable Pre-Funding Account and retain therein the Original Group I

remitted on the Closing Date to the Trustee by the Depositor. Funds deposited in
the Pre-Funding Accounts shall be held in trust by the Trustee for the
Certificateholders for the uses and purposes set forth herein.

                  (b) The Trustee will invest funds deposited in the Pre-Funding
Accounts as directed by the Depositor in Permitted Investments with a maturity
date (i) no later than the Business Day immediately preceding the date on which
such funds are required to be withdrawn from such account pursuant to this
Agreement, if a Person other than the Trustee or an Affiliate manages or advises

Accounts the amount of any net loss incurred in respect of any such Permitted
Investment immediately upon realization of such loss without any right of
reimbursement therefor. At no time will the Pre-Funding Accounts be assets of
any REMIC created hereunder.

                  (c) Amounts on deposit in the Pre-Funding Accounts shall be
withdrawn by the Trustee as follows:

                  (i) On any Subsequent Transfer Date, the Trustee shall
         withdraw from the Group I Pre-Funding Account or the Group II
         Pre-Funding Account, as applicable, an amount equal to 100% of the
         Stated Principal Balances of the Subsequent Group I Mortgage Loans or
         the Subsequent Group II Mortgage Loans, as applicable, transferred and
         assigned to the Trustee for deposit in the Mortgage Pool on such
         Subsequent Transfer Date and pay such amount to or upon the order of
         the Depositor upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section
         2.08 with respect to such transfer and assignment;

                  (ii) If the amount on deposit in the Pre-Funding Accounts
         (exclusive of any investment income therein) has not been reduced to
         zero during the Funding Period, on the day immediately following the
         termination of the Funding Period, the Trustee shall deposit into the
         Distribution Account any amounts remaining in the Pre-Funding Accounts
         (exclusive of any investment income therein) for distribution in
         accordance with the terms hereof;




                                      114
<PAGE>



                  (iii) To withdraw any amount not required to be deposited in
         the Pre-Funding Accounts or deposited therein in error;

                  (iv) To distribute to the Interest Coverage Account any income
         and gain realized from the investment of funds in the Pre-Funding
         Accounts; and

                  (v) To clear and terminate the Pre-Funding Accounts upon the

         with any amounts remaining on deposit therein being paid to the Holders
         of the Certificates then entitled to distributions in respect of
         principal.

                  Withdrawals pursuant to clauses (i), (ii) and (iii) shall be
treated as contributions of cash to REMIC 1 on the date of withdrawal.

                  SECTION 4.06. Interest Coverage Accounts.

                  (a) If amounts are required to be deposited in the Interest
Coverage Accounts, no later than the Closing Date, the Trustee shall establish
and maintain a segregated non-interest bearing trust account that is an Eligible
Account, which shall be titled (i) "Group I Interest Coverage Account, Wells
Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee for the registered holders of "First Franklin
Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-FF11, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2004-FF11" (the
"Group I Interest Coverage Account") and (ii) "Group II Pre-Funding Account,
Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee for the registered holders of "First Franklin
Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-FF11, Asset-Backed Certificates, Series 2004-FF11" (the
"Group II Pre-Funding Account"). The Trustee shall, promptly upon receipt,
deposit in each Interest Coverage Account and retain therein the related
Interest Coverage Amount, remitted on the Closing Date to the Trustee by the
Depositor. Funds deposited in the Interest Coverage Accounts shall be held in
trust by the Trustee for the Certificateholders for the uses and purposes set
forth herein

                  (b) The Trustee shall invest funds deposited in the Interest
Coverage Accounts in Permitted Investments of the kind described in clauses (i),
(v) or (vi) of the definition of Permitted Investments, as specified in a
written direction from the Depositor, with a maturity date no later than the
second Business Day preceding each Distribution Date. For federal income tax
purposes, the holder of the largest Percentage Interest of the Residual
Certificates shall be the owner of the Interest Coverage Accounts and shall
report all items of income, deduction, gain or loss arising therefrom. At no
time shall either Interest Coverage Account be an asset of any Trust REMIC. All
income and gain realized from investment of funds deposited in the Interest
Coverage Accounts shall be for the sole and exclusive benefit of the Depositor
and shall be remitted by the Trustee to the Depositor on the first Business Day
following each Distribution Date. The Depositor shall deposit in the Interest
Coverage Accounts the amount of any net loss incurred in respect of any such
Permitted Investment immediately upon realization of such loss.

                  (c) On each Distribution Date during the Funding Period and on
the last day of the Funding Period, the Trustee shall withdraw from the related
Interest Coverage Account and deposit in the Distribution Account an amount
equal to 30 days' interest on the excess, if any, of the related Original
Pre-Funded Amount, over the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of related
Subsequent Mortgage Loans that both (i) had a Due Date during the Due Period
relating




                                      115
<PAGE>



to such Distribution Date and (ii) had a Subsequent Cut-off Date prior to the
first day of the month in which such Distribution Date occurs, at a per annum
rate equal to the weighted average Pass-Through Rate of the related Offered
Certificates for such Distribution Date, with the Pass-Through Rate on the
related Offered Certificates, solely for the purposes of the foregoing
calculation, multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the actual
number of days in the Accrual Period for such Class for such Distribution Date,
and the denominator of which is 30. Such withdrawal and deposit shall be treated
as a contribution of cash by the Servicer to REMIC I. Immediately following any
such withdrawal and deposit, and immediately following the conveyance of any
Subsequent Mortgage Loans to the Trust on any Subsequent Transfer Date, the
Trustee shall withdraw from the Interest Coverage Accounts and remit to the
Depositor or its designee an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount
remaining in such Interest Coverage Account over the amount that would be
required to be withdrawn therefrom (assuming sufficient funds therein) pursuant
to the second preceding sentence on each subsequent Distribution Date, if any,
that shall occur during the Funding Period or that shall be the last day of the
Funding Period, if no Subsequent Mortgage Loans were acquired by the Trust Fund
after the end of the Prepayment Period relating to the current Distribution Date
(assuming that LIBOR remains constant at the level of LIBOR applicable to the
calculation of the Pass-Through Rate for the Class A Certificates and Mezzanine
Certificates for the current Distribution Date).

                  (d) Upon the earlier of (i) the Distribution Date immediately
following the end of the Funding Period, (ii) the reduction of the aggregate
Certificate Principal Balance of the Class A Certificates and the Mezzanine
Certificates to zero or (iii) the termination of this Agreement in accordance
with Section 10.01, any amount remaining on deposit in the Interest Coverage
Accounts after distributions pursuant to paragraph (c) above shall be withdrawn
by the Trustee and paid to the Depositor or its designee.

                  SECTION 4.07. Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account.

                  No later than the Closing Date, the Trustee shall establish
and maintain with itself a separate, segregated trust account titled, "Net WAC
Rate Carryover Reserve Account, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee, in trust for
registered Holders of First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-FF11, Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2004-FF11." All amounts deposited in the Net WAC Rate
Carryover Reserve Account shall be distributed to the Holders of the Class A
Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates and the Class B Certificates in the
manner set forth in Section 4.01(d).

                  On each Distribution Date as to which there is a Net WAC Rate
Carryover Amount payable to the Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates
or the Class B Certificates, the Trustee has been directed by the Class C
Certificateholders to, and therefore will, deposit into the Net WAC Rate
Carryover Reserve Account the amounts described in Section 4.01(d)(iv), rather
than distributing such amounts to the Class C Certificateholders. In addition,
any payments received by the Trustee under the Cap Contract on each Distribution
Date will be deposited into the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account. On each
such Distribution Date, the Trustee shall hold all such amounts for the benefit
of the Holders of the Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates and the
Class B Certificates, and will distribute such amounts to the Holders of the
Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates and the Class B Certificates in
the amounts and priorities set forth in Section 4.01(d).

                  On each Distribution Date, any amounts remaining in the Net
WAC Rate Reserve Account (representing payments received by the Trustee under
the Cap Contract) after the payment of any Net WAC Rate Carryover Amounts on the
Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates and the Class B Certificates
for such Distribution Date, shall be payable to the Trustee.

                  For federal and state income tax purposes, the Trustee will be
deemed to be the owner of the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account. All
amounts deposited into the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account (other than
amounts received under the Cap Contract) shall be treated as amounts distributed
by REMIC 3 to the Holder of the Class C Interest and by REMIC 4 to the Holder of
the Class C Certificates. The Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account will be an
"outside reserve fund" within the meaning of Treasury regulation Section
1.860G-2(h). Upon the termination of the Trust, or the payment in full of the
Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates and the Class B Certificates,
all amounts remaining on deposit in the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account
will be released by the Trust and distributed to the Trustee or its designee.
The Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account will be part of the Trust but not
part of any REMIC and any payments to the Holders of the Class A Certificates,
the Mezzanine Certificates or the Class B Certificates of Net WAC Rate Carryover
Amounts will not be payments with respect to a "regular interest" in a REMIC
within the meaning of Code Section 860(G)(a)(1).

                  By accepting a Class C Certificate, each Class C
Certificateholder hereby agrees to direct the Trustee, and the Trustee hereby is
directed, to deposit into the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve Account the amounts
described above on each Distribution Date as to which there is any Net WAC Rate
Carryover Amount rather than distributing such amounts to the Class C
Certificateholders. By accepting a Class C Certificate, each Class C
Certificateholder further agrees that such direction is given for good and
valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged by
such acceptance.

                  Amounts on deposit in the Net WAC Rate Carryover Reserve
Account shall remain uninvested.

                  For federal tax return and information reporting, the purchase
price allocated to the Cap Contract in respect of any Net WAC Rate Carryover
Amount may be obtained from the Trustee, upon receipt from the Depositor.

                  SECTION 4.08. Distributions on the REMIC 1 Regular Interests.

                  (a) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall cause in the
following order of priority, the following amounts which shall be deemed to be
distributed by REMIC 1 to REMIC 2 on account of the REMIC 1 Regular Interests or
withdrawn from the Distribution Account and distributed to the holders of the
Class R Certificates (in respect of the Class R-1 Interest), as the case may be:

Charges in respect of the Mortgage Loans received during the related Prepayment
Period will be distributed by REMIC 1 to the Holders of REMIC 1 Regular Interest
LTP. The payment of the foregoing amounts to the Holders of REMIC 1 Regular
Interest LTP shall not reduce the Uncertificated Principal Balance thereof.

                  (b) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall cause in the
following order of priority, the following amounts which shall be deemed to be
distributed by REMIC 2 to REMIC 3 on account of the REMIC 2 Regular Interests or

         proportion as the Overcollateralization Deficiency Amount is allocated

                  and in the same proportion as principal payments are allocated
                  to the Corresponding Certificates, until the Uncertificated
                  Principal Balances of such REMIC 2 Regular Interests are
                  reduced to zero, and second, to the Holders of REMIC 2 Regular
                  Interest LTZZ, until the Uncertificated Principal Balance of

Principal Balance of any Class of Certificates shall be to the Certificate
Principal Balance of such Class immediately prior to the relevant Distribution
Date, before reduction thereof by any Realized Losses, in each case to be
allocated to such Class of Certificates, on such Distribution Date.

                  Any allocation of Realized Losses to a Mezzanine Certificate
on any Distribution Date shall be made by reducing the Certificate Principal
Balance thereof by the amount so allocated; any allocation of Realized Losses to
a Class C Certificates shall be made by reducing the amount otherwise payable in
respect thereof pursuant to Section 4.01(d)(iv). No allocations of any Realized

REMIC 1 Regular Interest LT1 until the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each
such REMIC 1 Regular Interest has been reduced to zero, and all Realized Losses
on the Subsequent Group I Mortgage Loans shall be allocated to REMIC 1 Regular
Interest LT1PF until the Uncertificated Principal Balance thereof has been
reduced to zero. All Realized Losses on the Group II Mortgage Loans shall be

Principal Balance of each such REMIC 1 Regular Interest has been reduced to
zero; provided however, with respect to the first three Distribution Dates, all
Realized Losses on the Initial Group II Mortgage Loans shall be allocated to
REMIC 1 Regular Interest LT2 until the Uncertificated Principal Balance of each

on the Subsequent Group II Mortgage Loans shall be allocated to REMIC 1 Regular
Interest LT2PF until the Uncertificated Principal Balance thereof has been
reduced to zero.

                  (c) All Realized Losses on the Mortgage Loans shall be deemed
to have been allocated in the specified percentages, as follows: first, to

                                THE CERTIFICATES

                  SECTION 5.01. The Certificates.

                  Each of the Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine Certificates,
the Class B Certificates, the Class P Certificates, the Class C Certificates and
the Residual Certificates shall be substantially in the forms annexed hereto as
exhibits, and shall, on original issue, be executed, authenticated and delivered
by the Trustee to or upon the order of the Depositor concurrently with the sale
and assignment to the Trustee of the Trust Fund. The Class A Certificates, the
Mezzanine Certificates and the Class B Certificates shall be initially evidenced
by one or more Certificates representing a Percentage Interest with a minimum
dollar denomination of $25,000 and integral dollar multiples of $1.00 in excess
thereof, except that one Certificate of each such Class of Certificates may be
in a different denomination so that the sum of the denominations of all
outstanding Certificates of such Class shall equal the Certificate Principal
Balance of such Class on the Closing Date. The Class P Certificates, the Class C
Certificates and the Residual Certificates are issuable in any Percentage
Interests; provided, however, that the sum of all such percentages for each such
Class totals 100% and no more than ten Certificates of each Class may be issued
and outstanding at any one time.

                  The Certificates shall be executed on behalf of the Trust by
manual or facsimile signature on behalf of the Trustee by a Responsible Officer.
Certificates bearing the manual or facsimile signatures of individuals who were,
at the time when such signatures were affixed, authorized to sign on behalf of
the Trustee shall bind the Trust, notwithstanding that such individuals or any
of them have ceased to be so authorized prior to the authentication and delivery
of such Certificates or did not hold such offices at the date of such
Certificate. No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit under this
Agreement or be valid for any purpose, unless such Certificate shall have been
manually authenticated by the Trustee substantially in the form provided for
herein, and such authentication upon any Certificate shall be conclusive
evidence, and the only evidence, that such Certificate has been duly
authenticated and delivered hereunder. All Certificates shall be dated the date
of their authentication. Subject to Section 5.02(c), the Class A Certificates
and the Mezzanine Certificates shall be Book-Entry Certificates. The other
Classes of Certificates shall not be Book-Entry Certificates.

                  SECTION 5.02. Registration of Transfer and Exchange of
                                Certificates.

                  (a) The Certificate Registrar shall cause to be kept at the
Corporate Trust Office a Certificate Register in which, subject to such
reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Certificate Registrar shall
provide for the registration of Certificates and of transfers and exchanges of
Certificates as herein provided. The Trustee shall initially serve as
Certificate Registrar for the purpose of registering Certificates and transfers
and exchanges of Certificates as herein provided.

                  Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Certificate
at any office or agency of the Certificate Registrar maintained for such purpose
pursuant to the foregoing paragraph and, in the case of a Residual Certificate,
upon satisfaction of the conditions set forth



                                      123

below, the Trustee on behalf of the Trust shall execute, authenticate and
deliver, in the name of the designated transferee or transferees, one or more
new Certificates of the same aggregate Percentage Interest.

                  At the option of the Certificateholders, Certificates may be
exchanged for other Certificates in authorized denominations and the same
aggregate Percentage Interests, upon surrender of the Certificates to be
exchanged at any such office or agency. Whenever any Certificates are so
surrendered for exchange, the Trustee shall execute on behalf of the Trust and
authenticate and deliver the Certificates which the Certificateholder making the
exchange is entitled to receive. Every Certificate presented or surrendered for
registration of transfer or exchange shall (if so required by the Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar) be duly endorsed by, or be accompanied by a written
instrument of transfer satisfactory to the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar
duly executed by, the Holder thereof or his attorney duly authorized in writing.
In addition, (i) with respect to each Class R Certificate, the holder thereof
may exchange, in the manner described above, such Class R Certificate for three
separate certificates, each representing such holder's respective Percentage
Interest in the Class R-1 Interest, the Class R-2 Interest and the Class R-3
Interest, respectively, in each case that was evidenced by the Class R
Certificate being exchanged and (ii) with respect to each Class R-X Certificate,
the holder thereof may exchange, in the manner described above, such Class R-X
Certificate for two separate certificates, each representing such holder's
respective Percentage Interest in the Class R-4 Interest and the Class R-5
Interest, respectively, in each case that was evidenced by the Class R-X
Certificate being exchanged.

                  (b) Except as provided in paragraph (c) below, the Book-Entry
Certificates shall at all times remain registered in the name of the Depository
or its nominee and at all times: (i) registration of such Certificates may not
be transferred by the Trustee except to another Depository; (ii) the Depository
shall maintain book-entry records with respect to the Certificate Owners and
with respect to ownership and transfers of such Certificates; (iii) ownership
and transfers of registration of such Certificates on the books of the
Depository shall be governed by applicable rules established by the Depository;
(iv) the Depository may collect its usual and customary fees, charges and
expenses from its Depository Participants; (v) the Trustee shall for all
purposes deal with the Depository as representative of the Certificate Owners of
the Certificates for purposes of exercising the rights of Holders under this
Agreement, and requests and directions for and votes of such representative
shall not be deemed to be inconsistent if they are made with respect to
different Certificate Owners; (vi) the Trustee may rely and shall be fully
protected in relying upon information furnished by the Depository with respect
to its Depository Participants and furnished by the Depository Participants with
respect to indirect participating firms and Persons shown on the books of such
indirect participating firms as direct or indirect Certificate Owners; and (vii)
the direct participants of the Depository shall have no rights under this
Agreement under or with respect to any of the Certificates held on their behalf
by the Depository, and the Depository may be treated by the Trustee and its
agents, employees, officers and directors as the absolute owner of the
Certificates for all purposes whatsoever.

                  All transfers by Certificate Owners of Book-Entry Certificates
shall be made in accordance with the procedures established by the Depository
Participant or brokerage firm representing such Certificate Owners. Each
Depository Participant shall only transfer Book-Entry Certificates of
Certificate Owners that it represents or of brokerage firms for which it acts



                                      124
<PAGE>



as agent in accordance with the Depository's normal procedures. The parties
hereto are hereby authorized to execute a Letter of Representations with the
Depository or take such other action as may be necessary or desirable to
register a Book-Entry Certificate to the Depository. In the event of any
conflict between the terms of any such Letter of Representation and this
Agreement, the terms of this Agreement shall control.

                  (c) If (i)(x) the Depository or the Depositor advises the
Trustee in writing that the Depository is no longer willing or able to discharge
properly its responsibilities as Depository and (y) the Trustee or the Depositor
is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) after the occurrence of a
Servicer Event of Termination, the Certificate Owners of the Book-Entry
Certificates representing Percentage Interests of such Classes aggregating not
less than 51% advise the Trustee and Depository through the Financial
Intermediaries and the Depository Participants in writing that the continuation
of a book-entry system through the Depository to the exclusion of issuing
definitive, fully registered certificates (the "Definitive Certificates") to
Certificate Owners is no longer in the best interests of the Certificate Owners,
then upon surrender to the Certificate Registrar of the Book-Entry Certificates
by the Depository, accompanied by registration instructions from the Depository
for registration, the Trustee shall, at the Depositor's expense, in the case of
(i) or (ii) above, or the Servicer's expense, in the case of (iii) above,
execute on behalf of the Trust and authenticate the Definitive Certificates.
Neither the Depositor nor the Trustee shall be liable for any delay in delivery
of such registration instructions and may conclusively rely on, and shall be
protected in relying on, such instructions. Upon the issuance of Definitive
Certificates, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar, the Servicer, any Paying
Agent and the Depositor shall recognize the Holders of the Definitive
Certificates as Certificateholders hereunder.

                  (d) No transfer, sale, pledge or other disposition of any
Class B Certificate, Class C Certificate, Class P Certificate or Residual
Certificate shall be made unless such disposition is exempt from the
registration requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "1933
Act"), and any applicable state securities laws or is made in accordance with
the 1933 Act and such laws. In the event of any such transfer, (other than in
connection with (i) the initial transfer of any such Certificate by the
Depositor to an Affiliate of the Depositor, (ii) the transfer of any such Class
C, Class P or Residual Certificate to the issuer under the Indentue or the
indenture trustee under the Indenture or (iii) a transfer of any such Class C,
Class P ro Residual Certificate from the issuer under the Indenture or the
indenture trustee under the Indenture to the Depositor or an Affiliate of the
Depositor), (i) unless such transfer is made in reliance upon Rule 144A (as
evidenced by an investment letter delivered to the Trustee, in substantially the
form attached hereto as Exhibit J) under the 1933 Act, the Trustee and the
Depositor shall require a written Opinion of Counsel (which may be in-house
counsel) acceptable to and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Depositor, that such transfer may be made pursuant to an
exemption, describing the applicable exemption and the basis therefor, from the
1933 Act or is being made pursuant to the 1933 Act, which Opinion of Counsel
shall not be an expense of the Trustee or the Depositor or (ii) the Trustee
shall require the transferor to execute a transferor certificate (in
substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit L) and the transferee to
execute an investment letter (in substantially the form attached hereto as
Exhibit J) acceptable to and in form and substance reasonably satisfactory to
the Depositor and the Trustee certifying to the Depositor and the Trustee the
facts surrounding such transfer, which investment letter shall not be an expense
of the Trustee or the Depositor.

The Holder of a Class B Certificate, Class C Certificate, Class P Certificate or
Residual Certificate desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby
agree to, indemnify the Trustee and the Depositor against any liability that may
result if the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such
federal and state laws.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event of any such
transfer of any Ownership Interest in any Private Certificate that is a
Book-Entry Certificate, except with respect to the initial transfer of any such
Ownership Interest by the Depositor, such transfer shall be required to be made
in reliance upon Rule 144A under the 1933 Act, and the transferor will be deemed
to have made each of the transferor representations and warranties set forth
Exhibit L hereto in respect of such interest as if it was evidenced by a
Definitive Certificate and the transferee will be deemed to have made each of
the transferee representations and warranties set forth Exhibit J hereto in
respect of such interest as if it was evidenced by a Definitive Certificate. The
Certificate Owner of any such Ownership Interest in any such Book-Entry
Certificate desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to,
indemnify the Trustee and the Depositor against any liability that may result if
the transfer is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and
state laws.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no certification or Opinion of Counsel
described in this Section 5.02(d) will be required in connection with the
transfer, on the Closing Date, of any Residual Certificate by the Depositor to
an "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501 of the 1933 Act.

                  No transfer of a Class B Certificate, Class C Certificate,
Class P Certificate or Residual Certificate or any interest therein shall be
made to any Plan subject to ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code, any Person
acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf of any such Plan or any Person
acquiring such Certificates with "Plan Assets" of a Plan within the meaning of
Department of Labor regulations promulgated at 29 C.F.R. ss. 2510.3-101 ("Plan
Assets"), as certified by such transferee in the form of Exhibit M, unless (i)
in the case of a Class C Certificate, a Class P Certificate or Residual
Certificate, the Depositor, the Trustee and the Servicer are provided with an
Opinion of Counsel which establishes to the satisfaction of the Depositor, the
Trustee and the Servicer that the purchase of such Certificates is permissible
under applicable law, will not constitute or result in any prohibited
transaction under ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code and will not subject the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee or the Trust Fund to any obligation or
liability (including obligations or liabilities under ERISA or Section 4975 of
the Code) in addition to those undertaken in this Agreement, which Opinion of
Counsel shall not be an expense of the Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee or
the Trust Fund or (ii) in the case of a Class B Certificate, (1) it is an
insurance company, (2) the source of funds used to acquire or hold the
certificate or interest therein is an "insurance company general account," as
such term is defined in Prohibited Transaction Class Exemption ("PTCE") 95-60
and (3) the conditions in Sections I and III of PTCE 95-60 have been satisfied.
Neither a certification nor an Opinion of Counsel will be required in connection
with (i) the initial transfer of any such Certificate by the Depositor to an
Affiliate of the Depositor, (ii) the transfer of any such Class C, Class P or
Residual Certificate to the issuer under the Indenture or the indenture trustee
under the Indenture or (iii) a transfer of any such Class C, Class P or Residual
Certificate from the issuer under the Indenture or the indenture trustee under
the Indenture to the Depositor or an Affiliate of the Depositor (in which case,
the Depositor or any Affiliate thereof shall be



                                      126
<PAGE>



deemed to have represented that such Affiliate is not a Plan or a Person
investing Plan Assets) and the Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely
upon a representation (which, upon the request of the Trustee, shall be a
written representation) from the Depositor of the status of such transferee as
an affiliate of the Depositor.

                  Each Transferee of a Mezzanine Certificate will be deemed to
have represented by virtue of its purchase or holding of such Certificate (or
interest therein) that either (a) such Transferee is not a Plan or purchasing
such Certificate with Plan Assets, (b) it has acquired and is holding such
Certificate in reliance on Prohibited Transaction Exemption ("PTE") 90-59, 55
Fed. Reg. 36724 (September 6, 1990), as amended by PTE 2000-58, 65 Fed. Reg.
67765 (November 13, 2000) and PTE 2002-41, 67 Fed. Reg. 54487 (August 22, 2002)
(the "Exemption"), and that it understands that there are certain conditions to
the availability of the Exemption including that such Certificate must be rated,
at the time of purchase, not lower than "BBB-" (or its equivalent) by a Rating
Agency, or (c) the following conditions are satisfied: (i) such Transferee is an
insurance company, (ii) the source of funds used to purchase or hold such
Certificate (or interest therein) is an "insurance company general account" (as
defined in PTCE 95-60, and (iii) the conditions set forth in Sections I and III
of PTCE 95-60 have been satisfied.

                  If any Mezzanine Certificate, Class B Certificate, Class C
Certificate, Class P Certificate or Residual Certificate or any interest therein
is acquired or held in violation of the provisions of the preceding paragraphs,
the next preceding permitted beneficial owner will be treated as the beneficial
owner of that Certificate retroactive to the date of transfer to the purported
beneficial owner. Any purported beneficial owner whose acquisition or holding of
any such Certificate or interest therein was effected in violation of the
provisions of the preceding paragraph shall indemnify and hold harmless the
Depositor, the Servicer, the Trustee and the Trust from and against any and all
liabilities, claims, costs or expenses incurred by those parties as a result of
that acquisition or holding.

                  Each Person who has or who acquires any Ownership Interest in
a Residual Certificate shall be deemed by the acceptance or acquisition of such
Ownership Interest to have agreed to be bound by the following provisions and to
have irrevocably appointed the Depositor or its designee as its attorney-in-fact
to negotiate the terms of any mandatory sale under clause (v) below and to
execute all instruments of transfer and to do all other things necessary in
connection with any such sale, and the rights of each Person acquiring any
Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate are expressly subject to the
following provisions:

                  (i) Each Person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in
         a Residual Certificate shall be a Permitted Transferee and shall
         promptly notify the Trustee of any change or impending change in its
         status as a Permitted Transferee.

                  (ii) No Person shall acquire an Ownership Interest in a
         Residual Certificate unless such Ownership Interest is a PRO RATA
         undivided interest.

                  (iii) In connection with any proposed transfer of any
         Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate, the Trustee shall as a
         condition to registration of the transfer, require delivery to it, in
         form and substance satisfactory to it, of each of the following:




                                      127
<PAGE>


                  (A)      an affidavit in the form of Exhibit K hereto from the
                           proposed transferee to the effect that such
                           transferee is a Permitted Transferee and that it is
                           not acquiring its Ownership Interest in the Residual
                           Certificate that is the subject of the proposed
                           transfer as a nominee, trustee or agent for any
                           Person who is not a Permitted Transferee; and

                  (B)      a covenant of the proposed transferee to the effect
                           that the proposed transferee agrees to be bound by
                           and to abide by the transfer restrictions applicable
                           to the Residual Certificates.

                  (iv) Any attempted or purported transfer of any Ownership
         Interest in a Residual Certificate in violation of the provisions of
         this Section shall be absolutely null and void and shall vest no rights
         in the purported transferee. If any purported transferee shall, in
         violation of the provisions of this Section, become a Holder of a
         Residual Certificate, then the prior Holder of such Residual
         Certificate that is a Permitted Transferee shall, upon discovery that
         the registration of transfer of such Residual Certificate was not in
         fact permitted by this Section, be restored to all rights as Holder
         thereof retroactive to the date of registration of transfer of such
         Residual Certificate. The Trustee shall be under no liability to any
         Person for any registration of transfer of a Residual Certificate that
         is in fact not permitted by this Section or for making any
         distributions due on such Residual Certificate to the Holder thereof or
         taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the
         provisions of this Agreement so long as the Trustee received the
         documents specified in clause (iii). The Trustee shall be entitled to
         recover from any Holder of a Residual Certificate that was in fact not
         a Permitted Transferee at the time such distributions were made all
         distributions made on such Residual Certificate. Any such distributions
         so recovered by the Trustee shall be distributed and delivered by the
         Trustee to the prior Holder of such Residual Certificate that is a
         Permitted Transferee.

                  (v) If any Person other than a Permitted Transferee acquires
         any Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate in violation of the
         restrictions in this Section, then the Trustee shall have the right but
         not the obligation, without notice to the Holder of such Residual
         Certificate or any other Person having an Ownership Interest therein,
         to notify the Depositor to arrange for the sale of such Residual
         Certificate. The proceeds of such sale, net of commissions (which may
         include commissions payable to the Depositor or its affiliates in
         connection with such sale), expenses and taxes due, if any, will be
         remitted by the Trustee to the previous Holder of such Residual
         Certificate that is a Permitted Transferee, except that in the event
         that the Trustee determines that the Holder of such Residual
         Certificate may be liable for any amount due under this Section or any
         other provisions of this Agreement, the Trustee may withhold a
         corresponding amount from such remittance as security for such claim.
         The terms and conditions of any sale under this clause (v) shall be
         determined in the sole discretion of the Trustee and it shall not be
         liable to any Person having an Ownership Interest in a Residual
         Certificate as a result of its exercise of such discretion.

                  (vi) If any Person other than a Permitted Transferee acquires
         any Ownership Interest in a Residual Certificate in violation of the
         restrictions in this Section, then the



                                      128
<PAGE>



         Trustee upon receipt of reasonable compensation will provide to the
         Internal Revenue Service, and to the persons specified in Sections
         860E(e)(3) and (6) of the Code, information needed to compute the tax
         imposed under Section 860E(e)(5) of the Code on transfers of residual
         interests to disqualified organizations.

                  The foregoing provisions of this Section shall cease to apply
to transfers occurring on or after the date on which there shall have been
delivered to the Trustee, in form and substance satisfactory to the Trustee, (i)
written notification from each Rating Agency that the removal of the
restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section will not cause such Rating
Agency to downgrade its rating of the Certificates and (ii) an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that such removal will not cause any REMIC created
hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC.

                  (e) No service charge shall be made for any registration of
transfer or exchange of Certificates of any Class, but the Certificate Registrar
may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or governmental charge
that may be imposed in connection with any transfer or exchange of Certificates.

                  All Certificates surrendered for registration of transfer or
exchange shall be canceled by the Certificate Registrar and disposed of pursuant
to its standard procedures.

                  SECTION 5.03. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen
                                Certificates.

                  If (i) any mutilated Certificate is surrendered to the
Certificate Registrar or the Certificate Registrar receives evidence to its
satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any Certificate and (ii) there
is delivered to the Trustee, the Depositor and the Certificate Registrar such
security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless,
then, in the absence of notice to the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar that
such Certificate has been acquired by a bona fide purchaser, the Trustee shall
execute on behalf of the Trust, authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in
lieu of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new
Certificate of like tenor and Percentage Interest. Upon the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section, the Trustee or the Certificate Registrar may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee and the Certificate Registrar) in
connection therewith. Any duplicate Certificate issued pursuant to this Section,
shall constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the Trust,
as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen or destroyed
Certificate shall be found at any time.

                  SECTION 5.04. Persons Deemed Owners.

                  The Servicer, the Depositor, the Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar, any Paying Agent and any agent of the Servicer, the Depositor, the
Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any Paying Agent may treat the Person,
including a Depository, in whose name any Certificate is registered as the owner
of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to
Section 4.01 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the Servicer,
the Trust, the Trustee nor any agent of any of them shall be affected by notice
to the contrary.

                  SECTION 5.05. Appointment of Paying Agent.

                  (a) The Paying Agent shall make distributions to
Certificateholders from the Distribution Account pursuant to Section 4.01 and
shall report the amounts of such distributions to the Trustee. The duties of the
Paying Agent may include the obligation (i) to withdraw funds from the
Collection Account pursuant to Section 3.11(a) and for the purpose of making the
distributions referred to above and (ii) to distribute statements and provide
information to Certificateholders as required hereunder. The Paying Agent
hereunder shall at all times be an entity duly organized and validly existing
under the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof, authorized
under such laws to exercise corporate trust powers and subject to supervision or
examination by federal or state authorities. The Paying Agent shall initially be
the Trustee. The Trustee may appoint a successor to act as Paying Agent, which
appointment shall be reasonably satisfactory to the Depositor.

                  (b) The Trustee shall cause the Paying Agent (if other than
the Trustee) to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such
Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee that such Paying Agent shall hold all
sums, if any, held by it for payment to the Certificateholders in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid
to such Certificateholders and shall agree that it shall comply with all
requirements of the Code regarding the withholding of payments in respect of
Federal income taxes due from Certificate Owners and otherwise comply with the
provisions of this Agreement applicable to it.

                         THE SERVICER AND THE DEPOSITOR

                  SECTION 6.01. Liability of the Servicer and the Depositor.

                  The Servicer shall be liable in accordance herewith only to
the extent of the obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken by
Servicer herein. The Depositor shall be liable in accordance herewith only to
the extent of the obligations specifically imposed upon and undertaken by the
Depositor.

                  SECTION 6.02. Merger or Consolidation of, or Assumption of the
                                Obligations of, the Servicer or the Depositor.

                  Any entity into which the Servicer or Depositor may be merged
or consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer or the Depositor shall be a party, or any
corporation succeeding to the business of the Servicer or the Depositor, shall
be the successor of the Servicer or the Depositor, as the case may be,
hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding; provided, however, that the successor Servicer shall satisfy
all the requirements of Section 7.02 with respect to the qualifications of a
successor Servicer.

                  SECTION 6.03. Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and
                                Others.

                  Neither the Servicer nor the Depositor nor any of the
directors or officers or employees or agents of the Servicer or the Depositor
shall be under any liability to the Trust or the Certificateholders for any
action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action by the Servicer or
the Depositor in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in
judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer,
the Depositor or any such Person against any liability which would otherwise be
imposed by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the
performance of duties of the Servicer or the Depositor, as the case may be, or
by reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties as Servicer or
Depositor, as the case may be, hereunder. The Servicer and any director or
officer or employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on any
document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person
respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Servicer and the Depositor, and
any director or officer or employee or agent of the Servicer or the Depositor,
shall be indemnified by the Trust and held harmless against any loss, liability
or expense incurred in connection with (i) any legal action relating to this
Agreement or the Certificates, other than any loss, liability or expense
incurred by reason of its willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence or by
reason of its reckless disregard of its obligations and duties hereunder or by
reason of its failure to perform its obligations or duties hereunder and (ii)
any breach of a representation or warranty regarding the Mortgage Loans. The
Servicer or the Depositor may undertake any such action which it may deem
necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement, and the rights and duties
of the parties hereto and the interests of the Certificateholders hereunder. In
such event, unless the Depositor or the Servicer acts without the consent of the
Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 51% of the Voting Rights, the




                                      131
<PAGE>



reasonable legal expenses and costs of such action and any liability resulting
therefrom shall be expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust and the Servicer
shall be entitled to be reimbursed therefor from the Collection Account as and
to the extent provided in Section 3.11, any such right of reimbursement being
prior to the rights of the Certificateholders to receive any amount in the
Collection Account. The Servicer's right to indemnity or reimbursement pursuant
to this Section shall survive any resignation or termination of the Servicer
pursuant to Section 6.04 or 7.01 with respect to any losses, expenses, costs or
liabilities arising prior to such resignation or termination (or arising from
events that occurred prior to such resignation or termination). This paragraph
shall apply to the Servicer solely in its capacity as Servicer hereunder and in
no other capacities.

                  SECTION 6.04. Servicer Not to Resign.

                  The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties
hereby imposed on it except upon determination that its duties hereunder are no
longer permissible under applicable law. Any such determination pursuant to the
preceding sentence permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced
by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect obtained at the expense of the Servicer
and delivered to the Trustee. No resignation of the Servicer shall become
effective until the Trustee or a successor servicer shall have assumed the
Servicer's responsibilities, duties, liabilities (other than those liabilities
arising prior to the assumption of servicing duties by the Trustee or the
appointment of such successor) and obligations under this Agreement. Any such
resignation shall not relieve the Servicer of responsibility for any of the
obligations specified in Sections 7.01 and 7.02 as obligations that survive the
resignation or receipt of notice of termination of the Servicer

                  Except as expressly provided in this Agreement, the Servicer
shall not assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or privileges hereunder
to any other Person, or delegate to or subcontract with, or authorize or appoint
any other Person to perform any of the duties, covenants or obligations to be
performed by the Servicer hereunder. The foregoing prohibition on assignment
shall not prohibit the Servicer from designating a Sub-Servicer as payee of any
indemnification amount payable to the Servicer hereunder; provided, however, no
Sub-Servicer shall be a third-party beneficiary hereunder and the parties hereto
shall not be required to recognize any Subservicer as an indemnitee under this
Agreement.

                  SECTION 6.05. Delegation of Duties.

                  In the ordinary course of business, the Servicer at any time
may delegate any of its duties hereunder to any Person, including any of its
Affiliates, who agrees to conduct such duties in accordance with standards
comparable to those set forth in Section 3.01. Such delegation shall not relieve
the Servicer of its liabilities and responsibilities with respect to such duties
and shall not constitute a resignation within the meaning of Section 6.04.
Except as provided in Section 3.02, no such delegation is permitted that results
in the delegee subservicing any Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall provide the
Trustee with 60 days prior written notice prior to the delegation of any of its
duties to any Person other than any of the Servicer's Affiliates or their
respective successors and assigns.

                  SECTION 6.06. [Reserved].

                  Inspection.

                  The Servicer, in its capacity as Servicer, shall afford the
Trustee, upon reasonable notice, during normal business hours, access to all
records maintained by the Servicer in respect of its rights and obligations
hereunder and access to officers of the Servicer responsible for such
obligations.

                                     DEFAULT

                  SECTION 7.01. Servicer Events of Termination.

                  (a) If any one of the following events ("Servicer Events of
Termination") shall occur and be continuing:

                  (i) (A) The failure by the Servicer to make any Advance; or
         (B) any other failure by the Servicer to deposit in the Collection
         Account or the Distribution Account any deposit required to be made
         under the terms of this Agreement which continues unremedied for a
         period of one Business Day after the date upon which written notice of
         such failure shall have been given to the Servicer by the Trustee or to
         the Servicer and the Trustee by any Holders of a Regular Certificate
         evidencing at least 25% of the Voting Rights; or

                  (ii) The failure by the Servicer to make any required
         Servicing Advance which failure continues unremedied for a period of 30
         days, or the failure by the Servicer duly to observe or perform, in any
         material respect, any other covenants, obligations or agreements of the
         Servicer as set forth in this Agreement, which failure continues
         unremedied for a period of 30 days (or if such failure or breach cannot
         be remedied within 30 days, then such remedy shall have been commenced
         within 30 days and diligently pursued thereafter; provided, however,
         that in no event shall such failure or breach be allowed to exist for a
         period of greater than 90 days), after the date (A) on which written
         notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall have
         been given to the Servicer by the Trustee or to the Trustee by any
         Holders of a Regular Certificate evidencing at least 25% of the Voting
         Rights or (B) of actual knowledge of such failure by a Servicing
         Officer of the Servicer; or

                  (iii) The entry against the Servicer of a decree or order by a
         court or agency or supervisory authority having jurisdiction in the
         premises for the appointment of a trustee, conservator, receiver or
         liquidator in any insolvency, conservatorship, receivership,
         readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar
         proceedings, or for the winding up or liquidation of its affairs, and
         the continuance of any such decree or order unstayed and in effect for
         a period of 60 days; or

                  (iv) The Servicer shall voluntarily go into liquidation,
         consent to the appointment of a conservator or receiver or liquidator
         or similar person in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, marshalling
         of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to the
         Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property;
         or a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory authority
         having jurisdiction in the premises for the appointment of a
         conservator, receiver, liquidator or similar person in any insolvency,
         readjustment of debt, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar
         proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall
         have been entered against the Servicer and such decree or order shall
         have remained in force undischarged, unbonded or unstayed for a period
         of 60 days; or the Servicer shall



                                      134
<PAGE>



         admit in writing its inability to pay its debts generally as they
         become due, file a petition to take advantage of any applicable
         insolvency or reorganization statute, make an assignment for the
         benefit of its creditors or voluntarily suspend payment of its
         obligations;

                  (b) then, and in each and every such case, so long as a
Servicer Event of Termination shall not have been remedied within the applicable
grace period, (x) with respect solely to clause (i)(A) above, if such Advance is
not made by 11:00 A.M., New York time, on the Business Day immediately following
the Servicer Remittance Date (provided the Trustee shall give the Servicer, and
the Servicer shall have received, notice of such failure to advance by 5:00 P.M.
New York time on the Servicer Remittance Date), the Trustee shall terminate all
of the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement and the
Trustee, or a successor servicer appointed in accordance with Section 7.02,
shall immediately make such Advance and assume, pursuant to Section 7.02, the
duties of a successor Servicer and (y) in the case of (i)(B), (ii), (iii) and
(iv) above, the Trustee shall, at the direction of the Holders of each Class of
Regular Certificates evidencing Percentage Interests aggregating not less than
51%, by notice then given in writing to the Servicer (and to the Trustee if
given by Holders of Certificates), terminate all of the rights and obligations
of the Servicer as servicer under this Agreement. Any such notice to the
Servicer shall also be given to each Rating Agency, the Depositor and the
Servicer. On or after the receipt by the Servicer (and by the Trustee if such
notice is given by the Holders) of such written notice, all authority and power
of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Certificates
or the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the Trustee
pursuant to and under this Section; and, without limitation, and the Trustee is
hereby authorized and empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Servicer, as attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other
instruments, and to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to
complete the transfer and endorsement of each Mortgage Loan and related
documents or otherwise. The Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Trustee (or
the applicable successor Servicer) in effecting the termination of the
responsibilities and rights of the Servicer hereunder, including, without
limitation, the delivery to the Trustee of all documents and records requested
by it to enable it to assume the Servicer's functions under this Agreement
within ten Business Days subsequent to such notice, the transfer within one
Business Day subsequent to such notice to the Trustee (or the applicable
successor Servicer) for the administration by it of all cash amounts that shall
at the time be held by the Servicer and to be deposited by it in the Collection
Account, the Distribution Account, any REO Account or any Servicing Account or
that have been deposited by the Servicer in such accounts or thereafter received
by the Servicer with respect to the Mortgage Loans or any REO Property received
by the Servicer. All reasonable costs and expenses (including attorneys' fees)
incurred in connection with transferring the Mortgage Files to the successor
Servicer and amending this Agreement to reflect such succession as Servicer
pursuant to this Section shall be paid by the predecessor Servicer (or if the
predecessor Servicer is the Trustee, the initial Servicer) upon presentation of
reasonable documentation of such costs and expenses and to the extent not paid
by the Servicer, by the Trust.

                  Notwithstanding the termination of the Servicer hereunder, the
Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of all unpaid Servicing Fees and all
unreimbursed Advances and Servicing Advances in the manner and at the times set
forth herein.

                  SECTION 7.02. Trustee to Act; Appointment of Successor.

                  (a) From the time the Servicer (and the Trustee, if notice is
sent by the Holders) receives a notice of termination pursuant to Section 7.01
or 6.04, the Trustee (or such other successor Servicer as is approved in
accordance with this Agreement) shall be the successor in all respects to the
Servicer in its capacity as servicer under this Agreement and the transactions
set forth or provided for herein and shall be subject to all the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto placed on the Servicer
by the terms and provisions hereof arising on and after its succession.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the parties hereto agree that the Trustee, in its
capacity as successor Servicer, immediately will assume all of the obligations
of the Servicer to make advances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee, in
its capacity as successor Servicer, shall not be responsible for the lack of
information and/or documents that it cannot obtain through reasonable efforts.
It is understood and agreed by the parties hereto that there will be a period of
transition (not to exceed 90 days) before the transition of servicing
obligations is fully effective. As compensation therefor, the Trustee (or such
other successor Servicer) shall be entitled to such compensation as the Servicer
would have been entitled to hereunder if no such notice of termination had been
given. Notwithstanding the above, (i) if the Trustee is unwilling to act as
successor Servicer or (ii) if the Trustee is legally unable so to act, the
Trustee shall appoint or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to appoint,
any established housing and home finance institution, bank or other mortgage
loan or home equity loan servicer having a net worth of not less than
$50,000,000 as the successor to the Servicer hereunder in the assumption of all
or any part of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities of the Servicer
hereunder; provided, that the appointment of any such successor Servicer will
not result in the qualification, reduction or withdrawal of the ratings assigned
to the Certificates by the Rating Agencies as evidenced by a letter to such
effect from the Rating Agencies. Pending appointment of a successor to the
Servicer hereunder, unless the Trustee is prohibited by law from so acting, the
Trustee shall act in such capacity as hereinabove provided. In connection with
such appointment and assumption, the successor shall be entitled to receive
compensation out of payments on Mortgage Loans in an amount equal to the
compensation which the Servicer would otherwise have received pursuant to
Section 3.18 (or such other compensation as the Trustee and such successor shall
agree, not to exceed the Servicing Fee). The appointment of a successor Servicer
shall not affect any liability of the predecessor Servicer which may have arisen
under this Agreement prior to its termination as Servicer to pay any deductible
under an insurance policy pursuant to Section 3.14 or to reimburse the Trustee
pursuant to Section 3.06), nor shall any successor Servicer be liable for any
acts or omissions of the predecessor Servicer or for any breach by such Servicer
of any of its representations or warranties contained herein or in any related
document or agreement. The Trustee and such successor shall take such action,
consistent with this Agreement, as shall be necessary to effectuate any such
succession. All reasonable Servicing Transfer Costs shall be paid by the
predecessor Servicer upon presentation of reasonable documentation of such
costs, and if such predecessor Servicer defaults in its obligation to pay such
costs, such costs shall be paid by the successor Servicer or the Trustee (in
which case the successor Servicer or the Trustee, as applicable, shall be
entitled to reimbursement therefor from the assets of the Trust).

                  (b) Any successor to the Servicer, including the Trustee,
shall during the term of its service as servicer continue to service and
administer the Mortgage Loans for the benefit of Certificateholders, and
maintain in force a policy or policies of insurance covering errors and



                                      136
<PAGE>



omissions in the performance of its obligations as Servicer hereunder and a
fidelity bond in respect of its officers, employees and agents to the same
extent as the Servicer is so required pursuant to Section 3.14.

                  SECTION 7.03. Waiver of Defaults.

                  The Majority Certificateholders may, on behalf of all
Certificateholders, waive any events permitting removal of the Servicer as
servicer pursuant to this Article VII, provided, however, that the Majority
Certificateholders may not waive a default in making a required distribution on
a Certificate without the consent of the Holder of such Certificate. Upon any
waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist and any Servicer
Event of Termination arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for
every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or impair any right consequent thereto except to the extent
expressly so waived. Notice of any such waiver shall be given by the Trustee to
the Rating Agencies.

                  SECTION 7.04. Notification to Certificateholders.

                  (a) Upon any termination or appointment of a successor to the
Servicer pursuant to this Article VII or Section 6.04, the Trustee shall give
prompt written notice thereof to the Certificateholders at their respective
addresses appearing in the Certificate Register and each Rating Agency.

                  (b) No later than 60 days after the occurrence of any event
which constitutes or which, with notice or lapse of time or both, would
constitute a Servicer Event of Termination or within five Business Days after a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee becomes aware of the occurrence of such an
event, the Trustee shall transmit by mail to all Certificateholders notice of
such occurrence unless such default or Servicer Event of Termination shall have
been waived or cured.

                  SECTION 7.05. Survivability of Servicer Liabilities.

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, upon
termination of the Servicer hereunder, any liabilities of the Servicer which
accrued prior to such termination shall survive such termination.

                                   THE TRUSTEE

                  SECTION 8.01. Duties of Trustee.

                  The Trustee, prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
Termination and after the curing of all Servicer Events of Termination which may
have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement. If a Servicer Event of Termination has
occurred (which has not been cured) of which a Responsible Officer has
knowledge, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it
by this Agreement, and use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise,
as a prudent man would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of
his own affairs.

                  The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they
conform to the requirements of this Agreement; provided, however, that the
Trustee will not be responsible for the accuracy or content of any such
resolutions, certificates, statements, opinions, reports, documents or other
instruments. If any such instrument is found not to conform to the requirements
of this Agreement in a material manner the Trustee shall take such action as it
deems appropriate to have the instrument corrected, and if the instrument is not
corrected to the Trustee's satisfaction, the Trustee will provide notice thereof
to the Certificateholders.

                  No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve
the Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent
failure to act or its own misconduct; provided, however, that:

                  (i) prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
         Termination, and after the curing of all such Servicer Events of
         Termination which may have occurred, the duties and obligations of the
         Trustee shall be determined solely by the express provisions of this
         Agreement, the Trustee shall not be liable except for the performance
         of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in this
         Agreement, no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
         Agreement against the Trustee and, in the absence of bad faith on the
         part of the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely, as to the truth
         of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed
         therein, upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and
         conforming to the requirements of this Agreement;

                  (ii) the Trustee shall not be personally liable for an error
         of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer of the Trustee,
         unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in
         ascertaining or investigating the facts related thereto;

                  (iii) the Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect
         to any action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good
         faith in accordance with the direction of the Majority
         Certificateholders relating to the time, method and place of conducting
         any



                                      138
<PAGE>



         proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising or
         omitting to exercise any trust or power conferred upon the Trustee,
         under this Agreement; and

                  (iv) the Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of any
         failure by the Servicer to comply with the obligations of the Servicer
         referred to in clauses (i) through (v) of Section 7.01(a) unless a
         Responsible Officer of the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office
         obtains actual knowledge of such failure or the Trustee receives
         written notice of such failure from the Servicer or the Majority
         Certificateholders.

                  The Trustee shall not be required to expend or risk its own
funds or otherwise incur financial liability in the performance of any of its
duties hereunder, or in the exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there is
reasonable ground for believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate
indemnity against such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it, and
none of the provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event require
the Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance of, any
of the obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement, except during such
time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor to, and be vested with the
rights, duties, powers and privileges of, the Servicer in accordance with the
terms of this Agreement.

                  SECTION 8.02. Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

                  (a) Except as otherwise provided in Section 8.01:

                  (i) the Trustee may request and rely upon, and shall be
         protected in acting or refraining from acting upon, any resolution,
         Officers' Certificate, certificate of auditors or any other
         certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request,
         consent, order, appraisal, bond or other paper or document reasonably
         believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by
         the proper party or parties, and the manner of obtaining consents and
         of evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by
         Certificateholders shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as
         the Trustee may prescribe;

                  (ii) the Trustee may consult with counsel and any advice or
         Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization and
         protection in respect of any action taken or suffered or omitted by it
         hereunder in good faith and in accordance with such Opinion of Counsel;

                  (iii) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any
         of the rights or powers vested in it by this Agreement, or to
         institute, conduct or defend any litigation hereunder or in relation
         hereto, at the request, order or direction of any of the
         Certificateholders, pursuant to the provisions of this Agreement,
         unless such Certificateholders shall have offered to the Trustee
         reasonable security or indemnity against the costs, expenses and
         liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby; the right of the
         Trustee to perform any discretionary act enumerated in this Agreement
         shall not be construed as a duty, and the Trustee shall not be
         answerable for other than its negligence or willful misconduct in the
         performance of any such act;




                                      139
<PAGE>


                  (iv) the Trustee shall not be personally liable for any action
         taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and believed by it to be
         authorized or within the discretion or rights or powers conferred upon
         it by this Agreement;

                  (v) prior to the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Termination
         and after the curing of all Servicer Events of Termination which may
         have occurred, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation
         into the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate,
         statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, consent,
         order, approval, bond or other paper or documents, unless requested in
         writing to do so by the Majority Certificateholders; provided, however,
         that if the payment within a reasonable time to the Trustee of the
         costs, expenses or liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the
         making of such investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not
         reasonably assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the
         terms of this Agreement, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity
         against such cost, expense or liability as a condition to such
         proceeding. Nothing in this clause (v) shall derogate from the
         obligation of the Servicer to observe any applicable law prohibiting
         disclosure of information regarding the Mortgagors;

                  (vi) the Trustee shall not be accountable, shall have no
         liability and makes no representation as to any acts or omissions
         hereunder of the Servicer until such time as the Trustee may be
         required to act as Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02 and thereupon only
         for the acts or omissions of the Trustee as successor Servicer;

                  (vii) the Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
         hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or
         through agents or attorneys or a custodian; and

                  (viii) the right of the Trustee to perform any discretionary
         act enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty, and
         the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its negligence or
         willful misconduct in the performance of such act.

                  (b) The Depositor hereby directs the Trustee to execute,
deliver and perform its obligations under the Cap Contract on the Closing Date
and thereafter on behalf of the Holders of the Class A Certificates, the
Mezzanine Certificates and the Class B Certificates. The Seller, the Depositor,
the Servicer and the Holders of the Class A Certificates, the Mezzanine
Certificates and the Class B Certificates by their acceptance of such
Certificates acknowledge and agree that the Trustee shall execute, deliver and
perform its obligations under the Cap Contract and shall do so solely in its
capacity as Trustee of the Trust Fund and not in its individual capacity.

                  SECTION 8.03. Trustee Not Liable for Certificates or Mortgage
                                Loans.

                  The recitals contained herein and in the Certificates (other
than the authentication of the Trustee on the Certificates) shall be taken as
the statements of the Depositor, and the Trustee assumes no responsibility for
the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no representations as to the
validity or sufficiency of this Agreement or of the Certificates (other than the
signature and authentication of the Trustee on the Certificates) or of any
Mortgage Loan



                                      140

or related document. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or
application by the Servicer, or for the use or application of any funds paid to
the Servicer in respect of the Mortgage Loans or deposited in or withdrawn from
the Collection Account by the Servicer. The Trustee shall at no time have any
responsibility or liability for or with respect to the legality, validity and
enforceability of any Mortgage or any Mortgage Loan, or the perfection and
priority of any Mortgage or the maintenance of any such perfection and priority,
or for or with respect to the sufficiency of the Trust or its ability to
generate the payments to be distributed to Certificateholders under this
Agreement, including, without limitation: the existence, condition and ownership
of any Mortgaged Property; the existence and enforceability of any hazard
insurance thereon (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the
Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02); the validity of the assignment of any
Mortgage Loan to the Trustee or of any intervening assignment; the completeness
of any Mortgage Loan; the performance or enforcement of any Mortgage Loan (other
than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section
7.02); the compliance by the Depositor, the Seller or the Servicer with any
warranty or representation made under this Agreement or in any related document
or the accuracy of any such warranty or representation prior to the Trustee's
receipt of notice or other discovery of any non-compliance therewith or any
breach thereof; any investment of monies by or at the direction of the Servicer
or any loss resulting therefrom, it being understood that the Trustee shall
remain responsible for any Trust property that it may hold in its individual
capacity; the acts or omissions of any of the Servicer (other than if the
Trustee shall assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02), any
Sub-Servicer or any Mortgagor; any action of the Servicer (other than if the
Trustee shall assume the duties of the Servicer pursuant to Section 7.02), or
any Sub- Servicer taken in the name of the Trustee; the failure of the Servicer
or any Sub-Servicer to act or perform any duties required of it as agent of the
Trustee hereunder; or any action by the Trustee taken at the instruction of the
Servicer (other than if the Trustee shall assume the duties of the Servicer
pursuant to Section 7.02); provided, however, that the foregoing shall not
relieve the Trustee of its obligation to perform its duties under this
Agreement, including, without limitation, the Trustee's duty to review the
Mortgage Files pursuant to Section 2.01. The Trustee shall have no
responsibility for filing any financing or continuation statement in any public
office at any time or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any
security interest or lien granted to it hereunder (unless the Trustee shall have
become the successor Servicer).

                  SECTION 8.04. Trustee May Own Certificates.

                  The Trustee in its individual or any other capacity may become
the owner or pledgee of Certificates with the same rights as it would have if it
were not Trustee and may transact any banking and trust business with the
Originator, the Servicer, the Depositor or their Affiliates.

                  SECTION 8.05. Trustee Fee and Expenses.

                  (a) The Trustee shall withdraw from the Distribution Account
on each Distribution Date and pay to itself the Trustee Fee. The Trustee, or any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Trustee, shall be indemnified by
REMIC 1 and held harmless against any loss, liability or expense (not including
expenses and disbursements incurred or made by the Trustee, including the
compensation and the expenses and disbursements of its agents and



                                      141

counsel, in the ordinary course of the Trustee's performance in accordance with
the provisions of this Agreement) incurred by the Trustee arising out of or in
connection with the acceptance or administration of its obligations and duties
under this Agreement, other than any loss, liability or expense (i) resulting
from the Servicer's actions or omissions in connection with this Agreement and
the Mortgage Loans for which the Trustee is indemnified under Section 8.05(b),
(ii) that constitutes a specific liability of the Trustee under this Agreement
or (iii) any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason of willful
misfeasance, bad faith or negligence of the Trustee in the performance of its
duties hereunder or by reason of the Trustee's reckless disregard of its
obligations and duties hereunder or as a result of a breach of the Trustee's
obligations under Article X hereof. Any amounts payable to the Trustee, or any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Trustee, in respect of the
indemnification provided by this Section 8.05(a), or pursuant to any other right
of reimbursement from the Trust Fund that the Trustee, or any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Trustee, may have hereunder in its capacity as such,
may be withdrawn by the Trustee from the Distribution Account at any time.

                  (b) The Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trustee or any
director, officer, employee or agent of the Trustee from, and hold it harmless
against, any loss, liability or expense resulting from a breach of the
Servicer's obligations and duties under this Agreement. Such indemnity shall
survive the termination or discharge of this Agreement and the resignation or
removal of the Trustee or the Servicer for actions prior to such resignation or
removal. Any payment hereunder made by the Servicer to the Trustee shall be from
the Servicer's own funds, without reimbursement from the Trust Fund therefor.

                  SECTION 8.06. Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.

                  The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be an entity duly
organized and validly existing under the laws of the United States of America or
any state thereof, authorized under such laws to exercise corporate trust
powers, having a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 and
subject to supervision or examination by federal or state authority. If such
entity publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant to law or to
the requirements of any aforesaid supervising or examining authority, then for
the purposes of this Section 8.06, the combined capital and surplus of such
entity shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as set forth in
its most recent report of condition so published. The principal office of the
Trustee (other than the initial Trustee) shall be in a state with respect to
which an Opinion of Counsel has been delivered to such Trustee at the time such
Trustee is appointed Trustee to the effect that the Trust will not be a taxable
entity under the laws of such state. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease
to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this Section 8.06, the
Trustee shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in
Section 8.07.

                  SECTION 8.07. Resignation or Removal of Trustee.

                  The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the
trusts hereby created by giving written notice thereof to the Depositor, the
Servicer and each Rating Agency. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the
Depositor shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by written instrument, in
duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the resigning
Trustee and one copy to the successor Trustee. If no successor Trustee shall
have been so appointed and have accepted appointment within 30 days after the
giving of such notice



                                      142
<PAGE>



of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor Trustee.

                  If at any time the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 8.06 and shall fail to resign after
written request therefor by the Depositor, or if at any time the Trustee shall
be legally unable to act, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a
receiver of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public
officer shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or
affairs for the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, then the
Depositor or the Servicer may remove the Trustee. If the Depositor or the
Servicer removes the Trustee under the authority of the immediately preceding
sentence, the Depositor shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee by written
instrument, in duplicate, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the
Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee.

                  The Majority Certificateholders may at any time remove the
Trustee by written instrument or instruments delivered to the Servicer, the
Depositor and the Trustee; the Depositor shall thereupon use its best efforts to
appoint a successor trustee in accordance with this Section.

                  Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor Trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 8.07 shall
not become effective until acceptance of appointment by the successor Trustee as
provided in Section 8.08.

                  SECTION 8.08. Successor Trustee.

                  Any successor Trustee appointed as provided in Section 8.07
shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Depositor, the Servicer and to its
predecessor Trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and
thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor Trustee shall become
effective, and such successor Trustee, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally
named as Trustee. The Depositor, the Servicer and the predecessor Trustee shall
execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may reasonably
be required for fully and certainly vesting and confirming in the successor
Trustee all such rights, powers, duties and obligations.

                  No successor Trustee shall accept appointment as provided in
this Section 8.08 unless at the time of such acceptance such successor Trustee
shall be eligible under the provisions of Section 8.06 and the appointment of
such successor Trustee shall not result in a downgrading of the Regular
Certificates by either Rating Agency, as evidenced by a letter from each Rating
Agency.

                  Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor Trustee as
provided in this Section 8.08, the successor Trustee shall mail notice of the
appointment of a successor Trustee hereunder to all Holders of Certificates at
their addresses as shown in the Certificate Register and to each Rating Agency.

                  SECTION 8.09. Merger or Consolidation of Trustee.

                  Any entity into which the Trustee may be merged or converted
or with which it may be consolidated, or any entity resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Trustee shall be a party, or any entity
succeeding to the business of the Trustee, shall be the successor of the Trustee
hereunder, provided such entity shall be eligible under the provisions of
Section 8.06 and 8.08, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding.

                  SECTION 8.10. Appointment of Co-Trustee or Separate Trustee.

                  Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, at any
time, for the purpose of meeting any legal requirements of any jurisdiction in
which any part of the Trust or any Mortgaged Property may at the time be
located, the Servicer and the Trustee acting jointly shall have the power and
shall execute and deliver all instruments to appoint one or more Persons
approved by the Trustee to act as co-trustee or co-trustees, jointly with the
Trustee, or separate trustee or separate trustees, of all or any part of the
Trust, and to vest in such Person or Persons, in such capacity and for the
benefit of the Certificateholders, such title to the Trust, or any part thereof,
and, subject to the other provisions of this Section 8.10, such powers, duties,
obligations, rights and trusts as the Servicer and the Trustee may consider
necessary or desirable. Any such co-trustee or separate trustee shall be subject
to the written approval of the Servicer. If the Servicer shall not have joined
in such appointment within 15 days after the receipt by it of a request so to
do, or in the case a Servicer Event of Termination shall have occurred and be
continuing, the Trustee alone shall have the power to make such appointment. No
co-trustee or separate trustee hereunder shall be required to meet the terms of
eligibility as a successor trustee under Section 8.06, and no notice to
Certificateholders of the appointment of any co-trustee or separate trustee
shall be required under Section 8.08. The Servicer shall be responsible for the
fees of any co-trustee or separate trustee appointed hereunder.

                  Every separate trustee and co-trustee shall, to the extent
permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following provisions and
conditions:

                  (i) all rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
         imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and
         exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee or
         co-trustee jointly (it being understood that such separate trustee or
         co-trustee is not authorized to act separately without the Trustee
         joining in such act), except to the extent that under any law of any
         jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be performed
         (whether as Trustee hereunder or as successor to the Servicer
         hereunder), the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
         such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
         obligations (including the holding of title to the Trust or any portion
         thereof in any such jurisdiction) shall be exercised and performed
         singly by such separate trustee or co-trustee, but solely at the
         direction of the Trustee;

                  (ii) no trustee hereunder shall be held personally liable by
         reason of any act or omission of any other trustee hereunder; and




                                      144
<PAGE>


                  (iii) the Servicer and the Trustee, acting jointly, may at any
         time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee or
         co-trustee except that following the occurrence of a Servicer Event of
         Termination, the Trustee acting alone may accept the resignation or
         remove any separate trustee or co-trustee.

                  Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee
shall be deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and
co-trustees, as effectively as if given to each of them. Every instrument
appointing any separate trustee or co-trustee shall refer to this Agreement and
the conditions of this Article VIII. Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon
its acceptance of the trusts conferred, shall be vested with the estates or
property specified in its instrument of appointment, either jointly with the
Trustee or separately, as may be provided therein, subject to all the provisions
of this Agreement, specifically including every provision of this Agreement
relating to the conduct of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection
to, the Trustee. Every such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee and a
copy thereof given to the Depositor and the Servicer.

                  Any separate trustee or co-trustee may, at any time,
constitute the Trustee, its agent or attorney-in-fact, with full power and
authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in
respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. If any separate trustee
or co-trustee shall die, become incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all
of its estates, properties, rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be
exercised by the Trustee, to the extent permitted by law, without the
appointment of a new or successor Trustee.

                  SECTION 8.11. Limitation of Liability.

                  The Certificates are executed by the Trustee, not in its
individual capacity but solely as Trustee of the Trust, in the exercise of the
powers and authority conferred upon and vested in it by the Trust Agreement.
Each of the undertakings and agreements made on the part of the Trustee in the
Certificates is made and intended not as a personal undertaking or agreement by
the Trustee but is made and intended for the purpose of binding only the Trust.

                  SECTION 8.12. Trustee May Enforce Claims Without Possession of
                                Certificates.

                  (a) All rights of action and claims under this Agreement or
the Certificates may be prosecuted and enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Certificates or the production thereof in any
proceeding relating thereto, and such proceeding instituted by the Trustee shall
be brought in its own name or in its capacity as Trustee for the benefit of all
Holders of such Certificates, subject to the provisions of this Agreement. Any
recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the reasonable
compensation, expenses, disbursement and advances of the Trustee, its agents and
counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the Certificateholders in respect of
which such judgment has been recovered.

                  (b) The Trustee shall afford the Seller, the Depositor, the
Servicer and each Certificateholder upon reasonable notice during normal
business hours, access to all records maintained by the Trustee in respect of
its duties hereunder and access to officers of the Trustee responsible for
performing such duties. Upon request, the Trustee shall furnish the Depositor,
the



                                      145
<PAGE>



Servicer and any requesting Certificateholder with its most recent financial
statements. The Trustee shall cooperate fully with the Seller, the Servicer, the
Depositor and such Certificateholder and shall make available to the Seller, the
Servicer, the Depositor and such Certificateholder for review and copying such
books, documents or records as may be requested with respect to the Trustee's
duties hereunder. The Seller, the Depositor, the Servicer and the
Certificateholders shall not have any responsibility or liability for any action
or failure to act by the Trustee and are not obligated to supervise the
performance of the Trustee under this Agreement or otherwise.

                  SECTION 8.13. Suits for Enforcement.

                  In case a Servicer Event of Termination or other default by
the Servicer or the Depositor hereunder shall occur and be continuing, the
Trustee shall, at the direction of the Majority Certificateholders, or otherwise
may, proceed to protect and enforce its rights and the rights of the
Certificateholders under this Agreement by a suit, action or proceeding in
equity or at law or otherwise, whether for the specific performance of any
covenant or agreement contained in this Agreement or in aid of the execution of
any power granted in this Agreement or for the enforcement of any other legal,
equitable or other remedy, as the Trustee, being advised by counsel, and subject
to the foregoing, shall deem most effectual to protect and enforce any of the
rights of the Trustee and the Certificateholders.

                  SECTION 8.14. Waiver of Bond Requirement.

                  The Trustee shall be relieved of, and each Certificateholder
hereby waives, any requirement of any jurisdiction in which the Trust, or any
part thereof, may be located that the Trustee post a bond or other surety with
any court, agency or body whatsoever.

                  SECTION 8.15. Waiver of Inventory, Accounting and Appraisal
                                Requirement.

                  The Trustee shall be relieved of, and each Certificateholder
hereby waives, any requirement of any jurisdiction in which the Trust, or any
part thereof, may be located that the Trustee file any inventory, accounting or
appraisal of the Trust with any court, agency or body at any time or in any
manner whatsoever.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                              REMIC ADMINISTRATION

                  SECTION 9.01. REMIC Administration.

                  (a) REMIC elections as set forth in the Preliminary Statement
shall be made by the Trustee on Form 1066 or other appropriate federal tax or
information return for the taxable year ending on the last day of the calendar
year in which the Certificates are issued. The regular interests and residual
interest in each REMIC shall be as designated in the Preliminary Statement.

                  (b) The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day"
of each REMIC within the meaning of section 860G(a)(9) of the Code.

                  (c) The Servicer shall pay any and all tax-related expenses
(not including taxes) of each REMIC, including but not limited to any
professional fees or expenses related to audits or any administrative or
judicial proceedings with respect to each REMIC that involve the Internal
Revenue Service or state tax authorities, but only to the extent that (i) such
expenses are ordinary or routine expenses, including expenses of a routine audit
but not expenses of litigation (except as described in (ii)); or (ii) such
expenses or liabilities (including taxes and penalties) are attributable to the
negligence or willful misconduct of the Servicer in fulfilling its duties
hereunder. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement of expenses to the
extent provided in clause (i) above from the Collection Account.

                  (d) The Trustee shall prepare, sign and file, all of the
REMICs' federal and state tax and information returns (including Form 8811) as
the direct representative of each REMIC created hereunder. The expenses of
preparing and filing such returns shall be borne by the Trustee.

                  (e) The Holder of the Class R Certificate at any time holding
the largest Percentage Interest thereof shall be the "tax matters person" as
defined in the REMIC Provisions (the "Tax Matters Person") with respect to REMIC
1, REMIC 2 and REMIC 3 and shall act as the Tax Matters Person for REMIC 1,
REMIC 2 and REMIC 3. The Holder of the Class R-X Certificate at any time holding
the largest Percentage Interest thereof shall be the Tax Matters Person with
respect to REMIC 4 and REMIC 5 and shall act as the Tax Matters Person for REMIC
4 and REMIC 5. The Trustee, as agent for the Tax Matters Person, shall perform
on behalf of each REMIC all reporting and other tax compliance duties that are
the responsibility of such REMIC under the Code, the REMIC Provisions or other
compliance guidance issued by the Internal Revenue Service or any state or local
taxing authority. Among its other duties, if required by the Code, the REMIC
Provisions, or other such guidance, the Trustee, as agent for the Tax Matters
Person, shall provide (i) to the Treasury or other governmental authority such
information as is necessary for the application of any tax relating to the
transfer of a Residual Certificate to any disqualified person or organization
and (ii) to the Certificateholders such information or reports as are required
by the Code or REMIC Provisions. The Trustee, as agent for the Tax Matters
Person, shall represent each REMIC in any administrative or judicial proceedings
relating to an examination or audit by any governmental taxing authority,
request an



                                      147
<PAGE>



administrative adjustment as to any taxable year of any REMIC, enter into
settlement agreements with any government taxing agency, extend any statute of
limitations relating to any item of any REMIC and otherwise act on behalf of any
REMIC in relation to any tax matter involving the Trust.

                  (f) The Trustee, the Servicer and the Holders of Certificates
shall take any action or cause the REMIC to take any action necessary to create
or maintain the status of each REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC Provisions and
shall assist each other as necessary to create or maintain such status. Neither
the Trustee, the Servicer nor the Holder of any Residual Certificate shall take
any action, cause any REMIC created hereunder to take any action or fail to take
(or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the REMIC Provisions, if
taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the status of such
REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon such REMIC
(including but not limited to the tax on prohibited transactions as defined in
Code Section 860F(a)(2) and the tax on prohibited contributions set forth on
Section 860G(d) of the Code) (either such event, an "Adverse REMIC Event")
unless the Trustee and the Servicer have received an Opinion of Counsel (at the
expense of the party seeking to take such action) to the effect that the
contemplated action will not endanger such status or result in the imposition of
such a tax. In addition, prior to taking any action with respect to any REMIC
created hereunder or the assets therein, or causing such REMIC to take any
action, which is not expressly permitted under the terms of this Agreement, any
Holder of a Residual Certificate will consult with the Trustee and the Servicer,
or their respective designees, in writing, with respect to whether such action
could cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur with respect to any REMIC, and no
such Person shall take any such action or cause any REMIC to take any such
action as to which the Trustee or the Servicer has advised it in writing that an
Adverse REMIC Event could occur.

                  (g) Each Holder of a Residual Certificate shall pay when due
any and all taxes imposed on each REMIC created hereunder by federal or state
governmental authorities. To the extent that such Trust taxes are not paid by a
Residual Certificateholder, the Trustee shall pay any remaining REMIC taxes out
of current or future amounts otherwise distributable to the Holder of the
Residual Certificate in the REMICs or, if no such amounts are available, out of
other amounts held in the Distribution Account, and shall reduce amounts
otherwise payable to Holders of regular interests in the related REMIC. Subject
to the foregoing, in the event that a REMIC incurs a state or local tax,
including franchise taxes, as a result of a determination that such REMIC is
domiciled in the State of California for state tax purposes by virtue of the
location of the Servicer, the Servicer agrees to pay on behalf of such REMIC
when due, any and all state and local taxes imposed as a result of such a
determination, in the event that the Holder of the related Residual Certificate
fails to pay such taxes, if any, when imposed.

                  (h) The Trustee, as agent for the Tax Matters Person, shall,
for federal income tax purposes, maintain books and records with respect to each
REMIC created hereunder on a calendar year and on an accrual basis.

                  (i) No additional contributions of assets shall be made to any
REMIC created hereunder, except as expressly provided in this Agreement with
respect to eligible substitute mortgage loans.




                                      148
<PAGE>


                  (j) Neither the Trustee nor the Servicer shall enter into any
arrangement by which any REMIC created hereunder will receive a fee or other
compensation for services.

                  (k) [Reserved].

                  (l) The Trustee will apply for an Employee Identification
Number from the Internal Revenue Service via a Form SS-4 or other acceptable
method for all tax entities and shall complete Form 8811.

                  SECTION 9.02. Prohibited Transactions and Activities.

                  Neither the Depositor, the Servicer nor the Trustee shall
sell, dispose of, or substitute for any of the Mortgage Loans, except in a
disposition pursuant to (i) the foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan, (ii) the
bankruptcy of the Trust Fund, (iii) the termination of any REMIC created
hereunder pursuant to Article X of this Agreement, (iv) a substitution pursuant
to Article II of this Agreement or (v) a repurchase of Mortgage Loans pursuant
to Article II of this Agreement, nor acquire any assets for any REMIC, nor sell
or dispose of any investments in the Distribution Account for gain, nor accept
any contributions to either REMIC after the Closing Date, unless it has received
an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party causing such sale,
disposition, or substitution) that such disposition, acquisition, substitution,
or acceptance will not (a) affect adversely the status of any REMIC created
hereunder as a REMIC or of the interests therein other than the Residual
Certificates as the regular interests therein, (b) affect the distribution of
interest or principal on the Certificates, (c) result in the encumbrance of the
assets transferred or assigned to the Trust Fund (except pursuant to the
provisions of this Agreement) or (d) cause any REMIC created hereunder to be
subject to a tax on prohibited transactions or prohibited contributions pursuant
to the REMIC Provisions.

                  SECTION 9.03. Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes
                                and Loss of REMIC Status.

                  (a) In the event that any REMIC fails to qualify as a REMIC,
loses its status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result
of a prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC
Provisions due to the negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties and
obligations set forth herein, the Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee and the
Trust Fund against any and all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses
("Losses") resulting from such negligence; provided, however, that the Servicer
shall not be liable for any such Losses attributable to the action or inaction
of the Trustee, the Depositor or the Holder of the Residual Certificate, as
applicable, nor for any such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by
any such Person on which the Servicer has relied. The foregoing shall not be
deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Holder of such

Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no event shall the Servicer have any
liability (1) for any action or omission that is taken in accordance with and in
compliance with the express terms of, or which is expressly permitted by the

negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set forth
herein, and (3) for any special or consequential damages to Certificateholders
(in addition to payment of principal and interest on the Certificates).

                  (b) In the event that any REMIC fails to qualify as a REMIC,
loses its status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result
of a prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC
Provisions due to the negligent performance by the Trustee of its duties and
obligations set forth herein, the Trustee shall indemnify the Servicer and the
Trust Fund against any and all Losses resulting from such negligence; provided,
however, that the Trustee shall not be liable for any such Losses attributable
to the action or inaction of the Servicer, the Depositor or the Holder of the
Residual Certificate, as applicable, nor for any such Losses resulting from

                                   TERMINATION

                  SECTION 10.01. Termination.

                  (a) The respective obligations and responsibilities of the
Servicer, the Depositor and the Trustee created hereby (other than the
obligation of the Trustee to make certain payments to Certificateholders after
the final Distribution Date and the obligation of the Servicer to send certain
notices as hereinafter set forth) shall terminate upon notice to the Trustee
upon the earliest of (i) the Distribution Date on which the Certificate
Principal Balances of the Regular Certificates have been reduced to zero, (ii)
the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan in the Trust,
(iii) the optional purchase by the Terminator (as defined below) of the Mortgage
Loans as described below and (iv) the Distribution Date in January 2035.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the trust created hereby
continue beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor
of the descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late ambassador of the United
States to the Court of St. James's, living on the date hereof.

                  The majority Holder of the Class C Certificates (unless such
Holder is the Seller, Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc. or an Affiliate of either
of them), or if such Holder (x) fails to exercise such option or (y) is the
Seller, Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc. or an Affiliate of either of them, the
Servicer (with the written consent of the Depositor or an Affiliate thereof,
such consent not to be unreasonably withheld) (either such Holder or the
Servicer, as applicable, the "Terminator"), may, at its option, terminate this
Agreement on any date on which the aggregate of the Stated Principal Balances of
the Mortgage Loans (after giving effect to scheduled payments of principal due
during the related Due Period, to the extent received or advanced, and
unscheduled collections of principal received during the related Prepayment
Period) on such date is equal to or less than 10% of the sum of (i) the
aggregate Stated Principal Balances of the Initial Mortgage Loans on the Cut-off
Date and (ii) the Original Pre-Funded Amounts, by purchasing, on the next
succeeding Distribution Date, all of the outstanding Mortgage Loans and REO
Properties at a price equal to the greater of (i) the Stated Principal Balance
of the Mortgage Loans and the appraised value of any REO Properties, such
appraisal to be conducted by an Independent appraiser mutually agreed upon by
the Terminator and the Trustee in their reasonable discretion and (ii) the fair
market value of the Mortgage Loans and the REO Properties (as determined by the
Terminator and, to the extent that the Class A Certificates, a Class of
Mezzanine Certificates or the Class B Certificates will not receive all amounts
owed to it as a result of the termination, the Trustee, as of the close of
business on the third Business Day next preceding the date upon which notice of
any such termination is furnished to the related Certificateholders pursuant to
Section 10.01(c)), in each case plus accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the
weighted average of the Mortgage Rates through the end of the Due Period
preceding the final Distribution Date plus unreimbursed Servicing Advances,
Advances, any unpaid Servicing Fees allocable to such Mortgage Loans and REO
Properties and any accrued and unpaid Net WAC Rate Carryover Amount (the
"Termination Price"); provided, however, such option may only be exercised if
the Termination Price is sufficient to pay all interest accrued on, as well as
amounts necessary to retire the note balance of, each class of notes issued




                                      151
<PAGE>



pursuant to an indenture, secured, at least in part, by the Class C
Certificates, the Class P Certificates and/or the Residual Certificates.

                  In connection with any such purchase pursuant to the preceding
paragraph, the Terminator shall deposit in the Distribution Account all amounts
then on deposit in the Collection Account, which deposit shall be deemed to have
occurred immediately preceding such purchase.

                  Any such purchase shall be accomplished by deposit into the
Distribution Account on the Determination Date before such Distribution Date of
the Termination Price.

                  (b) Notice of any termination, specifying the Distribution
Date (which shall be a date that would otherwise be a Distribution Date) upon
which the Certificateholders may surrender their Certificates to the Trustee for
payment of the final distribution and cancellation, shall be given promptly by
the Trustee upon the Trustee receiving notice of such date from the Terminator,
by letter to the Certificateholders mailed not earlier than the 15th day and not
later than the 25th day of the month next preceding the month of such final
distribution specifying (1) the Distribution Date upon which final distribution
of the Certificates will be made upon presentation and surrender of such
Certificates at the office or agency of the Trustee therein designated, (2) the
amount of any such final distribution and (3) that the Record Date otherwise
applicable to such Distribution Date is not applicable, distributions being made
only upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office or agency
of the Trustee therein specified.

                  (c) Upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates, the
Trustee shall cause to be distributed to the Holders of the Certificates on the
Distribution Date for such final distribution, in proportion to the Percentage
Interests of their respective Class and to the extent that funds are available
for such purpose, an amount equal to the amount required to be distributed to
such Holders in accordance with the provisions of Section 4.01 for such
Distribution Date. By acceptance of the Residual Certificates, the Holders of
the Residual Certificates agree, in connection with any termination hereunder,
to assign and transfer any amounts in excess of the par value of the Mortgage
Loans, and to the extent received in respect of such termination, to pay any
such amounts to the Holders of the Class C Certificates.

                  (d) In the event that all Certificateholders shall not
surrender their Certificates for final payment and cancellation on or before
such final Distribution Date, the Trustee shall promptly following such date
cause all funds in the Distribution Account not distributed in final
distribution to Certificateholders to be withdrawn therefrom and credited to the
remaining Certificateholders by depositing such funds in a separate Servicing
Account for the benefit of such Certificateholders, and the Servicer (if the
Servicer has exercised its right to purchase the Mortgage Loans) or the Trustee
(in any other case) shall give a second written notice to the remaining
Certificateholders, to surrender their Certificates for cancellation and receive
the final distribution with respect thereto. If within nine months after the
second notice all the Certificates shall not have been surrendered for
cancellation, the Residual Certificateholders shall be entitled to all unclaimed
funds and other assets which remain subject hereto, and the Trustee upon
transfer of such funds shall be discharged of any responsibility for such funds,
and the Certificateholders shall look to the Residual Certificateholders for
payment.

                  SECTION 10.02. Additional Termination Requirements.

                  (a) In the event that the Terminator exercises its purchase
option as provided in Section 10.01, each REMIC shall be terminated in
accordance with the following additional requirements, unless the Trustee shall
have been furnished with an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that the failure of
the Trust to comply with the requirements of this Section will not (i) result in
the imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" of the Trust as defined in
Section 860F of the Code or (ii) cause any REMIC constituting part of the Trust
Fund to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are
outstanding:

                  (i) Within 90 days prior to the final Distribution Date, the
         Terminator shall adopt and the Trustee shall sign a plan of complete
         liquidation of each REMIC created hereunder meeting the requirements of
         a "Qualified Liquidation" under Section 860F of the Code and any
         regulations thereunder; and

                  (ii) At or after the time of adoption of such a plan of
         complete liquidation and at or prior to the final Distribution Date,
         the Trustee shall sell all of the assets of the Trust Fund to the
         Terminator for cash pursuant to the terms of the plan of complete
         liquidation.

                  (b) By their acceptance of Certificates, the Holders thereof
hereby agree to appoint the Trustee as their attorney in fact to: (i) adopt such
a plan of complete liquidation (and the Certificateholders hereby appoint the
Trustee as their attorney in fact to sign such plan) as appropriate and (ii) to
take such other action in connection therewith as may be reasonably required to
carry out such plan of complete liquidation all in accordance with the terms
hereof.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                  SECTION 11.01. Amendment.

                  This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the
Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee; and without the consent of the
Certificateholders (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to correct or supplement any
provisions herein which may be defective or inconsistent with any other
provisions herein, (iii) to amend the provisions of Section 3.22(b) or (iv) to
make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under
this Agreement which shall not be inconsistent with the provisions of this
Agreement; provided that such action shall not, as evidenced by either (a) an
Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Trustee or (b) written notice to the
Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee from each Rating Agency that such action
will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any outstanding
Class of Certificates with respect to which it is a Rating Agency, adversely
affect in any material respect the interests of any Certificateholder. No
amendment shall be deemed to adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of any Certificateholder who shall have consented thereto, and no
Opinion of Counsel or Rating Agency confirmation shall be required to address
the effect of any such amendment on any such consenting Certificateholder.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, neither an Opinion of Counsel nor written notice
to the Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee from the Rating Agencies will be
required in connection with an amendment to the provisions of Section 3.22(b).

                  In addition, this Agreement may be amended from time to time
by the Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Majority
Certificateholders for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in
any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of this Agreement or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders of Certificates; provided,
however, that no such amendment or waiver shall (x) reduce in any manner the
amount of, or delay the timing of, payments on the Certificates or distributions
which are required to be made on any Certificate without the consent of the
Holder of such Certificate, (y) adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of the Holders of any Class of Certificates (as evidenced by either
(i) an Opinion of Counsel delivered to the Trustee or (ii) written notice to the
Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee from each Rating Agency that such action
will not result in the reduction or withdrawal of the rating of any outstanding
Class of Certificates with respect to which it is a Rating Agency) in a manner
other than as described in clause (x) above, without the consent of the Holders
of Certificates of such Class evidencing at least a 66% Percentage Interest in
such Class, or (z) reduce the percentage of Voting Rights required by clause (y)
above without the consent of the Holders of all Certificates of such Class then
outstanding. Upon approval of an amendment, a copy of such amendment shall be
sent to the Rating Agencies.

                  Notwithstanding any provision of this Agreement to the
contrary, the Trustee shall not consent to any amendment to this Agreement
unless it shall have first received an Opinion of Counsel, delivered by (and at
the expense of) the Person seeking such Amendment, to the effect that such
amendment will not result in the imposition of a tax on any REMIC created
hereunder constituting part of the Trust Fund pursuant to the REMIC Provisions
or cause any REMIC created hereunder constituting part of the Trust to fail to
qualify as a REMIC at any



                                      154
<PAGE>



time that any Certificates are outstanding, and that the amendment is being made
in accordance with the terms hereof.

                  Promptly after the execution of any such amendment the Trustee
shall furnish, at the expense of the Person that requested the amendment if such
Person is the Servicer (but in no event at the expense of the Trustee),
otherwise at the expense of the Trust, a copy of such amendment and the Opinion
of Counsel referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph to the Servicer
and each Rating Agency.

                  It shall not be necessary for the consent of
Certificateholders under this Section 11.01 to approve the particular form of
any proposed amendment; instead it shall be sufficient if such consent shall
approve the substance thereof. The manner of obtaining such consents and of
evidencing the authorization of the execution thereof by Certificateholders
shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as the Trustee may prescribe.

                  The Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, enter into any
amendment pursuant to this Section 11.01 that affects its rights, duties and
immunities under this Agreement or otherwise.

                  SECTION 11.02. Recordation of Agreement; Counterparts.

                  To the extent permitted by applicable law, this Agreement is
subject to recordation in all appropriate public offices for real property
records in all the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which any or
all of the properties subject to the Mortgages are situated, and in any other
appropriate public recording office or elsewhere, such recordation to be
effected by the Servicer at the expense of the Trust, but only upon direction of
Certificateholders accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such
recordation materially and beneficially affects the interests of the
Certificateholders.

                  For the purpose of facilitating the recordation of this
Agreement as herein provided and for other purposes, this Agreement may be
executed simultaneously in any number of counterparts, each of which
counterparts shall be deemed to be an original, and such counterparts shall
together constitute but one and the same instrument.

                  SECTION 11.03. Limitation on Rights of Certificateholders.

                  The death or incapacity of any Certificateholder shall not (i)
operate to terminate this Agreement or the Trust, (ii) entitle such
Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or to
take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of the
Trust, or (iii) otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the
parties hereto or any of them.

                  Except as expressly provided for herein, no Certificateholder
shall have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the operation
and management of the Trust, or the obligations of the parties hereto, nor shall
anything herein set forth or contained in the terms of the Certificates be
construed so as to constitute the Certificateholders from time to time as
partners or members of an association; nor shall any Certificateholder be under
any liability to



                                      155
<PAGE>



any third person by reason of any action taken by the parties to this Agreement
pursuant to any provision hereof.

                  No Certificateholder shall have any right by virtue of any
provision of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in
equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, unless such
Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee a written notice of default
and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless also the
Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the Voting Rights shall have
made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or
proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the
Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses
and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee for 15 days
after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall have
neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding. It is
understood and intended, and expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with
every other Certificateholder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of
Certificates shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of any
provision of this Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice the rights of the
Holders of any other of such Certificates, or to obtain or seek to obtain
priority over or preference to any other such Holder, which priority or
preference is not otherwise provided for herein, or to enforce any right under
this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal, ratable
and common benefit of all Certificateholders. For the protection and enforcement
of the provisions of this Section 11.03 each and every Certificateholder and the
Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as can be given either at law or in
equity.

                  SECTION 11.04. Governing Law; Jurisdiction.

                  This Agreement shall be construed in accordance with the laws
of the State of New York, and the obligations, rights and remedies of the
parties hereunder shall be determined in accordance with such laws. With respect
to any claim arising out of this Agreement, each party irrevocably submits to
the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York and the United
States District Court located in the Borough of Manhattan in The City of New
York, and each party irrevocably waives any objection which it may have at any
time to the laying of venue of any suit, action or proceeding arising out of or
relating hereto brought in any such courts, irrevocably waives any claim that
any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any such court has been brought
in any inconvenient forum and further irrevocably waives the right to object,
with respect to such claim, suit, action or proceeding brought in any such
court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party, provided that
service of process has been made by any lawful means.

                  SECTION 11.05. Notices.

SECTION 11.11.    Acts of Certificateholders.

                  (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken
by the Certificateholders may be embodied in and evidenced by one or more
instruments of substantially similar tenor signed by such Certificateholders in
person or by an agent duly appointed in writing, and such action shall become
effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and
the Servicer. Such instrument or instruments (and the action embodied therein
and evidenced thereby) are herein sometimes referred to as the "act" of the
Certificateholders signing such instrument or instruments. Proof of execution of
any such instrument or of a writing appointing any such agent shall be
sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement and conclusive in favor of the
Trustee and the Trust, if made in the manner provided in this Section 11.11.

notary public or other officer authorized by law to take acknowledgments of
deeds, certifying that the individual signing such instrument or writing
acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Whenever such execution is by a
signer acting in a capacity other than his or her individual capacity, such
certificate or affidavit shall also constitute sufficient proof of his
authority.

                  (c) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice,
consent, waiver or other action by any Certificateholder shall bind every future
Holder of such Certificate and the Holder of every Certificate issued upon the
registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof, in
respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or the

                           Asset-Backed Certificates,

designated as First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-FF11, Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2004-FF11 (herein collectively called the "Certificates"),
and representing a beneficial ownership interest in the Trust created by the
Agreement.

         The Certificateholder, by its acceptance of this Certificate, agrees
that it will look solely to the funds on deposit in the Distribution Account for
payment hereunder and that the Trustee is not liable to the Certificateholders
for any amount payable under this Certificate or the Agreement or, except as
expressly provided in the Agreement, subject to any liability under the
Agreement.

         This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Agreement and
reference is made to the Agreement for the interests, rights and limitations of
rights, benefits, obligations and duties evidenced thereby, and the rights,
duties and immunities of the Trustee.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, then the
Business Day immediately following such Distribution Date (the "Distribution
Date"), commencing on the first Distribution Date specified on the face hereof,
to the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered at the close of
business on the applicable Record Date in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate and the amount required to be
distributed to Holders of Certificates of the Class to which this Certificate
belongs on such Distribution Date pursuant to the Agreement.

         Distributions on this Certificate shall be made by check or money order
mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears on the
Certificate Register or by wire transfer or otherwise, as set forth in the
Agreement. The final distribution on each Certificate will be made in like
manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee specified in the notice to
Certificateholders of such final distribution.

         The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Trustee and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time
by the Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee and of Holders of the requisite
percentage of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected by
such amendment, as specified in the Agreement. Any such consent by the Holder of
this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate
Register of the Certificate Registrar upon surrender of this Certificate for
registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the holder hereof or such
holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations and evidencing the
same aggregate Percentage Interest in the Trust will be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees.

         The Certificates are issuable only as registered Certificates without
coupons in denominations specified in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Certificates are
exchangeable for new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations
and evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee and any agent of the
Depositor, the Servicer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Trustee, the Servicer or any such agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

         On any Distribution Date following the date at which the remaining
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of the
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date
and the Original Pre-Funded Amounts, the Terminator may purchase, in whole, from
the Trust the Mortgage Loans at a purchase price determined as provided in the
Agreement. In the event that no such optional termination occurs, the
obligations and responsibilities created by the Agreement will terminate upon
notice to the Trustee upon the earliest of (i) the Distribution Date on which
the Certificate Principal Balances of the Regular Certificates have been reduced
to zero, (ii) the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan
in the Trust, (iii) the Distribution Date in December 2034.

         Capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Agreement shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be
deemed inconsistent with that meaning.

         the Certificates of the above-referenced Class with respect to the

                 FINANCIAL ASSET SECURITIES CORP., as Depositor

         Principal in respect of this Certificate is distributable monthly as
set forth herein. Accordingly, the Certificate Principal Balance of this Class
B-1 Certificate at any time may be less than the Initial Certificate Principal
Balance set forth on the face hereof, as described herein. This Class B-1
Certificate does not evidence an obligation of, or an interest in, and is not
guaranteed by the Depositor, the Servicer, or the Trustee referred to below or
any of their respective affiliates.

         This certifies that Cede & Co. is the registered owner of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by this Class B-1 Certificate (obtained by
dividing the Denomination of this Class B-1 Certificate by the Original Class
Certificate Principal Balance) in certain monthly distributions with respect to
a Trust consisting primarily of the Mortgage Loans deposited by Financial Asset
Securities Corp. (the "Depositor"). The Trust was created pursuant to a Pooling
and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 1, 2004 (the "Agreement") among the
Depositor, National City Home Loan Services, Inc., as servicer (the "Servicer"),
and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking association, as trustee (the

issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and conditions of the
Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Class B-1 Certificate by virtue
of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder is bound.

         No transfer of a Certificate of this Class shall be made unless such
transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
and any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from the registration
requirements under said Act and such laws. In the event that a transfer is to be
made in reliance upon an exemption from the Act and such laws, in order to
assure compliance with the Act and such laws, the Certificateholder desiring to
effect such transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee shall
each certify to the Trustee and the Depositor in writing the facts surrounding
the transfer. In the event that such a transfer is not to be made pursuant to
Rule 144A of the Act, there shall be delivered to the Trustee and the Depositor
of an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption
from the Act, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be obtained at the expense of
the Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor; or there shall be delivered to the
Trustee and the Depositor a transferor certificate by the transferor and an
investment letter shall be executed by the transferee. The Holder hereof
desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee and the Depositor against any liability that may result if the transfer
is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

                           Asset-Backed Certificates,

designated as First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-FF11, Asset-Backed

         The Certificateholder, by its acceptance of this Certificate, agrees
that it will look solely to the funds on deposit in the Distribution Account for
payment hereunder and that the Trustee is not liable to the Certificateholders
for any amount payable under this Certificate or the Agreement or, except as
expressly provided in the Agreement, subject to any liability under the
Agreement.

         This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Agreement and
reference is made to the Agreement for the interests, rights and limitations of
rights, benefits, obligations and duties evidenced thereby, and the rights,
duties and immunities of the Trustee.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, then the
Business Day immediately following such Distribution Date (the "Distribution

to the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered at the close of
business on the applicable Record Date in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate and the amount required to be
distributed to Holders of Certificates of the Class to which this Certificate
belongs on such Distribution Date pursuant to the Agreement.

         Distributions on this Certificate shall be made by check or money order
mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears on the
Certificate Register or by wire transfer or otherwise, as set forth in the
Agreement. The final distribution on each Certificate will be made in like
manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee specified in the notice to
Certificateholders of such final distribution.

         The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Trustee and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time
by the Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee and of Holders of the requisite
percentage of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected by
such amendment, as specified in the Agreement. Any such consent by the Holder of
this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the holder hereof or such
holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations and evidencing the
same aggregate Percentage Interest in the Trust will be issued to the designated

tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

Depositor, the Servicer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Trustee, the Servicer or any such agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

         On any Distribution Date following the date at which the remaining
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10%of the
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date
and the Original Pre-Funded Amounts, the Terminator may purchase, in whole, from
the Trust the Mortgage Loans at a purchase price determined as provided in the

Certificate Principal Balance) in certain monthly distributions with respect to

and any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from the registration
requirements under said Act and such laws. In the event that a transfer is to be

assure compliance with the Act and such laws, the Certificateholder desiring to
effect such transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee shall
each certify to the Trustee and the Depositor in writing the facts surrounding
the transfer. In the event that such a transfer is not to be made pursuant to
Rule 144A of the Act, there shall be delivered to the Trustee and the Depositor
of an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption
from the Act, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be obtained at the expense of
the Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor; or there shall be delivered to the
Trustee and the Depositor a transferor certificate by the transferor and an
investment letter shall be executed by the transferee. The Holder hereof
desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee and the Depositor against any liability that may result if the transfer

         the Certificates of the above-referenced Class with respect to the

         loans (the "Mortgage Loans")

                 FINANCIAL ASSET SECURITIES CORP., as Depositor

         Principal in respect of this Certificate is distributable monthly as
set forth herein. Accordingly, the Certificate Principal Balance of this Class C
Certificate at any time may be less than the Initial Certificate Principal
Balance set forth on the face hereof, as described herein. This Class C
Certificate does not evidence an obligation of, or an interest in, and is not
guaranteed by the Depositor, the Servicer, or the Trustee referred to below or
any of their respective affiliates.

         This certifies that Greenwich Capital Financial Products, Inc., is the
registered owner of the Percentage Interest evidenced by this Class C
Certificate (obtained by dividing the Denomination of this Class C Certificate
by the Original Class Certificate Principal Balance) in certain distributions
with respect to a Trust consisting primarily of the Mortgage Loans deposited by
Financial Asset Securities Corp. (the "Depositor"). The Trust was created
pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 1, 2004 (the
"Agreement") among the Depositor, National City Home Loan Services, Inc., as
servicer (the "Servicer"), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national banking
association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). To the extent not defined herein, the
capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the Agreement. This
Class C Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms, provisions and
conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of this Class C
Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such Holder
is bound.

         No transfer of a Certificate of this Class shall be made unless such
transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
and any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from the registration
requirements under said Act and such laws. In the event that a transfer is to be
made in reliance upon an exemption from the Act and such laws, in order to
assure compliance with the Act and such laws, the Certificateholder desiring to
effect such transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee shall
each certify to the Trustee and the Depositor in writing the facts surrounding
the transfer. In the event that such a transfer is not to be made pursuant to
Rule 144A of the Act, there shall be delivered to the Trustee and the Depositor
of an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption
from the Act, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be obtained at the expense of
the Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor; or there shall be delivered to the
Trustee and the Depositor a transferor certificate by the transferor and an
investment letter shall be executed by the transferee. The Holder hereof
desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the
Trustee and the Depositor against any liability that may result if the transfer
is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

         fixed rate mortgage loans (the "Mortgage Loans")

                 FINANCIAL ASSET SECURITIES CORP., as Depositor

         This Certificate does not evidence an obligation of, or an interest in,
and is not guaranteed by the Depositor, the Servicer or the Trustee referred to
below or any of their respective affiliates.

         This certifies that Greenwich Capital Markets, Inc. is the registered
owner of the Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate specified above
in the interest represented by all Certificates of the Class to which this
Certificate belongs in a Trust consisting primarily of the Mortgage Loans
deposited by Financial Asset Securities Corp. (the "Depositor"). The Trust was
created pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement dated as of December 1,
2004 (the "Agreement") among the Depositor, National City Home Loan Services,
Inc., as servicer (the "Servicer"), and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., a national
banking association, as trustee (the "Trustee"). To the extent not defined
herein, the capitalized terms used herein have the meanings assigned in the
Agreement. This Certificate is issued under and is subject to the terms,
provisions and conditions of the Agreement, to which Agreement the Holder of
this Certificate by virtue of the acceptance hereof assents and by which such
Holder is bound.

         This Certificate does not have a principal balance or pass-through rate
and will be entitled to distributions only to the extent set forth in the
Agreement. In addition, any distribution of the proceeds of any remaining assets
of the Trust will be made only upon presentment and surrender of this
Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office or the office or agency maintained by
the Trustee in Minneapolis, Minnesota.

         No transfer of a Certificate of this Class shall be made unless such
transfer is made pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Act
and any applicable state securities laws or is exempt from the registration
requirements under said Act and such laws. In the event that a transfer is to be
made in reliance upon an exemption from the Act and such laws, in order to
assure compliance with the Act and such laws, the Certificateholder desiring to
effect such transfer and such Certificateholder's prospective transferee shall
each certify to the Trustee and the Depositor in writing the facts surrounding
the transfer. In the event that such a transfer is not to be made pursuant to
Rule 144A of the Act, there shall be delivered to the Trustee and the Depositor
of an Opinion of Counsel that such transfer may be made pursuant to an exemption
from the Act, which Opinion of Counsel shall not be obtained at the expense of
the Trustee, the Servicer or the Depositor; or there shall be delivered to the
Trustee and the Depositor a transferor certificate by the transferor and an
investment letter shall be executed by the transferee. The Holder hereof
desiring to effect such transfer shall, and does hereby agree to, indemnify the

                                     A-21-2

<PAGE>

Trustee and the Depositor against any liability that may result if the transfer
is not so exempt or is not made in accordance with such federal and state laws.

         No transfer of this Certificate to a Plan subject to ERISA or Section
4975 of the Code, any Person acting, directly or indirectly, on behalf of any
such Plan or any person using Plan Assets to acquire this Certificate shall be
made except in accordance with Section 5.02(d) of the Agreement.

         Each Holder of this Certificate will be deemed to have agreed to be
bound by the restrictions of the Agreement, including but not limited to the
restrictions that (i) each person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in
this Certificate must be a Permitted Transferee, (ii) no Ownership Interest in
this Certificate may be transferred without delivery to the Trustee of (a) a
transfer affidavit of the proposed transferee and (b) a transfer certificate of
the transferor, each of such documents to be in the form described in the
Agreement, (iii) each person holding or acquiring any Ownership Interest in this
Certificate must agree to require a transfer affidavit and to deliver a transfer
certificate to the Trustee as required pursuant to the Agreement, (iv) each
person holding or acquiring an Ownership Interest in this Certificate must agree
not to transfer an Ownership Interest in this Certificate if it has actual
knowledge that the proposed transferee is not a Permitted Transferee and (v) any
attempted or purported transfer of any Ownership Interest in this Certificate in
violation of such restrictions will be absolutely null and void and will vest no
rights in the purported transferee. Pursuant to the Agreement, The Trustee will
provide the Internal Revenue Service and any pertinent persons with the
information needed to compute the tax imposed under the applicable tax laws on
transfers of residual interests to disqualified organizations, if any person
other than a Permitted Transferee acquires an Ownership Interest on a Class R-X
Certificate in violation of the restrictions mentioned above.

         Reference is hereby made to the further provisions of this Certificate
set forth on the reverse hereof, which further provisions shall for all purposes
have the same effect as if set forth at this place.

         This Certificate shall not be entitled to any benefit under the
Agreement or be valid for any purpose unless manually countersigned by an
authorized officer of the Trustee.

                           Asset-Backed Certificates,

designated as First Franklin Mortgage Loan Trust 2004-FF11, Asset-Backed
Certificates, Series 2004-FF11 (herein collectively called the "Certificates"),
and representing a beneficial ownership interest in the Trust created by the
Agreement.

         The Certificateholder, by its acceptance of this Certificate, agrees
that it will look solely to the funds on deposit in the Distribution Account for
payment hereunder and that the Trustee is not liable to the Certificateholders
for any amount payable under this Certificate or the Agreement or, except as
expressly provided in the Agreement, subject to any liability under the
Agreement.

         This Certificate does not purport to summarize the Agreement and
reference is made to the Agreement for the interests, rights and limitations of
rights, benefits, obligations and duties evidenced thereby, and the rights,
duties and immunities of the Trustee.

         Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement, a distribution will be made on
the 25th day of each month or, if such 25th day is not a Business Day, then the
Business Day immediately following such Distribution Date (the "Distribution
Date"), commencing on the first Distribution Date specified on the face hereof,
to the Person in whose name this Certificate is registered at the close of
business on the applicable Record Date in an amount equal to the product of the
Percentage Interest evidenced by this Certificate and the amount required to be
distributed to Holders of Certificates of the Class to which this Certificate
belongs on such Distribution Date pursuant to the Agreement.

         Distributions on this Certificate shall be made by check or money order
mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears on the
Certificate Register or by wire transfer or otherwise, as set forth in the
Agreement. The final distribution on each Certificate will be made in like
manner, but only upon presentment and surrender of such Certificate at the
Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee specified in the notice to
Certificateholders of such final distribution.

         The Agreement permits, with certain exceptions therein provided, the
amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Trustee and the rights of the Certificateholders under the Agreement at any time
by the Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee and of Holders of the requisite
percentage of the Percentage Interests of each Class of Certificates affected by
such amendment, as specified in the Agreement. Any such consent by the Holder of
this Certificate shall be conclusive and binding on such Holder and upon all
future Holders of this Certificate and of any Certificate issued upon the
transfer hereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu hereof whether or not
notation of such consent is made upon this Certificate. The Agreement also
permits the amendment thereof, in certain limited circumstances, without the
consent of the Holders of any of the Certificates.

         As provided in the Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein
set forth, the transfer of this Certificate is registrable in the Certificate
Register of the Certificate Registrar upon surrender of this Certificate for
registration of transfer at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee
accompanied by a written instrument of transfer in form satisfactory to the
Trustee and the Certificate Registrar duly executed by the holder hereof or such
holder's attorney duly authorized in writing, and thereupon one or more new
Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations and evidencing the
same aggregate Percentage Interest in the Trust will be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees.

         The Certificates are issuable only as registered Certificates without
coupons in denominations specified in the Agreement. As provided in the
Agreement and subject to certain limitations therein set forth, Certificates are
exchangeable for new Certificates of the same Class in authorized denominations
and evidencing the same aggregate Percentage Interest, as requested by the
Holder surrendering the same.

         No service charge will be made for any such registration of transfer or
exchange, but the Trustee may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any
tax or other governmental charge payable in connection therewith.

         The Depositor, the Servicer and the Trustee and any agent of the
Depositor, the Servicer or the Trustee may treat the Person in whose name this
Certificate is registered as the owner hereof for all purposes, and none of the
Depositor, the Trustee, the Servicer or any such agent shall be affected by any
notice to the contrary.

         On any Distribution Date following the date at which the remaining
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10%of the
aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the Cut-off Date
and the Original Pre-Funded Amounts, the Terminator may purchase, in whole, from
the Trust the Mortgage Loans at a purchase price determined as provided in the
Agreement. In the event that no such optional termination occurs, the
obligations and responsibilities created by the Agreement will terminate upon
notice to the Trustee upon the earliest of (i) the Distribution Date on which
the Certificate Principal Balances of the Regular Certificates have been reduced
to zero, (ii) the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan
in the Trust, (iii) the Distribution Date in December 2034.

         Capitalized terms used herein that are defined in the Agreement shall
have the meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement, and nothing herein shall be
deemed inconsistent with that meaning.

         original Lost Note Affidavit stating that the original mortgage note

         be a true and complete copy of the original submitted for recording;

                                       2
<PAGE>

                  (iii) an original Assignment, in form and substance acceptable
         for recording. The Mortgage shall be assigned either (A) in blank,
         without recourse or (B) to "Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee";

                  (iv) an original copy of any intervening assignment of
         Mortgage showing a complete chain of assignments;

                  (v) the original or a certified copy of lender's title
         insurance policy; and

                  (vi) the original or copies of each assumption, modification,
         written assurance, substitution agreement or guarantee, if any.

                  The Seller hereby confirms to the Purchaser and the Trustee
that it has caused the appropriate entries to be made in its general accounting
records to indicate that such Mortgage Loans have been transferred to the
Trustee and constitute part of the Trust in accordance with the terms of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement.

                  If any of the documents referred to in Section 2.02(ii), (iii)
or (iv) above has as of the Closing Date been submitted for recording but either
(x) has not been returned from the applicable public recording office or (y) has
been lost or such public recording office has retained the original of such
document, the obligations of the Seller to deliver such documents shall be
deemed to be satisfied upon (1) delivery to the Trustee or the Custodian, no
later than the Closing Date, of a copy of each such document certified by the
Seller in the case of (x) above or the applicable public recording office in the
case of (y) above to be a true and complete copy of the original that was
submitted for recording and (2) if such copy is certified by the Seller,
delivery to the Trustee or the Custodian, promptly upon receipt thereof of
either the original or a copy of such document certified by the applicable
public recording office to be a true and complete copy of the original. If the
original lender's title insurance policy, or a certified copy thereof, was not
delivered pursuant to Section 2.02(v) above. The Seller shall deliver or cause
to be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian, the original or a copy of a
written commitment or interim binder or preliminary report of title issued by
the title insurance or escrow company, with the original or a certified copy
thereof to be delivered to the Trustee or the Custodian, promptly upon receipt
thereof. The Seller shall deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee or the
Custodian promptly upon receipt thereof any other documents constituting a part
of a Mortgage File received with respect to any Mortgage Loan, including, but
not limited to, any original documents evidencing an assumption or modification
of any Mortgage Loan.

                  Upon discovery or receipt of notice of any materially
defective document in, or that a document is missing from, a Mortgage File, the
Seller shall have 120 days to cure such defect or deliver such missing document
to the Purchaser. If the Seller does not cure such defect or deliver such
missing document within such time period, the Seller shall either repurchase or
substitute for such Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 2.03 of the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement.

                  The Seller shall cause the Assignments which were delivered in
blank to be completed and shall cause all Assignments referred to in Section
2.02(iii) hereof and, to the

                                       3

extent necessary, in Section 2.02(iv) hereof to be recorded. The Seller shall be
required to deliver such assignments for recording within 180 days of the
Closing Date. In the event that any such Assignment is lost or returned
unrecorded because of a defect therein, the Seller shall promptly have a
substitute Assignment prepared or have such defect cured, as the case may be,
and thereafter cause each such Assignment to be duly recorded.

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, for administrative convenience
and facilitation of servicing and to reduce closing costs, the Assignments of
Mortgage shall not be required to be submitted for recording (except with
respect to any Mortgage Loan located in Maryland) unless such failure to record
would result in a withdrawal or a downgrading by any Rating Agency of the rating
on any Class of Certificates; provided, however, each Assignment shall be
submitted for recording by the Seller in the manner described above, at no
expense to the Trust Fund or Trustee, upon the earliest to occur of: (i)
reasonable direction by Holders of Certificates entitled to at least 25% of the
Voting Rights, (ii) the occurrence of a Servicer Event of Termination, (iii) the
occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or foreclosure relating to the Servicer,
(iv) the occurrence of a servicing transfer as described in Section 7.02 of the
Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (v) upon receipt of notice from the Servicer,
the occurrence of a bankruptcy, insolvency or foreclosure relating to the
Mortgagor under the related Mortgage and (vi) upon receipt of notice from the
Servicer, any Mortgage Loan that is 90 days or more Delinquent. Upon receipt of
written notice from the Purchaser that recording of the Assignments is required
pursuant to one or more of the conditions set forth in the preceding sentence,
the Seller shall be required to deliver such Assignments for recording as
provided above, promptly and in any event within 30 days following receipt of
such notice. The Seller shall furnish the Trustee, or its designated agent, with
a copy of each Assignment submitted for recording.

                  In the event that any Mortgage Note is endorsed in blank as of
the Closing Date, promptly following the Closing Date, the Trustee, at the
expense of the Seller, shall cause to be completed such endorsements "Pay to the
order of Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee, without recourse."

                  The Purchaser hereby acknowledges its acceptance of all right,
title and interest to the Mortgage Loans and other property, now existing and
hereafter created, conveyed to it pursuant to Section 2.01.

                  The parties hereto intend that the transaction set forth

and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans and other property described above. In
the event the transaction set forth herein is deemed not to be a sale, the
Seller hereby grants to the Purchaser a security interest in all of the Seller's
right, title and interest in, to and under the Mortgage Loans and other property
described above, whether now existing or hereafter created, to secure all of the
Seller's obligations hereunder; and this Agreement shall constitute a security
agreement under applicable law.

               REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES; REMEDIES FOR BREACH

         Section 3.01 Seller Representations and Warranties Relating to the
Mortgage Loans.

                  The Seller and the Purchaser understand, acknowledge and agree
that, the representations and warranties set forth in this Section 3.01 are made
as of the Closing Date or as of the date specifically provided herein.

                  The Seller hereby represents and warrants with respect to the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser that as of the Closing Date or as of such date
specifically provided herein:

                  (a) The information set forth in the mortgage loan schedule
delivered to the Seller by the Originator is complete, true and correct as of
the Cut-off Date;

                  (b) None of the Mortgage Loans were delinquent in their
monthly payments as of November 30, 2004; the Seller has not advanced funds, or
induced, solicited or knowingly received any advance of funds from a party other
than the owner of the related Mortgaged Property, directly or indirectly, for
the payment of any amount required by the Mortgage Note or Mortgage;

                  (c) At the time of origination, and to the best of the
Seller's knowledge, there were no delinquent taxes, ground rents, water charges,
sewer rents, assessments, insurance premiums, leasehold payments, including
assessments payable in future installments or other outstanding charges
affecting the related Mortgaged Property;

                  (d) The terms of the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage have not
been impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect, except by written
instruments, recorded in the applicable public recording office if necessary to
maintain the lien priority of the Mortgage, and which have been delivered to the
Purchaser or its designee; the substance of any such waiver, alteration or
modification has been approved by the title insurer, to the extent required by
the related policy, and is reflected on the Mortgage Loan Schedule. No
instrument of waiver, alteration or modification has been executed, and no
Mortgagor has been released, in whole or in part, except in connection with an
assumption agreement approved by the insurer under the title

                                       5
<PAGE>

insurer, to the extent required by the policy, and which assumption agreement
has been delivered to the Purchaser or its designee and the terms of which are
reflected in the Mortgage Loan Schedule;

                  (e) The Mortgage Note and the Mortgage are not subject to any
right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of
usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage Note and the
Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render the Mortgage
unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to any right of rescission,
set-off, counterclaim or defense, including the defense of usury, and no such
right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense has been asserted with
respect thereto;

                  (f) All buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by
an insurer that satisfies the requirements of First Franklin Financial
Corporation's (the "Originator") underwriting guidelines against loss by fire,
hazards of extended coverage and such other hazards as are customary in the area
where the Mortgaged Property is located, in an amount that is at least equal to
the lesser of (i) the amount necessary to fully compensate for any damage or
loss to the improvements which are a part of such property on a replacement cost
basis or (ii) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan, in each
case in an amount not less than such amount as is necessary to prevent the
Mortgagor and/or the Mortgagee from becoming a co-insurer. All such insurance
policies contain a standard mortgagee clause naming the Originator, its
successors and assigns as mortgagee and all premiums thereon have been paid. If
the Mortgaged Property is in an area identified on a Flood Hazard Map or Flood
Insurance Rate Map issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having
special flood hazards (and such flood insurance has been made available), a
flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
Federal Insurance Administration is in effect which policy conforms to the
requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor
thereunder to maintain all such insurance at the Mortgagor's cost and expense,
and on the Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the Mortgage
to maintain such insurance at Mortgagor's cost and expense and to seek
reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor;

                  (g) Prior to the Closing Date, any and all requirements of any
federal, state or local law including, without limitation, usury, truth in
lending, real estate settlement procedures, consumer credit protection, equal
credit opportunity, fair housing or disclosure laws applicable to the
origination and servicing of mortgage loans of a type similar to the Mortgage
Loans have been complied with;

                  (h) The Mortgage has not been satisfied, canceled,
subordinated or rescinded, in whole or in part, and the Mortgaged Property has
not been released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole or in part, nor has
any instrument been executed that would effect any such satisfaction,
cancellation, subordination, rescission or release;

                  (i) The Mortgage is a valid, existing and enforceable first
lien on the Mortgaged Property, including all improvements on the Mortgaged
Property subject only to (A) the lien of current real property taxes and
assessments not yet due and payable, (B) covenants, conditions and restrictions,
rights of way, easements and other matters of the public record as of the date
of recording being acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally and
specifically

                                       6
<PAGE>

referred to in the lender's title insurance policy delivered to the originator
of the Mortgage Loan and which do not adversely affect the Value of the
Mortgaged Property, and (C) other matters to which like properties are commonly
subject which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the security
intended to be provided by the Mortgage or the use, enjoyment, value or
marketability of the related Mortgaged Property. Any security agreement, chattel
mortgage or equivalent document related to and delivered in connection with the
Mortgage Loan establishes and creates a valid, existing and enforceable first
lien and first priority security interest on the property described therein and
the Seller has full right to sell and assign the same;

                  (j) The Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage are genuine and
each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker thereof,
enforceable in accordance with its terms;

                  (k) All parties to the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage had
legal capacity to enter into the Mortgage Loan and to execute and deliver the
Mortgage Note and the Mortgage, and the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage have been
duly and properly executed by such parties. The Mortgagor is a natural person;

                  (l) The proceeds of the Mortgage Loan have been fully
disbursed to or for the account of the Mortgagor and there is no obligation for
the Mortgagee to advance additional funds thereunder and any and all
requirements as to completion of any on-site or off-site improvement and as to
disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with. All costs,
fees and expenses incurred in making or closing the Mortgage Loan and the
recording of the Mortgage have been paid, and the Mortgagor is not entitled to
any refund of any amounts paid or due to the Mortgagee pursuant to the Mortgage
Note or Mortgage;

                  (m) Prior to the sale of the Mortgage Loan by the Seller, the
Seller was the sole legal, beneficial and equitable owner of the Mortgage Note
and the Mortgage and had full right to transfer and sell the Mortgage Loan free
and clear of any encumbrance, equity, lien, pledge, charge, claim or security
interest;

                  (n) All parties which had any interest in the Mortgage Loan,
whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise, were (or, during the
period in which they held and disposed of such interest, were) in compliance
with any and all applicable "doing business" and licensing requirements of the
laws of the state wherein the Mortgaged Property is located.

                  (o) The Mortgage Loan was covered by an American Land Title
Association ("ALTA") lender's title insurance policy, which has an
adjustable-rate mortgage endorsement in the case of the adjustable-rate Mortgage
Loans, in the form of ALTA 6.0 or 6.1 acceptable to prudent lenders, issued by a
title insurer acceptable to prudent lenders and qualified to do business in the
jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located, insuring (subject to the
exceptions contained in (i)(A) and (B) above) the Originator its successors and
assigns as to the first priority lien of the Mortgage in the original principal
amount of the Mortgage Loan and against any loss by reason of the invalidity or
unenforceability of the lien resulting from the provisions of the Mortgage
providing for adjustment in the Mortgage Rate and Monthly Payment. Additionally,
such lender's title insurance policy affirmatively insures ingress and
                                       7

<PAGE>

egress to and from the Mortgaged Property, and against encroachments by or upon
the Mortgaged Property or any interest therein. The Originator, its successors
and assigns, is the sole insured of such lender's title insurance policy, and
such lender's title insurance policy is in full force and effect and will be in
full force and effect upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
this Agreement. No claims have been made under such lender's title insurance
policy, and no prior holder of the related Mortgage, including the Seller, has
done, by act or omission, anything which would impair the coverage of such
lender's title insurance policy;

                  (p) There is no default, breach, violation or event of
acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note (other than the
delinquencies mentioned in clause (b)) and no event which, with the passage of
time or with notice and the expiration of any grace or cure period, would
constitute a default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, and the Seller
has not waived any default, breach, violation or event of acceleration;

                  (q) There are no mechanics' or similar liens or claims which
have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are outstanding that
under law could give rise to such lien) affecting the related Mortgaged Property
which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or coordinate with, the lien of the
related Mortgage;

                  (r) All improvements that were considered in determining the
Value of the related Mortgaged Property lay wholly within the boundaries and
building restriction lines of the Mortgaged Property, and no improvements on
adjoining properties encroached upon the Mortgaged Property. Each appraisal has
been performed in accordance with the provisions of the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989;

                  (s) The Mortgage Loan was originated (for purposes of the
Secondary Mortgage Market Enhancement Act of 1984) by the Originator or by a
savings and loan association, a savings bank, a commercial bank or similar
banking institution which is supervised and examined by a federal or state
authority, or by a mortgagee approved as such by the Secretary of Housing and
Urban Development;

                  (t) Principal payments on the Mortgage Loan commenced no more
than two (2) months after the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan were disbursed. The
Mortgage Loan bears interest at the Mortgage Rate. With respect to each Mortgage
Loan, the Mortgage Note is payable on the first day of each month. The Mortgage
Note is payable in Monthly Payments. With respect to the adjustable-rate
Mortgage Loans, the Monthly Payments are changed on each Adjustment Date to an
amount which will fully amortize the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage
Loan over its remaining term at the Mortgage Rate. Interest on the Mortgage Loan
is calculated on the basis of a 360 day year consisting of twelve 30 day months.
The Mortgage Note does not permit negative amortization. No adjustable-rate
Mortgage Loan permits the Mortgagor to convert the Mortgage Loan to a fixed-rate
Mortgage Loan;

                  (u) The origination, servicing and collection practices used
by the Originator and any servicer of the Mortgage Loan, with respect to each
Mortgage Note and Mortgage have been in all respects legal, proper, prudent and
customary in the mortgage origination and servicing industry. The Mortgage Loan
has been serviced by the Originator and any predecessor

                                       8
<PAGE>

servicer in accordance with the terms of the Mortgage Note. With respect to
escrow deposits and Escrow Payments, if any, all such payments are in the
possession of, or under the control of, the Seller and there exist no
deficiencies in connection therewith for which customary arrangements for
repayment thereof have not been made. No escrow deposits or Escrow Payments or
other charges or payments due the Seller have been capitalized under any
Mortgage or the related Mortgage Note;

                  (v) The Mortgaged Property is free of damage and waste and
there is no proceeding pending for the total or partial condemnation thereof;

                  (w) The Mortgage and related Mortgage Note contain customary
and enforceable provisions such as to render the rights and remedies of the
holder thereof adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged Property of
the benefits of the security provided thereby, including, (A) in the case of a
Mortgage designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (B) otherwise by
judicial foreclosure. Since the date of origination of the Mortgage Loan, the
Mortgaged Property has not been subject to any bankruptcy proceeding or
foreclosure proceeding and the Mortgagor has not filed for protection under
applicable bankruptcy laws. There is no homestead or other exemption available
to the Mortgagor which would interfere with the right to sell the Mortgaged
Property at a trustee's sale or the right to foreclose the Mortgage. The
Mortgagor has not notified the Seller and the Seller has no knowledge of any
relief requested or allowed to the Mortgagor under the Servicemembers Civil
Relief Act;

                  (x) The Mortgage Loan was underwritten in accordance with the
underwriting standards of the Originator in effect at the time the Mortgage Loan
was originated; and the Mortgage Note and Mortgage are on forms acceptable to
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac;

                  (y) The Mortgage Note is not and has not been secured by any
collateral except the lien of the corresponding Mortgage on the Mortgaged
Property and the security interest of any applicable security agreement or
chattel mortgage referred to in (i) above;

                  (z) The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the related
Mortgaged Property which satisfied the standards of the Financial Institutions
Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, and the rules and regulations
thereunder, as amended from time to time, and was made and signed by an
appraiser who met the minimum requirements of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or
complied with the Originator's automated appraisal methodology as set forth in
the Originator's underwriting guidelines, duly appointed by the Originator, who
had no interest, direct or indirect in the Mortgaged Property or in any loan
made on the security thereof, whose compensation is not affected by the approval
or disapproval of the Mortgage Loan and who met the minimum qualifications of
the Financial Institutions Reform, Recovery and Enforcement Act of 1989, and the
rules and regulations thereunder;

                  (aa) In the event the Mortgage constitutes a deed of trust, a
trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, has been properly
designated and currently so serves and is named in the Mortgage, and no fees or
expenses are or will become payable by the Purchaser to the trustee under the
deed of trust, except in connection with a trustee's sale after default by the
Mortgagor;

                                       9
<PAGE>

                  (bb) No Mortgage Loan contains provisions pursuant to which
Monthly Payments are (A) paid or partially paid with funds deposited in any
separate account established by the Seller, the Mortgagor, or anyone on behalf
of the Mortgagor, (B) paid by any source other than the Mortgagor or (C)
contains any other similar provisions which may constitute a "buydown"
provision. The Mortgage Loan is not a graduated payment mortgage loan and the
Mortgage Loan does not have a shared appreciation or other contingent interest
feature;

                  (cc) The Mortgagor has executed a statement to the effect that
the Mortgagor has received all disclosure materials required by applicable law
with respect to the making of adjustable-rate or fixed-rate mortgage loans, as
applicable; and if the Mortgage Loan is a Refinanced Mortgage Loan, the
Mortgagor has received all disclosure and rescission materials required by
applicable law with respect to the making of a refinanced Mortgage Loan, and
evidence of such receipt is and will remain in the Mortgage File;

                  (dd) No Mortgage Loan was made in connection with (A) the
construction or rehabilitation of a Mortgaged Property or (B) facilitating the
trade-in or exchange of a Mortgaged Property;

                  (ee) The Mortgage Note, the Mortgage, the Assignment and any
other documents required to be delivered with respect to each Mortgage Loan have
been delivered to the Seller;

                  (ff) The Mortgaged Property is lawfully occupied under
applicable law. All inspections, licenses and certificates required to be made
or issued with respect to all occupied portions of the Mortgaged Property and,
with respect to the use and occupancy of the same, including but not limited to
certificates of occupancy, have been made or obtained from the appropriate
authorities;

                  (gg) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no error,
omission, misrepresentation, negligence, fraud or similar occurrence with
respect to a Mortgage Loan has taken place on the part of any person, including,
without limitation, the Mortgagor, any appraiser, any builder or developer, or
any other party involved in the origination, modification or amendment of the
Mortgage Loan or in the application of any insurance in relation to such
Mortgage Loan;

                  (hh) The Assignment is in recordable form and is acceptable
for recording under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property
is located;

                  (ii) Any principal advances made to the Mortgagor prior to the
Closing Date have been consolidated with the outstanding principal amount
secured by the Mortgage, and the secured principal amount, as consolidated bears
a single interest rate and single repayment term. The lien of the Mortgage
securing the consolidated principal amount is expressly insured as having first

the mortgagee's consolidated interest or by other title evidence acceptable to
Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The consolidated principal amount does not exceed
the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan;

applicable environmental laws pertaining to environmental hazards including,
without limitation, asbestos, and there is no pending action or proceeding

thereon, or a two- to four-family dwelling, or an individual condominium unit in
a low rise or high rise condominium project, or an individual unit in a planned

by a long term residential lease, unless otherwise specifically disclosed in the
related Mortgage Loan Schedule, (A) the terms of such lease expressly permit the
mortgaging of the leasehold estate, the assignment of the lease without the
lessor's consent (or the lessors consent has been obtained and such consent is

rights of the lessee upon foreclosure or assignment in lieu of foreclosure or
provide the holder of the Mortgage with substantially similar protection; (B)
the terms of such lease do not (x) allow the termination thereof upon the
lessee's default without the holder of the Mortgage being entitled to receive
written notice of, and opportunity to cure, such default or (y) prohibit the
holder of the Mortgage from being insured under the hazard insurance policy
relating to the Mortgaged Property, (C) the original term of such lease is not
less than 15 years; (D) the term of such lease does not terminate earlier than

Property is located in a jurisdiction in which the use of leasehold estates for
residential properties is a widely accepted practice;

                  (qq) At the time of origination, the Loan-to-Value Ratio of
the Mortgage Loan was not greater than 100%. With respect to the Mortgage Loans,
when measured by aggregate Stated Principal Balance as of the Cut-off Date, with
respect to no less than 80% of the Mortgage Loans, the calculation of the
Loan-to-Value Ratio at the time of origination was determined based on a full
formal appraisal acceptable to Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac or complied with the
Originator's automated appraisal methodology as set forth in the Originator's
underwriting guidelines;

                  (rr) The Mortgage, and if required by applicable law the
related Mortgage Note, contains a provision for the acceleration of the payment
of the unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in the event that the
Mortgaged Property is sold or transferred without the prior written consent of
the Mortgagee, at the option of the Mortgagee;

                  (ss) No Mortgage Loan is subject to the requirements of the
Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of 1994 ("HOEPA") and no Mortgage Loan
is in violation of any comparable state law or ordinance similar to HOEPA;

                  (tt) The information set forth in the Prepayment Charge
Schedule is complete, true and correct in all material respects as of the
Cut-off Date, and each Prepayment Charge is permissible, enforceable and
collectible under applicable federal, state and local law (except to the extent
that (i) the enforceability thereof may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
moratorium, receivership and other similar laws relating to creditors' rights
generally or (ii) the collectability thereof may be limited due to acceleration
in connection with a foreclosure or other involuntary payoff);

                  (uu) As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loan was not prepaid
in full prior to the sale of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller, and the Seller

would be made after the sale of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller;

<PAGE>

                  (vv) The Mortgage Loan had an original term of maturity of not
more than 360 months;

                  (ww) Each Mortgage Loan constitutes a "qualified mortgage"
within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(3) of the Code;

                  (xx) No proceeds from any Group I Mortgage Loan were used to
purchase single premium credit insurance policies as part of the origination of,
or as a condition to closing such Group I Mortgage Loan;

                  (yy) No Mortgage Loan originated before October 1, 2002 has a
Prepayment Charge term longer than five years after its date of origination and
no Group I Mortgage Loan originated on or after October 1, 2002 has a Prepayment
Charge term longer than three years after its date of origination;

                  (zz) No Mortgage Loan was originated on or after October 1,

                  (aaa) No Mortgage Loan is classified as a high cost mortgage
loan under HOEPA. No Mortgage Loan is a "high cost home," "covered" (excluding
home loans defined as "covered home loans" in the New Jersey Home Ownership
Security Act of 2002 that were originated between November 26, 2003 and July 7,
2004), "high risk home" or "predatory" loan under any other applicable state,
federal or local law (or a similarly classified loan using different terminology
under a law imposing heightened regulatory scrutiny or additional legal
liability for residential mortgage loans having high interest rates, points
and/or fees);

                  (bbb) All Mortgage Loans were originated in compliance with
all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, all applicable
anti-predatory lending laws and none of the mortgage loans are "High Cost" as
defined by the applicable predatory and abusive lending laws;

                  (ccc) No Mortgage Loan is a high cost loan or a covered loan,
as applicable (as such terms are defined in Standard & Poor's LEVELS Version 5.6
Glossary Revised, Appendix E; and

                  (ddd) With respect to any Mortgage Loan originated on or after
August 1, 2004, neither the related mortgage nor the related mortgage note
requires the borrower to submit to arbitration to resolve any dispute arising
out of or relating in any way to the mortgage loan transaction.

action described in the following paragraphs of this Section 3.03 in respect of
such Mortgage Loan. Upon discovery by either the Seller or the Purchaser of a
breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties that materially

Purchaser (or which materially and adversely affects the interests of the
Purchaser in the related Mortgage Loan in the case of a representation and
warranty relating to a particular Mortgage Loan), the party discovering such
breach shall give prompt written notice to the other. It is understood by the
parties hereto that a breach of the representations and warranties made in
Section 3.01(ss), (yy), (zz), (aaa), (bbb) and (ddd) will be deemed to
materially and adversely affect the value of the related Mortgage Loan or the
interest of the Purchaser.

                  Within 120 days of the earlier of either discovery by or
notice to the Seller of any breach of a representation or warranty made by the
Seller that materially and adversely affects the value of a Mortgage Loan or the

its best efforts promptly to cure such breach in all material respects and, if
such breach cannot be cured, the Seller shall, at the Purchaser's option,
repurchase such Mortgage Loan at the Purchase Price. In the event that a breach
shall involve any representation or warranty set forth in Subsection 3.02 and
such breach cannot be cured within 120 days of the earlier of either discovery
by or notice to the Seller of such breach, all of the Mortgage Loans shall, at
the Purchaser's option be repurchased by the Seller at the Purchase Price. The
Seller may, at the request of the Purchaser and assuming the Seller has a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan, rather than repurchase a deficient Mortgage
Loan as provided above, remove such Mortgage Loan and substitute in its place a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans. If the Seller does not provide a
Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, it shall repurchase the deficient
Mortgage Loan. Any repurchase of a Mortgage Loan(s) pursuant to the foregoing
provisions of this Section 3.03 shall occur on a date designated by the
Purchaser and shall be accomplished by deposit in accordance with Section 2.03

scheduled Prepayment Charge, for the benefit of the Holders of the Class P
Certificates, by

collected by the Servicer and paid by the Servicer, for the benefit of the
Holders of the Class P Certificates, in respect of such Prepayment Charge.

repurchased Mortgage Loan. In the event the Purchase Price is deposited in the

written notice to the Purchaser that such deposit has taken place. Upon such
repurchase, the Mortgage Loan Schedule shall be amended to reflect the
withdrawal of the repurchased Mortgage Loan from this Agreement.

substitutes a Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans, the Seller shall

therein. The Seller shall remit for deposit in the Collection Account the
Monthly Payment due on such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan or Loans in the
month following the date of such substitution. Monthly payments due with respect
to Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans in the month of substitution will be
retained by the Seller. For the month of substitution, distributions to the
Purchaser will include the Monthly Payment due on such Deleted Mortgage Loan in
the month of substitution, and the Seller shall thereafter be entitled to retain
all amounts subsequently received by the Seller in respect of such Deleted
Mortgage Loan. Upon such substitution, the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loans
shall be subject to the terms of this Agreement in all respects, and the Seller
shall be deemed to have made with respect to such Qualified Substitute Mortgage
Loan or Loans as of the date of substitution, the covenants, representations and
warranties set forth in Subsections 3.01 and 3.02.

                  It is understood and agreed that the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 3.01 and 3.02 shall survive delivery of the
respective Mortgage Files to the Trustee on behalf of the Purchaser.

                  It is understood and agreed that the obligations of the Seller
set forth in this Section 3.03 to cure, repurchase and substitute for a
defective Mortgage Loan and the obligations of the Seller to indemnify the
Purchaser as provided in Section 5.01 constitute the sole remedies of the
Purchaser respecting a missing or defective document or a breach of the
representations and warranties contained in Section 3.01 or 3.02.

         Section 4.01 Covenants of the Seller. The Seller hereby covenants that
except for the transfer hereunder, the Seller will not sell, pledge, assign or
transfer to any other Person, or

discovery thereof, and the Seller will defend the right, title and interest of
the Trust, as assignee of the Purchaser, in, to and under the Mortgage Loans,
against all claims of third parties claiming through or under the Seller;
provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.01 shall prevent or be deemed
to prohibit the Seller from suffering to exist upon any of the Mortgage Loans
any Liens for municipal or other local taxes and other governmental charges if
such taxes or governmental charges shall not at the time be due and payable or
if the Seller shall currently be contesting the validity thereof in good faith
by appropriate proceedings and shall have set aside on its books adequate
reserves with respect thereto.

         therein a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
         make the statements made therein not misleading, to the extent that any
         untrue statement or alleged untrue statement therein results (or is

which it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Article V.

indemnified party, and it shall notify the indemnifying party thereof, the

indemnified party. After notice from the indemnifying party to the indemnified
party of its election to assume the defense of such claim or action, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to the indemnified party under this
Article V for any legal or other expenses subsequently incurred by the
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof other than reasonable
costs of investigation.

                  Any indemnified party shall have the right to employ separate
counsel in any such action and to participate in the defense thereof, but the
fees and expenses of such counsel shall be at the expense of such indemnified
party unless: (i) the employment thereof has been specifically authorized by the
indemnifying party in writing; (ii) such indemnified party shall have been
advised in writing by such counsel that there may be one or more legal defenses
available to it which are different from or additional to those available to the
indemnifying party and in the reasonable judgment of such counsel it is
advisable for such indemnified party to employ separate counsel; or (iii) the
indemnifying party has failed to assume the defense of such action and employ
counsel reasonably satisfactory to the indemnified party, in which case, if such
indemnified party notifies the indemnifying party in writing that it elects to
employ separate counsel at the expense of the indemnifying party, the
indemnifying party shall not have the right to assume the defense of such action
on behalf of such indemnified party, it being understood,

                                       19
<PAGE>

however, the indemnifying party shall not, in connection with any one such
action or separate but substantially similar or related actions in the same
jurisdiction arising out of the same general allegations or circumstances, be
liable for the reasonable fees and expenses of more than one separate firm of
attorneys (in addition to local counsel) at any time for all such indemnified
parties, which firm shall be designated in writing by the Purchaser, if the
indemnified parties under this Article V consist of the Purchaser.

                  Each indemnified party, as a condition of the indemnity
agreements contained in Section 5.01 (a) and (b) hereof, shall use its best
efforts to cooperate with the indemnifying party in the defense of any such
action or claim. No indemnifying party shall be liable for any settlement of any
such action effected without its written consent (which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld), but if settled with its written consent or if there be a
final judgment for the plaintiff in any such action, the indemnifying party
agrees to indemnify and hold harmless any indemnified party from and against any
loss or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Notwithstanding the
foregoing sentence, if at any time an indemnified party shall have requested an
indemnifying party to consent to a settlement of any action, the indemnifying
party agrees that it shall be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
effected without its written consent if such settlement is entered into more
than 30 days after receipt by such indemnifying party of the aforesaid request
and the indemnifying party has not previously provided the indemnified party
with written notice of its objection to such settlement. No indemnifying party
shall effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect
of which an indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity is or
could have been sought hereunder, without the written consent of such
indemnified party, unless settlement includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability and claims that are the subject matter of
such proceeding.

                  (c) In order to provide for just and equitable contribution in
circumstances in which the indemnity agreement provided for in this Article is
for any reason held to be unenforceable although applicable in accordance with
its terms, the Seller, on the one hand, and the Purchaser, on the other, shall
contribute to the aggregate losses, liabilities, claims, damages and expenses of
the nature contemplated by said indemnity agreement incurred by the Seller and
the Purchaser in such proportions as shall be appropriate to reflect the
relative benefits received by the Seller on the one hand and the Purchaser on
the other from the sale of the Mortgage Loans; provided, however, that no person
guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11 (f) of
the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was
not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this Section,
each officer and director of the Purchaser and each person, if any, who controls
the Purchaser within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have
the same rights to contribution as the Purchaser and each director of the
Seller, each officer of the Seller, and each person, if any, who controls the
Seller within the meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act shall have the
same rights to contribution as the Seller.

                  (d) The Seller agrees to indemnify and to hold each of the
Purchaser, the Trustee, each of the officers and directors of each such entity
and each person or entity who controls each such entity or person and each
Certificateholder harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other

                                       20
<PAGE>

costs, fees and expenses that the Purchaser, the Trustee, or any such person or
entity and any Certificateholder may sustain in any way (i) related to the
failure of the Seller to perform its duties in compliance with the terms of this
Agreement or (ii) arising from a breach by the Seller of its representations and
warranties in Sections 3.01 and 3.02 of this Agreement. The Seller shall
immediately notify the Purchaser, the Trustee and each Certificateholder if a
claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement. The Seller shall
assume the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
therewith, including reasonable counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and
satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against the Purchaser, the
Trustee or any such person or entity and/or any Certificateholder in respect of
such claim.

                                   TERMINATION

         Section 6.01 Termination. The respective obligations and
responsibilities of the Seller and the Purchaser created hereby shall terminate,
except for the Seller's indemnity obligations as provided herein upon the
termination of the Trust as provided in Article X of the Pooling and Servicing
Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         Section 7.01 Amendment. This Agreement may be amended from time to time
by the Seller and the Purchaser, by written agreement signed by the Seller and
the Purchaser.

         Section 7.02 Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York and the
obligations, rights and remedies of the parties hereunder shall be determined in
accordance with such laws.

         Section 7.03 Notices. All demands, notices and communications hereunder
shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly given if personally
delivered at or mailed by registered mail, postage prepaid, addressed as
follows: (i) if to the Seller, Greenwich Capital Financial Products, Inc., 600
Steamboat Road, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830, Attention: Legal, or such other
address as may hereafter be furnished to the Purchaser in writing by the Seller
and (ii) if to the Purchaser, Financial Asset Securities Corp., 600 Steamboat
Road, Greenwich, Connecticut 06830, Attention: Legal, or such other address as
may hereafter be furnished to the Seller in writing by the Purchaser.

         Section 7.04 Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the
covenants, agreements, provisions of terms of this Agreement shall be held
invalid for any reason whatsoever, then such covenants, agreements, provisions
or terms shall be deemed severable from the remaining covenants, agreements,
provisions or terms of this Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity of
enforceability of the other provisions of this Agreement.

         Section 7.05 Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts and by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts,
each of which, when so executed, shall be deemed to be an original and such
counterparts, together, shall constitute one and the same agreement.

         Section 7.06 Further Agreements. The Purchaser and the Seller each
agree to execute and deliver to the other such additional documents, instruments
or agreements as may be necessary or reasonable and appropriate to effectuate
the purposes of this Agreement or in connection with the issuance of any Series
of Certificates representing interests in the Mortgage Loans.

                                       22

<PAGE>

         Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, as a further
inducement for the Purchaser to purchase the Mortgage Loans from the Seller, the
Seller will cooperate with the Purchaser in connection with the sale of any of
the securities representing interests in the Mortgage Loans. In that connection,
the Seller will provide to the Purchaser any and all information and appropriate
verification of information, whether through letters of its auditors and counsel
or otherwise, as the Purchaser shall reasonably request and will provide to the
Purchaser such additional representations and warranties, covenants, opinions of
counsel, letters from auditors, and certificates of public officials or officers
of the Seller as are reasonably required in connection with such transactions
and the offering of investment grade securities rated by the Rating Agencies.

         Section 7.07 Intention of the Parties. It is the intention of the
parties that the Purchaser is purchasing, and the Seller is selling, the
Mortgage Loans rather than pledging the Mortgage Loans to secure a loan by the
Purchaser to the Seller. Accordingly, the parties hereto each intend to treat
the transaction for federal income tax purposes and all other purposes as a sale
by the Seller, and a purchase by the Purchaser, of the Mortgage Loans. The
Purchaser will have the right to review the Mortgage Loans and the related
Mortgage Files to determine the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans which will
affect the federal income tax consequences of owning the Mortgage Loans and the
Seller will cooperate with all reasonable requests made by the Purchaser in the
course of such review.

         Section 7.08 Successors and Assigns; Assignment of Purchase Agreement.
This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be enforceable by the
Seller, the Purchaser and the Trustee.

         The obligations of the Seller under this Agreement cannot be assigned
or delegated to a third party without the consent of the Purchaser which consent
shall be at the Purchaser's sole discretion, except that the Purchaser
acknowledges and agrees that the Seller may assign its obligations hereunder to
any Person into which the Seller is merged or any corporation resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which the Seller is a party or any Person
succeeding to the business of the Seller. The parties hereto acknowledge that
the Purchaser is acquiring the Mortgage Loans for the purpose of contributing
them to a trust that will issue a series of Certificates representing undivided
interests in such Mortgage Loans. As an inducement to the Purchaser to purchase
the Mortgage Loans, the Seller acknowledges and consents to the assignment by
the Purchaser to the Trustee of all of the Purchaser's rights against the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement insofar as such rights relate to Mortgage Loans
transferred to the Trustee and to the enforcement or exercise of any right or
remedy against the Seller pursuant to this Agreement by the Trustee. Such
enforcement of a right or remedy by the Trustee shall have the same force and
effect as if the right or remedy had been enforced or exercised by the Purchaser
directly.

         Section 7.09 Survival. The representations and warranties set forth in
Sections 3.01 and 3.02 and the provisions of Article V hereof shall survive the
purchase of the Mortgage Loans hereunder.

accordance with Section 2.02 of the referenced Pooling and Servicing Agreement
(the "Pooling and Servicing Agreement"). Capitalized terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the meanings set forth in the Pooling and
Servicing Agreement.

         As to each Mortgage Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (other

delivered to the Trustee pursuant Section 2.01 of the Pooling and Servicing

relate to such Mortgage Loan and (iii) based on the Trustee's examination and
only as to the foregoing, the information set forth in the Mortgage Loan

the validity, legality, sufficiency, enforceability or genuineness of any of the
documents contained in the Mortgage File pertaining to the Mortgage Loans
identified on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, (ii) the collectability, insurability,

         1. The undersigned is an officer of , the proposed Transferee of an
Ownership Interest in Class R Certificates (the "Certificate") issued pursuant
to the Pooling and Servicing Agreement, (the "Agreement"), relating to the
above-referenced Certificates, among Financial Asset Securities Corp., as
Depositor, National City Home Loan Services, Inc., as Servicer (the "Servicer")
and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Trustee (the "Trustee"). Capitalized terms used,
but not defined herein shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the
Agreement. The Transferee has authorized the undersigned to make this affidavit
on behalf of the Transferee.

         2. The Transferee is, as of the date hereof and will be, as of the date
of the Transfer, a Permitted Transferee. The Transferee is acquiring its
Ownership Interest in the Certificate either (i) for its own account or (ii) as
nominee, trustee or agent for another Person and has attached hereto an
affidavit from such Person in substantially the same form as this affidavit. The
Transferee has no knowledge that any such affidavit is false.

         3. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that (i) a tax
will be imposed on Transfers of the Certificate to Persons that are not
Permitted Transferees; (ii) such tax will be imposed on the transferor, or, if
such Transfer is through an agent (which includes a broker, nominee or
middleman) to a Person that is not a Permitted Transferee, on the agent; and
(iii) the Person otherwise liable for the tax shall be relieved of liability for
the tax if the subsequent Transferee furnished to such Person an affidavit that
such subsequent Transferee is a Permitted Transferee and, at the time of
Transfer, such Person does not have actual knowledge that the affidavit is
false.

         4. The Transferee has been advised of, and understands that a tax will
be imposed on a "pass-through entity" holding the Certificate if at any time
during the taxable year of the pass- through entity a Person that is not a
Permitted Transferee is the record holder of an interest in such entity. The
Transferee understands that such tax will not be imposed for any period with
respect to which the record holder furnishes to the pass-through entity an
affidavit that such record holder is a Permitted Transferee and the pass-through
entity does not have actual knowledge that such affidavit is false. (For this
purpose, a "pass-through entity" includes a regulated investment company, a real
estate investment trust or common trust fund, a partnership, trust or estate,
and certain cooperatives and, except as may be provided in Treasury Regulations,
persons holding interests in pass-through entities as a nominee for another
Person).

         5. The Transferee has reviewed the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of the
Agreement and understands the legal consequences of the acquisition of an
Ownership Interest in the Certificate including, without limitation, the
restrictions on subsequent Transfers and the provisions regarding voiding the
Transfer and mandatory sales. The Transferee expressly agrees to be bound by and
to abide by the provisions of Section 5.02(d) of the Agreement and the
restrictions noted on the face of the Certificate. The Transferee understands
and agrees that any breach of any of the representations included herein shall
render the Transfer to the Transferee contemplated hereby null and void.

         6. The Transferee agrees to require a Transfer Affidavit from any
Person to whom the Transferee attempts to Transfer its Ownership Interest in the
Certificate, and in connection with any Transfer by a Person for whom the
Transferee is acting as nominee, trustee or agent, and the Transferee will not
Transfer its Ownership Interest or cause any Ownership Interest to be
Transferred to any Person that the Transferee knows is not a Permitted
Transferee. In connection with any such Transfer by the Transferee, the
Transferee agrees to deliver to the Trustee a certificate substantially in the
form set forth as Exhibit K to the Agreement (a "Transferor Certificate") to the
effect that such Transferee has no actual knowledge that the Person to which the
Transfer is to be made is not a Permitted Transferee.

         7. The Transferee does not have the intention to impede the assessment
or collection of any tax legally required to be paid with respect to the
Certificate.

         8. The Transferee's taxpayer identification number is _____________.

         9. The Transferee is a U.S. Person as defined in Code Section
7701-(a)(30).

         10. The Transferee is aware that the Certificate may be a "noneconomic
residual interest" within the meaning of proposed Treasury regulations
promulgated pursuant to the Code and that the transferor of a noneconomic
residual interest will remain liable for any taxes due with respect to the
income on such residual interest, unless no significant purpose of the transfer
was to impede the assessment or collection of tax.

         11. The Transferee is not an employee benefit plan that is subject to
ERISA or a plan that is subject to Section 4975 of the Code, nor is it acting on
behalf of such a plan.
