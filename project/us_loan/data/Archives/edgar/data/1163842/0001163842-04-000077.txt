                          ELIGIBILITY AND PARTICIPATION

3.1       Eligibility. The following classes of individuals shall be eligible to
          participate in the Plan:

          (a)       Unless the Administrator  determines otherwise,  an Employee
                    shall be eligible to participate in the Plan for a Plan Year
                    if his or her  stated  Compensation  and  Bonus for the year
                    before  the  Plan  Year   equals  or   exceeds   the  annual
                    compensation    limit   established   under   Code   Section
                    401(a)(17),  or if the  Employee  is hired  during  the Plan
                    Year,  his or her  stated  rate of  Compensation  and target
                    Bonus on the  Employee's  date of hire equals or exceeds the
                    compensation   limit  then  in  effect  under  Code  Section
                    401(a)(17).

          (b)       Each Outside  Director  shall be eligible to  participate in
                    the Plan.

          (c)       Before each Plan Year,  the  Administrator  may designate as
                    eligible for  participation in the Plan any other person who
                    is among a select group of management or highly  compensated
                    Employees  of an  Employer.  The  Administrator  will notify
                    those  Employees  as  well as  Outside  Directors  of  their
                    eligibility to participate in the Plan and provide them with
                    a  Deferral  Form.  The  Administrator  shall  have the sole
                    discretion to determine eligibility pursuant to the Plan.

3.2       Participation.  An Eligible  Individual  who  properly  completes  and
          timely  submits a Deferral Form shall become a Participant in the Plan
          on the first date as of which an Elective  Deferral or Bonus  Deferral
          is credited to his or her  Account.  A  Participant  in the Plan shall
          continue to be a Participant so long as any amount remains credited to
          his or her Account.

3.3       Suspension of Participation.  If the  Administrator  determines that a
          Participant  currently  making Elective  Deferrals no longer satisfies
          the eligibility  requirements of Section 3.1(a) or (c) during the Plan
          Year,  the  Administrator  may  suspend  the  Participant's   Elective
          Deferrals  until  the  next  following  Plan  Year  as  of  which  the
          Participant  again satisfies such  eligibility  requirements.  In such
          circumstance,  the Administrator  shall notify the Participant of such
          suspension.  If  the  Participant's   participation  is  suspended  as
          described in this Section and the  Administrator  determines  that the
          Participant  again satisfies the  eligibility  requirements of Section
          3.1(a) or (c), the Administrator shall notify the Participant, and the
          Participant  shall be permitted to resume active  participation in the
          Plan as of the next following Plan Year. During the period of any such
          suspension,  such individual shall continue to be a Participant solely
          with respect to his or her Account  balance until such Account balance
          is distributed from the Plan.

                           DEFERRALS AND CONTRIBUTIONS

4.1       Elective  Deferrals.  An Eligible  Individual may irrevocably elect to
          defer, on a pre-tax basis, all or a portion (in whole  percentages) of
          his or her  Compensation  at the time  permitted  under  Section  4.3.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the amount of an Eligible Individual's
          Compensation  eligible  for  deferral  in a given  Plan Year shall not
          exceed  his  or  her   Compensation  and  Bonus  reduced  by  Required
          Withholdings with respect to such Compensation.  Such an election is a
          separate  and   independent   election   from  an  election  to  defer
          compensation under the Qualified Plan.

4.2       Bonus Deferrals. An Eligible Individual may irrevocably elect to defer
          all  or a  portion  of  his  or  her  Bonus  (in  whole  percentages).
          Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the amount of an Eligible Individual's
          Bonus  eligible for deferral in a given Plan Year shall not exceed the
          Bonus  reduced  by the sum of any  pre-tax  contributions  made to the
          Qualified  Plan and the  amount  necessary  to  satisfy  any  Required
          Withholdings with respect to such Bonus.

4.3      Elections.

          (a)  Time for Making Deferral Elections.

               (i)  Elective  Deferrals.

          (A)  Generally.  An  election to defer  Compensation  shall be made no
               later  than the  last  day of the  calendar  year  preceding  the
               calendar  year in  which  the  Compensation  is  earned,  or such
               earlier date as the Administrator shall designate.

          (B)  Newly Eligible Individuals. In the case of an Eligible Individual
               in his or her first year of  employment or service as a member of
               the Board,  as the case may be, or in the case of an Employee who
               becomes an Eligible Individual during a Plan Year, an election to
               defer Compensation must be made within 30 days after the Eligible
               Individual begins employment or such service, as the case may be,
               or becomes  eligible,  and at least five business days before the
               commencement  of the first payroll  period for which the election
               is effective.  For  Compensation  earned in such Plan Year,  such
               elections are effective only with respect to Compensation  earned
               after the effective date of the election.

                                       5

               (ii) Bonus  Deferrals.  An election to defer Bonuses must be made
                    no later  than  June 30 of the  calendar  year to which  the
                    Bonus relates.

               (iii)Rolling Deferrals. A timely filed and completed election for
                    Elective   and/or  Bonus   Deferrals  shall  also  apply  to
                    Compensation   and/or  Bonus,   as  applicable,   earned  in
                    subsequent   Plan  Years  until  changed  or  revoked  by  a
                    Participant  in  accordance  with  Section  4.3(b),  or  the
                    Participant  otherwise  ceases to be eligible to participate
                    in the Plan.

          (b)  Deferral Forms;  Revocation or Change of Deferral  Election.  All
               Deferral  Forms for Elective and Bonus  Deferrals  must be timely
               filed or  otherwise  submitted  in the manner and in such form as
               prescribed  by the  Administrator.  Except  as  provided  in this
               subsection (b), from and after the last date permitted for making
               such elections, all deferral elections pursuant to this Article 4
               shall be irrevocable.

               (i)  An Eligible Individual may change or revoke a prior election
                    up to the date established  under Section 4.3(a)(i) or (ii),
                    as applicable.

               (ii) Notwithstanding  the  provisions of Sections 4.1 and 4.2, to
                    the extent  permitted  under Code Section 409A and the rules
                    and regulations  promulgated  thereunder,  a Participant may
                    revoke  his or her  Elective  Deferral  election  made under
                    Section  4.3(a) after the  commencement  of the Plan Year to
                    which the  election  relates by filing an  election to cease
                    Elective  Deferrals;   provided,   however,  that  (A)  such
                    revocation shall apply solely to Compensation not yet earned
                    as  of  the  date   the   revocation   is  filed   with  the
                    Administrator,  and (B) a Participant who revokes his or her
                    Elective  Deferral  election under this subsection (b) shall
                    not be entitled  to make a new  Elective  Deferral  election
                    until  the Plan Year  that  begins at least 12 months  after
                    such revocation.

                                   ARTICLE 5
                            ACCOUNTS AND INVESTMENTS

5.1       Accounts.  The  Administrator  shall  establish  an  Account  for each
          Participant to reflect Elective Deferrals and Bonus Deferrals made for
          the Participant's  benefit,  together with any adjustments for income,
          gains  or  losses  and  any  payments   from  the  Account.   Separate
          sub-accounts  may be  established  for  Elective  Deferrals  and Bonus
          Deferrals,  if any,  and to reflect,  among other  items,  the various
          investment  funds,  separate deferral periods and/or forms of payment.
          Elective  Deferrals  shall be credited  as of the end of each  payroll
          period or, in the case of Outside  Directors,  when  payment for Board
          and  Board  committee  fees  would  otherwise  be paid to the  Outside
          Directors,  and Bonus  Deferrals  shall be  credited as of the date on
          which the Bonus would  otherwise be paid. The Accounts are established
          solely  for  the  purposes  of  tracking  Elective  Deferrals,   Bonus
          Deferrals and any income adjustments  thereto.  The Accounts shall not
          be used to  segregate  assets for payment of any  amounts  deferred or
          allocated  under the Plan, and shall not constitute or be treated as a
          trust fund of any kind.

5.2       Investments.

     (a)  Hypothetical  Investments.  Amounts  credited  to  each  Participant's
          Account shall be deemed invested, in accordance with the Participant's
          directions,  in one or more  hypothetical  investment  funds  that are
          available under the Plan. The hypothetical  investment funds available
          under the Plan shall be those  designated  by the  Administrator  from
          time  to  time in its  discretion.  If a  Participant  does  not  make
          investment  elections  with respect to amounts  credited to his or her
          Account,  such amounts shall be deemed  invested in such  hypothetical
          investment funds as the Administrator may direct.  Notwithstanding any
          provision in the Plan to the contrary,  earnings and losses based on a
          Participant's  investment  elections  shall  begin to accrue as of the
          date such  Participant's  Elective  Deferrals and Bonus Deferrals,  if
          any,  are  credited  to his  or her  Account.  The  Administrator  may
          promulgate   uniform  and   nondiscriminatory   rules  and  procedures
          governing investment elections under the Plan.

     (b)  Time for Selecting  Investments.  A Participant  shall make his or her
          hypothetical investment fund elections at such time as he or she files
          the Deferral  Form,  as described in Article 4.  Investment  elections
          must be made in whole percentages. A Participant may change his or her
          investment  elections at any time, or may reallocate  amounts invested
          among the  hypothetical  investment funds available under the Plan, by
          directing  the  Administrator  in such  form  and at such  time as the
          Administrator shall require.

     (c)  Account  Charges.  Unless the  Administrator,  in its sole discretion,
          decides   otherwise,   investment   expenses  for  each  Participant's
          sub-account  shall be debited  against  each  respective  sub-account.
          Other Plan  charges and  administrative  expenses  will be paid by the
          Employer without debit against Participant Accounts.

     5.3  Statements.  At least once each Plan Year, the  Administrator  (or its
          designee)  shall  provide the  Participant  with a  statement  of such
          Participant's  Account reflecting the deemed income,  gains and losses
          (realized and unrealized), amounts of deferrals and distributions with
          respect to such Account since the prior statement.

                                    VESTING

         Subject to the  provisions of Section 7.5, a  Participant  shall at all
times have a fully vested and nonforfeitable right to all Elective Deferrals and

deemed income, gains and losses attributable thereto.

                            DISTRIBUTION OF ACCOUNTS

7.1       Election as to Time and Form of Payment.

     (a)  Initial Distribution Elections.  Except as otherwise permitted in this
          Article 7, a Participant's  Account will be paid to the Participant in
          a single lump sum as soon as  administratively  practicable  after the
          occurrence  of a  Distribution  Event.  However,  in the case of a Key
          Employee who has a termination of employment Distribution Event (other
          than due to death or  Disability)  while any stock of the  Employer is
          publicly  traded on an  established  securities  market or  otherwise,
          distribution  of  Non-Grandfathered  Deferrals may not be made earlier
          than six months after the date of the termination of employment (or if
          the  Participant  dies during such six month period,  earlier than the
          date of the Participant's death).  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  the
          Administrator  may  promulgate  uniform  and  nondiscriminatory  rules
          pursuant to which a Participant may elect an alternate  payment option
          or later payment  commencement  date  permitted  below with respect to
          amounts deferred pursuant to the Participant's  Deferral Election,  by
          filing  a  written  request  with  the  Administrator  as part of such
          Deferral  Election or as otherwise  permitted by the  Administrator no
          later  than the last  day for  filing  such  Deferral  Election  under
          Section 4.3(b). To the extent permitted under rules established by the
          Administrator,  such an  election  may  separately  specify  different
          payment   options  or  payment   commencement   dates  for   different
          Distribution Events.

     (b)  Payment Options. The distribution options available under the Plan are
          (i) a single lump sum, or (ii) annual  installments paid over a period
          of up to ten years, as elected by the  Participant,  provided that the
          amount of the Participant's Account balance to be paid in installments
          is at least  $25,000  at the time  distribution  is to begin  (or such
          lesser  amount as may be required  for a cash-out  distribution  under
          Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder). If a Participant elects
          to receive payment of his Account in annual installments,  each annual
          amount  shall  consist  of an amount  equal to (A) the  balance of the
          Account on or about the annual payment date times (B) a fraction,  the
          numerator of which is one and the  denominator  of which is the number
          of remaining  installment years (including the year of the installment
          being  paid).   Each  installment  shall  be  paid  on  or  about  the
          anniversary of the first payment,  and any remaining  Account  balance
          shall  continue to be invested in  accordance  with the  Participant's
          investment  elections as described  above.  Any such election shall be
          made in  accordance  with  procedures  and  rules  established  by the
          Administrator.

     (c)  Subsequent  Changes  in  Distribution  for  Grandfathered   Deferrals.
          Subject to the approval of the Administrator, a Participant may change
          the form of distribution or defer the payment commencement date of his
          or her  Grandfathered  Deferrals by filing an election in the form and
          manner prescribed by the Administrator; provided that such election is
          made  before  termination  of the  Participant's  employment  or Board
          service,  as the case may be, and at least  twelve  months  before the
          date payment is otherwise scheduled to commence. In no event, however,
          may a Participant  defer payment of Grandfathered  Deferrals to a date
          that is more than one year following such termination. A Participant's
          distribution  election shall become irrevocable upon the Participant's
          termination of employment or Board service.

     (d)  Subsequent  Changes in Distribution for  Non-Grandfathered  Deferrals.
          The Administrator may promulgate uniform and  nondiscriminatory  rules
          pursuant to which a Participant may elect an alternate  payment option
          or a later payment  commencement date of  Non-Grandfathered  Deferrals
          after the initial Deferral Election.  Such a change election shall not
          take effect until at least twelve months after the date on which it is
          made and shall be effective only if (1) the election is filed with the
          Administrator  before the  Participant's  termination of employment or
          Board  service;  (2) the election  does not  accelerate  the timing or
          payment  schedule of any  distribution;  (3) the payment  commencement
          date in the change election is not less than five years after the date
          the  distribution  would otherwise have commenced for the Distribution
          Event  without  regard  to such  election;  and (d) the  Administrator
          approves such election.  In no event, however, may a Participant elect
          a payment commencement date for Non-Grandfathered Deferrals later than
          (i)  April  1 of the  calendar  year  after  the  year  in  which  the
          Participant  attains  age 70 1/2,  or (ii) the  Participant's  date of
          termination of employment or Board service,  if later (or, in the case
          of a Key  Employee as described  in Section  7.1(a),  six months after
          such  Participant's  termination of employment (or if the  Participant
          dies  during  such six  month  period,  the date of the  Participant's
          death)).

                                       8

     (e)  Termination of Employment or Board Service.  For purposes of the Plan,
          a Participant who is an Employee shall  terminate  employment when the
          Participant  separates  from  service  with  all  Employers.  However,
          temporary  absence  from  employment  because  of  illness,  vacation,
          approved  leaves of absences,  and transfers of  employment  among the
          Employers  shall not be considered a  termination  of employment or an
          interruption of employment.  A Participant who is an Outside  Director
          shall  terminate  service with the Board when he resigns or is removed
          from Board service or the effective date of his or her  termination as
          director if the Participant is not re-elected to serve on the Board.

7.2       Death.

     (a)  If a Participant dies before payment or complete  distribution (in the
          case  of  installment  payouts)  of his or her  Account,  all  amounts
          credited  to  the   Participant's   Account   shall  be  paid  to  the
          Participant's  designated Beneficiary,  according to the Participant's
          payment  election,  as  described  in Section  7.1  above,  unless the
          Administrator   elects,   in  its  sole  discretion,   to  pay  out  a
          Participant's  Grandfathered Deferrals in a single lump sum as soon as
          practicable  following  notification of the date of the  Participant's
          death.

     (b)  A Participant may designate a Beneficiary or Beneficiaries,  including
          contingent  Beneficiaries,  by notifying the Administrator in writing,
          at any time before the  Participant's  death,  on a form prescribed by
          the  Administrator  for  that  purpose.  A  married   Participant  may
          designate  someone  other  than  his or  her  spouse  as  Beneficiary,
          provided  the  Participant  obtains the written  consent of his or her
          spouse.  Spousal consent shall only be effective if it is witnessed by
          a notary public and no designation shall be valid or effective without
          such spousal  consent,  if  applicable.  A Participant  may revoke any
          Beneficiary  designation or designate a new Beneficiary  (with spousal
          consent,  if  applicable)  at  any  time  without  the  consent  of  a
          Beneficiary or any other person. If no Beneficiary is designated or no
          Beneficiary  survives the  Participant,  payment  shall be made to the
          Participant's  surviving  spouse,  or, if none,  to the  Participant's
          estate.

7.3       Scheduled In-Service Distribution.  A Participant may elect to receive
          a scheduled  in-service  distribution  with  respect to an Elective or
          Bonus  Deferral  at the time he or she files the  applicable  Deferral
          Form.   Such  election  shall  specify  the  time  for  the  scheduled
          in-service   distribution   without   regard  to  the   occurrence  or
          non-occurrence   of  a  triggering   event.  A  scheduled   in-service
          distribution  may not be made until three years have elapsed since the
          close of the Plan Year to which the  Elective  and/or  Bonus  Deferral
          relates. Any scheduled in-service distribution shall be made in a cash
          lump sum payment. An election for a scheduled in-service  distribution
          shall automatically  terminate upon the Participant's  retirement (for
          purposes of the Qualified Plan) or other Distribution  Event, at which
          time the provisions of Section 7.1 shall govern.

                                       9
<PAGE>


                    A Participant  may,  with the consent of the  Administrator,
          elect to (a)  terminate a scheduled  in-service  distribution,  or (b)
          extend  to a later  date  the  date on  which a  scheduled  in-service
          distribution   will   occur,   provided   that,   in   the   case   of
          Non-Grandfathered  Deferrals,  the  deferred  date of  such  scheduled
          in-service  distribution  may not be earlier than five years after the
          date such in-service  distribution was otherwise scheduled to be made.
          A Participant  may make an election  under the  preceding  sentence by
          filing  a new  election,  at  such  time  and  in  such  form  as  the
          Administrator shall designate,  at least twelve months before the date
          such scheduled  in-service  distribution  would  otherwise  occur.  An
          election to revoke or defer a scheduled in-service distribution may be
          made during the election period for making deferral  elections for the
          Plan Year, as provided in Section 4.1,  provided it is timely made. No
          more than one such  revocation  or extension  shall be permitted  with
          respect to any scheduled in-service distribution.

7.4       Hardship Distributions.

          (a)  A  Participant  may  request  that all or a portion of his or her
               Account  balance  be  distributed  at any  time by  submitting  a
               written   request  to  the   Administrator,   provided  that  the
               Participant  has  incurred a Hardship,  and the  distribution  is
               necessary to alleviate such Hardship.  In determining whether the
               Hardship   distribution   request   should   be   approved,   the
               Administrator  shall  be  entitled  to rely on the  Participant's
               representation that the Hardship cannot be alleviated:

               (i)  through   reimbursement  or  compensation  by  insurance  or
                    otherwise;

               (ii) by reasonable liquidation of the Participant's assets (other
                    than assets under the Qualified Plan, if available),  to the
                    extent such liquidation  would not itself cause an immediate
                    and heavy financial need; or

               (iii)by  cessation  of  contributions  under  the Plan and  other
                    deferred compensation arrangements.

          (b)  The  Administrator  shall deem a distribution  to be necessary to
               alleviate a Hardship if the  distribution is not in excess of the
               amount of the  Participant's  Hardship,  plus taxes  attributable
               thereto.  The Account balance that is not distributed pursuant to
               the Hardship  request shall remain in the Plan.  Distributions to
               alleviate  a  Hardship  will be made as soon as  administratively
               feasible  after the  Administrator  has reviewed and approved the
               request.  Elective Deferrals will be suspended effective with the
               beginning   of  the  pay  period   following   the  date  of  the
               Administrator's  approval  of the  request and may not be resumed
               until the Plan Year that begins at least twelve months later.

7.5       Early  Distribution of Grandfathered  Deferrals.  Notwithstanding  the
          foregoing  provisions  of this  Article VII or the  provisions  of any
          applicable  deferral  election,  solely to the extent  permitted under
          Code  Section  409A and  regulations  thereunder  with  respect to the
          Participant's  Grandfathered  Deferrals,  a  Participant  may elect to
          receive a lump-sum payment of any or all of his or her Account balance
          before the date  prescribed in Section  7.1(a).  Such payment shall be
          made  as soon as  practicable  following  the  date  as of  which  the
          Participant  requests such payment.  The Administrator  shall impose a
          penalty  for such  early  payment,  in an  amount  equal to 10% of the
          Account balance to be distributed,  and such penalty shall be deducted
          from the distribution and forfeited by the Participant.

                                       10
<PAGE>

7.6       Right of Offset.  The  Corporation  shall have the right to offset any
          amounts  payable  to a  Participant  under  the  Plan  by  any  amount
          necessary to reimburse an Employer for  liabilities  or obligations of
          the Participant to the Employer, including for amounts misappropriated
          by the Participant.

7.7       Taxes.  All  federal,  state or  local  taxes  that the  Administrator
          determines are required to be withheld from any payments made pursuant
          to this Article 7 shall be withheld.

                                   ARTICLE 8
                               PLAN ADMINISTRATION

8.1       Plan  Administration and  Interpretation.  Unless the Board determines
          otherwise,  the Administrative Committee appointed for purposes of the
          Qualified  Plan  shall be the  Administrator  and shall  have the same
          authority and powers as prescribed to it under the Qualified Plan. The
          Administrator  shall have the final authority and  responsibility  and
          complete  discretion to interpret and construe the Plan, and to decide
          all  matters  arising   thereunder,   including  without   limitation,
          questions of eligibility for participation,  eligibility for benefits,
          the  validity of any  election  made under the Plan,  the value of any
          Account balance, and the timing, method and amount of the distribution
          thereof.   Benefits   under  the  Plan  shall  be  paid  only  if  the
          Administrator  decides in its discretion that the Eligible Individual,
          Participant   or   Beneficiary   is   entitled   to  them.   All  such
          interpretations  or  decisions  by the  Administrator  shall be final,
          conclusive  and binding on all  Participants  and any  Beneficiary  or
          other person claiming under or through any Participant, in the absence
          of clear and convincing  evidence that the Committee acted arbitrarily
          and  capriciously.  The Committee  shall have the authority to deviate
          from the literal terms of the Plan to the extent it shall determine to
          be necessary or appropriate to operate the Plan in compliance with the
          provisions  of  applicable   law.  Any   individual   serving  on  the
          Administrative  Committee,  or as Administrator,  who is a Participant
          will not vote or act on any  matter  relating  solely  to  himself  or
          herself. When making a determination or calculation, the Administrator
          shall be entitled to rely on information furnished by a Participant, a
          Beneficiary,  the  Employer or a trustee (if any).  The  Administrator
          shall have the  responsibility  for  complying  with any reporting and
          disclosure requirements of ERISA.

                                       11
<PAGE>

          The Administrative Committee may appoint one or more officers or other
          appropriate  employees of the Corporation to act as  Administrator  of
          the  Plan,  and may  further  delegate  such  specific  administrative
          responsibilities  to officers or other  appropriate  employees  of the
          Corporation  as  it  deems  appropriate.   Any  action  taken  by  the
          Administrator  within the scope of his or her authority under the Plan
          shall be final,  conclusive  and binding on all  Participants  and any
          Beneficiary or other person claiming under or through any Participant,
          in the absence of clear and convincing evidence that the Administrator
          acted arbitrarily and capriciously; provided, however, that a decision
          permitted to be made under the terms of the Plan in the best interests
          of the Company shall (subject to the  following) be final,  conclusive
          and binding on all persons whomsoever; and provided, further, that the
          Committee may, in its discretion, review any such action.

8.2       Information. To enable the Administrator to perform its functions, the
          Employer shall supply full and timely information to the Administrator
          on all matters  relating to the  compensation of  Participants,  their
          employment, death, termination of employment, and such other pertinent
          facts as the Administrator may require.

8.3       Indemnification of Administrator. The Employer agrees to indemnify and
          to defend to the fullest extent permitted by law any director, officer
          or employee who serves as Administrator (including any such individual
          who  formerly  served  as  Administrator)   against  all  liabilities,
          damages,  costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and
          amounts paid in settlement  of any claims  approved by the Employer in
          writing  in  advance)  occasioned  by any  act or  omission  to act in
          connection with the Plan, if such act or omission is in good faith.

8.4       Claims Procedure. A Participant or Beneficiary shall have the right to
          file a claim,  inquire if he has any right to benefits and the amounts
          thereof, or appeal the denial of a claim. Benefits under the Plan will
          be paid only if the Administrator decides, in its discretion, that the
          claimant is entitled to them.

          (a)  Initial  Claim.  A claim will be considered  filed when a written
               communication  is made  by the  Participant,  Beneficiary  or his
               authorized  representative to the Administrator (the "claimant").
               The  Administrator  shall,  within 90 days of the  receipt of the
               claim,  either  allow or deny the  claim in  writing.  The  claim
               denial shall include:  (1) the specific reason or reasons for the
               denial;  (2) specific  references to pertinent Plan provisions on
               which the denial is based;  (3) a description  of any  additional
               material or information necessary for the claimant to perfect the
               claim and an  explanation  of why such material or information is
               necessary;  and (4) an  explanation  of the Plan's  claim  review
               procedure, including a statement of the claimant's right to bring
               a civil action under ERISA Section  502(a)  following a denial of
               the claim upon review.

          (b)  Appeal of Denied Claim. If a claim is wholly or partially denied,
               the claimant may file an appeal  requesting the  Administrator to
               conduct  a full and  fair  review.  The  claimant  must  file his
               written  appeal no more than 60 days  after he  receives  written
               notice of the denial.  The claimant may review or receive copies,
               upon request and free of charge, any documents,  records or other
               information "relevant" (within the meaning of Department of Labor
               Regulation Section 2560.503-1(m)(8)) to the claimant's claim. The
               claimant may also submit written comments, documents, records and
               other information  relating to his claim. The Administrator shall
               take into  account  all  comments,  documents,  records and other
               information  submitted  by the  claimant  relating  to the claim,
               without  regard to whether  such  information  was  submitted  or
               considered   in   the   initial   review   of  the   claim.   The
               Administrator's decision on appeal shall be given to the claimant
               in writing no later than 60 days following receipt of the appeal.
               However, if the Administrator,  in its sole discretion,  grants a
               hearing,  or  there  are  special  circumstances   involved,  the
               decision will be given no later than 120 days after receiving the
               appeal.  If such an  extension  of time for  review is  required,
               written  notice  of  the  extension  shall  be  furnished  to the
               claimant  before the initial 60 days  expires and shall  indicate
               the special circumstances  requiring an extension of time and the
               date  by  which  the  Administrator  expects  to  render  a final
               decision.  Benefits  under  the  Plan  will be  paid  only if the
               Administrator  decides in its  discretion  that the  claimant  is
               entitled to them.  The written  decision on appeal  shall be in a
               manner  calculated  to be  understood  by the  claimant and shall
               include:  (1) the specific reason or reasons for the denial;  (2)
               specific  references  to pertinent  Plan  provisions on which the
               denial is based; (3) a statement that the claimant is entitled to
               receive,  upon request and free of charge,  reasonable access to,
               and  copies  of,  all  documents,  records  or other  information
               relevant to the  claimant's  claim;  and (4) a  statement  of the
               claimant's  right to bring a civil  action  under  ERISA  Section
               502(a) following a denial of the claim upon review.

                            AMENDMENT AND TERMINATION

9.1       Authority  to  Amend  and  Terminate.  Subject  to  Section  9.2,  the
          Administrator  shall have the right to amend or terminate  the Plan at
          any time. If the Plan is  terminated  and a trust is  established  (as
          described  in Section  10.1),  the Board may (a) elect to  continue to
          maintain the trust to pay benefits  hereunder as they become due as if
          the Plan had not  terminated,  or (b) solely to the  extent  permitted
          under Code Section 409A and regulations thereunder, direct the trustee
          to pay promptly to Participants (or their  Beneficiaries)  the balance
          of their Accounts.

9.2       Existing  Rights.  No  amendment  or  termination  of the  Plan  shall
          adversely affect the rights of any Participant with respect to amounts
          that have been credited to his or her Account  before the later of the
          date  such   amendment  or   termination   is  adopted  or  effective.
          Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Administrator may amend the Plan as
          necessary to address changes in applicable law in order to assure that
          amounts  contributed to the Plan are not subject to federal income tax
          prior to distribution or withdrawal,  which amendment may (among other
          things) limit a Participant's  ability to withdraw amounts  previously
          credited  to his or her Account  prior to  termination  of  employment
          and/or limit previously available methods of distribution.

                                   ARTICLE 10
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

10.1      No  Funding.  The  Corporation  intends  that the Plan  constitute  an
          "unfunded" plan for tax purposes and for purposes of Title I of ERISA;
          provided that the  Administrator  may authorize the creation of trusts
          and deposit therein cash or other property, or make other arrangements
          to meet the Corporation's  obligations under the Plan. Any such trusts
          or other  arrangements shall be consistent with the unfunded status of
          the Plan,  unless  the  Administrator  otherwise  determines  with the
          consent of each Participant.

10.2      General  Creditor  Status.  The Plan constitutes a mere promise by the
          Corporation  and any Employer to make payments in accordance  with the
          terms of the Plan and  Participants and  Beneficiaries  shall have the
          status of  general  unsecured  creditors  of the  Corporation  and all
          Employers.  Nothing in the Plan will be construed to give any employee
          or any other person rights to any specific assets of the  Corporation,
          an Employer or of any other person.

                                       13

10.3      Non-assignability.  None of the benefits, payments, proceeds or claims
          of any Participant or Beneficiary shall be subject to any claim of any
          creditor of any  Participant  or Beneficiary  and, in particular,  the
          same shall not be subject to attachment or  garnishment or other legal
          process by any creditor of such Participant or Beneficiary,  nor shall
          any Participant or Beneficiary have any right to alienate, anticipate,
          commute, pledge, encumber or assign any of the benefits or payments or
          proceeds  that  he or she  may  expect  to  receive,  contingently  or
          otherwise under the Plan.

10.4      Satisfaction  of  Claims;  Unclaimed  Benefits.  Any  payment  to  any
          Participant or  Beneficiary  in accordance  with the provisions of the
          Plan shall,  to the extent  thereof,  be in full  satisfaction  of all
          claims under the Plan against the Employer,  the  Administrator  and a
          trustee  (if any) under the Plan,  and the  Administrator  may require
          such  Participant  or  Beneficiary,  as a condition  precedent to such
          payment,  to  execute a receipt  and  release to such  effect.  If any
          Participant or Beneficiary  is determined by the  Administrator  to be
          incompetent  by reason of  physical  or mental  disability  (including
          minority) to give a valid receipt and release,  the  Administrator may
          cause the payment or payments  becoming  due to such person to be made
          to another person for his or her benefit without responsibility on the
          part of the  Administrator,  the  Employer  or a  trustee  (if any) to
          follow the application of such funds. In the case of a benefit payable
          on behalf of a Participant,  if the  Administrator is unable to locate
          the  Participant or beneficiary to whom such benefit is payable,  upon
          the  Administrator's  determination  thereof,  such  benefit  shall be
          forfeited  to  the  Corporation.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if
          subsequent to any such  forfeiture  the  Participant or Beneficiary to
          whom such  benefit is payable  makes a valid  claim for such  benefit,
          such  forfeited   benefit  shall  be  restored  to  the  Plan  by  the
          Corporation.

10.5      Governing  Law  and   Severability.   The  Plan  shall  be  construed,
          administered,and governed in all respects under and by the laws of the
          Commonwealth  of  Virginia.  If any  provision  is held by a court  of
          competent  jurisdiction to be invalid or unenforceable,  the remaining
          provisions hereof shall continue to be fully effective.

10.6      Not a Contract  of  Employment  or Board  Service.  The  adoption  and
          maintenance  of the Plan shall not be deemed to be a contract  between
          the Employer and any person or to be consideration  for the employment
          or service of any person.  Nothing  contained in the Plan shall confer
          upon any person a right to be employed or to continue in the employ of
          an Employer, or to interfere,  in any way, with an Employer's right to
          terminate,  with or without cause,  the employment of a Participant in
          the Plan at any time.  Similarly,  nothing contained in the Plan shall
          be deemed to give a  Participant  who is a member  of the  Board,  the
          right to remain in the  service  of the  Board or  interfere  with the
          right  of  the   Corporation  or  its   shareholders  to  remove  such
          Participant from Board service at any time.

10.7      Severability.  If any  provision of this Plan shall be held illegal or
          invalid for any reason, said illegality or invalidity shall not affect
          the remaining provisions of the Plan; but instead each provision shall
          be fully  severable and the Plan shall be construed and enforced as if
          said illegal or invalid provision had never been included herein.
