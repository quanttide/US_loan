Item 8. Other Events.

On December 17, 2004, we, Integrated Surgical Systems, Inc., were served with a
summons and complaint commenced in the Yolo County (California) Superior Court,
styled Bischoff, et al. v. Integrated Surgical Systems, et al. The plaintiffs in
this litigation, all from Germany, allege that our ROBODOC(R) System is
defective and dangerous, both in its manufacture and design and, as a result of
such defect and dangerous condition, the plaintiffs, all of whom were subjected
to medical treatment utilizing the ROBODOC System, sustained injury. The
plaintiffs are seeking class action status for this matter.

We believe the plaintiff's allegations are without merit. We intend to conduct a
vigorous defense against the allegations contained in the complaint. However, we
do not have any product liability insurance currently in effect, our coverage
having been terminated in June 2004, due to our financial inability to pay the
requisite insurance premiums.

Defending against a product liability action can be expensive and time consuming
to management personnel. We currently do not have the funds which may be
necessary to defend our company against the plaintiffs' allegations. The failure
to properly defend our company against the allegations could result in a
material judgment against our company which could adversely affect our financial
condition and results of operations. We also currently may not have the funds
necessary to satisfy any judgment rendered against us. Our failure to
successfully defend against the allegations could result in our seeking
protection under the United States Bankruptcy Code. Such action could have a
material adverse affect on the market price of our common stock.

This case is at its incipient stages. Our company intends to retain competent
counsel to represent us in this matter. The amount of damages, if any, are
indeterminable at this juncture, especially since our company believes it has
meritorious defenses to this action.
