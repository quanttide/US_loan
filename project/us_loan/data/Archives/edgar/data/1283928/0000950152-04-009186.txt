ITEM  1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

ITEM 2.03.  Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

      On December 23, 2004, Kahiki Foods, Inc. ("Kahiki") consummated
Convertible Note Purchase Agreement dated December 21, 2004 (the "Purchase
Agreement") with Townsends, Inc. ("Townsends"), pursuant to which Kahiki issued
a $1,000,000 Convertible Promissory Note due December 31, 2009 (the "Note") to
Townsends. The Note bears interest at the rate of 5% per annum, which accrues to
maturity, and is convertible into Preferred Stock, to be authorized, or Common
Stock, at a conversion price of $2.25 per share.

      In connection with the Purchase Agreement, Kahiki and Townsends have also
entered into (i) a Supply Agreement pursuant to which Kahiki will purchase a
minimum of 20,000 pounds and a maximum of 40,000 pounds per week of chicken
products from Townsends at current market prices less $0.09; and (ii) a Co-pack
and Storage Agreement pursuant to which Kahiki will manufacture finished poultry
products for Townsends on a cost plus 10% basis.

      Under the Purchase Agreement, Townsends will acquire a second $1,000,000
Note under the same terms upon (i) Kahiki obtaining financing in the amount of
at least $2,000,000; (ii) Kahiki receiving all approvals necessary to occupy and
operate its Gahanna, Ohio manufacturing facility; and (iii) Kahiki having
transferred substantially all of its operations to the Gahanna, Ohio
manufacturing facility. Kahiki is also obligated to seek shareholder approval of
an amendment to Kahiki's Articles of Incorporation to authorize Convertible
Preferred Stock at the next annual meeting of Kahiki's shareholders. It is
anticipated that Townsends will convert the Note(s) to Preferred Stock upon
shareholder approval of the amendment. The Preferred Stock will provide for
cumulative annual dividends at an annual rate of $.1125 per share, will be
convertible into Common Stock on a share for share basis (subject to
anti-dilution rights), will have a liquidation preference of 1.5 times the
invested amount, and will entitle Townsends to appoint up to 2 members of
Kahiki's Board of Directors. A copy of the Purchase Agreement is attached hereto
as Exhibit 10.1 and a copy of the Note is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2, each
of which are incorporated herein by reference.

      In connection with these transactions, Kahiki and Townsends entered into a
Registration Rights Agreement. Under this agreement, Kahiki is required to file
a registration statement with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on
demand by Townsends between December 21, 2005 and December 20, 2009, for the
purpose of registering the resale of shares of Common Stock into which the Notes
and Preferred Stock may be converted. A copy of the registration Rights
Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein by
reference.

      On December 23, 2004, Kahiki completed the issuance of a Term Promissory
Note dated December 17, 2004 (the "Term Note") to Key Bank National Association.
The Term Note is in the amount of $2,232,000 and matures on June 20, 2012. The
Term Note is secured by a Commercial Security Agreement and an Open-End Mortgage
on Kahiki's Gahanna, Ohio

<PAGE>

manufacturing facility and equipment. A copy of the term Note is attached hereto
as Exhibit 10.6

      Kahiki intends to use the proceeds of these transactions for general
corporate purposes, including payment of costs associated with the opening of
Kahiki's new Gahanna, Ohio manufacturing facility.

ITEM  4.01. Changes in Registrant and Certifying Accountant.

      On December 20, 2004, the Board of Directors of Kahiki, on the
recommendation of its audit committee, dismissed Child, Sullivan & Company as
its principal independent accountants. Neither Child, Sullivan & Company's
report on Kahiki's financial statements for its most recent fiscal years nor GBQ
Partners LLP (Kahiki's previous principal independent account) report on
Kahiki's financial statements for its fiscal year ended March 31, 2003,
contained an adverse opinion or disclaimer of accounting principles. During
Kahiki's two most recent fiscal years for which Child Sullivan & Company or GBQ
Partners LLC issued an audit report, there were no disagreements between Kahiki
and such accountants on any matters of accounting principles or practices,
financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which if not
resolved to the former accountant's satisfaction, would have caused them to make
reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection with their
reports.

      Kahiki has requested that Child, Sullivan & Company furnish it with a
letter addressed to the SEC stating whether it agrees with the above statements.
A copy of Child, Sullivan & Company's letter to the SEC, dated December 22,
2004, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.

      On December 20, 2004, the Board of Directors of Kahiki, on the
recommendation of its audit committee, engaged Plante & Moran, PLLC as its
principal accountant to audit Kahiki's financial statements for its fiscal year
ending March 31, 2005.

                  as true and complete as of the Second Closing as though such

                  does not withdraw such supplement within two (2) days
                  thereafter, the Purchaser shall have no obligation to purchase
                  the Second Closing Note;

                  prospects, condition (financial or otherwise), assets or
                  liabilities of the Company, regardless of whether or not such
                  events or changes are inconsistent with the representations
                  and warranties given herein by the Company, except changes
                  contemplated by this Agreement; and

                        (D) no action or proceeding by or before any
                  governmental authority has been instituted, or threatened (and
                  not subsequently settled, dismissed or otherwise terminated)
                  which can reasonably be expected to restrain, prohibit or
                  invalidate the transactions contemplated by this Agreement
                  other than an action or proceeding instituted or threatened by
                  the Purchaser;

and no rule of strict construction shall be applied against any Party.

      6.11 INTERPRETATION. Accounting terms used but not otherwise defined
herein shall have the meanings given to them under GAAP. As used in this
Agreement (including all Schedules, the Disclosure Letter, Exhibits and
amendments hereto), the masculine, feminine and neuter gender and the singular
or plural number shall be deemed to include the others whenever the context so
requires. References to Articles and Sections refer to articles and sections of

covenants hereunder shall be given independent effect so that if a certain
action or condition constitutes a default under a certain covenant, the fact
that such action or condition is permitted by another covenant shall not affect

remedies existing in their favor at Law or equity, including, without

reason, such provision, as to such jurisdiction, shall be ineffective, without
invalidating the remaining provisions of this Agreement or affecting the
validity or enforceability of this Agreement or affecting the validity or
enforceability of such provision in any other jurisdiction. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, if such provision could be more narrowly drawn so as not to be
invalid, prohibited or unenforceable in such jurisdiction, it shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be so narrowly drawn, without invalidating the remaining
provisions of this Agreement or affecting the validity or enforceability of such
provision in any other jurisdiction. This Agreement shall survive any conversion
of the Notes.

          DESIGNATION, POWERS, RIGHTS, PREFERENCES, QUALIFICATIONS, AND
                                   LIMITATIONS
                                       OF
                                    SERIES A
                                 PREFERRED STOCK



         At the next annual meeting of the shareholders of Kahiki Foods, Inc.
held after December __, 2004 (the "Closing Date"), Kahiki Foods shall adopt an
amendment to its Articles of Incorporation containing substantially the
following provisions:

1. Designation

         Of the 10,000,000 shares of capital stockauthorized to be issued by the
Kahiki Foods, Inc., an Ohio corporation (the "CORPORATION"), 9,000,000 SHALL BE
DESIGNATED COMMON STOCK WITH NO PAR VALUE AND 1,000,000 SHALL be designated as
Series A Convertible Preferred Stock, $0.01 par value. The Series A Convertible
Preferred Stock (the "SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK") shall rank senior to all other
classes of the Corporation's capital stock, including the Corporation's Common
Stock (the "COMMON STOCK") and all other classes of preferred stock
(collectively, the "JUNIOR STOCK") with respect to liquidation and dividend
rights. The Series A Preferred Stock shall have the powers, rights, preferences,
qualifications, and limitations set forth herein in this certificate (the
"CERTIFICATE OF DESIGNATION").

2. Dividends

         The holders of record of Series A Preferred Stock shall be each
entitled to receive, when and as declared by the Board of Directors out of funds
legally available therefor, cumulative dividends, compounding annually, at an
annual rate equal to $0.1125 per share, respectively, adjusted for any
combinations, consolidations, subdivisions, or stock splits with respect to such
shares (the "PREFERRED A DIVIDEND PREFERENCE"), payable annually on December 1
of each year (or the next business day thereafter) when and as declared by the
Board of Directors, in preference and priority to any payment of any dividend on
any shares of Junior Stock (other than those payable solely in Common Stock).
The Preferred A Dividend Preference may be payable in-cash or in additional
shares of Series A Preferred Stock at the option of the Board of Directors. If
an "EVENT OF NONCOMPLIANCE" (as defined in Section 6 below) occurs, then the
Preferred A Dividend Preference shall be increased as provided for in Section 6.
No dividend shall be paid on or declared and set apart with respect to the
Common Stock or any other class of Junior Stock unless and until cumulative
dividends on the Series A Preferred Stock shall have been paid or declared as
set forth herein and set apart during that fiscal year and any prior year in
which dividends were not paid. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if during any
fiscal year of the Corporation, the Corporation pays dividends (cash or
otherwise) to the holders of the Corporation's Common Stock, then the holders of
record of the Series A Preferred Stock shall also be entitled to receive

                                      -1-
<PAGE>

dividends in an amount equal to the amount of any dividend declared payable with
respect to each share of Common Stock multiplied by the number of shares of
Common Stock into which each share of Series A Preferred Stock is convertible
pursuant to Section 5 hereof, as of the record date for the determination of
holders of Common Stock and Series A Preferred Stock entitled to receive such
dividend. No dividend shall be declared or paid with respect to the Common Stock
unless such a dividend is declared and paid with respect to the Series A
Preferred Stock (as provided above). The record dates with respect to the
payment of dividends with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock arising from
such dividends paid on the Common Stock shall be the same as the record dates
with respect to the payment of dividends with respect to the Common Stock. The
right to such dividends shall be cumulative as to the Series A Preferred Stock.

3. Liquidation, Dissolution, or Winding Up

         In the event of a "LIQUIDATION EVENT" (as defined below), each holder
of Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to be paid out of the assets of
the Corporation available for distribution to holders of the Corporation's
capital stock, before any payment or declaration and setting apart for payment
of any amount shall be made in respect of the Corporation's Junior Stock, an
amount equal to the greater of (a) if the Liquidation Event occurs (i) prior to
December __, 2006, $3.375 per share, respectively (as adjusted to reflect any
share split, combination, reclassification, or similar event involving the
Series A Preferred Stock), plus all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon
(whether or not declared), up to and including the date when full payment shall
be tendered to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock with respect to such
Liquidation Event or (ii) on or after December __, 2006, $4.50 per share,
respectively (as adjusted to reflect any share split, combination,
reclassification, or similar event involving the Series A Preferred Stock), plus
all accrued but unpaid dividends thereon (whether or not declared), up to and
including the date when full payment shall be tendered to the holders of the
Series A Preferred Stock with respect to such Liquidation Event (either (i) or
(ii), the "LIQUIDATION PREFERENCE") and (b) the amount per share that the
holders of Series A Preferred Stock would have been entitled to receive if each
share of Series A Preferred Stock held by such holders had been converted into
Common Stock, pursuant to Section 5 hereof, immediately prior to the Liquidation
Event. If the assets of the Corporation shall be insufficient to permit the
payment in full to the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock of the
Liquidation Preference, then the entire assets of the Corporation available for
such distribution shall be distributed ratably among the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock in proportion to the Liquidation Preference that each such
holder is otherwise entitled to receive based upon the aggregate Liquidation
Preference of the Series A Preferred Stock held by each such holder and the
aggregate Liquidation Preference of all Series A Preferred Stock. After such
payment shall have been made in full to the holders of the Series A Preferred
Stock or funds necessary for such payment shall have been set aside by the
Corporation in trust for the account of holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
so as to be available for such payment, distributions may be made on the Junior
Stock. For purposes of this Section 3, a "LIQUIDATION EVENT" of this Corporation
shall be deemed to be occasioned by, or to include, by means of any transaction
or series of related transactions, any of the following: (A) any liquidation,
dissolution, or winding up of the Corporation, whether voluntary or involuntary;
(B) the acquisition of the stock of the Corporation by another entity or person
(including, without limitation, any reorganization, merger, or consolidation
but,

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

excluding any merger effected exclusively for the purpose of changing the
domicile of the Corporation), unless the Corporation's stockholders of record,
as constituted immediately prior to such acquisition will, immediately after
such acquisition (by virtue of securities issued or sold as consideration for
the Corporation's acquisition or otherwise), hold at least 50% of the voting
power of the surviving or acquiring entity; (C) the sale of all or substantially
all of the assets of the Corporation, unless the Corporation's stockholders of
record, as constituted immediately prior to such acquisition or sale will,
immediately after such acquisition or sale (by virtue of securities issued as
consideration for the Corporation's acquisition or sale or otherwise), hold at
least 50% of the voting power of the surviving or acquiring entity; or (D) the
Corporation's making an assignment for the benefit of creditors or commencing
any bankruptcy, dissolution, termination of corporate existence, or any similar
action. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the holders of at least fifty-one percent
(51%) of the outstanding Series A Preferred Stock voting together as a single
class (based on the number of shares held by the holders on an as-converted to
Common Stock basis) (the "CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED MAJORITY"), may waive any
Liquidation Event for purposes of the distributions set forth in this Section 3.

4. Voting Rights

         (a) Except as otherwise expressly required by law, each holder of
Series A Preferred Stock shall be entitled to vote on all matters submitted to a
vote of the holders of Common Stock and shall be entitled to that number of
votes equal to the maximum whole number of Common Stock into which such holder's
Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable, is convertible pursuant to the
provisions of Section 5 on the record date for the determination of stockholders
entitled to vote on such matter or, if no record date is established, on the
date such vote is taken or any written consent of stockholders is first
executed. Except as otherwise expressly provided below in this Section 4 or as
required by law and except for the voting rights of the holders of the Series A
Preferred Stock to elect a director of the Corporation pursuant to the Voting
Agreement dated as of the Closing Date, the holders of Series A Preferred Stock
and Common Stock shall vote together as a single class on all matters, and
neither the Common Stock nor any of the Series A Preferred Stock shall be
entitled to vote as a separate class on any matter to be voted on by
stockholders of the Corporation.

         (b) The Corporation shall not take any of the following actions without
the affirmative vote (in writing or at a meeting of holders of Series A
Preferred Stock) of the holders of at least the Convertible Preferred Majority:

                  (i) The Corporation shall not amend, alter, waive, or repeal
         the preferences, privileges, special rights, or other powers of the
         Series A Preferred Stock, as set forth herein;

                  (ii) The Corporation shall not increase or decrease (other
         than by conversion in accordance with this Certificate of Designation)
         the authorized number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock;

                                      -3-
<PAGE>

                  (iii) The Corporation shall not amend, waive or repeal any
         provisions of or add any provision to, the Corporation's Amended and
         Restated Articles of Incorporation or Code of Regulations;

                  (iv) declare or pay any dividend or other distribution upon
         any class of the Junior Stock;

                  (v) authorize or designate, whether by reclassification or
         otherwise, any new class or series of shares or any other securities
         convertible into equity securities of the Corporation that has rights,
         preferences, or privileges senior to or pari passu with the Series A
         Preferred Stock; or

                  (vi) increase the size of the Corporation's Board of
         Directors.

         (c) Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph (b) above, the actions
of the Corporation specified therein shall not require the separate affirmative
vote of Convertible Preferred Majority, if less than twenty-five percent (25%)
of the aggregate number of shares of Series A Preferred Stock theretofore issued
by the Corporation are at the time outstanding.

5. Conversion

         (a) Optional Conversion.

                  (i) Each holder of the Series A Preferred Stock may at any
         time, upon surrender of the certificates therefor, convert all or any
         portion of his or its Series A Preferred Stock into fully paid and
         nonassessable Common Stock of the Corporation, at the Series A
         Conversion Price set forth below, plus declared and unpaid dividends
         thereon.

                  (ii) Before any holder of Series A Preferred Stock shall be
         entitled to convert the same into full shares of Common Stock, such
         holder shall surrender the certificate or certificates therefor,
         endorsed or accompanied by written instrument or instruments of
         transfer, in form satisfactory to the Corporation, duly executed by the
         registered holder or by his, her or its attorney duly authorized in
         writing, at the office of the Corporation or of any transfer agent for
         the Series A Preferred Stock, and shall give written notice to the
         Corporation at its office that the holder elects to convert the same
         and shall state therein the holder's name or the names of the nominees
         in which the holder wishes the certificate or certificates for shares
         of Common Stock to be issued. As soon as practicable thereafter, the
         Corporation shall issue and deliver at its office to the holder of the
         Series A Preferred Stock, or to the holders nominee or nominees, a
         certificate or certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock to
         which the holder shall be entitled as aforesaid, together with cash in
         lieu of any fraction of a share. A conversion shall be deemed to have
         been made immediately prior to the close of business on the date of the
         surrender of the shares of Series A Preferred Stock to be converted,
         and the person or persons entitled to receive the shares of Common
         Stock issuable upon conversion shall be treated for all purposes as the
         record holder or holders of the shares of Common Stock at the close of
         business on that date. From and after that date, all rights of the
         holder with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock so converted shall
         terminate, except only the right of the holder

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

         to receive certificates for the number of shares of Common Stock
         issuable-upon conversion thereof and cash for fractional shares. No
         fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon conversion of
         the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional shares to which
         the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation shall pay cash
         equal to such fraction multiplied by the then-effective Conversion
         Price.

         (b) Automatic Conversion.

                  (i) All outstanding Series A Preferred Stock shall be (1)
         converted automatically and without the need for any action by the
         holders thereof, at the conversion ratio set forth below, plus declared
         and unpaid dividends thereon, into fully paid and nonassessable shares
         of Common Stock immediately upon and simultaneously with the
         achievement of the "MINIMUM COMMON PRICE" (as defined below) at any
         time after December __, 2005 or (2) converted automatically upon the
         affirmative vote of at least the Convertible Preferred Majority. The
         "MINIMUM COMMON PRICE" shall mean that the closing price of the
         Corporation's Common Stock (exclusive of any trades by the
         Corporation's officers, directors or five percent or greater
         stockholders) on any trading exchange or market for which shares of
         Common Stock of the Corporation are then primarily traded or sold,
         equals or exceeds $5.00 per share (adjusted for any combinations,
         consolidations, subdivisions, or stock splits with respect to such
         shares) for at least 180 consecutive trading days.

                  (ii) All holders of record of shares of Series A Preferred
         Stock will be given written notice of the date of any automatic
         conversion referenced in this Section 5(b). That notice will be sent by
         mail, first class, postage prepaid, to each record holder of Series A
         Preferred Stock at each holder's address appearing on the stock
         register. Promptly after receiving the notice, each holder of shares of
         Series A Preferred Stock shall surrender the holder's certificate or
         certificates for all affected shares to the Corporation at the place
         designated in the notice, and thereafter shall receive certificates for
         the number of shares of Common Stock or other securities to which the
         holder is entitled. Upon the date of any automatic conversion, all
         rights with respect to the Series A Preferred Stock will terminate,
         except only the rights of the holders thereof, upon surrender of their
         certificate or certificates therefor, to receive certificates for the
         number of shares of Common Stock or other securities into which their
         Series A Preferred Stock has been converted and cash for fractional
         shares. From and after the date of the automatic conversion, all
         certificates evidencing shares of Series A Preferred Stock
         automatically converted in accordance with these provisions shall be
         deemed to have been retired and canceled and the shares of Series A
         Preferred Stock represented thereby converted into Common Stock for all
         purposes, notwithstanding the failure of the holder or holders thereof
         to surrender his, her or its certificates. As soon as practicable after
         the date of any automatic conversion and the surrender of the
         certificate or certificates for Series A Preferred Stock as aforesaid,
         the Corporation shall cause to be issued and delivered to the holder,
         or to the holder's written order, a certificate or certificates for the
         number of full shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable on
         the conversion in accordance with the provisions hereof and cash as
         provided herein in respect of any

                                      -5-
<PAGE>

         fraction of a share of Common Stock otherwise issuable upon the
         conversion. No fractional shares of Common Stock shall be issued upon
         conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. In lieu of any fractional
         shares to which the holder would otherwise be entitled, the Corporation
         shall pay cash equal to such fraction multiplied by the then-effective
         Conversion Price.

         (c) Conversion Ratio. Subject to adjustment in the event of certain
capital transactions including, without limitation, stock splits, stock
dividends, recapitalization and reorganizations, each share of the Series A
Preferred Stock may be converted into such number of shares of Common Stock as
is obtained by dividing $2.25 by the initial conversion price of $2.25 per share
or, in case any adjustment of such conversion price has taken place pursuant to
the provisions of this Section 5, by the conversion price as last adjusted and
in effect on the date any shares of Series A Preferred Stock are surrendered for
conversion (such conversion price, or such conversion price as last adjusted,
being referred to herein as the "SERIES A CONVERSION PRICE").

         (d) Adjustments. The Series A Conversion Price at which the Series A
Preferred Stock may or shall be converted into Common Stock shall be subject to
adjustment from time to time in certain cases as follows:

                  (i) In case the Corporation shall (A) pay a dividend on its
         Common Stock in shares of its capital stock, (B) subdivide its
         outstanding Common Stock, (C) combine its outstanding Common Stock into
         a smaller number of shares, or (D) issue in any recapitalization,
         reorganization or reclassification of its Common Stock (including any
         such reclassification in connection with a consolidation or merger in
         which the Corporation is the continuing corporation) any shares of its
         capital stock, the Conversion Price in effect immediately prior thereto
         shall be adjusted proportionately so that the holder of any Series A
         Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall be entitled
         to receive the number and kind of shares of capital stock of the
         Corporation which such holder would have owed or have been entitled to
         receive after the happening of such event, had such Series A Preferred
         Stock been converted immediately prior to the happening of such event.
         Such adjustment shall be made whenever any of such events shall occur.
         An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph (i) shall become
         effective, retroactively to the record date, immediately after the
         payment date in the case of a stock dividend and shall become effective
         immediately after the effective date in the case of a subdivision,
         combination, recapitalization, reorganization, or reclassification.

                  (ii) In the event that, at any time, as a result of an
         adjustment made pursuant to paragraph (i) above, the holder of any
         Series A Preferred Stock thereafter surrendered for conversion shall
         become entitled to receive any shares of capital stock of the
         Corporation other than its Common Stock, thereafter the number of such
         other shares so receivable upon conversion shall be subject to
         adjustment from time to time in a manner and on terms as nearly
         equivalent as practicable to the provisions with respect to the Common
         Stock contained in paragraph (i) above.

                                      -6-
<PAGE>

                  (iii) Whenever the amount of Common Stock or other securities
         deliverable upon the conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock shall
         be adjusted pursuant to the provisions hereof, the Corporation shall
         forthwith file, at its principal office and with any transfer agent or
         agents for the Series A and for Common Stock, and with any stock
         exchange on which such Series A or Common Stock are listed, a
         statement, signed by its President or one of its Vice Presidents or its
         Secretary or Treasurer, stating the adjusted number of its Common Stock
         or other securities deliverable per share of Series A Preferred Stock,
         upon conversion thereof calculated to the nearest share and setting
         forth in reasonable detail the method of calculation and the facts
         requiring such adjustment and upon which such calculation is based, and
         shall give notice thereof by mail, postage prepaid, to the holders of
         record of the Series A Preferred Stock, as applicable. Each adjustment
         shall remain in effect until a subsequent adjustment hereunder is
         required.

                  (iv) At all times, the Corporation shall reserve and keep
         available unto its authorized but unissued Common Stock the full number
         of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon the conversion of all the
         then-outstanding Series A Preferred Stock and shall take all such
         action and obtain all such permits or orders as may be necessary to
         enable the Corporation lawfully to issue such Common Stock upon the
         conversion of such Series A Preferred Stock.

                  (v) No fractional Common Stock shall be issued upon a
         conversion of the Series A Preferred Stock. If any fractional interest
         in a Common Stock share would be deliverable upon the conversion of any
         Series A Preferred Stock, the Corporation shall round such fractional
         interest to the nearest whole share, in lieu of delivering the
         fractional share therefor.

         (e) Adjustment of Conversion Price Upon Issuance of Common Stock.

                  (i) Mechanics of Adjustment. Except as provided in Subsection
         5(e)(vii), if and whenever the Corporation shall issue or sell, or
         under any of Subsections 5(e)(ii) through 5(e)(vi) is deemed to have
         issued or sold, any shares of its Common Stock without consideration or
         for a consideration per share less than the Series A Conversion Price
         for the shares of its Series A Preferred Stock in effect immediately
         prior to the time of such issuance or sale (the "DILUTIVE PRICE"), then
         such Series A Conversion Price at such time shall be reduced to an
         amount (calculated to the sixth decimal point) equal to (x) the
         Dilutive Price if such issuance or sale occurs on or prior to December
         __, 2006 and (y) if such issuance or sale occurs after December __,
         2006, the price determined by dividing (1) an amount equal to the sum
         of (A) the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
         prior to such issuance or sale (including as outstanding all Common
         Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock and all
         Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Options or the conversion of
         Convertible Securities, as such terms are defined in Subsection
         5(e)(ii)), multiplied by such Conversion Price at such time and (B) the
         consideration, if any, received and/or receivable by the Corporation in
         connection with such issuance or sale, by (2) the total number of
         shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately after such issuance or
         sale, including as outstanding all

                                      -7-
<PAGE>

         Common Stock issuable upon conversion of outstanding Preferred Stock
         and all Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of Options or the
         conversion of Convertible Securities. The Dilutive Price shall be
         determined by the consideration, if any, received and/or receivable by
         the Corporation in connection with such dilutive issuance or sale as
         determined by the Board of Directors in good faith.

                  (ii) Issuance of Rights or Options. Except as provided in
         Subsection 5(e)(vii), in case at any time the Corporation shall in any
         manner grant (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or
         otherwise) any rights to subscribe for or to purchase, or any options
         for the purchase of, shares of Common Stock or any stock or securities
         convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (such rights or
         options being hereinafter referred to as "OPTIONS" and such Convertible
         or exchangeable stock or securities being hereinafter referred to as
         "CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES"), whether or not such Options or the right to
         convert or exchange any such Convertible Securities are immediately
         exercisable, and the price per share for which a share of Common Stock
         is issuable upon the exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or
         exchange of such Convertible Securities (determined by dividing (A) the
         total amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
         consideration for the granting of such Options, plus the aggregate
         amount of additional consideration payable to the Corporation upon the
         exercise of all such Options, plus, in the case of such Options which
         relate to Convertible Securities, the aggregate amount of additional
         consideration, if any, payable upon the issuance or sale of such
         Convertible Securities and upon the conversion or exchange thereof, by
         (B) the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the full
         exercise of such Option or upon the full conversion or exchange of all
         such Convertible Securities issuable upon the exercise of such Options)
         shall be less than such Series A Conversion Price, as applicable, in
         effect immediately prior to the time of the granting of such Options,
         then the maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the
         exercise of such Options or upon the conversion or exchange of the
         maximum number of such Convertible Securities issuable upon the
         exercise of such Options shall be deemed to have been issued for such
         price per share as of the date such Options were granted and thereafter
         shall be deemed to be outstanding. Except as otherwise provided in
         Subsection 5(e)(iv), no adjustment of such Series A Conversion Price,
         as applicable, shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common
         Stock or of such Convertible Securities upon exercise of such Options
         or upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon conversion or
         exchange of such Convertible Securities if an appropriate adjustment
         was previously made pursuant to this Subsection 5(e)(ii) upon the
         issuance of such Options.

                  (iii) Issuance of Convertible Securities. Except as provided
         in Subsection 5(e)(vii), in case the Corporation shall in any manner
         issue (whether directly or by assumption in a merger or otherwise) or
         sell any Convertible Securities, whether or not the rights to exchange
         or convert any such Convertible Securities are exercisable immediately,
         and the price per share for which a share of Common Stock is issuable
         upon such conversion or exchange (determined by dividing (A) the total
         amount, if any, received or receivable by the Corporation as
         consideration for the issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities,
         plus the aggregate amount of additional

                                      -8-
<PAGE>

         consideration, if any, payable to the Corporation upon the conversion
         or exchange thereof, by (B) the maximum number of shares of Common
         Stock issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible
         Securities) shall be less than such Series A Conversion Price in effect
         immediately prior to the time of such issuance or sale, then the
         maximum number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion or
         exchange of all such Convertible Securities shall be deemed to have
         been issued for such price per share as of the date of the issuance or
         sale of such Convertible Securities and thereafter shall be deemed to
         be outstanding; provided that (a) except as otherwise provided in
         Subsection 5(e)(iv), no adjustment of such Series A Conversion Price
         shall be made upon the actual issuance of such Common Stock upon
         conversion or exchange of such Convertible Securities if an appropriate
         adjustment was previously made pursuant to this Subsection 5(e)(iii)
         upon the issuance of such Convertible Securities, and (b) if any such
         issuance or sale of such Convertible Securities is made upon the
         exercise of any Options to purchase any such Convertible Securities for
         which adjustments of the Conversion Price have been or are to be made
         pursuant to other provisions of this Subsection 5(e), no further
         adjustment of such Series A Conversion Price shall be made by reason of
         such issuance or sale.

                  (iv) Change in Option Price or Conversion Rate. In the event
         that the purchase price provided for in any Option referred to in
         Subsection 5(e)(ii), the additional consideration, if any, payable upon
         the conversion or exchange of any Convertible Securities referred to in
         Subsections 5(e)(ii) or 5(e)(iii), or the rate at which any Convertible
         Securities referred to in Subsections 5(e)(ii) or 5(e)(iii) are
         convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock, shall
         change at any time (other than under or by reason of provisions
         designed to protect against dilution), such Series A Conversion Price
         in effect at the time of such event for any outstanding shares of
         Series A Preferred Stock shall be readjusted to the Conversion Price
         which would have been in effect at such time had such Options or
         Convertible Securities still outstanding provided for such purchase
         price, additional consideration, or conversion rate, as the case may
         be, at the time such Options or Convertible Securities initially were
         granted, issued or sold. In the event any Option or any right to
         convert or exchange Convertible Securities shall expire or terminate
         without being exercised, such Series A Conversion Price then in effect
         hereunder for any outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall
         be adjusted to the Series A which would have been in effect at the time
         of such expiration or termination had such Option or Convertible
         Securities, to the extent outstanding immediately prior to such
         expiration or termination, never been issued, and the shares of Common
         Stock issuable thereunder shall no longer be deemed to be outstanding.
         If the purchase price provided for in any Option referred to in
         Subsection 5(e)(ii) or the rate at which any Convertible Securities
         referred to in Subsections 5(e)(ii) or 5(e)(iii) are convertible into
         or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock shall be reduced at any time
         under or by reason of provisions with respect thereto designed to
         protect against dilution, then, in case of the grant of any such,
         Option or upon conversion or exchange of any such Convertible
         Securities, the Conversion Price then in effect hereunder for any
         outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock shall be adjusted to
         such respective amount as would have been obtained had such Option or
         Convertible Securities never been issued as to such Common Stock and
         had adjustments been made upon the issuance of the Common

                                      -9-
<PAGE>

         Stock delivered as aforesaid, but only if, as a result of such
         adjustment, the Conversion Price then in effect hereunder is hereby
         reduced.

                  (v) Consideration for Stock. In case any shares of Common
         Stock, Options, or Convertible Securities shall be issued or sold for
         cash, the consideration received therefor shall be deemed to be the
         amount received by the Corporation therefor, without deduction of any
         expenses incurred or any underwriting commissions or concessions paid
         or allowed by the Corporation in connection therewith. In case any
         shares of Common Stock, Options, or Convertible Securities shall be
         issued or sold, in whole or in part, for a consideration other than
         cash, the amount of the consideration other than cash received by the
         Corporation shall be deemed to be the fair market value of such
         consideration as determined in good faith by a majority of the members
         of the Board of Directors of the Corporation, without deduction of any
         expenses incurred or any underwriting commission or concessions paid or
         allowed by the Corporation in connection therewith.

                  (vi) Treasury Shares. The disposition of shares of Common
         Stock owned or held by or for the account of the Corporation (other
         than a result of a cancellation of treasury shares) shall be considered
         an issue or sale of Common Stock for the purpose of this Subsection
         5(e).

                  (vii) When Adjustment Is Not Required. Notwithstanding any
         provision herein to the contrary, no adjustment shall be made in the
         Conversion Price as a result of (1) the issuance of Common Stock upon
         conversion of any shares of Series A Preferred Stock; (2) the issuance
         of Series A Preferred Stock upon conversion of any outstanding
         convertible notes in existence as of the Closing Date; (3) the issuance
         of dividends or other distributions on the Series A Preferred Stock;
         (4) the issuance of warrants or other securities to financial
         institutions or lenders in connection with lease lines or loans
         approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors; (5) the issuance of
         stock, warrants or options to employees, directors or consultants of
         the Company as approved by the Corporation's Board of Directors at a
         price not less than 85% of the then applicable Series A Conversion
         Price; (6) the exercise of any warrants, options or other convertible
         securities in existence as of the Closing Date for the purchase of
         Common Stock; or (7) any subdivisions or combination affecting the
         Common Stock or the issuance of shares of Common Stock pursuant to a
         stock dividend or other distribution on Common Stock if an appropriate
         adjustment to the Series A Conversion Price, is made pursuant to
         Subsection 5(d).

                     (viii) Notices of Record Date. In the event of any taking
           by this Corporation of a record of the holders of any class of
           securities for the purpose of determining the holders thereof who are
           entitled to receive any dividend (other than a cash dividend) or
           other distribution, any right to subscribe for, purchase, or
           otherwise acquire any shares of stock of any class or any other
           securities or property, or to receive any other right, this
           Corporation shall send via certified or overnight mail to each holder
           of Series A Preferred Stock, at least ten (10) days prior to the date
           specified therein, a notice specifying the date on which any such
           record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, distribution
           or right, and the amount and character of such dividend,
           distribution, or right.

                  (ix) Reservation of Stock Issuable Upon Conversion. At all
         times, this Corporation shall reserve and keep available out of its
         authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely for the purpose
         of effecting the conversion of the shares of the Series A Preferred
         Stock, such number of its shares of Common Stock as shall from time to
         time be sufficient to effect the conversion of all outstanding shares
         of the Preferred Stock; and if at any time the number of authorized but
         unissued shares of Common Stock shall not be sufficient to effect the
         conversion of all then-outstanding shares of the Series A Preferred
         Stock, in addition to such other remedies as shall be available to the
         holder of such Series A Preferred Stock, this Corporation will take
         such corporate action as may, in the opinion of its counsel, be
         necessary to increase its authorized but unissued shares of Common
         Stock to such number of shares as shall be sufficient for such
         purposes, including, without limitation, engaging in best efforts to
         obtain the requisite stockholder approval of any necessary amendment to
         the Corporation's Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation.

                  (x) Notices. Any notice required by the provisions of this
         Certificate to be given to the holders of shares of Series A Preferred
         Stock shall be deemed given if deposited in the United States mail,
         certified mail postage prepaid, or overnight mail, and addressed to
         each holder of record at his address appearing on the books of this
         Corporation.

         6. Events of Noncompliance.

                  (a) An "Event of Noncompliance" will be deemed to have
         occurred if any of the following actions occur and remain uncured after
         30 days following written notice to, or discovery by, the Corporation:

                        (i) the Corporation's default under, or material breach
         of, any of the provisions of the definitive investment agreements
         entered between the Corporation and Townsends, Inc. on or around the
         Closing Date, including without limitation the provisions of this
         Certificate of Designation, the Voting Agreement, Convertible Note
         Purchase Agreement and Registration Rights Agreement;

                        (ii) the Corporation's default under, or material breach
         of, any of the provisions of the Corporation's Supply Agreement dated
         on or around the Closing Date, as amended from time to time with
         Townsends, Inc.; and

                        (iii) the Corporation's default under, or material
         breach of, any of the provisions of the Corporation's Co-Packing
         Agreement dated on or around the Closing Date, as amended from time to
         time with Townsends, Inc.

                  (b) Upon the occurrence of an Event of Noncompliance, the
         dividends payable on the then outstanding shares of Series A Preferred
         shall increase to $0.225 per share. The right to increased dividends
         pursuant to the preceding sentence shall cease upon the earlier of (w)
         the conversion of all outstanding shares of Series A Preferred Stock
         into Common Stock pursuant to Section 5 of this Certificate of
         Designation; (x) the payment in full of the Liquidation Preference (or
         such higher amount, as applicable) on all outstanding shares of Series

                                      -11-

         Stock pursuant to Section 3 of this Certificate of Designation; (y) the
         Corporation's cure of the facts and circumstances resulting in the
         Event of Noncompliance; or (z) the waiver of the Event of Noncompliance
         by the Convertible Preferred Majority.

         7. Reissuance of Preferred Stock. No shares of Series A Preferred Stock
redeemed, purchased, or acquired by the Corporation or converted into Common
Stock shall be reissued, and all such shares shall be canceled and eliminated
from the shares the Corporation shall be authorized to issue.

                           CONVERTIBLE PROMISSORY NOTE

$1,000,000                                                  Wilmington, Delaware
                                                               December 21, 2004

         FOR VALUE RECEIVED, the undersigned, Kahiki Foods, Inc., an Ohio
corporation ("BORROWER" or the "COMPANY"), hereby promises to pay to the order
of Townsends, Inc. ("TOWNSENDS"), a Delaware corporation, or its assigns (the
"HOLDER"), the principal sum of ONE MILLION DOLLARS ($1,000,000) (the "PRINCIPAL
AMOUNT") plus any other amount necessary to equal the Redemption Price (as
defined below) on December 31, 2009, except as otherwise set forth herein, and
with interest thereon from time to time as provided herein.

         1. PURCHASE AGREEMENT.

                  (a) General. This Convertible Promissory Note (the "NOTE") is
issued by the Borrower, on the date hereof, pursuant to the Note Purchase
Agreement (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT"), dated as of the date hereof, between the
Borrower and Townsends and is subject to the terms thereof. As conditions to the
closing of the Purchase Agreement, the Borrower and the Holder have also entered
into that certain Supply Agreement (the "SUPPLY AGREEMENT"), dated as of the
date hereof, and that certain Copack and Storage Agreement (the "COPACK
AGREEMENT"), dated as of the date hereof, (the Purchase Agreement, Supply
Agreement, and Copacking Agreement collectively referred to herein as the
"TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS"). The Holder is entitled to the benefits of this Note
and the Purchase Agreement, and may enforce the agreements of the Borrower
contained herein and therein and exercise the remedies provided for hereby and
thereby or otherwise available in respect hereto and thereto.

                  (b) Capitalized Terms. Capitalized terms used herein and not
defined herein have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Purchase
Agreement.

<PAGE>

         2. INTEREST AND PRINCIPAL AMORTIZATION.

                  (a) Basic Interest. The Borrower promises to pay interest
("INTEREST") on the Principal Amount of this Note at the rate of five percent
(5%) per annum (the "INTEREST RATE"). Interest on this Note shall accrue from
and including the date of issuance through and until payment of the Redemption
Price (as defined below), and shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year
of twelve (12) 30-day months. All payments on this Note shall be paid in U.S.
Dollars by wire transfer of immediately available funds to such bank account as
is designated in writing by the Holder from time to time. Interest shall accrue
and be paid at maturity unless an Event of Non-Compliance has occurred in which
case it shall be payable on the first business day of each month. All payments
of Interest and/or portions of the outstanding Principal Amount shall be
reflected by the Holder on the Payment and Accrual Schedule in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "PAYMENT AND ACCRUAL SCHEDULE") although the Holder's
failure to make such entries shall not relieve the Borrower of any of its
obligations under this Note. All of the Holder's entries upon the Payment and
Accrual Schedule shall be conclusively presumed true and correct absent manifest
error (notwithstanding the expiration of any applicable cure periods).

                  (b) Event of Non-Compliance Rate of Interest. Notwithstanding
the foregoing provisions of Section 2(a), but subject to applicable law, upon
occurrence of an Event of Non-Compliance (as hereafter defined) any unpaid
Principal Amount on this Note shall, for each day from the date of such Event of
Non-Compliance until the earlier to occur of (i) the date such Event of
Non-Compliance is cured or waived (including any cure or waiver after any
applicable cure period) and (ii) the date of repayment in full of the Redemption
Price, bear interest at a rate (the "NON-COMPLIANCE RATE") equal to the sum of
(A) the Interest Rate payable from time to time as provided in Section 2(a)
above and (B) ten percent (10%) per annum, provided, however, that if an Event
of Non-Compliance shall continue for more than one (1) year without being cured
or waived then the Non-Compliance Rate shall increase by an additional five
percent (5%) per annum on the first (1st) anniversary of the Event of
Non-Compliance and on each such anniversary thereafter so long as any Event of
Non-Compliance shall continue without being cured or waived. During any Event of
Non-Compliance, all Interest shall be payable on the first business day of each
month.

                  (c) No Usurious Interest. In the event that any interest
rate(s) provided for in this Section 2, shall be determined to be unlawful, such
Interest Rate(s) shall be computed at the highest rate permitted by applicable
law. Any payment by the Borrower of any Interest in excess of that permitted by
law shall be deemed applied to the Principal Amount of this Note without
prepayment premium or penalty; if no such Principal Amount is outstanding, such
excess shall be returned to the Borrower.

                  (d) Principal Amortization. An amount equal to the Redemption
Price (as defined in Section 2(e) below) shall be due on the Maturity Date, and
there shall be no required amortization of the Principal Amount due hereunder.

                  (e) Redemption Price Generally. As used in this Note,
"REDEMPTION PRICE" means (i) prior to December 17, 2006 the greater of (A) one
hundred and fifty percent (150%) of the original Principal Amount or (B) one
hundred percent (100%) of the then outstanding Principal Amount of this Note
plus Interest accrued and unpaid thereon through such

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

date or (ii) after December 17, 2006, the greater of (x) two hundred percent
(200%) of the original Principal Amount or (y) one hundred percent (100%) of the
then outstanding Principal Amount of this Note plus Interest accrued and unpaid
thereon through such date, plus in the case of both (i) and (ii), reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses of Holder (including, without limitation,
reasonable fees, charges and disbursements of counsel), if any, associated with
such payment.

         3. CONVERSION.

                  (a) Optional Conversion. The full amount of the outstanding
Principal Amount and any accrued and unpaid Interest as of any particular date
on this Note shall, at the Holder's option, convert into (i) Preferred Stock (if
authorized) or (ii) Common Stock (as such terms are defined in the Purchase
Agreement) of the Company, in each case at $2.25 per share (as such price may be
adjusted after the date hereof, the "NOTE CONVERSION PRICE"), subject to the
adjustments provided in the anti-dilution provisions of the Certificate of
Designation attached to the Purchase Agreement as Exhibit F, which shall apply
to this Section 3 whether or not the Preferred Stock has been authorized by the
Company (either such conversion defined in this Section 3(a)(i) or Section
3(a)(ii), the "OPTIONAL CONVERSION").

                  (b) Mandatory Conversion. Upon (i) shareholder approval,
adoption and filing of an amendment to the Articles of Incorporation of the
Company containing provisions substantially in the form of Exhibit F to the
Purchase Agreement and (ii) the Company's issuance of duly authorized Preferred
Stock to Townsends, the outstanding Principal Amount and any accrued and unpaid
Interest under this Note shall immediately convert into such Preferred Stock at
the Note Conversion Price then in effect at the date of such conversion (the
"MANDATORY CONVERSION").

                  (c) Conversion Procedure. An Optional Conversion shall be
effected by surrendering this Note to the Borrower, accompanied by written
notice to the Borrower that the Holder elects to convert the Principal Amount
and Interest amounts outstanding under this Note (the "CONVERSION AMOUNT") into
Preferred Stock or Common Stock, as the case may be (the "CONVERSION NOTICE").
Interest accrued or accruing on the Conversion Amount from the date hereof to
the date of the Conversion Notice shall be paid in Preferred Stock or Common
Stock, as the case may be, calculated at the same Note Conversion Price as the
Principal Amount as determined above, and shall constitute payment in full of
any such interest on the same terms as would otherwise apply to the conversion
of the Principal Amount hereof. No fractional shares or scrip representing
fractions of Preferred Stock or Common Stock will be issued on conversion, but
the number of shares of Preferred Stock or Common Stock to be issued on
conversion shall be rounded up to the nearest whole share. The date on which the

or performance of any covenant, condition, representation or warranty,
certification or agreement on the part of the Borrower to be observed or
performed (after giving effect to any applicable cure periods) pursuant to the
terms hereof or pursuant to the terms of any of the Transaction Documents; or

                                      -4-
<PAGE>

                        (iv)  the Borrower shall default in the payment of
principal on any other Funded Indebtedness where the principal amount
outstanding is in excess of $100,000; or

                        (v) an involuntary proceeding shall be commenced or an
involuntary petition shall be filed in a court of competent jurisdiction against
the Borrower seeking (A) relief in respect of the Borrower or of a substantial

order or decree approving or ordering any of the foregoing shall be entered; or

                        (vi) if the Borrower shall (A) voluntarily commence any

States Code, as now constituted or hereafter amended, or any other Federal or
state bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or similar law, (B) consent to the
institution of, or fail to contest in a timely and appropriate manner, any
proceeding or the filing of any petition described in this Section 6(a), (C)
apply for or consent to the appointment of a receiver, trustee, custodian,
sequestrator, conservator or similar official for the Borrower, or for a
substantial part of the property or assets of the Borrower, (D) file an answer
admitting the material allegations of a petition filed against it in any such

                        (viii) one or more judgments for the payment of money in
an aggregate amount in excess of $100,000 (to the extent not covered by
insurance) shall be rendered against the Borrower and the same shall remain
undischarged for a period of 60 days during which execution shall not be
effectively stayed, or any action shall be legally taken by a judgment creditor
to levy upon assets or properties of the Borrower to enforce any such judgment.

                  (b) Acceleration; Forced Sale. If an Event of Default occurs
pursuant to Section 6(a)(vi) or Section 6(a)(vii) then the Redemption Price
shall automatically become immediately due and payable in cash, without
presentment, demand, protest or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby
expressly waived. If any other Event of Default occurs and is continuing the
Holder, by written notice to the Borrower, may declare the Redemption Price to
be immediately due and payable in cash. The Holder may rescind an acceleration
and all or any part of its consequences if all existing Events of Default have
been cured or waived, and if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment
or decree. Any notice or rescission shall be given in the manner specified in
Section 15 herein. If an Event of Default remains uncured for more than two (2)
years, in addition to any other remedies, the Holder may cause the Company to
seek and enter into a Change of Control transaction that generates sufficient
proceeds to pay the Holder the Redemption Price.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Event of Non-Compliance. If an Event of Default occurs
pursuant to Section 6(a) (each an "EVENT OF NON-COMPLIANCE") then the
Noncompliance Rate of Interest shall apply as set forth in Section 2(b).

         7. TSAO SUBORDINATION. Any amount owed to Michael Tsao or Alice Tsao
(or their Affiliates) by the Borrower shall at all times be wholly subordinate
and junior in right of payment to this Note.

         8. SUITS FOR ENFORCEMENT.

                  (a) Upon the occurrence of any one or more Events of Default,
the Holder of this Note may proceed to protect and enforce its rights hereunder
by suit in equity, action at law or by other appropriate proceeding, whether for
the specific performance of any covenant or agreement contained in the Purchase
Agreement or this Note or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in the
Purchase Agreement or this Note, or may proceed to enforce the payment of this
Note, or to enforce any other legal or equitable right of the Holders of this
Note.

                  (b) In case of any default under this Note, the Borrower will
pay to the Holder such amounts as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and
expenses of such Holder due to such default.

         9. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. No remedy herein conferred upon the Holder is
intended to be exclusive of any other remedy and each and every such remedy
shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every other remedy given
hereunder or now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute or
otherwise.

         10. REMEDIES NOT WAIVED. No course of dealing between the Borrower and
the Holder or any delay on the part of the Holder in exercising any rights
hereunder shall operate as a waiver of any right.

         11. TRANSFER.

                  (a) Permitted Transfers. Subject to the provisions of this
Section 11, this Note may be transferred or assigned, in whole or in part, by
the Holder at any time to any Person.

                  (b) Transferees. The term "HOLDER" as used herein shall also
include any transferee of this Note whose name has been recorded by the Borrower
in the Note Register. No transfers of this Note shall be permitted unless each
transferee of this Note acknowledges that this Note has not been registered
under the Securities Act, and may be transferred (i) only pursuant to an
effective registration under the Securities Act and any applicable state
securities law or (ii) if the Company first shall have been furnished with an
opinion of legal counsel or otherwise reasonably satisfactory to the Company to
the effect that such transfer is exempt from, or in compliance with, the
registration requirements of the Securities Act and such state laws and that
such transferee has represented that it is acquiring this Note for investment
purposes only and not with a view toward resale or distribution thereof.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Note may be transferred by Townsends to any
of its Affiliates without the requirement of an opinion of legal counsel, so
long as such transfer is in compliance with federal and state securities laws.

<PAGE>

                  (c) Note Register. The Borrower shall maintain a register (the
"NOTE REGISTER") in its principal offices for the purpose of registering the
Note and any transfer or partial transfer thereof, which register shall reflect
and identify, at all times, the ownership of record of any interest in the Note.
Upon the issuance of this Note, the Borrower shall record the name and address
of the initial purchaser of this Note in the Note Register as the first Holder.
Upon surrender for registration of transfer or exchange of this Note at the
principal offices of the Borrower, the Borrower shall, at its expense, execute
and deliver one or more new Notes of like tenor and of denominations of a like
aggregate Principal Amount, registered in the name of the Holder or a transferee
or transferees. Every Note surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange
shall be duly endorsed, or be accompanied by written instrument of transfer duly
executed by the Holder of such Note or such holder's attorney duly authorized in
writing. The failure of the Borrower to adequately maintain the Note Register in
compliance with this Section 11(c) shall not in any way alter, invalidate or
modify any Holder's interest in the Note.

         12. WAIVER OF NOTICE, PRESENTMENT AND DISHONOR. Each party liable under
this Note in any capacity, whether as maker, endorser, surety, guarantor or
otherwise: (a) waives presentment, demand, protest and notice of presentment,
notice of protest and notice of dishonor of this debt and each and every other
notice of any kind with respect to this Note, and (b) agrees that the holder of
this Note, at any time or times, without notice to it or its consent, may grant
extensions of time, without limit as to the number or the aggregate period of
such extensions, for the payment of any principal, interest or other sums due
hereunder.

         13. REPLACEMENT OF NOTE. On receipt by the Borrower of an affidavit of
an authorized representative of the Holder stating the circumstances of the
loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Note in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to Borrower (and in the case of any such mutilation, on
surrender and cancellation of such Note), the Borrower will promptly execute and
deliver, in lieu thereof, a new Note of like tenor (including, without
limitation, the legend regarding the subordination of certain rights of the
holder hereunder). If required by the Borrower, such Holder must provide
indemnity sufficient in the reasonable judgment of the Borrower to protect the
Borrower from any loss which the Borrower may suffer if a lost, stolen or
destroyed Note is replaced.

         14. COVENANTS BIND SUCCESSORS AND ASSIGNS. All the covenants,
stipulations, promises and agreements in this Note contained by or on behalf of
the Borrower shall bind its successors and assigns, whether so expressed or not.

         15. NOTICES. All notices, demands and other communications provided for
or permitted hereunder shall be made in writing and shall be by registered or
certified first-class mail, return receipt requested, telecopier (with receipt

Agreement. All such notices and communications shall be deemed to have been duly

or unenforceable in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining

                                                                  CONFORMED COPY

                          REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

            THIS REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT (this "AGREEMENT") is made as of
December 21, 2004, by and among (i) Kahiki Foods, Inc., an Ohio corporation
company (the "COMPANY") and (ii) Townsends, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("TOWNSENDS").

                                    RECITALS:

            A. The Company and Townsends are parties to a Note Purchase
Agreement dated the date hereof (the "PURCHASE AGREEMENT") pursuant to which
Townsends acquired convertible promissory Notes (the "NOTES"), convertible into
either the Company's Series A Convertible Preferred Shares (the "PREFERRED
STOCK") or the Company's Common Shares (the "COMMON STOCK"). In order to induce
Townsends to enter into the Purchase Agreement, the Company agreed to provide
the registration rights set forth in this Agreement.

            B. Unless otherwise provided in this Agreement, capitalized terms
used herein shall have the meanings set forth in Section 9 below.

                                    AGREEMENT

                  In consideration of the foregoing and the mutual covenants and
promises contained herein, the parties agree as follows:

            1. DEMAND REGISTRATIONS.

                  (A) REQUESTS FOR REGISTRATION. At any time after the first
anniversary of the date hereof and before the fourth anniversary of the date the
Notes convert into either Preferred Stock or Common Stock, the holders of a
majority of the Investor Registrable Securities may request registration under
the Securities Act of all or any portion of their Registrable Securities on Form
S-1, SB-2 or any similar long-form registration ("LONG-FORM REGISTRATIONS") in
the manner provided in Section 1(b);

                  (B) DEMAND REGISTRATIONS. The Initiating Holders shall be
entitled to request (i) one (1) Long-Form Registration in which the Company
shall pay all Registration Expenses ("COMPANY-PAID LONG-FORM REGISTRATIONS"). A
registration shall not count as the permitted Company-paid Long-Form
Registrations until it has become effective and the holders requesting
registration are able to register at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the
Registrable Securities requested to be included in such registration; provided
that in any event the Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in connection
with any registration initiated as a Company-paid Long-Form Registration whether
or not it has become effective and whether or not such registration is counted
as one of the permitted Company-paid Long-Form Registrations. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, and subject to Section 1(f) below, if any registration initiated
by the Initiating Holders as a Company-paid Long-Form Registration is
voluntarily withdrawn by the Initiating Holders, such

<PAGE>

holders shall either (i) pay all Registration Expenses in connection with such
registration in which case such registration shall not be deemed a Company-paid
Long-Form Registration or (ii) cause the Company to pay such expenses provided
that such registration shall count as the permitted Company-paid Long-Form
Registrations.

                  (c) SHORT-FORM REGISTRATIONS. Any registration requested
pursuant to Sections l(b) is referred to herein as a "DEMAND REGISTRATION." A
Demand Registration shall be on Form S-3, SB equivalent or any successor
short-form registration ("SHORT-FORM REGISTRATION") whenever the Company is
permitted to use Form S-3 or any successor short-form registration. A request
for a Demand Registration shall specify the approximate number of Registrable
Securities requested to be registered. Within five (5) days after receipt of any
such request from the Initiating Holders, the Company shall give written notice
of such requested registration to all other holders of Investor Registrable
Securities (if any) and, except as provided in Section 1(d) below, shall use its
commercially reasonable efforts include in such registration all Registrable
Securities with respect to which the Company has received written requests for
inclusion therein within ten (10) days after the receipt of the Company's
notice.

                  (d) PRIORITY ON DEMAND REGISTRATIONS. If a Demand Registration
is an underwritten offering and the managing underwriters advise the Company in
writing that in their opinion the number of Registrable Securities and, if
permitted hereunder, other securities requested to be included in such
registration exceeds the number which can be sold in an orderly manner in such
offering within a price range acceptable to the Initiating Holders, the Company
shall include in such registration: (i) first, the Investor Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the
holders of such Investor Registrable Securities on the basis of the number of
shares owned by such holders; (ii) second, securities the Company proposes to
sell; and (iii) third, other securities which are not Registrable Securities
requested to be included in such registration pursuant to contractual
registration rights ("OTHER REGISTRABLE SECURITIES"), pro rata among the holders
thereof on the basis of the number of their securities requested to be included
therein.

                  (e) RESTRICTIONS ON DEMAND REGISTRATIONS. If, at the time of a
request for a Demand Registration the Company reasonably expects to file a
registration statement for its securities within 90 days of such request, the
Company may postpone for up to 180 days from the effectiveness of such
contemplated registration statement the filing of the registration statement for
such requested Demand Registration. The Company shall not be obligated to effect
any Demand Registration within 90 days after (i) the effective date of a
previous Long-Form Registration or (ii) a previous registration in which the
holders of Registrable Securities were given piggyback rights pursuant to
Section 2 and in which there was not more than a 50% reduction in the number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included. The Company may postpone for up
to 90 days the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a
Demand Registration if in the good faith judgment of the Board such Demand
Registration would reasonably be expected to be materially detrimental to the
Company, provided that in such event, the Initiating Holders shall be entitled
to withdraw such request and, if such request is withdrawn, such Demand
Registration shall not count as one of the permitted Company-paid Long Form
Registrations hereunder and the Company shall pay all Registration Expenses in
connection with such registration. The Company may delay a

                                     - 2 -
<PAGE>

Demand Registration pursuant to the immediately preceding sentence only once in
any 12-month period.

                  (f) SELECTION OF UNDERWRITERS. The Initiating Holders
participating in a Demand Registration shall have the right to select the
investment banker(s) and manager(s) to administer the offering with the consent
of the Company, and such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld.

                  (g) OTHER REGISTRATION RIGHTS. Except as provided in this
Agreement and so long as Townsends holds more than the Minimum Ownership, the
Company shall not enter into any agreement with any Person to grant such Person
the right to request the Company to register any equity securities of the
Company, or any securities convertible or exchangeable into or exercisable for
such securities on terms that are equal to or more favorable than the
registration rights granted to the holders of Registrable Securities hereunder.

            2. PIGGYBACK REGISTRATIONS.

                  (a) RIGHT TO PIGGYBACK. Whenever the Company proposes (but
without any obligation to do so) to register any of its securities under the
Securities Act (other than (i) pursuant to a Demand Registration for which
Section 1 is applicable, or (ii) in connection with registrations on Form S-4,
S-8 or any successor or similar forms) and the registration form to be used may
be used for the registration of Registrable Securities (a "PIGGYBACK
REGISTRATION"), the Company shall give prompt written notice (in any event
within five (5) business days after its receipt of notice of any exercise of
demand registration rights other than under this Agreement) to all holders of
Registrable Securities of its intention to effect such a registration and shall
use its best efforts to include in such registration all Registrable Securities
with respect to which the Company has received written requests for inclusion
therein within ten (10) days after the receipt of the Company's notice.

                  (b) PIGGYBACK EXPENSES. The Registration Expenses of the
holders of Registrable Securities shall be paid by the Company in all Piggyback
Registrations.

                  (c) PRIORITY ON PRIMARY REGISTRATIONS. If a Piggyback
Registration is an underwritten primary registration on behalf of the Company,
and the managing underwriters advise the Company that in their opinion the
number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds the
number which in their sole discretion is compatible with the success of the
offering, the Company shall include in such registration (i) first, the
securities the Company proposes to sell; (ii) second, the Investor Registrable
Securities and Other Registrable Securities with piggyback registration rights
pari passu with the Investor Registrable Securities requested to be included in
such registration, pro rata among the holders of such Investor Registrable
Securities and Other Registrable Securities, if applicable, on the basis of the
number of shares owned by such holders; and (iii) third, Other Registrable
Securities requested to be included in such registration, pro rata among the
holders thereof on the basis of the number of other Registrable Securities
requested to be included therein.

                  (d) PRIORITY ON SECONDARY REGISTRATIONS. If a Piggyback
Registration is

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>

an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of holders of Other Registrable

                                     - 4 -

of disposition thereof, and pursuant thereto the Company shall as expeditiously
as reasonably possible:

                  (a) prepare and file with the Securities and Exchange
Commission a registration statement with respect to such Registrable Securities
and use its best efforts to cause such registration statement to become
effective; provided that before filing a registration statement or prospectus or
any amendments or supplements thereto, the Company shall furnish to the counsel
selected by the holders of a majority of the Registrable Securities included in
such registration statement copies of all such documents proposed to be filed,
which documents shall be subject to the review and comment of such counsel.

                  (b) notify each holder of Registrable Securities of the

the Securities Act with respect to the disposition of all securities covered by
such registration statement during such period in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition by the sellers thereof set forth in such registration
statement; provided, however, that if the Company is eligible to use Form S-3,
the holders of Registrable Securities may require the Company to keep such
registration effective as a "shelf registration" for a period of up to two
years;

                  (c) furnish to each seller of Registrable Securities such
number of copies of such registration statement, each amendment and supplement
thereto, the prospectus included in such registration statement (including each
preliminary prospectus) and such other documents as such seller may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the disposition of the Registrable Securities
owned by such seller;

                  (d) use its best efforts to register or qualify such
Registrable Securities under such other securities or blue sky laws of such
jurisdictions as any seller reasonably requests and use its reasonable efforts
to enable such seller to consummate the disposition in such jurisdictions of the
Registrable Securities owned by such seller; provided that the Company shall not
be required to (i) qualify generally to do business in any jurisdiction where it
would not otherwise be required to qualify but for this subparagraph, (ii)
subject itself to taxation in any such jurisdiction, or (iii) consent to general
service of process in any such jurisdiction;

                  (e) promptly notify each seller and the managing underwriter,

the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdiction or the initiation of any
proceeding for such purpose, (iv) of the existence of any fact of which the
Company becomes aware or the happening of any event which results in (A) the

such registration statement containing an untrue statement of a material fact or
omitting to state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to
make any statements therein, in light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, and (v) of the Company's reasonable determination that a
post-effective amendment to a registration statement would be appropriate or
that there exists circumstances not yet disclosed to the public which make
further sales under such amendment; and, if the notification relates to an event
described in any of the clauses (ii) through (v) of this Section 4(e), the
Company shall promptly prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to such
registration statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated
therein by reference or file any other required document so that (A) such

statements therein in the light of the circumstances under which they were made
not misleading (and shall furnish to each such holder and each underwriter, if
any, a reasonable number of copies of such prospectus so supplemented or
amended); and if the notification relates to an event described in clause (iii)
of this Section 4(e), the Company shall take all reasonable action required to
prevent the entry of such stop order or to remove it if entered;

                  (f) Use its best efforts to cause all such Registrable
Securities to be listed on each securities exchange on which similar securities
issued by the Company are then listed and, if not so listed, on the NASD
automated quotation system and, if listed on the NASD automated quotation
system, use its best efforts to secure designation of all such Registrable
Securities covered by such registration statement as a Nasdaq "national market
system security" within the meaning of Rule 11Aa2-1 of the Securities and
Exchange Commission or, failing that, to secure Nasdaq authorization for such
Registrable Securities and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, to
arrange for at least two market makers to register as such with respect to such
Registrable Securities with the NASD;

                  (g) provide a transfer agent and registrar for all such
Registrable Securities not later than the effective date of such registration
statement;

                  (h) enter into such customary agreements (including
underwriting agreements in customary form) and take all such other reasonable
actions (including hold-backs) as the underwriters, if any, reasonably request
in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such Registrable
Securities;

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

                  (i) make available for inspection by any seller of Registrable

provisions of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act and Rule 158 thereunder;

                  (k) permit any holder of Registrable Securities, which holder,
in the Company's sole and exclusive judgment, might be deemed to be an
underwriter or a controlling Person of the Company, to participate in the
preparation of such registration or comparable statement and to require the

reasonable judgment of such holder and its counsel is required to be included in
accordance with the Securities Act or the Exchange Act;

                  (l) in the event of the issuance of any stop order suspending

            5. FURNISH INFORMATION.

                  (a) It shall be a condition precedent to the obligations of
the Company to take any action pursuant to this Agreement with respect to the
Registrable Securities of any selling holder that such holder shall furnish to
the Company such reasonable information regarding itself, the Registrable
Securities held by it, and the intended method of disposition of such securities

<PAGE>

shall be required to effect the registration of such holder's Registrable
Securities. If any registration statement or comparable statement under "blue
sky" laws refers to any holder by name or otherwise as the holder of any
Registrable Securities, then such holder shall promptly (i) notify the Company
of the existence of any fact of which such holder becomes aware and the
happening of any event which relates to holder or the distribution of the
securities owned by such holder which results in the registration statement
containing an untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statements therein
not misleading, or the prospectus included in such registration statement
containing an untrue statement of material fact or omitting to state a material
fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make any statements therein,
in light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading and

Company to prepare a supplement or post-effective amendment to such registration
statement or related prospectus or any document incorporated thereunder by
reference o file any other documents required so that such registration
statement will not contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
statements therein not misleading, and such prospectus shall not include an

circumstances under which they were made not misleading.

                  (b) NOTICE OF DISCONTINUE. Each holder of Registrable
Securities agrees by acquisition of such Registrable Securities that, upon
receipt of any notice from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind
described in Section 4(e)(ii) through (v), such Holder shall forthwith
discontinue disposition of Registrable Securities pursuant to the registration
statement covering such Registrable Securities until such holder's receipt of
the copies of the supplemented or amended prospectus contemplated by Section
4(e) and, if so directed by the Company, such holder shall deliver to the
Company (at the Company's expense) all copies, other than permanent file copies,
then in such holder's possession of the prospectus covering such Registrable
Securities which is current at the time of receipt of such notice. If the
Company shall give any such notice, the Company shall extend the period during
which such registration statement shall be maintained effective pursuant to this
Agreement by the number of days in excess of ten (10) business days during the
period from and including the date of the giving of such notice pursuant to

the Company's performance of or compliance with this Agreement, including
without limitation all registration and filing fees, fees and expenses of

delivery expenses, fees and disbursements of custodians, and fees and
disbursements of counsel for the Company and the Company's independent certified
public accountants, underwriters (excluding underwriting discounts and

"REGISTRATION EXPENSES"), shall be borne as provided in this Agreement, except
that the Company shall, in any event, pay its internal expenses (including,
without limitation, all salaries and expenses of its officers and employees
performing legal or

                                     - 8 -
<PAGE>

accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the
expense of any liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the
securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed or on, the NASD automated
quotation system.

each Demand Registration and each Piggyback Registration, the Company shall
reimburse the holders of Registrable Securities included in such registration
for the reasonable fees and disbursements of one counsel chosen by the holders
of a majority of the Investor Registrable Securities included in such
registration and for the reasonable fees and disbursements of each additional
counsel retained by any holder of Registrable Securities for the purpose of
rendering a legal opinion on behalf of such holder in connection with any
underwritten Demand Registration or Piggyback Registration.

                  (c) PAYMENT OF REGISTRATION EXPENSES BY HOLDERS OF REGISTRABLE
SECURITIES. To the extent Registration Expenses are not required to be paid by
the Company, each holder of securities included in any registration hereunder
shall pay its proportionate share of all Registration Expenses based upon the
ratio of the aggregate selling price of each holder's securities included
therein to the aggregate selling price of all securities to be so registered.

            7. INDEMNIFICATION.

                  (a) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE COMPANY. The Company agrees to
indemnify, to the extent permitted by law, each holder of Registrable
Securities, its officers and Managers and each Person who controls such holder
(within the meaning of the Securities Act) against all losses, claims, damages,
liabilities and expenses to which such holder may become subject under the
Securities Act, the Securities Exchange Act, or other federal or state
securities law, insofar as such losses, claims, damages, liabilities and
expenses arise out of or are based upon any untrue or alleged untrue statement
of material fact contained in any registration statement, prospectus or
preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement thereto or any
omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and, with respect to
any prospectus or preliminary prospectus, in light of the circumstances in which
they were made, except insofar as the same are caused by or contained in any
information furnished in writing to the Company by or on behalf of such holder
expressly for use therein or by such holder's failure to deliver a copy of the
registration statement or prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto
after the Company has furnished such holder with a sufficient number of copies
of the same. In connection with an underwritten offering, the Company shall
indemnify such underwriters, their officers and Managers and each Person who
controls such underwriters (within the meaning of the Securities Act) to the
same extent as provided above with respect to the indemnification of the holders
of Registrable Securities.

                  (b) INDEMNIFICATION BY THE HOLDERS OF REGISTRABLE SECURITIES.
In connection with any registration statement in which a holder of Registrable
Securities is participating, each such holder shall furnish to the Company in
writing such information and affidavits as the Company reasonably requests for
use in connection with any such registration statement or prospectus and, to the
extent permitted by law, shall indemnify the Company, its Managers and officers
and each Person who controls the Company (within the meaning of the

                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>

Securities Act) against any losses, claims, damages, liabilities and expenses to
which such holder may become subject under the Securities Act, the Securities
Exchange Act, or other federal or state law, insofar as such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities arise out of or are based upon from any untrue or alleged
untrue statement of material fact contained in the registration statement,
prospectus or preliminary prospectus or any amendment thereof or supplement
thereto or any omission or alleged omission of a material fact required to be
stated therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and,
with respect to any prospectus or preliminary prospectus, in light of the
circumstances in which they were made, but only to the extent that such untrue
statement or omission is contained in any information or affidavit so furnished
in writing by such holder; provided that the obligation to indemnify shall be
individual, not joint and several, for each holder and shall be limited to the
net amount of proceeds received by such holder from the sale of Registrable
Securities pursuant to such registration statement, except in the case of gross
negligence or willful misconduct by such holder.

                  (c) PROCEDURE FOR INDEMNIFICATION. Any Person entitled to
indemnification hereunder shall (i) give prompt written notice to the
indemnifying party of any claim with respect to which it seeks indemnification
(provided that the failure to give prompt notice shall not impair any Person's
right to indemnification hereunder to the extent such failure has not prejudiced
the indemnifying party) and (ii) unless in such indemnified party's reasonable
judgment a conflict of interest between such indemnified and indemnifying
parties actually exists with respect to such claim, permit such indemnifying
party to assume the defense of such claim with counsel reasonably satisfactory
to the indemnified party. If such defense is assumed, the indemnifying party
shall not be subject to any liability for any settlement made by the indemnified
party without its consent (but such consent shall not be unreasonably withheld).
An indemnifying party who is not entitled to, or elects not to, assume the
defense of a claim shall not be obligated to pay the fees and expenses of more
than one (1) counsel for all parties indemnified by such indemnifying party with
respect to such claim, unless in the reasonable judgment of any indemnified
party a conflict of interest actually exists between such indemnified party and
any other of such indemnified parties with respect to such claim.

                  (d) SURVIVAL. The indemnification provided for under this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of the indemnified party or any officer, director or
controlling Person of such indemnified party and shall survive the transfer of
securities. The Company also agrees to make such provisions, as are reasonably
requested by any indemnified party, for contribution to such party in the event
the Company's indemnification is unavailable for any reason.

            8. PARTICIPATION IN UNDERWRITTEN REGISTRATIONS. No Person may
participate in any registration hereunder unless such Person:

                  (a) in the case of a registration which is underwritten,
agrees to sell such Person's securities on the basis provided in the applicable
underwriting arrangement; provided, however, that no holder of less than eight
percent (10%) of all Registrable Securities included in any underwritten
registration (other than an executive officer or director of the Company) shall
be required to make any representations or warranties to the Company or the
underwriters (other than representations and warranties regarding such holder,
such holder's ownership of stock and such

                                     - 10 -

holder's intended method of distribution) or to undertake any indemnification
obligations to the Company or the underwriters with respect thereto, except as
otherwise provided in Section 7;

                  (b) as expeditiously as possible, notifies the Company, at any
time when a prospectus relating to such Person's Registrable Securities is
required to be delivered under the Securities Act, of the happening of any event

fact or omits any fact necessary to make the statements therein not misleading;

or its counsel with respect to the registration of such Person's Registrable
Securities, including, without limitation, providing access to all relevant
books and records; and

powers of attorney, indemnities, underwriting agreements and other usual and
customary documents necessary or appropriate with respect to the offering of
such Person's Registrable Securities, and in the case of a registration which is
underwritten, necessary or appropriate under the terms of such underwriting
arrangements (subject to the provision in Section 8(a)).

                                SUPPLY AGREEMENT

      This SUPPLY AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), dated as of December 21, 2004,
is made by and between Townsends, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("Townsends"),
and Kahiki Foods, Inc., an Ohio corporation ("Kahiki").

                                    RECITALS

      A. Townsends and Kahiki have entered into that certain Note Purchase
Agreement and the related investment documents (collectively, the "Note Purchase
Agreement"), dated as of the date hereof, whereby Townsends has agreed to
purchase up to $2,000,000 in convertible notes (the "Notes") from Kahiki. The
execution of this Agreement is a condition to the closing of the Note Purchase
Agreement.

      B. In addition, Townsends and Kahiki have executed a Copacking and Storage

      C. Kahiki also desires to purchase additional poultry products from
Townsends for processing and resale to its other customers. Townsends desires to

and in return for the compensation, hereinafter set forth in this Agreement.

                                    AGREEMENT

<PAGE>

to deliver all Minimum Weekly Amounts under this Agreement for a period of three
(3) years. Termination for breach shall be in addition to such other rights and

other than consequential damages, caused as a result of the breach.

      9. FORCE MAJEURE. Delay or failure of performance of either party shall be

regulation or action, embargo, fire, flood, accident or other casualty not
resulting from negligence of either party hereto (each, a "Force Majeure
Event"). The party invoking the provisions of this paragraph shall give the

advertising, promotional material or products.

      12. ASSIGNMENT. Neither of the parties shall assign or transfer or purport
to assign or transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder without the
prior written consent of the other party, such consent not to be unreasonably
withheld or delayed. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that Kahiki
engages in any (a) merger or consolidation into or with any other corporation or
entity, (b) sale, conveyance, transfer, license, lease or other disposition of
all or substantially all of the assets of Kahiki or (c) acquisition by any
person of more than 50% of the voting power of all securities of Kahiki

assigned to the successor entity controlling the operations or assets of Kahiki
after such Change of Control, unless otherwise terminated pursuant to Section
8(d) above. Any default by Kahiki under this assignment provision shall allow
Townsends to terminate the Agreement.

      13. ENTIRE AGREEMENT; AMENDMENT. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement and understanding of Townsends and Kahiki relating to the subject
matter hereof, and supersedes all other negotiations, agreements,

Kahiki hereby agrees to load and unload the Stored Products from delivery
trucks, to use reasonable care in its storage and handling of the Stored
Products and to otherwise comply with Townsends' reasonable instructions
relating to the Stored Products. If it is determined by Kahiki, reasonably and
in good faith, that it does not have sufficient space to offer all or a portion
of the 200 pallet spaces to Townsends, Kahiki shall notify Townsends and

or greater than 5% of the previous cost.

            (c) Townsends shall have the right from time to time, upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours, to review such records of

Section 7.13 below) or (b) the sum of the LIBOR (as defined in Section 7.13
below) of interest for such day plus (i) any additional costs provided for in
Section 1.7 plus (ii) 250 basis points. The Prime Rate means the rate of
interest for such day publicly established from time to time by the Bank
(whether or not such rate is publicly announced) as its prime rate and is not
intended to be the lowest rate of interest charged by the Bank in connection
with extensions of credit for borrowers. Interest on the Debt shall be paid by
the Borrower (a) (i) for Prime Rate loans, on the 15th day of each calendar
month, commencing January 15, 2005 or (ii) for LIBOR loans, on the 15th day of
the month at the end of each LIBOR Period, (b) on the Maturity Date, and (c)
thereafter on demand. Any change in the Prime Rate

<PAGE>

shall be effective, without notice, as of the opening of business of the Bank on
the day on which the Prime Rate shall change.

                  1.2.2. Whenever the unpaid principal amount of the Debt has
become due and payable, whether at the stated maturity thereof, by acceleration
or otherwise, interest thereon, for each day until paid, shall be paid by the
Borrower on demand at a rate per annum equal to the interest rate set forth
above plus 300 basis points.

                  1.2.3. All interest under this Note shall be computed on the
basis of the actual days elapsed in a year of 360 days.

            1.3. PREPAYMENTS; PAYMENTS; INTEREST RATE SWAP.

                  1.3.1. The Borrower shall have the right to make prepayments
at any time of the principal amount of the Debt, in whole or in part, in the
aggregate principal amount of $10.000 or a whole multiple thereof, without
notice. Each prepayment shall be without premium or penalty, and shall be
applied to the principal installments in inverse order of maturity; provided,
however, that a prepayment penalty may apply to a LIBOR Loan (as defined in
Section 1.3.3 below) or for any portion of the principal balance hereunder that
will be "swapped" into a fixed interest rate.

                  1.3.2. The Borrower shall make all payments of principal and
interest under this Note to the Bank at its main office (or such other location
as the Bank may direct) in immediately available funds. If any payment of
principal or interest on this Note shall become due on a day other than a
Banking Day, such payment shall be due and payable upon the next succeeding
Banking Day and such extension of time shall in such case be included in
computing interest in connection with such payment. A "Banking Day" is any day
on which the main office of the Bank is open for business, except Federal
holidays.

                  1.3.3. Every thirty days during the time period this Note is
outstanding, funds will be made available by the Bank in federal funds or other
immediately available money of the United States, in the form of a LIBOR Loan
(individually a "LIBOR Loan" and collectively the "LIBOR Loans"). Each LIBOR
Loan shall be in full amount of the outstanding principal balance hereunder.

                  1.3.4. The Borrower shall be entitled to enter into an
interest rate swap agreement with or through the Bank for up to $1,000,000 of
the principal balance hereof.

            1.4. ADDITIONAL INTEREST. For so long as the Bank maintains reserves
against "Eurocurrency liabilities" (or any other category of liabilities which
includes deposits by reference to which the interest rate on LIBOR Loans is
determined or any category of extensions of credit or other assets which
includes loans by a non-United States office of the Bank to United States
residents) which the Bank determines in good faith to be legally required, and
as a result the cost to the Bank of making or maintaining its LIBOR is
determined by the Bank in good faith to have increased, then the Bank may
require the Borrower to pay, contemporaneously with each payment of interest on
any LIBOR Loan of the Bank, additional interest on such LIBOR Loan at

                                       2
<PAGE>

a rate per annum equal to (a)(i) the applicable LIBOR divided by (ii) one minus
the Euro Reserve Percentage minus (b) the applicable LIBOR.

            1.5. WITHHOLDING TAXES. All principal, interest and fee payments
made by the Borrower under this Note shall be in such amounts that the Bank
shall receive all amounts owing thereunder and hereunder free and clear of any
foreign or domestic withholding taxes, fees or other charges of any foreign or
domestic taxing authority. The Borrower is not obligated to pay any federal,
state or local income tax attributable to the Bank.

            1.6. INTEREST RATES. In no event whatsoever shall the interest rate
and other charges hereunder exceed the highest rate permissible under any law
which a court of competent jurisdiction shall, in a final determination, deem
applicable hereto. In the event a court determines that the Bank has received
interest and other charges hereunder in excess of the highest rate applicable
hereto, the Bank shall promptly refund such excess amount to the Borrower and
the provisions hereof shall be deemed amended to provide for such permissible
rate.

            1.7. ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS AND LIMITATIONS RELATING TO LIBOR LOANS.

                  1.7.1. Additions. The additional provisions and limitations
set forth below shall apply with respect to LIBOR Loans:

                        (a) Deposits Unavailable. If the Bank shall, in good
faith and for reasons beyond its control, determine that it is unable to
reasonably ascertain the LIBOR or that the Bank is unable to acquire Eurodollar
deposits on reasonable terms in an amount sufficient to meet a request for a
LIBOR Loan, the Bank shall promptly notify the Borrower, whereupon until the
Bank notifies the Borrower that the circumstances giving rise to such
unavailability no longer exist (which the Bank shall do upon receiving notice
thereof), the obligations of the Bank to make LIBOR Loans shall be suspended. In
such event, the Borrower may request a Loan of like amount to be made using the
"prime" rate of the Bank then in effect.

                        (b) Illegality. If, because of the introduction of or
any change in, or because of any judicial, administrative, or other governmental
interpretation of, any law or regulation, it becomes unlawful for Lender to
make, fund, or maintain any advance or balance at the LIBOR Rate, then Lender's
obligation to make, fund or maintain any such advance or balance shall terminate
and any such affected outstanding advance or balance shall be converted to the
Prime Rate on the earlier of the first day of the month following thereafter or
the date the making, funding, or maintaining of any such advance or balance
becomes unlawful.

                        (c) Increased Costs. If, because of the introduction of
or any change in, or because of any judicial, administrative, or other
governmental interpretation of, any law or regulation, there shall be any
increase in the cost to Lender of making, funding, maintaining, or allocating
capital to any amount outstanding under the Note bearing interest at the LIBOR
Rate, including a change in LIBOR Reserve Requirements, then Borrower shall,
from time to time upon demand by Lender, pay to Lender additional amounts
sufficient to compensate Lender for such increased cost.

                                       3
<PAGE>


                        (g) Interest Period. With respect to LIBOR Loans, if the
LIBOR Period (i) ends on a day which is not a LIBOR Banking Day, the LIBOR
Period shall be extended to the next succeeding LIBOR Banking Day unless such
LIBOR Banking Day falls in another calendar month, in which case such LIBOR
Period shall end on the next preceding LIBOR Banking Day; or (ii) begins on the
last LIBOR Banking Day of a calendar month (or on a day for which there is no
numerically corresponding day in the calendar month at the end of such interest
period), the LIBOR Period shall end on the last LIBOR Banking Day of the
calendar month at the end of the interest period; provided, however that
notwithstanding (i) or (ii) above, no period may be selected which ends after
the Maturity Date.

                  1.7.2. Limitation. Charges or additional expenses or otherwise
to Borrower under Sections 1.4 or 1.7.1 shall be subject to the conditions that
each is (a) the subject of written notice given to Borrower by the Bank within a
reasonable time after the Bank determines that the same may exist; (b) the
result of a change in law or regulation or official interpretation thereof
occurring after the date hereof and (c) not reflected in the determination of
any other rate or charge hereunder.

                  1.7.3. Statement. The Bank's written statement to the Borrower
that items under or covered by this Section 1.7 are properly chargeable to
Borrower under this Note, the general nature of those charges, and the amount
thereof shall be deemed to be correct, unless Borrower is able to identify any
mistakes thereto.

      SECTION 2. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. The execution of this Note by
the Borrower shall be deemed to constitute the Borrower's representation and
warranty to the Bank that, at the time of execution and at the time of
disbursement of the Debt: (a) this Note and the Security Documents (as defined
in Section 4 hereof) are the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
Borrower, enforceable against the Borrower in accordance with their terms; (b)
the Security Documents create a valid lien of the Bank in the collateral
thereof, prior to the claims of any other person or entity except as noted
therein; (c) the execution and delivery of this Note and the Security Documents
by the Borrower do not and will not conflict with, violate or constitute a
default under or breach of any court or administrative order, decree or ruling,
or any law, statute, ordinance or regulation, or any agreement, indenture,
mortgage, deed of trust, guaranty, lease, note or other obligation or instrument
binding upon the Borrower or any of his respective properties or assets; and (d)
neither this Note nor any other statement, assignment, agreement, instrument or
certificate of the Borrower made or delivered pursuant to or in connection with
this Note contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a
material fact required to be stated therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, or necessary to make the statements therein not
misleading.

      SECTION 3. COMPLIANCE WITH LAWS. On and after the date hereof and until
the Debt shall have been repaid and discharged in full or otherwise satisfied,
the Borrower shall comply with all applicable laws, including without limitation
all environmental laws.

      SECTION 4. SECURITY FOR DEBT. This Note is secured by and entitled to (a)
Commercial Security Agreement dated as of June 1, 2004, made by the Borrower for
the benefit of the Bank (the "Personal Property Security Agreement"), (b)

<PAGE>

Agreement"), (c) the Business Loan Agreement (Asset Based) dated as of June 1,
2004 and amended as of June 1, 2004 and December 17, 2004 between the Borrower
and the Bank (the "Loan Agreement") and (c) an Open-End Mortgage dated as of

Mortgage dated as of the date hereof (the "Mortgage" and, collectively with the
Loan Agreement, the Personal Property Security Agreement and the Fixtures
Security Agreement, the "Security Documents"), as any of the above may be
further amended or modified from time to time. Nothing contained in this Note,
the Security Documents or in any other document or instrument made in connection
herewith, shall be deemed or construed to create a partnership,
tenancy-in-common, joint tenancy, joint venture or co-ownership by or between
the Bank and the Borrower. The Bank shall not be in any way responsible for the
debts, losses, obligations or duties of the Borrower.

      SECTION 5. EVENTS OF DEFAULT. The following are Events of Defaults:

            5.2. The Borrower fails to pay the principal of the Note when and as
due.

            5.3. The Borrower fails to make a payment of any fee, expense or
other amount of money (not including the principal of or interest on the Note)
owing to the Bank under this Note when and as due and such failure is not
remedied within 10 Banking Days after the due date.

            5.4. Any representation or warranty made by the Borrower in this
Note or any information contained in any Security Document, Guaranty,
certificate, report, financial statement or other document delivered to the Bank
by the Borrower contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to
state a material fact required by this Note or law to be stated therein or
necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were made, not misleading.

            5.5. An Event of Default exists under the Loan Agreement.

      SECTION 6. DEFAULT REMEDIES.

            6.1. ACCELERATION. If an Event of Default exists, the outstanding
unpaid principal balance of this Note, together with all interest accrued
thereon and any unpaid fees, expenses or other amounts due to the Bank under
this Note, is immediately due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest
or notice of any kind, all of which are hereby waived.

            6.2. SET-OFF. Any and all moneys now or at any time hereafter owing
to the Borrower from the Bank, and all other funds on deposit in one or more
checking accounts with the Bank for the benefit of the Borrower, are hereby
pledged for the security of this and all other indebtedness from the Borrower to
the Bank or any legal holder hereof, and may, upon any demand for payment, be
paid and applied thereon whether such indebtedness be then due or to become due,
all without notice to or demand on the Borrower or any other person, all such

                                       5
<PAGE>

notices and demands being hereby expressly waived. If an Event of Default
exists, the Bank shall have the right, in addition to all other rights and
remedies available to it, to set-off against the principal of and interest on
this Note and any fees, expenses or other amounts owed to the Bank under this
Note (a) all amounts owing to the Borrower by the Bank, whether or not then due
and payable, and (b) all other funds or property of the Borrower (i) in a
deposit account (general or special) maintained with the Bank, or (ii) on
deposit with or otherwise held by or in the custody of the Bank for the
beneficial account of the Borrower, whether solely in the name of or for the
benefit of the Borrower or jointly in the name of or for the benefit of the
Borrower and any other person, all without notice to or demand on the Borrower
or any other person, all such notices and demands being hereby expressly waived.
The Bank, will notify the Borrower of any such set-off promptly after its
occurrence, but the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of
the set-off. The Borrower hereby confirms the Bank's right of banker's set-off
(also known as banker's lien) as it applies to the Borrower as set forth above,
and nothing in this Note shall be deemed a waiver or prohibition of such right
of banker's set-off.

            6.3. REMEDIES CUMULATIVE. The Bank may exercise the remedies
provided in the Security Documents upon the occurrence of an Event of Default.
No right or remedy conferred upon the Bank by this Note or legally available to
the Bank if an Event of Default exists is intended to be exclusive of any other
right or remedy, and each such right or remedy is cumulative and in addition to
every other such right or remedy.

            6.4. FORCE MAJEURE. The existence of an Event of Default is not
affected by the reason for its occurrence, even if the Event of Default was not
caused by a voluntary act of the Borrower or the Guarantor or was caused by a
natural disaster or force majeure.

      SECTION 7. MISCELLANEOUS.

            7.1. MODIFICATIONS AND WAIVERS. No modification or waiver of any

unaffected thereby and each term or provision of this Note shall be valid and be

            7.4. NO IMPLIED RIGHTS OR WAIVERS. No notice to or demand on the
Borrower in any case shall entitle the Borrower to any other or further notice
or demand in the same, similar or other circumstances. Neither any failure nor
any delay on the part of the Bank in exercising any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall a single or partial
exercise thereof preclude any other or further exercise of the same or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The Borrower hereby waives
presentment, demand, notice, protest and all other demands and notices in
connection with the delivery, acceptance, performance, default or enforcement of
this Note.

first obtaining the written consent of the Bank, and any attempted assignment or
transfer in the absence of such consent shall be void and of no effect.

            7.6. EXPENSES. All fees, costs and expenses, including reasonable

Banking Day preceding the date of such LIBOR Loan for delivery on the date of
such LIBOR Loan, for deposits for a 30 day period and in an amount equal to the
amount of such LIBOR Loan.
