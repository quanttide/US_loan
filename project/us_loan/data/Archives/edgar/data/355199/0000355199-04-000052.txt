ITEM 5.03.  AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN
            FISCAL YEAR.

The  Company's  bylaws  provide  that  its  fiscal  year  end is  determined  by
resolution  of the  board of  directors.  On  December  22,  2004,  the Board of
Directors approved changing Essex's financial reporting to calendar year end and
quarterly  reporting.  Historically,  Essex  closed its fiscal  year on the last
Sunday in December and each fiscal quarter had ninety-one  days.  This change is
effective  for fiscal year end 2004 and will add the five days from  December 27
to December 31, inclusive, to fiscal 2004 results.

This change is relatively minor and is not significant for comparative purposes.
As a  result,  there  is no  requirement  under  SEC  rules  to file a  separate
transition  period  report or  intention  to  restate  prior  periods.  Calendar
reporting is more commonly used by industry peers and the Company  believes this
change  will  eliminate  potential  confusion  about the  periods  for which the
Company is reporting and the due dates for such reports.




                                   SIGNATURES

           Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities  Exchange Act of 1934,
the  registrant  has duly  caused  this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

                                   ESSEX CORPORATION



                                   /S/ LEONARD E. MOODISPAW
