<PAGE>
                  1. Title to Warrant. Prior to the Termination Date and subject
to compliance with applicable laws and Section 7 of this Warrant, this Warrant
and all rights hereunder are transferable, in whole or in part, at the office or
agency of the Company by the Holder in person or by duly authorized attorney,
upon surrender of this Warrant together with the Assignment Form annexed hereto
properly endorsed.

                  2. Authorization of Shares. The Company covenants that all
Warrant Shares which may be issued upon the exercise of the purchase rights
represented by this Warrant will, upon issuance, be duly authorized, validly
issued, fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges
in respect of the issue thereof (other than taxes in respect of any transfer
occurring contemporaneously with such issue).

                  3. Exercise of Warrant.

                           (a) Except as provided in Section 4 herein, exercise
         of the purchase rights represented by this Warrant may be made at any
         time or times on or after the Initial Exercise Date and on or before
         the Termination Date by the surrender of this Warrant and the Notice of
         Exercise Form annexed hereto duly executed, at the office of the
         Company (or such other office or agency of the Company as it may
         designate by notice in writing to the registered Holder at the address
         of such Holder appearing on the books of the Company) and upon payment
         of the Exercise Price of the shares thereby purchased by wire transfer
         or cashier's check drawn on a United States bank or by means of a
         cashless exercise pursuant to Section 3(d), the Holder shall be
         entitled to receive a certificate for the number of Warrant Shares so
         purchased. Certificates for shares purchased hereunder shall be
         delivered to the Holder within three (3) Trading Days after the date on
         which this Warrant shall have been exercised as aforesaid. The Company
         shall pay any and all transfer taxes which may be payable with respect
         to the issuance and delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this
         Warrant (other than taxes in respect of any transfer occurring
         contemporaneously with such issue and excluding, for the avoidance of
         doubt, any income or similar taxes). This Warrant shall be deemed to
         have been exercised and such certificate or certificates shall be
         deemed to have been issued, and the Holder or any other person so
         designated to be named therein shall be deemed to have become a holder
         of record of such shares for all purposes, as of the date the Warrant
         has been exercised by payment to the Company of the Exercise Price and
         all taxes required to be paid by the Holder, if any, pursuant to
         Section 5 prior to the issuance of such shares, have been paid. If the
         Company fails to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates
         representing the Warrant Shares pursuant to this Section 3(a) by the
         close of business on the third Trading Day after the date of exercise,
         then the Holder will have the right to rescind such exercise.

                           (b) If within three (3) Trading Days after the
         Company's receipt of this Warrant and an original or facsimile copy of
         a Notice of Exercise the Company shall fail to issue and deliver a
         certificate to the Holder and register such Warrant Shares on the
         Company's share register upon such Holder's exercise hereunder, and if
         on or after such Trading Day the Holder purchases (in an open market
         transaction or otherwise) shares of

                                        2
<PAGE>
         Common Stock to deliver in satisfaction of a sale by the Holder of
         Warrant Shares issuable upon such exercise that the Holder anticipated
         receiving from the Company (a "BUY-IN"), then the Company shall, within
         three Business Days after the Holder's request promptly honor its
         obligation to deliver to the Holder a certificate or certificates
         representing such Warrant Shares and pay cash to the Holder in an
         amount equal to the excess (if any) of such Holder's total purchase
         price (including brokerage commissions, if any) for the shares of
         Common Stock so purchased over the product of (A) such number of shares
         of Common Stock, times (B) the Closing Trade Price on the date of
         exercise. "CLOSING TRADE PRICE" means, for any security as of any date,
         the last closing trade price for such security on The Nasdaq SmallCap
         Market (the "PRINCIPAL MARKET"), as reported by Bloomberg, or, if the
         Principal Market begins to operate on an extended hours basis and does
         not designate the closing trade price, then the last trade price, of
         such security prior to 4:00 p.m., New York Time, as reported by
         Bloomberg Financial Markets ("BLOOMBERG"), or, if the Principal Market
         is not the principal securities exchange or trading market for such
         security, the last closing trade price of such security on the
         principal securities exchange or trading market where such security is
         listed or traded as reported by Bloomberg, or if the foregoing do not
         apply, the last closing trade price of such security in the
         over-the-counter market on the electronic bulletin board for such
         security as reported by Bloomberg, or, if no closing trade price is
         reported for such security by Bloomberg, the average of the trade
         prices of any market makers for such security as reported in the "pink
         sheets" by Pink Sheets LLC (formerly the National Quotation Bureau,
         Inc.). If the Closing Trade Price cannot be calculated for a security
         on a particular date on any of the foregoing bases, the Closing Trade
         Price of such security on such date shall be the fair market value as
         mutually determined by the Company and the Holder. If the Company and
         the Holder are unable to agree upon the fair market value of such
         security, then such dispute shall be resolved by an independent,
         reputable investment bank selected by the Company and approved by the
         Holder. Such investment bank's determination shall be binding upon all
         parties absent demonstrable error. All such determinations to be
         appropriately adjusted for any stock dividend, stock split, stock
         combination or other similar transaction during the applicable
         calculation period. "TRADING DAY" shall mean (i) a day on which the
         Common Stock is traded on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, or (ii) if the
         Common Stock is not listed on the Nasdaq SmallCap Market, a day on
         which the Common Stock is traded on the over-the-counter market, as
         reported by the OTC Bulletin Board, or (iii) if the Common Stock is not
         quoted on the OTC Bulletin Board, a day on which the Common Stock is
         quoted in the over-the-counter market as reported by the National
         Quotation Bureau Incorporated (or any similar organization or agency
         succeeding its functions of reporting prices); provided, that in the
         event that the Common Stock is not listed or quoted as set forth in
         (i), (ii) and (iii) hereof, then Trading Day shall mean a Business Day.

                           (c) If this Warrant shall have been exercised in
         part, the Company shall, at the time of delivery of the certificate or
         certificates representing Warrant Shares, deliver to Holder a new
         Warrant evidencing the rights of Holder to purchase the unpurchased
         Warrant Shares called for by this Warrant, which new Warrant shall in
         all other respects be identical with this Warrant.

                                       3
<PAGE>
                           (d) The Company shall not effect any exercise of this
         Warrant, and the Holder shall not have the right to exercise any
         portion of this Warrant, pursuant to Section 3(a) or otherwise, to the
         extent that after giving effect to such issuance after exercise, the
         Holder (together with the Holder's affiliates), as set forth on the
         applicable Notice of Exercise, would beneficially own in excess of
         4.99% of the number of shares of the Common Stock outstanding
         immediately after giving effect to such issuance. For purposes of the
         foregoing sentence, the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially
         owned by the Holder and its affiliates shall include the number of
         shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of this Warrant with
         respect to which the determination of such sentence is being made, but
         shall exclude the number of shares of Common Stock which would be
         issuable upon (A) exercise of the remaining, nonexercised portion of
         this Warrant beneficially owned by the Holder or any of its affiliates
         and (B) exercise or conversion of the unexercised or nonconverted
         portion of any other securities of the Company (including, without
         limitation, any other convertible notes or convertible preferred stock
         or other warrants) subject to a limitation on conversion or exercise
         analogous to the limitation contained herein beneficially owned by the
         Holder or any of its affiliates. Except as set forth in the preceding
         sentence, for purposes of this Section 3(d), beneficial ownership shall
         be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act and
         the rules promulgated thereunder. For purposes of this Section 3(d), in
         determining the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock, the
         Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock as
         reflected in (x) the Company's most recent Form 10-Q or Form 10-K, as
         the case may be, (y) a more recent public announcement by the Company
         or (z) any other notice by the Company or the Company's Transfer Agent
         setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding;
         provided that the Holder may rely on the number of outstanding shares
         of Common Stock as reflected in clause (x) or (y) only if it has no
         knowledge or reason to believe that the information contained therein
         is inaccurate. Upon the written or oral request of the Holder, the
         Company shall within two Trading Days confirm orally and in writing to
         the Holder the number of shares of Common Stock then outstanding. In
         any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall be
         determined after giving effect to the conversion or exercise of
         securities of the Company, including this Warrant, by the Holder or its
         affiliates since the date as of which such number of outstanding shares
         of Common Stock was reported. The provisions of this Section 3(d) may
         be waived by the Holder upon, at the election of the Holder, not less
         than 61 days' prior notice to the Company, and the provisions of this
         Section 3(d) shall continue to apply until such 61st day (or such later
         date, as determined by the Holder, as may be specified in such notice
         of waiver). No exercise of this Warrant in violation of this Section
         3(d) but otherwise in accordance with this Warrant shall affect the
         status of the Warrant Shares as validly issued, fully paid and
         nonassessable.

                           (e) If, but only if, at any time after one year from
         the date of issuance of this Warrant there is no effective Registration
         Statement registering the resale of the Warrant Shares by the Holder,
         this Warrant may also be exercised at such time by means of a "cashless
         exercise" in which the Holder shall be entitled to receive a
         certificate for the number of Warrant Shares equal to the quotient
         obtained by dividing ((A-B) (X)) by (A), where:

                                       4
<PAGE>
                  (A) = the VWAP on the Trading Day preceding the date of such
                        election;

                  (B) = the Exercise Price, as adjusted; and

                  (X) = the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of
                        this Warrant in accordance with the terms of this
                        Warrant.

                  4. No Fractional Shares or Scrip. No fractional shares or
scrip representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this
Warrant. As to any fraction of a share which Holder would otherwise be entitled
to purchase upon such exercise, the Company shall pay a cash adjustment in
respect of such final fraction in an amount equal to such fraction multiplied by
the Exercise Price.

                  5. Charges, Taxes and Expenses. Issuance of certificates for
Warrant Shares shall be made without charge to the Holder for any issue or
transfer tax or other incidental expense in respect of the issuance of such
certificate, all of which taxes and expenses shall be paid by the Company, and
such certificates shall be issued in the name of the Holder or in such name or
names as may be directed by the Holder; provided, however, that in the event
certificates for Warrant Shares are to be issued in a name other than the name
of the Holder, this Warrant when surrendered for exercise shall be accompanied
by the Assignment Form attached hereto duly executed by the Holder; and the
Company may require, as a condition thereto, the payment of a sum sufficient to
reimburse it for any transfer tax incidental thereto.

                  6. Closing of Books. The Company will not close its
stockholder books or records in any manner which prevents the timely exercise of
this Warrant, pursuant to the terms hereof.

                  7. Transfer, Division and Combination.

                           (a) Subject to compliance with any applicable
         securities laws and the conditions set forth in Sections 1 and 7(d)
         hereof and to the provisions of Section 1.2 of the Subscription
         Agreement, this Warrant and all rights hereunder are transferable, in
         whole or in part, upon surrender of this Warrant at the principal
         office of the Company, together with a written assignment of this
         Warrant substantially in the form attached hereto duly executed by the
         Holder or its agent or attorney and funds sufficient to pay any
         transfer taxes payable upon the making of such transfer. Upon such
         surrender and, if required, such payment, the Company shall execute and
         deliver a new Warrant in the name of the assignee and in the
         denomination specified in such instrument of assignment, and shall
         issue to the assignor a new Warrant, and this Warrant shall promptly be
         cancelled. A Warrant, if properly assigned, may be exercised by a new
         holder for the purchase of Warrant Shares without having a new Warrant
         issued.

                           (b) The Company shall prepare, issue and deliver at
         its own expense (other than transfer taxes) the new Warrant or Warrants
         under this Section 7.

                           (c) The Company agrees to maintain, at its aforesaid
         office, books for the registration and the registration of transfer of
         the Warrants.

                                       5
<PAGE>
                           (d) If, at the time of the surrender of this Warrant
         in connection with any transfer of this Warrant, the transfer of this
         Warrant shall not be registered pursuant to an effective registration
         statement under the Securities Act and under applicable state
         securities or blue sky laws, the Company may require, as a condition of
         allowing such transfer (i) that the Holder or transferee of this
         Warrant, as the case may be, furnish to the Company a written opinion
         of counsel (which opinion shall be in form, substance and scope
         customary for opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the
         effect that such transfer may be made without registration under the
         Securities Act and under applicable state securities or blue sky laws,
         (ii) that the holder or transferee execute and deliver to the Company
         an investment letter in form and substance reasonably acceptable to the
         Company and (iii) that the transferee be an "accredited investor" as
         defined in Rule 501(a) promulgated under the Securities Act.

                  8. No Rights as Shareholder until Exercise. This Warrant does
not entitle the Holder to any voting rights or other rights as a shareholder of
the Company. Upon the surrender of this Warrant and the payment of the aggregate
Exercise Price (or by means of a cashless exercise), the Warrant Shares so
purchased shall be and be deemed to be issued to such Holder as the record owner
of such shares as of the close of business on the later of the date of such
surrender or payment.

                  9. Loss, Theft, Destruction or Mutilation of Warrant. The
Company covenants that upon receipt by the Company of evidence reasonably
satisfactory to it of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant
or any stock certificate relating to the Warrant Shares, and in case of loss,
theft or destruction, of indemnity or security reasonably satisfactory to it
(which, in the case of the Warrant, shall not include the posting of any bond),
and upon surrender and cancellation of such Warrant or stock certificate, if
mutilated, the Company will make and deliver a new Warrant or stock certificate
of like tenor and dated as of such cancellation, in lieu of such Warrant or
stock certificate.

                  10. Saturdays, Sundays, Holidays, etc. If the last or
appointed day for the taking of any action or the expiration of any right
required or granted herein shall be a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, then
such action may be taken or such right may be exercised on the next succeeding
day not a Saturday, Sunday or legal holiday.

                  11. Adjustments of Exercise Price and Number of Warrant
Shares. The number and kind of securities purchasable upon the exercise of this
Warrant and the Exercise Price shall be subject to adjustment from time to time
upon the happening of any of the following. In case the Company shall (i) pay a
dividend in shares of Common Stock or make a distribution in shares of Common
Stock to holders of its outstanding Common Stock, (ii) subdivide its outstanding
shares of Common Stock into a greater number of shares, (iii) combine its
outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares of Common
Stock, or (iv) issue any shares of its capital stock in a reclassification of
the Common Stock, then the number of Warrant Shares purchasable upon exercise of
this Warrant immediately prior thereto shall be adjusted so that the Holder
shall be entitled to receive the kind and number of Warrant Shares or other
securities of the Company which it would have owned or have been entitled to
receive had such Warrant been exercised in advance thereof. Upon each such
adjustment of the kind and number of Warrant Shares or other securities of the
Company which are purchasable hereunder,

                                       6
<PAGE>
the Holder shall thereafter be entitled to purchase the number of Warrant Shares
or other securities resulting from such adjustment at an Exercise Price per
Warrant Share or other security obtained by multiplying the Exercise Price in
effect immediately prior to such adjustment by the number of Warrant Shares
purchasable pursuant hereto immediately prior to such adjustment and dividing by
the number of Warrant Shares or other securities of the Company resulting from
such adjustment. An adjustment made pursuant to this paragraph shall become
effective immediately after the effective date of such event retroactive to the
record date, if any, for such event.

                  12. Reorganization, Reclassification, Merger, Consolidation or
Disposition of Assets. In case the Company shall reorganize its capital,
reclassify its capital stock, consolidate or merge with or into another
corporation (where the Company is not the surviving corporation of such event or
where there is a change in or distribution with respect to the Common Stock of
the Company), or sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all
its property, assets or business to another corporation and, pursuant to the
terms of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or
disposition of assets, shares of common stock of the successor or acquiring
corporation, or any cash, shares of stock or other securities or property of any
nature whatsoever (including warrants or other subscription or purchase rights)
in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the successor or acquiring
corporation ("Other Property"), are to be received by or distributed to the
holders of Common Stock of the Company, then the Holder shall have the right
thereafter to receive, upon exercise of this Warrant, the number of shares of
Common Stock of the successor or acquiring corporation or of the Company, if it
is the surviving corporation, and Other Property receivable upon or as a result
of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation or disposition
of assets by a Holder of the number of shares of Common Stock for which this
Warrant is exercisable immediately prior to such event. In addition to the
foregoing, in case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation or disposition of assets, the successor or acquiring corporation
(if other than the Company) shall expressly assume the due and punctual
observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition of this
Warrant to be performed and observed by the Company and all the obligations and
liabilities hereunder, subject to such modifications as may be deemed
appropriate (as determined in good faith by resolution of the Board of Directors
of the Company) in order to provide for adjustments of Warrant Shares for which
this Warrant is exercisable which shall be as nearly equivalent as practicable
to the adjustments provided for in this Section 12. For purposes of this Section
12, "common stock of the successor or acquiring corporation" shall include stock
of such corporation of any class which is not preferred as to dividends or
assets over any other class of stock of such corporation and which is not
subject to redemption and shall also include any evidences of indebtedness,
shares of stock or other securities which are convertible into or exchangeable
for any such stock, either immediately or upon the arrival of a specified date
or the happening of a specified event and any warrants or other rights to
subscribe for or purchase any such stock. The foregoing provisions of this
Section 12 shall similarly apply to successive reorganizations,
reclassifications, mergers, consolidations or disposition of assets.

                  13. Notice of Adjustment. Whenever the number of Warrant
Shares or number or kind of securities or other property purchasable upon the
exercise of this Warrant or the Exercise Price is adjusted, as herein provided,
the Company shall give notice thereof to the Holder, which notice shall state
the number of Warrant Shares (and other securities or property) purchasable upon
the exercise of this Warrant and the Exercise Price of such Warrant Shares (and
other

                                       7
<PAGE>
securities or property) after such adjustment, setting forth a brief statement
of the facts requiring such adjustment and setting forth the computation by
which such adjustment was made.

                  14. Notice of Corporate Action. If at any time:

                           (a) the Company shall take a record of the holders of
         its Common Stock for the purpose of entitling them to receive a
         dividend or other distribution, or any right to subscribe for or
         purchase any evidences of its indebtedness, any shares of stock of any
         class or any other securities or property, or to receive any other
         right, or

                           (b) there shall be any capital reorganization of the
         Company, any reclassification or recapitalization of the capital stock
         of the Company or any consolidation or merger of the Company with, or
         any sale, transfer or other disposition of all or substantially all the
         property, assets or business of the Company to, another corporation or,

                           (c) there shall be a voluntary or involuntary
         dissolution, liquidation or winding up of the Company;

then, in any one or more of such cases, the Company shall give to Holder (i) at
least 20 days' prior written notice of the date on which a record date shall be
selected for such dividend, distribution or right or for determining rights to
vote in respect of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger,
consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition, liquidation or winding up, and (ii)
in the case of any such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation,
sale, transfer, disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up, at least 20
days' prior written notice of the date when the same shall take place. Such
notice in accordance with the foregoing clause also shall specify (i) the date
on which any such record is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend,
distribution or right, the date on which the holders of Common Stock shall be
entitled to any such dividend, distribution or right, and the amount and
character thereof, and (ii) the date on which any such reorganization,
reclassification, merger, consolidation, sale, transfer, disposition,
dissolution, liquidation or winding up is to take place and the time, if any
such time is to be fixed, as of which the holders of Common Stock shall be
entitled to exchange their Warrant Shares for securities or other property
deliverable upon such disposition, dissolution, liquidation or winding up. Each
such written notice shall be sufficiently given if addressed to Holder at the
last address of Holder appearing on the books of the Company and delivered in
accordance with Section 16(d).

                  15. Authorized Shares. The Company covenants that during the
period the Warrant is outstanding, it will reserve from its authorized and
unissued Common Stock a sufficient number of shares to provide for the issuance
of the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of any purchase rights under this
Warrant. The Company further covenants that its issuance of this Warrant shall
constitute full authority to its officers who are charged with the duty of
executing stock certificates to execute and issue the necessary certificates for
the Warrant Shares upon the exercise of the purchase rights under this Warrant.
The Company will take all such reasonable action as may be necessary to assure
that such Warrant Shares may be issued as provided herein without violation of
any applicable law or regulation, or of any requirements of the Trading Market
upon which the Common Stock may be listed.

                  Except and to the extent as waived or consented to by the
Holder, the Company shall not by any action, including, without limitation,
amending its certificate of incorporation or through any reorganization,
transfer of assets, consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of
securities or any other voluntary action, avoid or seek to avoid the observance
or performance of any of the terms of this Warrant, but will at all times in
good faith assist in the carrying out of all such terms and in the taking of all
such actions as may be necessary or appropriate to protect the rights of Holder
as set forth in this Warrant against impairment. Without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, the Company will (a) not increase the par value of any Warrant
Shares above the amount payable therefor upon such exercise immediately prior to
such increase in par value, (b) take all such action as may be necessary or
appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue fully paid
and nonassessable Warrant Shares upon the exercise of this Warrant, and (c) use
commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all such authorizations, exemptions or
consents from any public regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof as may be
necessary to enable the Company to perform its obligations under this Warrant.

                  Before taking any action which would result in an adjustment
in the number of Warrant Shares for which this Warrant is exercisable or in the
Exercise Price, the Company shall obtain all such authorizations or exemptions
thereof, or consents thereto, as may be necessary from any public regulatory
body or bodies having jurisdiction thereof.

                  16. Miscellaneous.

                           (a) Jurisdiction. This Warrant shall constitute a
         contract under the laws of New York, without regard to its conflict of
         law, principles or rules.

                           (b) Restrictions. The Holder acknowledges that the
         Warrant Shares acquired upon the exercise of this Warrant, if not
         registered, will have restrictions upon resale imposed by state and
         federal securities laws.

                           (c) Nonwaiver and Expenses. No course of dealing or
         any delay or failure to exercise any right hereunder on the part of
         Holder shall operate as a waiver of such right or otherwise prejudice
         Holder's rights, powers or remedies, notwithstanding all rights
         hereunder terminate on the Termination Date. If the Company fails to
         comply with any provision of this Warrant, which results in any
         material damages to the Holder, the Company shall pay to Holder such
         amounts as shall be sufficient to cover any costs and expenses
         including, but not limited to, reasonable attorneys' fees, including
         those of appellate proceedings, incurred by Holder in collecting any
         amounts due pursuant hereto or in otherwise enforcing any of its
         rights, powers or remedies hereunder.

                           (d) Notices. Any notice, request or other document
         required or permitted to be given or delivered to the Holder by the
         Company shall be delivered in accordance with the notice provisions of
         the Subscription Agreement; provided that upon any permitted assignment
         of this Warrant, the assignee shall promptly provide the Company with
         its address for notices, which shall be the address for notices to such
         assignee, until changed in accordance with the Subscription Agreement.

                           (e) Limitation of Liability. No provision hereof, in
         the absence of any affirmative action by Holder to exercise this
         Warrant or purchase Warrant Shares, and no enumeration herein of the
         rights or privileges of Holder, shall give rise to any liability of
         Holder for the purchase price of any Common Stock or as a stockholder
         of the Company, whether such liability is asserted by the Company or by
         creditors of the Company.

                           (f) Remedies. Holder, in addition to being entitled
         to exercise all rights granted by law, including recovery of damages,
         will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this
         Warrant, without the necessity of showing economic loss and without any
         bond or other security being required. The Company agrees that monetary
         damages would not be adequate compensation for any loss incurred by
         reason of a breach by it of the provisions of this Warrant and hereby
         agrees to waive the defense in any action for specific performance that
         a remedy at law would be adequate.

                           (g) Successors and Assigns. Subject to applicable
         securities laws, this Warrant and the rights and obligations evidenced
         hereby shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the successors
         of the Company and the successors and permitted assigns of Holder. The
         provisions of this Warrant are intended to be for the benefit of all
         Holders from time to time of this Warrant and shall be enforceable by
         any such Holder or holder of Warrant Shares.

                           (h) Amendment. This Warrant may be modified or
         amended or the provisions hereof waived with the written consent of the
         Company and the Holder.

                           (i) Severability. Wherever possible, each provision
         of this Warrant shall be interpreted in such manner as to be effective
         and valid under applicable law, but if any provision of this Warrant
         shall be prohibited by or invalid under applicable law, such provision
         shall be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or invalidity,
         without invalidating the remainder of such provisions or the remaining
         provisions of this Warrant.

                           (j) Headings. The headings used in this Warrant are
         for the convenience of reference only and shall not, for any purpose,
         be deemed a part of this Warrant.

                           (k) Acceptance. Receipt of this Warrant by the Holder
         shall constitute acceptance of and agreement to all of the terms and
         conditions contained herein.
