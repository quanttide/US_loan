Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including statements about the projected use of proceeds. Future
events and Loudeye&#146;s actual results could differ materially from the results reflected in these
forward-looking statements. Factors that might cause such a difference include, but are not limited
to, the inability to satisfy closing conditions relating to the private placement, delays in
consummating the private placement for reasons beyond Loudeye&#146;s control, unanticipated expenses or
liabilities or other adverse events affecting Loudeye or the private placement, and risks detailed
from time to time in Loudeye&#146;s SEC reports, including quarterly reports on Form 10-Q, reports on
Form 8-K and annual reports on Form 10-K available through EDGAR at www.sec.gov. Loudeye reserves
the right to change the use of these proceeds from time to time as a result of contingencies such
as competitive developments, technological advances, or new business opportunities, including
opportunities to acquire products, technologies or businesses. Many of these factors or
contingencies are beyond Lodueye&#146;s ability to control or predict. Loudeye assumes no obligation to
update the forward-looking statements.
