<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">For privacy, the Holiday Quality Foods location will incorporate a
unique design twist for an in-store bank. It will be completely enclosed within
the popular grocery store and the layout will include discrete conference
spaces. The 1,200 square-foot location also features a 24-hour night deposit
with indoor ATM available during Holiday Quality Foods store hours, Monday &#151;
Sunday 6 AM to 11 PM.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The bank&#146;s relationship with Holiday Quality Foods began in June 2003
with the opening of their in-store branch in Magalia, California. &#147;When the
opportunity became available to partner with such a fine community
establishment as Holiday Quality Foods, we couldn&#146;t pass it up,&#148; noted Senior
Vice President in charge of branch development, Russ Wittmeier.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

total of 11 branches in Northern California with three in the
Yuba/Sutter/Colusa region. Throughout its expansion, Butte Community Bank has
remained committed to its community banking roots. With administrative offices
in Chico, California, all decisions are still made locally, right here in the
Northstate.</font></p>
