conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America. Our audit will be conducted in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted in the United States of America and will include tests of your accounting
records and other procedures we consider necessary to enable us to express such an opinion. If our opinion is other than unqualified, we will discuss the reasons with you in advance. If, for any reason, we are unable to complete the audit or are
unable to form or have not formed an opinion, we may decline to express an opinion or to issue a report as a result of this engagement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P

inventories, and direct confirmation of receivables and certain other assets and liabilities by correspondence with selected customers, creditors, and financial institutions. We will also request written representations from your attorneys as part
of the engagement, and they may bill you for responding to this inquiry. At the conclusion of our audit, we will require certain written representations from you about the financial statements and related matters. </FONT></P> <P

and disclosures in the financial statements; therefore, our audit will involve judgment about the number of transactions to be examined and the areas to be tested. Also, we will plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether
the financial statements are free of material misstatement, whether from errors, fraudulent financial reporting, misappropriation of assets, or violations of laws or governmental regulations that are attributable to the entity or to acts by
management or employees acting on behalf of the entity. Because an audit is designed to provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance and because we will not perform a detailed examination of all transactions, there is a risk that material
misstatements may exist and not be detected by us. In addition, an audit is not designed to detect immaterial misstatements or violations of laws or governmental regulations that </FONT></P>

sufficient to plan the audit and to determine the nature, timing, and extent of audit procedures to be performed. An audit is not designed to provide assurance on internal control or to identify reportable conditions, that is, significant
deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control. However, during the audit, if we become aware of such reportable conditions, we will communicate them to you. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

As part of our engagement, we may propose standard, adjusting, or correcting journal entries to your financial statements. You are responsible for reviewing the entries and understanding the nature of any proposed entries and the impact they have on
the financial statements. Further, you are responsible for designating a qualified management-level individual to be responsible and accountable for overseeing these services. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

where the fraud could have a material effect on the financial statements. You are also responsible for informing us of your knowledge of any allegations of fraud or suspected fraud affecting the Company received in communications from employees,
former employees, grantors, regulators, or others. In addition, you are responsible for identifying and ensuring the Organization complies with applicable laws and regulations. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

(requires little or no adjusting journal entries); (2) we will receive full support from your accounting personnel necessary for the preparation of all items discussed or as outlined on our client assistance list, to be provided; and (3) the
preparation of items on our client assistance list will be completed prior to our arrival to begin fieldwork, if applicable. If for some reason your accounting personnel are unable to provide the contemplated assistance, or should we encounter
unexpected circumstances that will require spending more time than presently anticipated, we will bring this to your attention and discuss the additional cost during the normal billing process. A change in the scope of our services (i.e., due to
changes to regulations or professional accounting standards affecting you, loss of key accounting or other personnel, acquisitions, etc.) may also require additional time and, therefore, add to the cost of the engagement. We assure you that we will
make every attempt to hold our time to a minimum, commensurate with the work involved. Services other than your audit and preparation of income tax returns, such as research or consultation, would be an additional cost. In accordance with firm
policy, work may be suspended if your account becomes significantly overdue and will not be resumed until your account is paid in full. If we elect to terminate our services for nonpayment, you will be obligated to compensate us for all time
expended and to reimburse us for all out-of-pocket expenditures through the date of termination. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
