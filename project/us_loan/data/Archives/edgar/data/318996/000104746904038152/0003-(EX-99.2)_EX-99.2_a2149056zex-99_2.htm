<P ALIGN="CENTER"><FONT SIZE=2><B>KEY ENERGY RECEIVES EXTENSION FROM BANK LENDERS<BR>
AND BEGINS DISCUSSIONS WITH THE NEW YORK STOCK EXCHANGE  </B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>MIDLAND, TX, December&nbsp;20, 2004</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Key Energy Services,&nbsp;Inc. (NYSE: KEG) announced today that the lenders under its
$175&nbsp;million revolving credit facility have amended the terms of the facility to extend their waiver of non-compliance with covenants requiring delivery of audited financial
statements. The revolving credit facility lenders have agreed to extend to March&nbsp;31, 2005, the date by which the Company must deliver audited financial statements for 2003 and quarterly
unaudited financial statements for the first three quarters of 2004. Accordingly, the Company continues to be able to borrow under the revolving credit facility and obtain letters of credit. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Under
the terms of the latest amendment, until the Company receives the consent of the bondholders to extend the date by which it must deliver its financial statements, the outstanding borrowings
under its revolving credit facility cannot exceed $150&nbsp;million. The Company currently has outstanding borrowings of $48&nbsp;million and outstanding letters of credit of $75.7&nbsp;million.
The Company believes that it has adequate cash flow and liquidity to fund its current activities. The terms of the amendment are otherwise similar to those set forth in the prior amendments announced
on April&nbsp;7, 2004 and on September&nbsp;2, 2004. The Company will pay waiver fees of approximately $437,500 to the lenders and an administrative fee to the administrative agent in
consideration of the amendment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company has received waivers from two of its three primary equipment lessors and anticipates receiving a response to its request from the third lessor shortly. There can be no assurances that the
Company will receive the waivers from the third primary equipment lessor or the other equipment lessors. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
Company also announced that its management met with the New York Stock Exchange (the "NYSE") on Friday, December&nbsp;17, 2004 to discuss its continued listing status. The Company requested that
the NYSE provide an extension to file its Form&nbsp;10-K for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 so that it can continue its listing status. The Company is seeking an extension for a
period of up to three months and anticipates that the NYSE will make its decision by early January; however, there can be no assurances that an extension will be granted. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>Commenting
on the waiver, Dick Alario, Chairman and CEO, stated, "Once again, we are very appreciative of the willingness of our senior lenders to work with the Company. It is our objective to
complete the restatement process on or before March&nbsp;31, 2005; however, we are not yet able to predict a specific date for completion. We will soon begin our extension discussions with the
holders of our 6<SUP>3</SUP>/<SMALL>8</SMALL>% and 8<SUP>3</SUP>/<SMALL>8</SMALL>% Senior Notes." </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2><I> Whenever possible, the Company has identified these "forward-looking statements" by words such as "expects", "believes", "anticipates" and similar phrases. Readers are cautioned that any such forward-
looking statements are not guarantees of future performance or the results of the ongoing review and restatements and are subject to certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to
predict, including, but not limited to risks related to the ability of the Company to complete its restatement and audit processes for 2003 and prior years and its ability to complete financial
statements for the first three quarters of 2004, in each case by March&nbsp;31, 2005; the impact of higher interest rate margins and commitment fees based on the timing of delivery of financial
statements and improvements in the ratings of the Company's secured debt; the risk that limitations on availability under the revolving credit facility will affect the Company's liquidity; the risk
that the Company will not be able to obtain consents or waivers from an equipment lessor or its noteholders; and the risk that the NYSE will not grant a waiver from listing requirements to provide
financial statements and the restatement process. Given these uncertainties, readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward-looking statements. Unless otherwise required by law, the
Company also disclaims any obligation to update its view of any such risks or uncertainties or to announce publicly the result of any revisions to the forward-looking statements made here; however,
readers should review carefully reports or documents the Company files periodically with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</I></FONT></P>
