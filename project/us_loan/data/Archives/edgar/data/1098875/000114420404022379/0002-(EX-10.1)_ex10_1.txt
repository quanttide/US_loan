                                                                    Exhibit 10.1


                                Letter Of Intent


       This Letter Of Intent (the "LOI") sets forth our general understanding
through which Monterey Bay Tech, Inc. ("MBYI") shall acquire, either through the
purchase of stock or merger, a Delaware corporation ("SpaceLogic US") which will
own 100% of the equity interests of SpaceLogic Ltd. ("SpaceLogic"), an Israeli
corporation, with MBYI being the surviving corporation in a proposed reverse
merger arranged by Baytree Capital Associates, LLC ("Baytree"), in exchange for
the issuance of 68.8% of MBYI's common stock to SpaceLogic's stockholders.

       It is the intent of the parties that this LOI be binding upon the parties
hereto, subject to the provisions of Section 6 below. The following are the
material terms of the proposed reverse merger and the financing which MBYI shall
undertake as a condition of Closing:

1. The Transaction. MBYI and SpaceLogic desire and intend to enter into a
transaction by which MBYI will acquire 100% of the equity of SpaceLogic US which
will own 100% of the equity of SpaceLogic in exchange for SpaceLogic's
stockholders' receiving 68.8% of the issued and outstanding shares of MBYI on a
fully diluted basis (the "Reverse Acquisition"). SpaceLogic US shall become the
principal operating company in the United States. SpaceLogic shall continue to
operate as a wholly-owned subsidiary of SpaceLogic US and continue SpaceLogic's
current R&D and operations in Israel. Notwithstanding any provision in this
agreement, the precise structure of the Reverse Acquisition and the operations
to be conducted by each of the entities will be determined so as to provide the
most efficient operational structure for SpaceLogic from tax perspectives. At
the time of the Reverse Acquisition, MBYI (a) shall have not less than $1.9
million of cash in its bank account (the "Cash Balance"), provided, however,
that upon execution of definitive agreements regarding the Reverse Transaction,
Baytree or its designee, shall, within 10 days of a request by SpaceLogic, loan
to SpaceLogic $500,000 pursuant to terms to be negotiated, which shall reduce
the Cash Balance at the closing of the Reverse Acquisition by such amount and
extinguish any repayment obligation of SpaceLogic with respect thereto, provided
further, that if the definitive agreement governing the Reverse Acquisition is
terminated prior to closing, SpaceLogic shall repay such amount no later than on
the 180th day following such termination, and (b) shall be owed cash payments as
set forth in Schedule "A" hereto pursuant to binding and unconditional
commitments of third parties which will not result in any repayment obligation
or dilution to the equity holders of SpaceLogic (the "Owed Payments").

         As of the closing of the transaction, the assets of MBYI other than the
Cash Balance and the Owed Payments, as set forth on Schedule "B" hereto (the
"Excluded Assets") shall be distributed to the pre-closing stockholders of MBYI
as a dividend or pursuant to a mechanism to be determined by MBYI.
Nothwithstanding any provision in this Agreement, the parties agree to
consummate the transaction in such a manner so as not to alter the economic
benefits conferred upon SpaceLogic as contemplated hereunder.

       2. Post-Closing Structure. The post-closing ownership shall be as
follows:

             ------------------------------------- --------------- ----------
                                                       Shares          %
             ------------------------------------- --------------- ----------
             MBYI's Existing Shareholders              11,019,267       20.8
             ------------------------------------- --------------- ----------
             New Investors                              2,203,852        4.1
             ------------------------------------- --------------- ----------
             SpaceLogic                                36,363,578       68.8
             ------------------------------------- --------------- ----------
             Baytree                                    3,305,780        6.3
             ------------------------------------- --------------- ----------
                  Total                                52,892,477      100.0
             ------------------------------------- --------------- ----------

         The foregoing is based on MBYI having no material liabilities and upon
consummation of the equity sale contemplated by Section 3.

         In the event that prior to the closing, MBYI shall desire not to
distribute any of the Excluded Assets to the pre-closing stockholders of MBYI,
the parties agree to negotiate, in good faith, an adjustment to the post-closing
ownership of MBYI, provided, however, that notwithstanding the foregoing,
SpaceLogic may, at its sole discretion, elect to consummate the transaction
without inclusion of any Excluded Assets.

         The post closing members of MBYI's Board of Directors shall be elected
or appointed by the post-closing equity holders which holders shall be entitled
to elect or appoint in accordance with their percentage equity interests.

         3. Initial Financing. In connection with the Reverse Acquisition, four
units of equity will be issued to a group of investors to be assembled by
Baytree (the "New Investors") in the amount of $250,000 for a total of $1.0
million. Each unit shall contain 550,963 common shares of MBYI representing a
price of $0.45 per share, and a warrant to purchase 550,963 common shares of
MBYI at a price of $1.50 per share. The warrant will expire four years from the
date of Closing.

       4. Use of Proceeds. The proceeds from the financings contemplated hereby
shall be used by SpaceLogic for working capital and no restrictions shall be
placed on the use of such funds.

       5. Agreement and Plan of Reorganization. Upon the acceptance of this
letter by SpaceLogic, MBYI and SpaceLogic will promptly negotiate, in good
faith, the terms of the agreement and plan of reorganization (the "Agreement").
The Agreement will be in a form customary for transactions of this type and will
include, in addition to those matters specifically set forth in this letter,
customary representations, warranties, indemnities, covenants and agreements of
both SpaceLogic and MBYI, customary conditions of closing and other customary
matters. MBYI and SpaceLogic and their respective representatives, agree to
cooperate and to use their best efforts to cause the Agreement to be executed
and delivered, and the Closing to occur within 60 days.

       6. Due Diligence Investigation. Each party will diligently pursue, and
will endeavor to complete an investigation of the legal, business, and financial
condition of the other party. Both parties will extend their full cooperation to
the other party and its lawyers, accountants and other representatives in

<PAGE>

connection with such investigation. Each party, its lawyers, accountants and
other representatives shall have full access to the other party's books and
records, facilities, accountants and key employees for purpose of conducting
such investigation, all subject to the signing of confidentiality undertakings
in a form to be acceptable to both parties. The consummation of the transaction
contemplated by this letter shall be conditional upon each party's complete
satisfaction with such investigation, including with respect to any legal
requirements for the completion of the transaction (e.g., SEC filings, SEC
investigation, restriction on stockholders following the transaction etc.).

       7. Public Announcements. Except as required by law, MBYI shall not make
any public announcements regarding the transaction contemplated herein without
the consent of SpaceLogic, not to be unreasonably withheld. Any press release or
other public disclosure, and any Form 8-K report prepared for filing by MBYI,
shall be reviewed and commented on by SpaceLogic prior to its publication.

       8. Filing and Applications. Subject to the confidentiality undertakings,
each party will cooperate fully with the other party in furnishing any necessary
information required in connection with any regulatory matters.

       9. Conduct of Business by SpaceLogic. Pending execution of the Agreement,
SpaceLogic shall conduct its business in the ordinary course and promptly inform
Baytree of any event outside the ordinary course of business.

       10. Expenses. Each party will bear its own expenses and costs of the
transaction contemplated hereby, including, but not limited to, the fees of
attorneys and financial advisers.

       11. Board Recommendation, No Solicitation and Exclusivity.

         (a) Recommendation of Board of Directors. The board of directors of
SpaceLogic has approved the transactions contemplated by this LOI or will
recommend the transactions to the stockholders of SpaceLogic. If, during the
Exclusivity Period (as set forth below), the board of directors of SpaceLogic
receives a Superior Proposal, which it must consider pursuant to Section 12(b),
and its board of directors is required by law to submit such Superior Proposal
to its stockholders, the board of directors shall submit such Superior Proposal
without recommendation.

         (b) No Solicitation. SpaceLogic agrees that during the Exclusivity
Period, neither it nor any of the officers and directors shall initiate, solicit
or encourage any inquiries, proposals or offers with respect to a merger,
reorganization, share exchange, consolidation, business combination,
recapitalization, sale of assets, or the like (any such proposal, other than
that made by MBYI, an "Acquisition Proposal"). SpaceLogic further agrees that,
during the Exclusivity Period, neither it nor any of its officers and directors
shall have any discussion with or provide any confidential information or data
to any person or entity (each a "Person") relating to an Acquisition Proposal.
SpaceLogic shall be permitted, solely to the extent necessary to fulfill its
fiduciary duties under law, to engage in any discussions or negotiations with,
or provide any information to, any Person in response to an unsolicited bona
fide written Acquisition Proposal, only to the extent that (x) SpaceLogic
concludes in good faith that such Acquisition Proposal constitutes a Superior
Proposal (or such Acquisition Proposal could likely result in a Superior
Proposal), (y) SpaceLogic receives from such Person an executed confidentiality
agreement containing terms at least as stringent as those contained in the
confidentiality agreement with MBYI, and (z) SpaceLogic (i) notifies MBYI
promptly of such inquiry, proposal, offer, information request, or discussion,
(ii) discloses to MBYI the name of such Person and the material terms and
conditions of any inquiry, proposal or offer, and (iii) prior to submitting such
Superior Proposal for consideration by its stockholders, SpaceLogic shall allow
MBYI (in its sole discretion) to prepare a revised proposal.


<PAGE>

      (b) Exclusivity. For a period of 90 days following the date hereof (the
"Exclusivity Period"), SpaceLogic agrees that it will, and will cause its
officers, directors to, immediately cease and cause to be terminated any
activities, discussions or negotiations existing as of the date of this LOI with
any parties (other than MBYI) with respect to any Acquisition Proposal.
SpaceLogic agrees that it will promptly inform its directors, officers, key
employees, agents and representatives of the obligations undertaken in this
Section 11.


       12. Counterpart Execution. This letter may be executed by the parties in
counterparts, all of which shall constitute one and the same original.

       13. Amendment. The terms of this letter may be amended, modified or
waived only in writing by the parties hereto.

       14. Governing Law. This LOI will be governed by the laws of the State of
Delaware. If the foregoing correctly set forth the material terms of your
understanding of the proposed Reverse Acquisition and, if such terms are
acceptable to you, please execute two originals of this letter and return one
executed original to the undersigned. We look forward to a successful Closing
and business relationship.
