     ANACOMP(R) ANNOUNCES PLAN TO DEREGISTER ITS SECURITIES. REPURCHASES TO
       CONTINUE UNDER ITS REPURCHASE PLAN. ANACOMP REPORTS FOURTH QUARTER
                     AND FISCAL YEAR 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS

                                      * * *

Anacomp Reports Revenues of $184 Million for Fiscal Year 2004; docHarbor(R) Web
  Presentment Services Grows 32% From Fiscal Year 2003; Multi-Vendor Services
    Annual Revenue Grows 10% From Fiscal Year 2003; Fiscal Year 2004 Pretax
           Operating Loss from Continuing Operations was $8.2 Million

                                      * * *

     SAN DIEGO, CA - December 20, 2004 - Anacomp, Inc. (OTC BB: ANCPA), a global
provider of information  outsourcing,  maintenance support and imaging and print
solutions,  today announced that it plans to voluntarily  deregister its Class A
Common  Stock,  Class B Common Stock and Class B Common Stock  Warrants from the
reporting  requirements  of the SEC on or about  January 25, 2005.  Anacomp also
announced  that it plans  to  continue  repurchasing  its  Class A Common  Stock
pursuant to its previously  authorized  repurchase plan, with approximately $8.4
million remaining authorized for this purpose through December 31, 2005.


     Anacomp  also  reported  its  financial  results,  with a net  loss of $3.1
million for the three  months  ended  September  30, 2004 and a net loss of $9.9
million for fiscal year 2004. Revenues were $43 million and $184 million for the
three months and twelve months ended September 30, 2004, respectively.

     "While the results for the 2004 fiscal year  reflect the  continued  double
digit growth of our  docHarbor(R) Web Presentment and MVS product line revenues,
which have grown 32% and 10%,  respectively,  over the prior  fiscal  year,  the
extensive  restructuring of our data centers was also accomplished this year. In
total,  we closed 30  facilities,  decreased  our  number  of  employees  by 246
worldwide and incurred $9.1 million in  restructuring  charges,  $2.7 million of
which occurred in the fourth fiscal quarter."


     "We have radically changed the way we do business in our data centers. This
has caused extra costs in the short term. But we have also  streamlined our cost
structure across the company for our legacy COM and CD business.  We believe the
planned actions taken this fiscal year will greatly improve our operations,  and
enhance shareholder value next year," said Jeff Cramer, Chief Executive Officer.


Plans to Deregister Securities

     Anacomp's  plans to  deregister  its  securities  were made  after  careful
consideration of the advantages and disadvantages of continuing registration and
the rising costs and demands on  management  time arising from  compliance  with
SEC, Sarbanes-Oxley and OTC Bulletin Board requirements.  Anacomp is eligible to
deregister each class of its securities because it has fewer than 300 holders of
record  for each such  class.  The Board of  Directors  believes  that while the
liquidity  for  Anacomp's  stock  may be  reduced  and the price of its stock is
likely  to  decrease  at least in the  near  term,  the  accounting,  legal  and
administrative savings associated with deregistration, both in terms of cost and
in time, are in the best interests of  shareholders  and Anacomp.  For Anacomp's
size and the thinly-traded nature of its stock, the Board believes the financial
and strategic  burden is  disproportionate  to the benefits of  maintaining  its
registered   status.   In  light  of  current  and  expected  future  regulatory
requirements,  especially the recent ones stemming from Sarbanes-Oxley,  Anacomp
estimates  that the savings  could range from $2.7  million to $3.2 million over
the  next  two  fiscal  years,   and  may  realize  ongoing  annual  savings  of
approximately  $1.5  million in addition to any  indirect  costs.  Anacomp  also
expects that management will be able to better focus its attention and resources
on continuing to improve operations and enhancing shareholder value.

     "Current  market  conditions  do not warrant the  significant  annual costs
associated with our being a reporting  company.  Our Board of Directors believes
it is prudent to use these funds to enhance Anacomp's financial performance.  As
a non-registered  company,  we will have more flexibility in pursuing  strategic
opportunities,  continuing to invest in our core business and in recruiting  and
retaining our people.  This move will also enable  management to focus more time
on operating our business," said Jeff Cramer.


     Anacomp expects that the  deregistration  will become  effective  within 90
days after its filing of the Form 15s with the SEC.  Upon  making the  necessary
filings with the SEC, Anacomp's  obligation to file reports under the Securities
Exchange  Act,  including  Forms  10-K,  10-Q,  8-K and proxy  statements,  will
immediately  be suspended and future  reports will not be available  through the
SEC EDGAR  system.  Following the  deregistration,  however,  Anacomp  currently
intends to continue to hold annual  meetings and to  voluntarily  make  periodic
financial and other  information  available to its shareholders via its website,
www.anacomp.com.


     As a result of deregistering  with the SEC,  Anacomp's Class A Common Stock
and Class B Common  Stock  will no longer be  eligible  for  listing  on the OTC
Bulletin Board.  Anacomp anticipates,  but cannot guarantee,  that following the
Form 15 filings  in  late-January,  its Class A Common  Stock and Class B Common
Stock  will  continue  to be  quoted  by the Pink  Sheets  Electronic  Quotation
Service, to the extent broker-dealers commit to make a market in its shares. The
Pink Sheets is a  centralized  quotation  service that  collects  and  publishes
market   maker   quotes  in  real  time,   primarily   through  its  website  at
www.pinksheets.com. Anacomp can provide no assurance that any broker-dealer will
make a market in its securities, which is a requirement for Pink Sheet trading.


Repurchases to Continue

     Anacomp plans to continue repurchasing its Class A Common Stock pursuant to
its previously authorized repurchase program.  Under the authorization,  Anacomp
may  periodically  repurchase  shares on the open  market at  prevailing  market
prices or in  privately  negotiated  transactions.  As of December  13, 2004 and
after  accounting  for  repurchases  made  last  fiscal  quarter,   Anacomp  was
authorized  to repurchase up to $8.4 million of its Class A Common Stock through
December  31,  2005.  Shares  purchased  under the  repurchase  program  will be
cancelled. Anacomp expects repurchases to be funded by available cash.


Fourth Quarter Fiscal Year 2004 Results

     For the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2004,  Anacomp's  operating loss
from  continuing  operations  was  $2.3  million,  compared  to a  $0.9  million
operating  loss from  continuing  operations in the fourth  quarter of the prior
fiscal  year.  The net loss in the fourth  quarter of fiscal  year 2004 was $3.1
million,  compared with a net loss of $0.4 million in the fourth  quarter of the
prior fiscal year.  Revenues for the three months ended  September 30, 2004 were
$43.0 million, compared with $48.5 million in the same period last fiscal year.


Product Line Results

     Anacomp  operates as one business  segment but has several distinct service
offerings or product lines.  Because of this, we track revenues by product line.
This permits  management  and  investors to track the progress of revenues  from
Multi-Vendor Services, or MVS, and docHarbor(R) Web Presentment Services, two of
our principal growth product lines, compared with our traditional CD/Digital and
COM revenues.  In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2004,  revenues for MVS were
$9.7 million,  reflecting a 11% growth rate over the fourth quarter of the prior
fiscal year. This increase reflected new Original  Equipment  Manufacturer (OEM)
agreements  and continued  growth in the  Company's MVS offerings  (services and
hardware  sales for products  manufactured  by other  companies).  In the fourth
quarter of fiscal year 2004, MVS  represented 71% of total  maintenance  service
revenues, which encompass both MVS and COM Professional Services.

     docHarbor(R) Web Presentment service revenues increased 27% to $6.3 million
from the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003. This increase reflected growth from
new customers,  as well as additional revenue from established customers who had
increased  their use of the Company's  web based  docHarbor(R)  Web  Presentment
service.

     CD/Digital  revenues declined $1.5 million, or 22%, from the fourth quarter
of fiscal year 2003.  The decrease  reflected  the negative  impact of increased
availability  and  affordability of alternative web based solutions or in-house,
online viewing systems.

     COM revenues -- comprised of COM/Other  Output  Services,  COM/Professional
Services,  and Equipment and Supplies -- declined $6.4 million, or 23%, from the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2003.  COM-related product lines had been impacted
negatively  by the decrease in demand for COM as customers  continued to opt for
digital solutions such as Web and CD services or in-house solutions.

</TABLE>


(A)  Anacomp  reports  its  financial  results  in  accordance  with  GAAP,  and
additionally on a non-GAAP basis using EBITDA. EBITDA is not a financial measure
that is in accordance  with, nor a substitute  for, GAAP measures and may not be
consistent with EBITDA (or similarly  titled  measures) used by other companies.
Anacomp  defines EBITDA as operating  income (loss) from  continuing  operations
excluding restructuring charges, depreciation and amortization expense, non-cash
compensation,  other income  (expense),  net,  pension costs from  non-operating
actuarial long-term  measurements  including primarily interest,  gain (loss) on
sale of discontinued  operations,  net of taxes, and income taxes.  Anacomp uses
EBITDA  to  evaluate  and  manage  its   operations  and  believes  that  EBITDA
information is useful to investors to allow them to perform additional financial
analyses,   including  Anacomp's  ability  to  service  its  debt.  Due  to  the
significance of the GAAP components excluded, EBITDA should not be considered in
isolation  of, or as an  alternative  to,  net  income  (loss),  cash flows from
operations or any other operating or liquidity performance measure prescribed by
GAAP. A  reconciliation  of EBITDA to net income (loss) is provided in the table
above.

(B)  International   pension  costs  from  non-operating   actuarial   long-term
measurements  including  primarily  interest,  reported as selling,  general and
administrative expense.

Note:The  reported  EBITDA in  fiscal  2004  includes  $161 in Q1 and $230 in Q2
     expenses related to a proxy contest involving the election of directors.
