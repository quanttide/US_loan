FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS

     This Form 8-K and other reports filed by Registrant from time to time with
the Securities and Exchange Commission (collectively the "Filings") contain or
may contain forward looking statements and information that are based upon
beliefs of, and information currently available to, Registrant's management as
well as estimates and assumptions made by Registrant's management. When used in
the filings the words "anticipate", "believe", "estimate", "expect", "future",
"intend", "plan" or the negative of these terms and similar expressions as they
relate to Registrant or Registrant's management identify forward looking
statements. Such statements reflect the current view of Registrant with respect
to future events and are subject to risks, uncertainties, assumptions and other
factors relating to Registrant's industry, Registrant's operations and results
of operations and any businesses that may be acquired by Registrant. Should one
or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should the underlying
assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may differ significantly from those
anticipated, believed, estimated, expected, intended or planned.

     Although Registrant believes that the expectations reflected in the forward
looking statements are reasonable, Registrant cannot guarantee future results,
levels of activity, performance or achievements. Except as required by
applicable law, including the securities laws of the United States, Registrant
does not intend to update any of the forward-looking statements to conform these
statements to actual results.

INFORMATION TO BE INCLUDED IN THE REPORT


ITEM 1.01  ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

On December 20, 2004, (the "Effective Date") pursuant to a Stock Purchase
Agreement and Share Exchange (the "Agreement") between us and Speedhaul
Incorporated we acquired all of the shares of Speedhaul Incorporated
("Speedhaul") from Andrew Norins, the sole shareholder of Speedhaul in
consideration for the issuance of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock to Mr.
Norins. Pursuant to the Agreement, Speedhaul became our wholly owned subsidiary
and we will file an amendment to change our name to Speedhaul Holdings, Inc. The
purpose for this merger with Speedhaul was to acquire an operating company which
we believed has a successful business plan. In addition, pursuant to the
Agreement, Richard I. Anslow cancelled 3,000,000 shares of our common stock. The
Agreement was executed by the parties on October 15, 2004 and was subject to the
delivery of audited financial statements by Speedhaul. The closing of the
transaction occurred on December 20, 2004 upon receipt of the Speedhaul audited
financial statements by Segway.

ITEM 2.01  COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement, between us and Speedhaul we acquired
one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
of Speedhaul for a total of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which are
restricted in accordance with Rule 144 of the 1933 Securities Act.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Speedhaul became our wholly owned subsidiary.

Based on the acquisition of Speedhaul, our business plan is that of an Internet
subscription based load and equipment posting and searching service for the
freight trucking business. We will commenced offering our services in January
2005. Our strategy is directed toward the satisfaction of our customer's needs
through integrated internet technology for the trucking industry that quickly
and easily allows shippers, carriers, and brokers to post and search load and
equipment listings throughout the United States and Canada, 24 hours a day, 7
days a week. We currently have one employee.

We gather load and equipment information from subscribers who participate in all
segments of the trucking industry: trucking companies, brokers, shippers,
freight forwarders, logistical companies, and others, and make that information
instantly available through a simple and easy to use Internet based software
program.

Databases of trucks and loads are maintained electronically and continuously
updated and the information is available to shippers and haulers in real time.
Our customer base is composed of shippers who desire to minimize their freight
cost and expedite their shipments by choosing their specific freight carriers,
and small to medium-size truck companies that want to maximize profits by
dealing directly with shippers, thus reducing freight brokerage fees.

Our business plan is focused on addressing the market opportunities created by
changes in the trucking industry. We believe that we can accomplish this by
developing innovative ways to satisfy customers' needs for a simple, yet
comprehensive way to search for postings in an easy-to-use online system. We
believe that the effective implementation of our business plan will result in
our gaining market share as one of the industry's best Internet sites for the
trucking industry both in the United States and Canada.

ITEM 3.02  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

Pursuant to the Stock Purchase Agreement between Speedhaul and us, we acquired
one hundred percent (100%) of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock
of Speedhaul for a total of 20,000,000 shares of our common stock which are
restricted in accordance with Rule 144 of the 1933 Securities Act.
Pursuant to the Agreement, Speedhaul became our wholly owned subsidiary. These
shares were issued in reliance on an exemption from registration under Section
4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933.

These shares of our common stock qualified for exemption under Section 4(2) of
the Securities Act of 1933 since the issuance of shares by us did not involve a
public offering. The offering was not a "public offering" as defined in Section
4(2) due to the insubstantial number of persons involved in the deal, the size
of the offering, and the manner of the offering. We did not undertake an
offering in which we sold a high number of shares to a high number of investors.
In addition, Andrew Norins had the necessary investment intent as required by
Section 4(2) since he agreed to and received share certificates bearing a legend
stating that such shares are restricted pursuant to Rule 144 of the 1933
Securities Act. This restriction ensures that these shares would not be
immediately redistributed into the market and therefore not be part of a "public
offering." Based on an analysis of the above factors, we have met the
requirements to qualify for exemption under Section 4(2) of the Securities Act
of 1933 for this transaction.

ITEM 5.01 CHANGES IN CONTROL OF REGISTRANT

Pursuant to the Agreement, Andrew Norins received 20,000,000 shares of our
common stock and became our principal shareholder owning approximately 89% of
our outstanding common shares.

ITEM 5.02 DEPARTURE OF DIRECTORS OR PRINCIPAL OFFICERS; ELECTION OF DIRECTORS;
APPOINTMENT OF PRINCIPAL OFFICERS.

On December 20, 2004, Richard I. Anslow resigned as President, Chief Executive
Officer, Chief Financial Officer and as our Chairman of the Board of Directors
and Andrew Norins was appointed President, CEO, CFO and Chairman of the Board of
Directors. Mr. Norins has been the operations Manager for Chopper Logistics in
Montville, New Jersey since November 2001. In such capacity, he has supervised
dispatching and deliveries and has been the payroll controller. He also assisted
the company in customer relations and scheduling. From January 2000 to November
2001, Mr. Norins owned and managed Westridge Enterpises in Greensboro, North
Carolina. As the manager of this bar/lounge, Mr. Norins supervised all of the
day to day operations of this company and handled the payroll and bookkeeping.
Prior to such time, he was employed as Logistics Center Supervisor at Penske
Logistics in Garfield, New Jersey from June 1994 until the end of 1999. His
responsibilities in such position included the handling of customer relations,
payroll manager and supervising dispatchers, clerks and drivers. Mr. Norins
received a Bachelor of Science from the University of Delaware in 1992 with a
Minor in Business Administration.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

To The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Speedhaul Incoporated



        We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Speedhaul Incorporated
(a development stage company) as of September 30, 2004 and the related
statements of operations, stockholder's equity and cash flows from inception
(June 30, 2004) through September 30, 2004. These financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these financial statements based on the audit.

        We conducted the audit in accordance with standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that the
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Speedhaul
Incorporated (a development stage company) as of September 30, 2004, and the
statement of operations and cash flows from inception (June 30, 2004) through
September 30, 2004 in conformity with U.S. generally accepted accounting
principles.

        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 2 to the
financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations
and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management's plan in regard to these matters are
also described in Note 8. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                      FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies:
     ------------------------------------------

Industry - Speedhaul Incorporated (The Company), a Company incorporated in the
- --------
state of New Jersey as of June 30, 2004, plans to operate an internet web site
which offers Internet subscription based load and equipment posting and
searching service for the freight trucking business. The Company will gather
load and equipment information from subscribers who participate in all segments
of the trucking industry: trucking companies, brokers, shippers, freight
forwarders, logistical companies, and others, and make that information
instantly available through a simple and easy to use Internet based software
program.

Results of Operations and Ongoing Entity - The Company is considered to be an
- ----------------------------------------
ongoing entity. The Company's shareholders fund any shortfalls in The Company's
cash flow on a day to day basis during the time period that The Company is in
the development stage.

Liquidity and Capital Resources - In addition to the stockholder funding capital
- -------------------------------
shortfalls; The Company anticipates interested investors that intend to fund the
Company's growth once a business is located.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers cash on hand and amounts on
- -------------------------
deposit with financial institutions which have original maturities of three
months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.

Basis of Accounting - The Company's financial statements are prepared in
- -------------------
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Income Taxes - The Company utilizes the asset and liability method to measure
- ------------
and record deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax
rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. At this time, The Company has set up an allowance for deferred taxes
as there is no company history to indicate the usage of deferred tax assets and
liabilities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company's financial instruments may
- -----------------------------------
include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and liabilities to banks and shareholders. The carrying amount
of long-term debt to banks approximates fair value based on interest rates that
are currently available to The Company for issuance of debt with similar terms
and remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of other financial instruments
approximate their fair value because of short-term maturities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments which potentially expose
- -----------------------------
the Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating
demand deposit accounts. The Company's policy is to place its operating demand
deposit accounts with high credit quality financial institutions. At this time
the Company has no deposits that are at risk.

2.   Related Party Transactions and Going Concern:
     --------------------------------------------

The Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a
going concern in the development stage, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. No
assurances can be given on the Company's success in its operations. The Company
has a deficit of $5,930 at September 30, 2004.

The Company's shareholder funds the Company's activities while the Company takes
steps to develop in its business plan. The Company has received $9,500 cash in
the form of a demand note from an unrelated third party. The demand note does
not carry an interest rate.

3.   Accounts Receivable and Customer Deposits:
     -----------------------------------------

Accounts receivable and Customer deposits do not exist at this time and
therefore have no allowances accounted for or disclosures made.

4.   Long-lived Assets - Including Property, Equipment and Intangible assets:
     -----------------------------------------------------------------------

Equipment and certain intangible assets to be held and used by the Company are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable. Impairment losses
are recognized if expected future cash flows of the related assets are less than
their carrying values. Measurement of an impairment loss is based on the fair
value of the asset. Long-lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles to be
disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less
costs to sell.

The Company holds intangible assets which are amortized over a 5 year period.

5.   Use of Estimates:
     ----------------

Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenue
and expenses. Management has no reason to make estimates at this time.

6.   Revenue and Cost Recognition:
     ----------------------------

The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles for financial statement reporting.

7.   Accrued Expenses:
     ----------------

Accrued expenses consist of accrued accounting costs during this stage of the
business.

8.   Operating Lease Agreements:
     --------------------------

The Company has no agreements at this time.

9.   Stockholder's Equity:
     --------------------

Common Stock includes 2,500 shares authorized at no par value, of which 2,500
have been issued for the amount of $300. The following describes the shares
issued.

On June 30, 2004, the Company issued 2,500 common shares to the sole shareholder
for total of $300, or $0.12 per share, in an issuance that the Company believes
is exempt from registration with the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission.

10.  Required Cash Flow Disclosure for Interest and Taxes Paid:
     ---------------------------------------------------------

The company has paid no amounts for federal income taxes and interest.


11.  Earnings Per Share:
     ------------------

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing earnings available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
for the period as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per
Shares". Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could
share in the earnings.

12.  Subsequent Event:
     ----------------

Subsequent from the September 30, 2004 financial statements, on October 15,
2004, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase and Share Exchange with Segway
III Corp., a New Jersey corporation. This Agreement provides for the acquisition
by Segway III Corp. whereby the Company shall become a wholly owned subsidiary
of the Segway III Corp. and in connection therewith, the issuance of a total of
20,000,000 shares of Segway III Corp. to the shareholder and cancellation of
3,000,000 shares held by Richard Anslow, the President and principal stockholder
Segway III Corp. Such Agreement is conditioned upon the issuance of these
audited financial statements for Speedhaul and the transaction shall close upon
receipt of such audited financial statements.

             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM



To The Board of Directors and Shareholders
Segway III Corp.
(consolidated)
(a development stage company)

        We have audited the accompanying balance sheet of Segway III Corp. (a
development stage company) as of December 20, 2004 and the related statements of
operations, stockholder's equity and cash flows from inception (May 25, 2004)
through December 20, 2004 and for the 11 months and 20 days ending December 20,
2004. These financial statements are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements based on the audit.

        We conducted the audit in accordance with standards of the Public
Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that
we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
financial statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. We believe that the
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.

        In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Segway III Corp. (a
development stage company) as of Decembetr 20, 2004, and the statement of
operations and cash flows from inception (May 25, 2004) through December 20,
2004 and the 11 months and 20 days ending December 20, 2004 in conformity with
U.S. generally accepted accounting principles.

        The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that
the Company will continue as a going concern. As discussed in Note 8 to the
financial statements, the Company has suffered recurring losses from operations
and has a net capital deficiency that raise substantial doubt about its ability
to continue as a going concern. Management's plan in regard to these matters are
also described in Note 8. The financial statements do not include any
adjustments that might result from the outcome of this uncertainty.

                                SEGWAY III CORP.
                                 (Consolidated)
                          (a development stage company)
                      FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

1.   Summary of significant accounting policies:
     ------------------------------------------

Industry - Segway III Corp. (The Company), a Company incorporated in the state
- --------
of New Jersey as of March 31, 2000, plans to operate it's subsidiary company,
Speedhaul Incorporated. The subsidiary's industry is described below.

Subsidiary Industry - Speedhaul Incorporated (The Company), a Company
- -------------------
incorporated in the state of New Jersey as of June 30, 2004, plans to operate an
internet web site which offersInternet subscription based load and equipment
posting and searching service for the freight trucking business. The Company
will gather load and equipment information from subscribers who participate in
all segments of the trucking industry: trucking companies, brokers, shippers,
freight forwarders, logistical companies, and others, and make that information
instantly available through a simple and easy to use Internet based software
program.

On October 15, 2004, the Company entered into a Stock Purchase and Share
Exchange with Speedhaul Incorporated (Speehaul), a New Jersey corporation. This
agreement provides for the acquisition of Speedhaul whereby Speedhaul became a
wholly owned subsidiary of the Company and in connection therewith, the issuance
of a total of 20,000,000 shares of the Company to the shareholder and
cancellation of 3,000,000 shares held by Richard Anslow, the President and
principal stockholder of the Company.

Results of Operations and Ongoing Entity - The Company is considered to be an
- ----------------------------------------
ongoing entity. The Company's shareholders fund any shortfalls in The Company's
cash flow on a day to day basis during the time period that The Company is in
the development stage.

Liquidity and Capital Resources - In addition to the stockholder funding capital
- -------------------------------
shortfalls; The Company anticipates interested investors that intend to fund the
Company's growth once a business is located.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - The Company considers cash on hand and amounts on
- -------------------------
deposit with financial institutions which have original maturities of three
months or less to be cash and cash equivalents.

Basis of Accounting - The Company's financial statements are prepared in
- -------------------
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles.

Income Taxes - The Company utilizes the asset and liability method to measure
- ------------
and record deferred income tax assets and liabilities. Deferred tax assets and
liabilities reflect the future income tax effects of temporary differences
between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and
liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax
rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary
differences are expected to be recovered or settled. Deferred tax assets are
reduced by a valuation allowance when in the opinion of management, it is more
likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be
realized. At this time, The Company has set up an allowance for deferred taxes
as there is no company history to indicate the usage of deferred tax assets and
liabilities.

Fair Value of Financial Instruments - The Company's financial instruments may
- -----------------------------------
include cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts receivable,
accounts payable and liabilities to banks and shareholders. The carrying amount
of long-term debt to banks approximates fair value based on interest rates that
are currently available to The Company for issuance of debt with similar terms
and remaining maturities. The carrying amounts of other financial instruments
approximate their fair value because of short-term maturities.

Concentrations of Credit Risk - Financial instruments which potentially expose
- -----------------------------
The Company to concentrations of credit risk consist principally of operating
demand deposit accounts. The Company's policy is to place its operating demand
deposit accounts with high credit quality financial institutions. At this time
The Company has no deposits that are at risk.

2.   Related Party Transactions and Going Concern:
     --------------------------------------------
The Company's financial statements have been presented on the basis that it is a
going concern in the development stage, which contemplates the realization of
assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business. At
this time The Company has not identified the business that it wishes to engage
in.

The Company's shareholders fund The Company's activities while The Company takes
steps to locate and negotiate with a business entity for combination; however,
there can be no assurance these activities will be successful.

3.   Accounts Receivable and Customer Deposits:
     -----------------------------------------
Accounts receivable and Customer deposits do not exist at this time and
therefore have no allowances accounted for or disclosures made.

4.   Use of Estimates:
     ----------------

Management uses estimates and assumptions in preparing these financial
statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. Those
estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities,
the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities, and the reported revenue
and expenses. Management has no reason to make estimates at this time.

5.   Revenue and Cost Recognition:
     ----------------------------

The Company uses the accrual basis of accounting in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles for financial statement reporting.

6.   Accrued Expenses:
     ----------------

Accrued expenses consist of accrued legal, accounting and office costs during
this stage of the business.

7.   Operating Lease Agreements:
     --------------------------

The Company has no agreements at this time.

     ---------------------------------------------------------

The company has paid no amounts for federal income taxes and interest.

10.  Earnings Per Share:
     ------------------

Basic earnings per share ("EPS") is computed by dividing earnings available to
common shareholders by the weighted-average number of common shares outstanding
for the period as required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB)
under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards (SFAS) No. 128, "Earnings per
Shares". Diluted EPS reflects the potential dilution of securities that could
share in the earnings.
