The Pepsi Bottling Group Announces Financial Guidance for 2005;
Company Confirms 2004 Earnings Forecast

    Business Editors/Beverage Writers

    SOMERS, N.Y.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2004--The Pepsi Bottling
Group, Inc. (NYSE: PBG) today announced the Company's operating and
financial guidance for 2005. PBG Chairman and CEO John T. Cahill will
host a conference call with financial analysts and investors at 10
a.m. (EST) today to discuss the plans in detail. The call will be
webcast live and can be accessed along with presentation materials at
http://www.pbg.com.
    The Company also confirmed its 2004 full-year earnings forecast.
Worldwide volume is expected to grow two percent on a constant
territory basis, with volume in the U.S. improving one to two percent
for the year. Worldwide and U.S. net revenue per case both are
on-track to increase three percent. PBG expects diluted earnings per
share for the year to be in the range of $1.71 to $1.74, excluding the
$0.02 favorable impact from certain international tax matters.
Operating income is projected to improve three percent, reflecting the
downward pressure from the significant cost increases of raw
materials. The Company's cash flow forecast continues to be strong,
with net cash from operations less capital expenditures expected to be
about $530 million, an approximately 20-percent increase over 2003
results. Capital expenditures are expected to be about $700 million.
    Commenting on PBG's performance in 2004, Mr. Cahill said, "We will
deliver solid results for our shareholders in 2004. In the U.S.,
successful innovation and outstanding execution in the marketplace has
led to balanced topline growth. The introduction of Tropicana juice
drinks and the strategic use of limited-time offers, such as Mountain
Dew Pitch Black and Pepsi Holiday Spice, have fueled our volume
improvement.
    "Our international markets have contributed to our overall
performance. Europe will deliver strong growth in volume and profits
despite a difficult environment. In Mexico, we have seen consistent
improvement in our volume and share trends as the year progressed. Our
chief challenges there came from packaging and sweetener cost
increases and a difficult pricing environment, which has led to
disappointing operating profit. Our management team in Mexico has made
substantial progress this year in the areas of marketplace execution
and capability, and we believe that improvement will continue in
2005."
    Mr. Cahill continued, "As we look to 2005, we have a strong slate
of innovation planned in nearly all of our territories and will
continue to raise the bar on executional excellence with new programs
and initiatives. We are committed to driving balanced topline growth
and believe we have the right plans to achieve that objective. The
challenge of rising raw materials costs will continue into 2005. We
expect to incur a more than $100 million increase in our packaging and
sweetener costs versus 2004, which will have an impact on our
profitability next year. Our plans, however, reflect the realities of
the environments in which we operate and I have tremendous confidence
in the capability of our people to win in the marketplace."
    In 2005, PBG expects to deliver solid operating and financial
results. Diluted earnings per share are forecast to be $1.76 to $1.84,
excluding the impact of the 53rd week in the Company's fiscal 2005.
(See Editor's Note) The Company is considering reinvestment of the
additional profit from the 53rd week in long-term strategic
initiatives. The following table outlines PBG's operating and
financial guidance for 2005. The projections for volume, operating
profit, earnings per share, SD&A and interest expense exclude the
impact of the 53rd week.
