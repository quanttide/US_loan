    <TD>In regard to the Preble fire truck plant closure, as of a few weeks ago we began
production of stainless-steel bodies in our Ocala facility and production at Preble will
cease at the end of this month. As announced previously, we have restricted orders for
stainless-steel trucks during most of the past year to result in a backlog where we could
concentrate on a smaller number of pre-configured models as we climb up the learning curve
in Ocala. We have made only 40 production slots available during 2005 for stainless-steel
trucks, down from a normal 100. We will expand to include a full offering again down the
road, but will turn our backs on those ultra-complex vehicles, way-out at the end of the
