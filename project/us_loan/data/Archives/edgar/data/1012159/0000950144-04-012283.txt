<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>TIMCO AVIATION SERVICES, INC. ANNOUNCES INTENT TO OFFER<BR>
PREMIUM FOR EARLY CONVERSION OF ITS OUTSTANDING SENIOR AND<BR>
JUNIOR SUBORDINATED CONVERTIBLE PIK NOTES INTO COMMON STOCK</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Greensboro, North Carolina, December&nbsp;21, 2004 &#151; TIMCO Aviation Services, Inc. (OTCBB:TMAS) </B>today
announced that it intends to offer to the holders of its 8% senior subordinated convertible PIK
notes due 2006 (&#147;Senior Notes&#148;) and to the holders of its 8% junior subordinated convertible PIK
notes due 2007 (&#147;Junior Notes&#148;, and collectively with the Senior Notes, the &#147;Notes&#148;) the right to
receive a 15% premium for agreeing to an early conversion of their Notes into shares of the
Company&#146;s authorized but unissued common stock (&#147;Common Stock&#148;). An offering circular and related
documents with respect to the tender offer are expected to be filed by the Company and distributed
to the holders of the Notes in the near future.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The indentures relating to the Senior Notes and the Junior Notes provide that unless the Senior
Notes and the Junior Notes are redeemed prior to their maturity, the Senior Notes (including all
previously issued PIK interest and all accrued but unpaid interest) will automatically convert at
their maturity into 270.3&nbsp;million shares of Common Stock and the Junior Notes (including all
previously issued PIK interest and all accrued but unpaid interest) will automatically convert at
their maturity into 9.3&nbsp;million shares of Common Stock. Based on available information, the Company
does not anticipate that the Notes will be redeemed prior to their maturity and, as a result, the
Company anticipates that the Notes will automatically convert into Common Stock at their maturity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">If the early conversion were to occur on December&nbsp;31, 2004, holders of $1,000 in principal amount
of Senior Notes, including PIK interest thereon and any accrued but unpaid interest, who elected to
convert their Notes in the offer would receive the approximately 2,164 shares of Common Stock that
they would otherwise have received upon conversion of their Senior Notes into Common Stock at their
maturity (December&nbsp;31, 2006), plus a conversion premium equal to approximately 324 shares of Common
Stock. If the early conversion were to occur on December&nbsp;31, 2004, holders of $1,000 in principal
amount of Junior Notes, including PIK interest thereon and any accrued but unpaid interest, who
elected to convert their Notes in the offer would receive the approximately 1,965 shares of Common
Stock that they would otherwise have received upon conversion of their Junior Notes into Common
Stock at their maturity (January&nbsp;2, 2007), plus a conversion premium equal to approximately 294
shares of Common Stock. It is not expected that the offer will require any minimum number of Notes
to be tendered, and holders of Notes who elect not to convert their Notes in the offer will
continue to hold their Notes, which will automatically convert by their terms into Common Stock at
their maturity without the payment of any premium.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Lacy Harber, the Company&#146;s majority shareholder and the holder of $20.3&nbsp;million of the outstanding
Senior Notes (approximately 17% of the outstanding Senior Notes), has advised the Company that he
intends to convert his Notes in the offer. Further, Mr.&nbsp;Harber, who holds a warrant to purchase,
for nominal consideration, that number of shares of the Common Stock which is equal to 30% of the
Company&#146;s outstanding common stock (on a fully diluted basis), has advised the Company that he will
agree that his warrant shall not be applied to the premium shares issued in the tender offer. In
that regard, Mr.&nbsp;Harber has advised the Company that he intends to exercise his warrant with
respect to the shares outstanding at the closing of the offer, excluding any premium shares. If
less than all of the Notes are tendered, Mr.&nbsp;Harber will at the closing of the offer receive a new
warrant to acquire additional shares equal to 30% (on a fully-diluted basis) of the shares issuable
on the automatic conversion of the untendered Notes at their maturity. As such, Mr.&nbsp;Harber will
only receive from the full exercise of his warrant the same number of shares that he would have
otherwise received had the Notes automatically converted into Common Stock at their maturity and
had he exercised his warrant immediately thereafter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Assuming all of the Notes are tendered in the offer, following the closing of the offer and the
exercise of the warrant, Mr.&nbsp;Harber, who currently beneficially owns approximately 72% of the
Company&#146;s outstanding common stock, will beneficially own approximately 44% of the Company&#146;s
outstanding common stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">If the holders of all of the outstanding Senior Notes and Junior Notes agree to an early conversion
of their Notes in accordance with the tender offer, the Company will have 486,562,978 shares of
Common Stock outstanding, including an aggregate of 41,939,332 premium shares.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">At September&nbsp;30, 2004, the Company had a negative net worth of $95.6&nbsp;million. Had the Notes been
converted into Common Stock at that date, and the warrant held by Mr.&nbsp;Harber exercised in full, on
a pro-forma basis the Company would have had a positive net worth of $23.7&nbsp;million. The Company,
based on currently available information, believes that the Notes will convert into Common Stock at
their maturity. The Company believes that cleaning up its capital structure at this time will also
allow the Company to better take advantage of opportunities that may be available in its
marketplace over the next few years and allow the Company to take steps to create a more efficient
market for its Common Stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">This press release is not an offer or solicitation for the early conversion of the Notes into
Common Stock, which can only be made on the terms and subject to the conditions described in the
Offering Circular and related documents. At the time the offer is commenced, the Company will file
a Tender Offer Statement (including an offering circular, a related letter of transmittal and other
offer documents) with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (&#147;SEC&#148;). The Tender Offer
Statement will be made available to all Noteholders at no expense to them. The Tender Offer
Statement will also be available at no charge at the SEC&#146;s website at <U>www.sec.gov</U>. The
Tender Offer Statement will contain important information that should be read carefully before any
decision is made with respect to the offer.
