FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

DECEMBER 16, 2004

  STRATEGY INTERNATIONAL INSURANCE GROUP, INC. AND RS GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC.
       ANNOUNCE PROPOSED ACQUISITION OF RS GROUP BY STRATEGY INTERNATIONAL

TORONTO, ON CANADA-RS GROUP OF COMPANIES, INC. (FORMERLY RENT SHIELD CORP.)
(RSGC.OB: OTC BB) and Strategy International Insurance Group, Inc. (SGYI.OB: OTC
BB) today announced that they intend to enter into an agreement that will result
in RS Group's becoming a wholly-owned subsidiary of Strategy International.

The management teams of both companies have determined that the long-term
objectives of Strategy International and RS Group are converging. Strategy
International and RS Group believe that combining the strengths of both
companies will allow them to pursue new revenue opportunities, while optimizing
administrative economies of scale and investment decisions across the companies.
The move supports Strategy's continuing plan to deliver value to its
risk-management customers across multiple distribution channels while
structuring the transaction to minimize the effect of channel conflict.

The integration of the marketing and investment strength of RS Group into the
underwriting position of Strategy International provides both companies with the
necessary flexibility to provide the best service to their customers and the
efficient marketing of services and enhancement of sustainable customer
relationships. Once the purchase is completed, RS Group will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Strategy International. Strategy does not plan to
change RS Group's executive team, strategic direction or branding.

Commenting on this announcement, John Hamilton, CEO of RS Group of Companies,
Inc. said "This integration represents a natural convergence of two operations,
which have complementary abilities and similar long-term objectives. The
combined strength of underwriting expertise and product knowledge will allow
management to fulfill its operational aspirations."

It is anticipated that Strategy International will offer cash and stock, which
would result in a value to RS Group common stock holders of $1.75 per common
share, to acquire RS Group's outstanding common stock (approximately 65 million
shares), representing a 237 percent premium over the closing price of $0.52 on
December 15, 2004. Strategy International, with input from RS Group, is in the
process of determining the most effective method of achieving this acquisition.
The transaction will not be conditioned upon Strategy International obtaining
any financing.

"This acquisition provides Strategy with marketing and management resources that
further enhance the Company's expansion. RS Group's proven product expertise and
administrative capabilities will be an exceptional addition to the Strategy
underwriting group," said Stephen Stonhill, President and CEO of Strategy
International Insurance Group, Inc.

Strategy International expects the transaction to close on or about March 1,
2005, subject to the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals. Strategy
International estimates that the proposed transaction will be neutral to its
2004 earnings.
