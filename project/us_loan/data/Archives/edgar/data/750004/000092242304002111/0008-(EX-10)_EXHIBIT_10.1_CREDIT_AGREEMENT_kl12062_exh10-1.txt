8.1, determined on a pro forma basis as if such Incremental Term Loans had been
outstanding on the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for testing
compliance therewith (and, as applicable, as if such Incremental Term Loans had
been outstanding during the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then
ended). Each tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall be in an aggregate
principal amount that is not less than $25,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining
unused amount of the total Incremental Term Loans permitted hereby). The
Incremental Term Loans (a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount not
exceeding $100,000,000, (b) shall rank pari passu in right of payment and of
security with the Revolving Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans, (c) shall not
mature earlier than the Term Loan Maturity Date (but may, subject to clause (d)
below, have amortization prior to such date), (d) shall not have a weighted
average life that is shorter than the remaining weighted average life of the
Tranche B Term Loans, and (e) except as set forth above, shall be treated
substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Tranche
B Term Loans (in each case, including with respect to mandatory and voluntary
prepayments); provided that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to
Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Term Loan Maturity Date may provide
for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment
requirements applicable only during periods after the Term Loan Maturity Date
and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Tranche B
Term Loans. Each notice shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms
of the relevant Incremental Term Loans. Each existing Lender shall be afforded
the opportunity, but shall not be required, to provide a ratable share
(including a share of any Incremental Term Loans not subscribed to by other
existing Lenders) of any Incremental Term Loans. In the event that existing
Lenders provide commitments in an aggregate amount less than the total amount of
the Incremental Term Loans requested by the Borrower, the Borrower may arrange
for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other
financial institution being called an "Additional Lender") to extend commitments
to provide Incremental Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the
unsubscribed amount. Commitments in respect of Incremental Term Loans shall
become Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an
"Incremental Term Loan Amendment") to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the
other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Lender agreeing to provide
such Commitment, if any, each Additional Lender, if any, and the Administrative
Agent. The Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other
Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable

                                       31
<PAGE>

opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section.
The effectiveness of any Incremental Term Loan Amendment shall be subject to the
satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section
6.2 (it being understood that all references to the date of "any extension of
credit" in such Section 6.2 shall be deemed to refer to the effective date of
such Incremental Term Loan Amendment) and such other conditions as the parties
thereto shall agree. No Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental
Term Loans, unless it so agrees.

            Section 3. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF REVOLVING COMMITMENTS

            3.1. Revolving Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Dollar Revolving Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit
loans denominated in Dollars ("Dollar Revolving Loans") to the Borrower from
time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding which, when added to such Lender's Dollar
Revolving Percentage of the sum of (i) the Dollar L/C Obligations then
outstanding and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans then
outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lender's Dollar Revolving
Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Multicurrency
Revolving Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit loans denominated in
Dollars or a Foreign Currency ("Multicurrency Revolving Loans") to the Borrower
from time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding which, when added to such Lender's
Multicurrency Revolving Percentage of the Multicurrency L/C Obligations then
outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lender's Multicurrency Revolving
Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event may Revolving Loans be borrowed under a Revolving
Facility if, after giving effect thereto (and to any concurrent repayment or
prepayment of Revolving Loans), the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit under
such Revolving Facility would exceed the Total Revolving Commitments at such
time under such Revolving Facility. During the Revolving Commitment Period, the
Borrower may use the Revolving Commitments by borrowing, prepaying and
reborrowing the Revolving Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility, in whole
or in part, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The
Revolving Loans may from time to time be Eurocurrency Loans or Base Rate Loans,
as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with Sections 3.2 and 4.3; provided that Multicurrency Revolving
Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency may only be Eurocurrency Loans.

            (b) The Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Loans on the
Revolving Termination Date.

            3.2. Procedure for Revolving Loan Borrowing.(a) The Borrower may
borrow under Section 3.1 during the Revolving Commitment Period on any Business
Day, provided that the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable
notice (a "Borrowing Request") by telephone (which notice must be received by
the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time (or, in the
case of a Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, 12:00
Noon, London time), (a) three Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing
Date, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, or (b) one Business Day prior to the
requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Base Rate Loans), specifying (i)
whether the requested

                                       32
<PAGE>

borrowing is a borrowing under the Dollar Revolving Facility or the
Multicurrency Revolving Facility, provided that Revolving Loans denominated in a
Foreign Currency may only be borrowed under the Multicurrency Revolving
Facility, (ii) the amount and Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, (iii) the
requested Borrowing Date, (iv) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, the respective
amounts of each such Type of Revolving Loan, the respective currency therefor
and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor, and (v) the
location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds are to be
distributed. Such telephonic request shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

            (b) Each borrowing under a Revolving Facility shall be in an amount
equal to (x) in the case of Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Revolving
Commitments under the relevant Revolving Facility are less than $100,000, such
lesser amount), (y) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars,
$3,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof or (z) in the case
of Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Foreign
Currency Equivalent of $3,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof; provided that the Swingline Lender may request, on behalf of the
Borrower, borrowings under the Dollar Revolving Commitments that are Base Rate
Loans in other amounts pursuant to Section 3.4.

            (c) Upon receipt of any such Borrowing Request from the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Revolving Lender
of the requested currency and aggregate amount (in both the requested currency
and Dollars) of such borrowing. Each Revolving Lender will make the amount of
its pro rata share of each such borrowing, which shall be based on its Revolving
Percentage under the relevant Revolving Facility, as applicable, available to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower (i) in the case of
Dollars, at the Funding Office prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the
Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to the
Administrative Agent or (ii) in the case of a Foreign Currency, by wire transfer
prior to 11:00 A.M., London time, on the Borrowing Date requested by the
Borrower to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by
it for such purposes by notice to the Multicurrency Revolving Lenders in
immediately available funds. Such borrowing will then be made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Borrower, (i)
in the case of Dollars, on the books of such Funding Office, or (ii) in the case
of a Foreign Currency, in accordance with instructions provided by the Borrower,
in each case with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
Administrative Agent by the Revolving Lenders and in like funds as received by
the Administrative Agent.

            3.3. Swingline Commitment.(a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swingline Lender agrees to make a portion of the credit otherwise
available to the Borrower under the Dollar Revolving Commitments from time to
time during the Revolving Commitment Period by making swing line loans
denominated in Dollars ("Swingline Loans") to the Borrower; provided that (i)
the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans

                                       33
<PAGE>

outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Swingline Commitment then in effect
(notwithstanding that the Swingline Loans outstanding at any time, when
aggregated with the Swingline Lender's other outstanding Dollar Revolving
Extensions of Credit hereunder, may exceed the Swingline Commitment then in
effect), (ii) the Borrower shall not request, and the Swingline Lender shall not
make, any Swingline Loan if, after giving effect to the making of such Swingline
Loan, the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments under the
Dollar Revolving Facility would be less than zero and (iii) the Swingline Lender
shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an existing
Swingline Loan. During the Revolving Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the
Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof. Swingline Loans shall be Base Rate Loans
only.

            (b) The Borrower shall repay to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Revolving
Termination Date and the 30th day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided
that, during each calendar month, there shall be at least two consecutive
Business Days during which the outstanding balance of the Swingline Loans shall
be zero.

            3.4. Procedure for Swingline Borrowing; Refunding of Swingline
Loans. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swingline Lender make
Swingline Loans it shall give the Swingline Lender irrevocable telephonic notice
confirmed promptly in writing (which telephonic notice must be received by the
Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the proposed
Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed and (ii) the requested
Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day during the Revolving Commitment
Period). Each borrowing under the Swingline Commitment shall be in an amount
equal to $250,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Not later
than 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in a notice
in respect of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the
Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available
funds equal to the amount of the Swingline Loan to be made by the Swingline
Lender. The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan
available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date by depositing such proceeds in
the account of the Borrower with the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date
in immediately available funds.

            (b) The Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its
sole and absolute discretion may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), on one Business
Day's notice given by the Swingline Lender no later than 12:00 Noon, New York
City time, request each Dollar Revolving Lender to make, and each Dollar
Revolving Lender hereby agrees to make, a Dollar Revolving Loan, in an amount
equal to such Lender's Dollar Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount of
the Swingline Loans (the "Refunded Swingline Loans") outstanding on the date of
such notice, to repay the Swingline Lender. Each Dollar Revolving Lender shall
make the amount of such Dollar Revolving Loan available to the Administrative
Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds, not later than 10:00
A.M., New York City time, one Business Day after the date of such notice. The
proceeds of such Dollar Revolving Loans shall be immediately made available by
the Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender for application by the
Swingline Lender to the repayment of the Refunded Swingline Loans. The Borrower
irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to charge the Borrower's accounts
with the Administrative

                                       34
<PAGE>

Agent (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately
pay the amount of such Refunded Swingline Loans to the extent amounts received
from the Dollar Revolving Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full such
Refunded Swingline Loans.

            (c) If prior to the time a Dollar Revolving Loan would have
otherwise been made pursuant to Section 3.4(b), one of the events described in
Section 9(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower
or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swingline Lender in its sole
discretion, Dollar Revolving Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section
3.4(b), each Dollar Revolving Lender shall, on the date such Dollar Revolving
Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 3.4(b)
(the "Refunding Date"), purchase for cash an undivided participating interest in
the then outstanding Swingline Loans by paying to the Swingline Lender an amount
(the "Swingline Participation Amount") equal to (i) such Lender's Dollar
Revolving Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of
Swingline Loans then outstanding that were to have been repaid with such Dollar
Revolving Loans.

            (d) Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received
from any Dollar Revolving Lender such Lender's Swingline Participation Amount,
the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, the
Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its Swingline Participation
Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding
and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such
Lender's pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to
pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided,
however, that in the event that such payment received by the Swingline Lender is
required to be returned, such Dollar Revolving Lender will return to the
Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the
Swingline Lender.

            (e) Each Dollar Revolving Lender's obligation to make the Loans
referred to in Section 3.4(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant
to Section 3.4(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense
or other right that such Dollar Revolving Lender or the Borrower may have
against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of
Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in
Section 6; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by
the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Revolving Lender; or (v) any
other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing.

            3.5. Commitment Fees, etc. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee
for the period from and including the Effective Date to the last day of the
Revolving Commitment Period, computed at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average
daily amount of the Available Revolving Commitment of such Lender under each
Revolving Facility during the period for which payment

                                       35
<PAGE>

is made, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date, commencing on
the first of such dates to occur after the date hereof.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees
in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent.

            3.6. Termination or Reduction of Revolving Commitments.The Borrower
shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, to terminate the Revolving Commitments under either
Revolving Facility or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Revolving
Commitments under either Revolving Facility; provided that no such termination
or reduction of Revolving Commitments under either Revolving Facility shall be
permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the
Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans made on the effective date thereof, the Total
Revolving Extensions of Credit under such Revolving Facility would exceed the
Total Revolving Commitments under such Revolving Facility. Any such reduction
shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole multiple thereof, and
shall reduce permanently the Revolving Commitments under the relevant Revolving
Facility then in effect.

            3.7. L/C Commitment. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each Issuing Lender (in reliance on the agreements set forth in Section 3.10(a)
of the Revolving Lenders under the relevant Revolving Facility), agrees to issue
letters of credit under the Dollar Revolving Facility ("Dollar Letters of
Credit") and letters of credit under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility
("Multicurrency Letters of Credit"), in each case for the account of the
Borrower on any Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form
as may be approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender; provided that no
Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit under a
Revolving Facility if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the total L/C
Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Available Revolving Commitments under such Revolving Facility would be less than
zero. Each Dollar Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars and each
Multicurrency Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars or a Foreign
Currency. Each Letter of Credit shall expire no later than the earlier of (x)
the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five
Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date (the "Required Expiry
Date"); provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for
the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event
extend beyond the Required Expiry Date). An Issuing Lender may, in its sole
discretion, extend a Letter of Credit beyond the Required Expiry Date, provided
that (i) each L/C Participant's interest in the Issuing Lender's obligations and
rights under and in respect of such Letter of Credit shall terminate at the
close of business on the Required Expiry Date (except with respect to demands
for drawings thereunder submitted prior to that time) and (ii) such Issuing
Lender may, as condition to extending such Letter of Credit, require additional
fees or collateral.

            (b) No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any
Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such
Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any
applicable Requirement of Law.


                                       36
<PAGE>

            (c) The Existing Letters of Credit outstanding on the Effective Date
shall constitute Letters of Credit hereunder.

            3.8. Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit.The Borrower may
from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Dollar Letter of Credit
or a Multicurrency Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its
address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the
satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and
other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of
any Application, an Issuing Lender will notify the Administrative Agent of (i)
whether the Application is with respect to a Dollar Letter of Credit or
Multicurrency Letter of Credit and (ii) the amount, currency, requested
expiration and beneficiary of the requested Letter of Credit. Upon receipt of
confirmation from the Administrative Agent that after giving effect to the
requested issuance, the Available Revolving Commitments under the relevant
Revolving Facility would not be less than zero, such Issuing Lender will process
such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and
information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its
customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested
thereby (but in no event shall such Issuing Lender be required to issue any
Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the
Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers
and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of
Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such
Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Each Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of
such Letter of Credit to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
promptly following the issuance thereof. Each Issuing Lender shall promptly
furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the
Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender (including the amount and currency thereof).

            3.9. Fees and Other Charges. The Borrower will pay a fee on all
outstanding Letters of Credit under each Revolving Facility (determined based
upon Dollar Equivalents in the case of Multicurrency Letters of Credit issued in
Foreign Currencies) at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in
effect with respect to Eurocurrency Loans under such Revolving Facility, shared
ratably among the Revolving Lenders under such Revolving Facility. Such fees
shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the
issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant Issuing
Lender for its own account a fronting fee on the undrawn and unexpired amount of
each Letter of Credit as agreed by the Borrower and the Issuing Lender, payable
quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.

            (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or
reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses
as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating,
effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of
Credit to the extent that the fees and expenses associated with the issuance of
such Letter of Credit exceed the fronting fee therefor as specified in Section
3.9(a).

            3.10. L/C Participations.(a) Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees
to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce such Issuing
Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably
agrees to accept and purchase and hereby

                                       37
<PAGE>

accepts and purchases from such Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set
forth below, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk an undivided
interest equal to (i) such L/C Participant's Dollar Revolving Percentage in each
Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under and in respect of each Dollar
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender hereunder and the amount of each
draft paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder and (ii) such L/C Participant's
Multicurrency Revolving Percentage in each Issuing Lender's obligations and
rights under and in respect of each Multicurrency Letter of Credit issued by
such Issuing Lender hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by such Issuing
Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant in respect of a Letter of Credit
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender in respect of
such Letter of Credit that, if a draft is paid under such Letter of Credit for
which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to
the Administrative Agent upon demand of such Issuing Lender an amount equal to
such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage under the relevant Revolving
Facility of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so
reimbursed; provided that the related Reimbursement Obligation with respect to a
Multicurrency Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency may be
converted to Dollars pursuant to Section 3.11. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly forward such amounts to the relevant Issuing Lender.

            (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the
Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Lender pursuant to Section
3.10(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such
Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date
such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product
of (i) such amount times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate
during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the
date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender times
(iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during
such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to
be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.10(a) is not made available
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender by
such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is
due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant,
on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at
the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving
Facility. A certificate of such Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant
with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

            (c) Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment
under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro
rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.10(a), the
Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such
Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including
proceeds of Collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment
of interest on account thereof, the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender,
as the case may be, will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share
thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by
Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall be
required to be returned by the Administrative Agent or such Issuing

                                       38
<PAGE>

Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the
Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to it.

            (d) Each L/C Participant's obligation to purchase participating
interests pursuant to Section 3.10(b) shall be absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant or
the Borrower may have against any Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other
Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a
Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other
conditions specified in Section 6; (iii) any adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C
Participant; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

            3.11. Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower.The Borrower agrees
to reimburse each Issuing Lender on the Business Day next succeeding the
Business Day on which such Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of the date and
amount of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit and paid by such Issuing
Lender for the amount of such draft so paid and any taxes, fees, charges or
other reasonable costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection
with such payment. Each such payment shall be made to the relevant Issuing
Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds, provided that (a) the
Borrower may, at its option, elect by notice to such Issuing Lender immediately
following receipt of notice of such draft, to reimburse a draft paid in a
Foreign Currency in the same Foreign Currency and (b) if the Borrower does not
make such election, or if (notwithstanding such election) the Borrower does not
in fact reimburse any such draft made in a Foreign Currency on or prior to the
date required pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3.11, then such
Issuing Lender shall convert such Reimbursement Obligation into Dollars at the
rate of exchange then available to such Issuing Lender in the interbank market
where its foreign currency exchange operations in respect of such Foreign
Currency are then being conducted and the Borrower shall thereafter be required
to reimburse such Issuing Lender in Dollars for such Reimbursement Obligation
(in the amount so converted). Interest shall be payable on any such amounts
denominated in Dollars from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until
the relevant Issuing Lender receives payment in full at the rate set forth in
(i) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice,
Section 4.5(b) with respect to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving
Facility and (ii) thereafter, Section 4.5(c). Interest shall be payable on any
such amounts denominated in a Foreign Currency from the date on which the
relevant draft is paid until the relevant Issuing Lender receives payment in
full or conversion to Dollars as provided herein (i) until the Business Day next
succeeding the date of the relevant notice, at the rate determined by the
relevant Issuing Lender as its cost of funding such payment plus the Applicable
Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility
and (ii) thereafter, the rate set forth in Section 4.5(c). Each drawing under
any Dollar Letter of Credit shall (unless an event of the type described in
clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with
respect to the Borrower, in which case the procedures specified in Section 3.10
for funding by L/C Participants shall apply) constitute a request by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a borrowing pursuant to Section 3.2 of
Base Rate Loans under the Dollar Revolving Facility (or, at

                                       39
<PAGE>

the option of the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender in their sole
discretion, a borrowing pursuant to Section 3.4 of Swingline Loans) in the
amount of such drawing except that, in such event, Borrower is not deemed to
have given any representations and warranties pursuant to Section 6.2. Except in
the case of a drawing denominated in a Foreign Currency that the Borrower elects
to reimburse, and in fact reimburses, in such Foreign Currency as provided
above, each drawing under any Multicurrency Letter of Credit shall (unless an
event of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9(f) shall have
occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower, in which case the
procedures specified in Section 3.10 for funding by L/C Participants shall
apply), constitute a request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a
borrowing pursuant to Section 3.2 of Base Rate Loans under the Multicurrency
Revolving Facility denominated in Dollars in the amount of such drawing (or, in
the case of a drawing denominated in a Foreign Currency, the amount in Dollars
into which the Reimbursement Obligation was converted) except that, in either
such event, the Borrower is not deemed to have given any representations and
warranties pursuant to Section 6.2. The Borrowing Date with respect to such
borrowing shall be the first date on which a borrowing of Revolving Loans (or,
if applicable, Swingline Loans) could be made pursuant to Section 3.2 (or, if
applicable, Section 3.4), if the Administrative Agent had received a notice of
such borrowing at the time the Administrative Agent receives notice from such
Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit.

            3.12. Obligations Absolute.The Borrower's obligations under Section
3.11 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and
irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower
may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of
Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender
that such Issuing Lender not shall be responsible for, and the Borrower's
Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.11 shall not be affected by, among
other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements
thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid,
fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of
Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing Lender
shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,
dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in
connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a
final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender.
The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under
or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents,
if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in
accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code
of the State of New York and UCP 500, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall
not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower.

            3.13. Letter of Credit Payments.If any draft shall be presented for
payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the
relevant Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented
for payment under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall, in
addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of
Credit, be limited to determining in compliance with UCP 500 that the documents
(including each draft) delivered under such Letter

                                       40
<PAGE>

of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity
with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.

            3.14. Applications.To the extent that any provision of any
Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions
of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.

                    Section 4. GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE
                         TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

            4.1. Optional Prepayments.(a) The Borrower may at any time and from
time to time prepay the Loans (other than Multicurrency Revolving Loans
denominated in a Foreign Currency) under the relevant Facility, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the
Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior thereto in the case of
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars and at least one Business Day prior
thereto in the case of Base Rate Loans, which notice shall specify the date and
amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurocurrency Loans
denominated in Dollars or Base Rate Loans; provided that if a Eurocurrency Loan
denominated in Dollars is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts
owing pursuant to Section 4.11. Upon receipt of any such notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any
such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of
Dollar Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and are prepaid prior to the end
of the Revolving Commitment Period) accrued interest to such date on the amount
prepaid. Partial prepayments of Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans
denominated in Dollars shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000
or a whole multiple thereof. Partial prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be in
an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple thereof.

            (b) The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty except as specified in Section 4.11, upon
irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent
prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of
prepayment) specifying the date and amount of prepayment. If any such notice is
given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein, together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.11
and accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be in a
minimum principal amount equal to the Foreign Currency Equivalent of $1,000,000
in the relevant Foreign Currency or a multiple of the Foreign Currency
Equivalent of $100,000 in the relevant Foreign Currency in excess thereof.

            4.2. Mandatory Prepayments. If any Capital Stock shall be issued by
any Group Member (other than to any other Group Member) at a time when the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.00 to 1.00, an amount equal to 50% of the
Net Cash Proceeds thereof (or such lesser amount if, after giving effect to a
prepayment in such lesser amount, the

                                       41
<PAGE>

Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 3.00 to 1.00) shall be
applied no later than one Business Day following the date of such issuance
toward the prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loans as set forth in Section
4.2(d).

            (b) If any Indebtedness shall be incurred by any Group Member (other
than Excluded Indebtedness), an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds
thereof shall be applied no later than one Business Day following the date of
such incurrence toward the prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loans as set forth
in Section 4.2(d).

            (c) If on any date any Group Member shall receive Net Cash Proceeds
from any Asset Sale or Recovery Event then, unless a Reinvestment Notice shall
be delivered in respect thereof, such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied no
later than one Business Day following such date toward the prepayment of the
Tranche B Term Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d); provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds of Asset
Sales and Recovery Events that may be excluded from the foregoing requirement
pursuant to a Reinvestment Notice shall not exceed $80,000,000 in any fiscal
year of the Borrower and (ii) on each Reinvestment Prepayment Date, an amount
equal to the Reinvestment Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant
Reinvestment Event shall be applied toward the prepayment of the Tranche B Term
Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d).

            (d) Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments made
pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be applied to the prepayment of the Tranche B Term
Loans in accordance with Section 4.8(b). The application of any prepayment
pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be made, first, to Base Rate Loans under the
relevant Facility and, second, to Eurocurrency Loans under such Facility. Each
prepayment of the Loans under Section 4.2 shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid.

            (e) If, on any Calculation Date, the Total Multicurrency Revolving
Extensions of Credit exceed an amount equal to 105% of the Total Multicurrency
Revolving Commitments on such date, the Borrower shall, without notice or
demand, immediately repay such of the outstanding Multicurrency Revolving Loans
in an aggregate principal amount such that, after giving effect thereto, the
Total Multicurrency Revolving Extensions of Credit do not exceed the Total
Multicurrency Revolving Commitments, together with interest accrued to the date
of such payment or prepayment on the principal so prepaid if required hereby and
any amounts payable under Section 4.11 in connection therewith. After prepaying
any Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in Dollars, the Borrower may in
lieu of prepaying Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign
Currency in order to comply with this paragraph deposit amounts in the relevant
Foreign Currency or Foreign Currencies in a Cash Collateral Account in
accordance with the next succeeding sentence equal to the aggregate principal
amount of Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency
required to be prepaid. To the extent that after giving effect to any prepayment
of Multicurrency Revolving Loans required by this paragraph, the Total
Multicurrency Revolving Extensions of Credit at such time exceed the Total
Multicurrency Revolving Commitments at such time, the Borrower shall, without
notice or demand, immediately deposit in a Cash Collateral Account upon terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the
amount by which Total Multicurrency Revolving Extensions of Credit exceed the
Total Multicurrency Revolving

                                       42
<PAGE>

Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall apply any cash deposited in the Cash
Collateral Account (to the extent thereof) to pay any Reimbursement Obligations
which are or become due thereafter and/or to repay Multicurrency Revolving Loans
denominated in a Foreign Currency at the end of the Interest Periods therefor;
provided that (x) the Administrative Agent shall release to the Borrower from
time to time such portion of the amount on deposit in the Cash Collateral
Account to the extent such amount is not required to be so deposited in order
for the Borrower to be in compliance with this paragraph and (y) the
Administrative Agent may so apply such cash at any time after the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default. "Cash Collateral Account" means
an account specifically established by the Borrower with the Administrative
Agent for purposes of this Section 4.2 and hereby pledged to the Administrative
Agent and over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the right of withdrawal for application in accordance with
this Section 4.2.

            4.3. Conversion and Continuation Options.(a) The Borrower may elect
from time to time to convert Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars to Base
Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election, provided that any such conversion of
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars may only be made on the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time
to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars by
giving the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable
notice of such election (which notice shall specify the length of the initial
Interest Period therefor), provided that no Base Rate Loan under a particular
Facility may be converted into a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars when
any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent
or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in
its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any
such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may not elect to convert
the currency in which any Loan is denominated.

            (b) Any Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such upon the
expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in
Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such
Loans, provided that no Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars under a
particular Facility may be continued as such when any Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority
Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their
sole discretion not to permit such continuations, and provided, further, that if
the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this
paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding
proviso such Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars shall be automatically
converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest
Period and, if the Borrower shall fail to give such notice of continuation of a
Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, such
Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be
automatically continued for an Interest Period of one month. Upon receipt of any
such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender
thereof.


                                       43

            4.4. Limitations on Eurocurrency Tranches.Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations
of Eurocurrency Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder
shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a)
after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurocurrency
Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Tranche shall be equal to $3,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than ten
Eurocurrency Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.

            4.5. Interest Rates and Payment Dates. Each Eurocurrency Loan shall
bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a
rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined for such day plus the
Applicable Margin.

            (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

            (c) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or
Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate that would
otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section plus 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility plus 2%, and
(ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement
Obligation or any fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when
due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue
amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (A) the rate then
applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility plus 2% (or, in the
case of any such other amounts that do not relate to a particular Facility, the
rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility
plus 2%), in the case of amounts that are owing in Dollars, or (B)(I) the
Eurocurrency Rate in respect of the relevant Foreign Currency plus (II) 2%, in
the case of amounts owing that are denominated in Foreign Currencies, in each
case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such
non-payment until such amount is paid in full (after as well as before
judgment).

            (d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section
shall be payable from time to time on demand.

            4.6. Computation of Interest and Fees.(a) Interest and fees payable
pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the
actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of
interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, the interest
thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be)
day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination
of a Eurocurrency Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from
a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become
effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes
effective. The Administrative Agent shall as

                                       44
<PAGE>

soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the
effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.

            (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the
Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in
determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 4.5(a).

            4.7. Inability to Determine Interest Rate.If prior to the first day
of any Interest Period:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
           determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower
           absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
           relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
           ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period in
           respect of Loans denominated in Dollars, or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
           the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility
           that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such
           Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
           such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or
           maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, or

                  (c) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
           determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower,
           absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
           relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
           ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period in
           respect of any Foreign Currency (any such Foreign Currency is
           referred to as an "Affected Foreign Currency"),

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to
the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If
such notice is given (x) pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this Section 4.7 in
respect of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, then (i) any
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars under the relevant Facility
requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made
as Base Rate Loans, (ii) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to
have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurocurrency
Loans denominated in Dollars shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and
(iii) any outstanding Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars under the
relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current
Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans and (y) in respect of any Multicurrency
Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, then (i) any Multicurrency
Revolving Loans in an Affected Foreign Currency requested to be made on the
first day of such Interest Period shall not be made and (ii) any outstanding
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in an Affected Foreign Currency
shall be due and payable on the first day of such Interest Period.  Until
such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars under the relevant Facility or
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency in an
Affected Foreign

                                       45
<PAGE>

Currency shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the
right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurocurrency Loans.

            4.8. Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.(a) Each borrowing by the
Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of
any commitment fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be
made pro rata according to the respective Term Percentages, Dollar Revolving
Percentages or Multicurrency Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, of the
relevant Lenders.

            (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on
account of principal of and interest on the Tranche B Term Loans shall be made
pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the
Tranche B Term Loans then held by the Tranche B Lenders. The amount of each
principal prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loans shall be applied to reduce the
then remaining installments of the Tranche B Term Loans pro rata based upon the
then remaining principal amount thereof. Amounts repaid or prepaid on account of
the Tranche B Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

            (c) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on
account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans under a Revolving
Facility shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding
principal amounts of the Revolving Loans under such Revolving Facility then held
by the Revolving Lenders under such Revolving Facility. Each payment in respect
of Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit shall be made to
the Issuing Lender that issued such Letter of Credit.

            (d) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower
hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall
be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon,
New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately
available funds, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Lender or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and 11.5 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto; provided that payments made in a Foreign Currency shall be
made prior to 12:00 Noon, local time in the place of payment, on the due date
thereof to the Administrative Agent at the office of the Administrative Agent
designated by the Administrative Agent from time to time for payments made in
such Foreign Currency. All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall
be made in Dollars; provided that (i) payments in respect of the principal of or
interest on any Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency
shall be made in such Foreign Currency, (ii) any amounts payable under Section
4.9 or 4.11 in respect of any Multicurrency Revolving Loan or Multicurrency
Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be payable in such
Foreign Currency if the certificate submitted by the applicable Lender or
Issuing Lender in respect of such amount specifies such amount in such Foreign
Currency and (iii) payments in respect of Multicurrency Letters of Credit and
Multicurrency L/C Obligations denominated in a Foreign Currency may be made in
such Foreign Currency to the extent permitted by, and shall be made to the
extent required by, the applicable provisions of this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly upon receipt
in like funds as

                                       46
<PAGE>

received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency
Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a
Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another
calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately
preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal
pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at
the then applicable rate during such extension.

            (e) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made
by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to
a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its
share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available
to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on
the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
on demand, such amount with interest thereon (i) in the case of Loans
denominated in Dollars, at the greater of (A) a rate equal to the daily average
Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rates on interbank compensation for
the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the
Administrative Agent and (ii) in the case of Multicurrency Revolving Loans
denominated in a Foreign Currency, at a rate per annum reasonably determined by
the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount for the
period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the
Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any
Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such
borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender
within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent
shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate
per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility (or with
respect to Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, at a
rate per annum reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost
to it of funding such amount), on demand, from the Borrower.

            (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the
Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is
making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required
to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders under the
relevant Facility or the Issuing Lender their respective pro rata shares of a
corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by
the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any
amount which was made available pursuant to the

                                       47
<PAGE>

preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon (i) in the case of Loans
denominated in Dollars, at the greater of (A) the rate per annum equal to the
daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rates on interbank
compensation and (ii) in the case of Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated
in a Foreign Currency, at a rate per annum reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
against the Borrower.

            4.9. Requirements of Law.(a) If the adoption of or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance
by any Lender or any Issuing Lender with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

                (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
           deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held
           by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances,
           loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of
           funds by, any office of such Lender or Issuing Lender that is not
           otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate
           hereunder; or

                (ii) shall impose on such Lender or Issuing Lender any other
           condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
or Issuing Lender, by an amount that such Lender or Issuing Lender deems to
be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining
Eurocurrency Loans or issuing, maintaining or participating in Letters of
Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof,
then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or
Issuing Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender for such increased cost or reduced
amount received or receivable.  If any Lender or Issuing Lender becomes
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall
promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the
event by reason of which it has become so entitled.

            (b) If any Lender or Issuing Lender shall have determined that the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy
or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or
Issuing Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender or Issuing Lender with
any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the
force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof
shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing
Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that
which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such corporation could have achieved but
for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's
or Issuing Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Lender to be material,
then from time to time, after submission by such Lender or Issuing Lender to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request
therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will

                                       48
<PAGE>

compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's or Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that
the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Lender
pursuant to this paragraph for any amounts incurred more than six months prior
to the date that such Lender or Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of such
Lender's or Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; and
provided, further, that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a
retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the
period of such retroactive effect.

            (c) If any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction of any Foreign
Currency (or any other jurisdiction in which the funding operations of any
Multicurrency Revolving Lender shall be conducted with respect to such Foreign
Currency) shall have in effect any reserve, liquid asset or similar requirement
with respect to any category of deposits or liabilities customarily used to fund
loans in such Foreign Currency, or by reference to which interest rates
applicable to loans in such Foreign Currency are determined, and the result of
such requirement shall be to increase the cost to any Multicurrency Revolving
Lender of making or maintaining any Multicurrency Revolving Loan in such Foreign
Currency, and such Multicurrency Revolving Lender shall deliver to the Borrower
a notice requesting compensation under this paragraph, then the Borrower will
pay to such Multicurrency Revolving Lender on each Interest Payment Date with
respect to each Multicurrency Revolving Loan in such affected Foreign Currency
an amount that will compensate such Multicurrency Revolving Lender for such
additional cost.

            (d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section submitted by any Lender or Issuing Lender to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) setting forth the basis of calculation of such
additional amounts shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The
obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

            (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if,
(i)(A) the adoption of any law, rule or regulation after the date of this
Agreement, (B) any change in any law, rule or regulation or in the
interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority after the
date of this Agreement or (C) compliance by any Multicurrency Revolving Lender
with any request, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) of any Governmental Authority made or issued after the date of this
Agreement, shall make it unlawful for any such Multicurrency Revolving Lender to
make or maintain any Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign
Currency or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with
respect to any Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency,
or (ii) there shall have occurred any change in national or international
financial, political or economic conditions (including the imposition of or any
change in exchange controls, but excluding conditions otherwise covered by this
Section 4.9) which would make it impracticable for any Multicurrency Revolving
Lenders to make or maintain Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in the
relevant Foreign Currency after the date hereof to, or for the account of, the
Borrower, then:


                                       49
<PAGE>

                (i) by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative
           Agent, such Multicurrency Revolving Lender or Multicurrency Revolving
           Lenders may declare that Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in
           the affected Foreign Currency will not thereafter (for the duration
           of such unlawfulness) be made by such Multicurrency Revolving Lender
           or Multicurrency Revolving Lenders hereunder (or be continued for
           additional Interest Periods), whereupon any request for a
           Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in such Foreign Currency or
           to continue a Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in such
           Foreign Currency, as the case may be, for an additional Interest
           Period shall, as to such Multicurrency Revolving Lender or
           Multicurrency Revolving Lenders only, be of no force and effect,
           unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

                (ii) all outstanding Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated
           in the affected Foreign Currency made by such Multicurrency Revolving
           Lender or Multicurrency Revolving Lenders shall be repaid on the last
           day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto or, if
           earlier, the date on which the applicable notice becomes effective.

            (f) For purposes of Section 4.9(e), a notice to the Borrower by any
Multicurrency Revolving Lender shall be effective as to each Multicurrency
Revolving Loan denominated in the affected Foreign Currency made by such
Multicurrency Revolving Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest
Period currently applicable to such Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in
a Foreign Currency; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the
date of receipt thereof by the Borrower.

            4.10. Taxes. Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income,
stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes
(imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Agent or any Lender as a
result of a present or former connection between such Agent or such Lender and
the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any
such connection arising solely from such Agent or such Lender having executed,
delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced,
this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings
("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to
such Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to
such Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other
Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in
the amounts specified in this Agreement, provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with
respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's
failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section
or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to
such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement or
designates a new lending office, except to the extent that such Lender's
assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time

                                       50
<PAGE>

of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to
such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph.

            (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by
the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the
Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant
Agent or Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official
receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails
to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and
the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become
payable by any Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

            (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant,
to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased)
two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI,
or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of
Exhibit G and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors
thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming
complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on
all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it
becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or
before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In
addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the
obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S.
Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously
delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification
adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to
deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not
legally able to deliver.

            (e) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as
will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate,
provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver
such documentation and in such Lender's

                                       51
<PAGE>

judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice
the legal position of such Lender.

            (f) The agreements in this Section 4.10 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

            (g) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent determines, in its
sole discretion, that it has received a refund attributable to any Non-Excluded
Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Borrower or for which the Lender or the
Administrative Agent has received payment from the Borrower hereunder, such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, within 30 days of such receipt, shall
deliver to the Borrower the amount of such refund without interest (other than
any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); provided, however, that the Borrower agrees to repay the amount paid
over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent
in the event that such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. In addition, upon a written request
by the Borrower, any Lender and the Administrative Agent shall timely execute
and deliver to the Borrower such certificates, forms or other documents which
can be reasonably furnished consistent with the facts to assist the Borrower in
applying for refunds of Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes remitted hereunder,
unless to do so will unduly prejudice or cause undue hardship to such Lender or
the Administrative Agent (as determined in the sole discretion of such Lender or
the Administrative Agent). This paragraph shall not be construed to require any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person.

            4.11. Indemnity.The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to
hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing
of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has
given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion
from Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a
prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans or the conversion of Eurocurrency Loans, in
each case, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect
thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid,
or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of
such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided
for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any)
over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that
would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on
deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurocurrency
market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

<PAGE>

            4.12. Change of Lending Office.Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or
4.10(b) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use
reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to
designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the
object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided that such
designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause
such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect
or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender
pursuant to Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or 4.10(b).

            4.13. Replacement of Lenders.The Borrower shall be permitted to
replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to
Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or 4.10(b) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans
hereunder, with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement,
(iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action
under Section 4.12 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts
owing pursuant to Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or 4.10(b), (iv) the replacement
financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing
to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower
shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 4.11 if any Eurocurrency
Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day
of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial
institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and (if the replaced Lender was a Revolving Lender) each
Issuing Lender and (if the replaced Lender was a Dollar Revolving Lender) the
Swingline Lender, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such
replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6, (viii) until such
time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all
additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or
4.10(b), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed
to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

            4.14. Evidence of Debt. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance
with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to
time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

            (b) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall
maintain the Register pursuant to Section 11.6, and a subaccount therein for
each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder and any Note evidencing such Loan, the Type of such Loan and each
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

            (c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender
maintained pursuant to Section 4.14(a) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be prima facie

                                       53
<PAGE>

evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein
recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error
therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
(with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            (d) The Borrower agrees that, upon the request by any Lender
(through the Administrative Agent), the Borrower will prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Borrower payable to the order of
such Lender (or if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent, evidencing Loans
made by such Lender.

            4.15. Illegality.Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such
Lender hereunder to make Eurocurrency Loans, continue Eurocurrency Loans as such
and convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans shall forthwith be canceled
and (b) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurocurrency Loans, if any,
shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans (or, in the case of
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, be repaid) on
the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such
conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of
the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 4.11.

            4.16. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate. (a) No later than 1:00 P.M.,
London time, on each Calculation Date with respect to a Foreign Currency, the
Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate as of such Calculation
Date with respect to such Foreign Currency, provided that, upon receipt of a
Borrowing Request pursuant to Section 3.2 for a borrowing of a Multicurrency
Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency or a request for a Letter of
Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency pursuant to Section 3.8, the
Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate with respect to the
relevant Foreign Currency in accordance with the foregoing (it being
acknowledged and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall use such Exchange
Rate for the purposes of determining compliance with Section 3.1(a) or 3.7(a),
as applicable, with respect to such Borrowing Request or Application). The
Exchange Rates so determined shall become effective on the first Business Day
immediately following the relevant Calculation Date (a "Reset Date"), shall
remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date and shall for all purposes
of this Agreement (other than Section 4.7, 11.19 or any other provision
expressly requiring the use of a current Exchange Rate) be the Exchange Rates
employed in converting any amounts between Dollars and Foreign Currencies.

            (b) No later than 5:00 P.M., London time, on each Reset Date and
each Borrowing Date with respect to Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in
a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate
amount of the Dollar Equivalents of the principal amounts of the Multicurrency
Revolving Loans denominated in a

                                       54
<PAGE>

Foreign Currency then outstanding (after giving effect to any Multicurrency
Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency to be made or repaid on such
date and the aggregate amount of the L/C Obligations then outstanding).

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of
each determination of an Exchange Rate hereunder.

                   Section 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement
and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the
Borrower hereby represents and warrants to each Agent and each Lender that:

            5.1. Financial Condition.The audited consolidated balance sheet of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year
ended on such date, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from
Deloitte & Touche LLP, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the
fiscal year then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2004, and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the nine-month
period ended on such date, present fairly the consolidated financial condition
of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the
nine-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All
such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto,
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the
periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants
and disclosed therein). No Group Member has any material Guarantee Obligations,
contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or
unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign
currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of
derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements
referred to in this paragraph or disclosed in this Section 5.

            5.2. No Change.Since December 31, 2003, there has been no
development or event that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            5.3. Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law.Each Group Member (a)
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal
right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as
lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that the
failure to so qualify could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith
could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.


                                       55
<PAGE>

            5.4. Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.Each Loan Party
has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to
obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all necessary
organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to
authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act
by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required
in connection with the extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution,
delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, except (i) consents, authorizations, filings and
notices described in Schedule 5.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and
notices have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) the
filings referred to in Section 5.19. Each Loan Document has been duly executed
and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party party thereto. This Agreement
constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party party thereto,
enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

            5.5. No Legal Bar.The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any
Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will
not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of
their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or
any such Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created by the Security
Documents). No Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation applicable to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            5.6. Litigation.Except as described on Schedule 5.6, no litigation,
investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or
against any Group Member or against any of their respective properties or

information, document or certificate was so furnished (or, in the case of the
Confidential Information Memorandum, as of the date of this Agreement), any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact

projections contained in the materials referenced above are based upon good
faith estimates and assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be
reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such
financial information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact
and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial
information may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a
material amount. There is no fact known to any Loan Party that could reasonably

representing such Pledged Stock have been delivered to the Administrative Agent,
together with proper endorsements executed in blank and such other action has
been taken with respect to Pledged Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries as specified in
the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, and in the case of the other Collateral
described in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, when financing statements
specified on Schedule 5.19(a) have been filed in the offices specified on

perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of
the Loan Parties in such Collateral and the proceeds thereof, as security for

Guarantee and Collateral Agreement), a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on the
Mortgaged Properties described therein and proceeds thereof, and when the
Mortgages are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 5.19(b), such Mortgages
shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right,
title and interest of the Loan Parties in such Mortgaged Properties and the
proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations (as defined in the relevant
Mortgage), in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, subject
to the exceptions set forth on Schedule B to the applicable Title Policy and the
Liens permitted under Section 8.3. Schedule 1.1(a) lists each parcel of real

Debt" and "Designated Senior Debt" of the Borrower under and as defined in each

has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.

            5.23. Material Contracts.(a) As of the Effective Date, (i) each

obligation of each party thereto

                                       60
<PAGE>

enforceable in accordance with its terms and (ii) no Group Member is in default
of any material provision of any Material Contract.

            (b) To the best knowledge of the Borrower, (i) there has been no
default, breach or other violation of any Material Contract and (ii) no
Governmental Authority has any basis for terminating any Material Contract other
than customary termination provisions relating to convenience and other similar
provisions, except, in each case, as could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            (c) To the best knowledge of the Borrower, no Governmental Authority
has delivered notice of or otherwise demonstrated its intention to exercise its
option to terminate a Material Contract on the basis of clause (b)(ii) above
between itself and any of the Group Members, except for any such terminations
that, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            (d) Schedule 5.23 sets forth each material contract between any
Group Member and any Governmental Authority in effect on the Effective Date.

            5.24. Insurance.Schedule 5.24 sets forth a description of all
material insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the Subsidiary
Guarantors as of the Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, all premiums due
and payable in respect of such insurance have been paid. The Borrower reasonably
believes that the insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is adequate.

      through (v) above, such event or condition, together with all other such
      events or conditions, if any, would, in the reasonable judgment of the
      Required Lenders, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse

            (k) (i) any "person" or "group" (as such terms are used in Sections

                                       85
<PAGE>

      at any time outstanding and such defaults shall either (x) be continuing
      for a period of 60 days or more or (y) have resulted in the provider of
      the relevant Secured Surety Bonds taking any enforcement action in respect
      of the Lien securing such Secured Surety Bond;

then, and in any such event, (A) if such event is an Event of Default
specified in clause (i) or (ii) of paragraph (f) above with respect to the
Borrower, automatically the Commitments shall immediately terminate and the
Loans hereunder (with accrued interest thereon) and all other amounts owing
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents (including all amounts of
L/C Obligations, whether or not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding
Letters of Credit shall have presented the documents required thereunder)
shall immediately become due and payable, and (B) if such event is any other
Event of Default, either or both of the following actions may be taken:
(i) with the consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent may,
or upon the request of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent shall,
by notice to the Borrower declare the Revolving Commitments to be terminated
forthwith, whereupon the Revolving Commitments shall immediately terminate;
and (ii) with the consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent
may, or upon the request of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent
shall, by notice to the Borrower, declare the Loans hereunder (with accrued
interest thereon) and all other amounts owing under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents (including all amounts of L/C Obligations, whether or
not the beneficiaries of the then outstanding Letters of Credit shall have
presented the documents required thereunder) to be due and payable forthwith,
whereupon the same shall immediately become due and payable.  With respect to
all Letters of Credit with respect to which presentment for honor shall not
have occurred at the time of an acceleration pursuant to this paragraph, the
Borrower shall at such time deposit in a cash collateral account opened by
the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the aggregate then undrawn and
unexpired amount of such Letters of Credit.  Amounts held in such cash
collateral account shall be applied by the Administrative Agent to the
payment of drafts drawn under such Letters of Credit, and the unused portion
thereof after all such Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully
drawn upon, if any, shall be applied to repay other obligations of the
Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents.  After all such
Letters of Credit shall have expired or been fully drawn upon, all
Reimbursement Obligations shall have been satisfied and all other obligations
of the Borrower hereunder and under the other Loan Documents shall have been
paid in full, the balance, if any, in such cash collateral account shall be
returned to the Borrower (or such other Person as may be lawfully entitled
thereto).  Except as expressly provided above in this Section, presentment,
demand, protest and all other notices of any kind are hereby expressly waived
by the Borrower.

                             Section 10. THE AGENTS

            10.1. Appointment.(a) Each Lender and Issuing Lender hereby
irrevocably designates and appoints each Agent as the agent of such Lender under
this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and each such Lender irrevocably
authorizes such Agent, in such capacity, to take such action on its behalf under
the provisions of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents and to exercise
such powers and perform such duties as are delegated to such Agent by the terms
of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, together with such actions and
powers as are reasonably incidental thereto. Notwithstanding any provision to
the contrary elsewhere in this Agreement, no Agent shall have any duties or
responsibilities, except those

                                       86
<PAGE>

expressly set forth herein, or any fiduciary relationship with any Lender, and
no implied covenants, functions, responsibilities, duties, obligations or
liabilities shall be read into this Agreement or any other Loan Document or
otherwise exist against any Agent.

            (b) The Issuing Lender shall act on behalf of the Revolving Lenders
with respect to Letters of Credit issued or made under this Agreement and the
documents associated therewith. It is understood and agreed that the Issuing
Lender (i) shall have all of the benefits and immunities (x) provided to the
Agents in this Section 10 with respect to acts taken or omissions suffered by
the Issuing Lender in connection with Letters of Credit issued or made under
this Agreement and the documents associated therewith as fully as if the term
"Agents", as used in this Section 10, included the Issuing Lender with respect
to such acts or omissions and (y) as additionally provided in this Agreement and
(ii) shall have all of the benefits of the provisions of Section 10.7 as fully
as if the term "Agents", as used in Section 10.7, included the Issuing Lender.

            10.2. Delegation of Duties.Each Agent may execute any of its duties
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents by or through agents or
attorneys-in-fact and shall be entitled to advice of counsel concerning all
matters pertaining to such duties. Each Agent and any such agent or
attorney-in-fact may perform any and all of its duties and exercise its rights
and powers through their respective Related Parties. No Agent shall be
responsible for the negligence or misconduct of any agents or attorneys-in-fact
selected by it with reasonable care.

            10.3. Exculpatory Provisions.Neither any Agent nor any of their
respective Related Parties shall be (i) liable for any action lawfully taken or
omitted to be taken by it or such Person under or in connection with this
Agreement or any other Loan Document (except to the extent that any of the
foregoing are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from its or such Person's own gross
negligence or willful misconduct) or (ii) responsible in any manner to any of
the Lenders for any recitals, statements, representations or warranties made by
any Loan Party or any officer thereof contained in this Agreement or any other
Loan Document or in any certificate, report, statement or other document
referred to or provided for in, or received by the Agents under or in connection
with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under
any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Loan Party.

            10.4. Reliance by Agents.Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent.
The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all

                                       87
<PAGE>

purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Each Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agents shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the
Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

            10.5. Notice of Default.No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless
such Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default." In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to
the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required
Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other
instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement); provided that unless
and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

            10.6. Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.Each Lender expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective Related Parties
have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any
affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that
it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender,
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their
affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into
this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or
any of its Related Parties.

                                       88
<PAGE>

            10.7. Indemnification.The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in
its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their
respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought
after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans
shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure
Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
(whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the
Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            10.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity.Each Agent and its affiliates
may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of
business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With
respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of
Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

            10.9. Successor Administrative Agent.The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent at any time upon notice to the Lenders, the
Issuing Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any time by the Required
Lenders. Upon the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Required Lenders shall appoint a
successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of
Default under Section 9(a) or Section 9(f) with respect to the Borrower shall
have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring
Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor
agent, which agent shall be a bank organized and doing business under the laws
of the United States or any state thereof, subject to supervision or examination
by any federal or state authority and having a total shareholder equity


                                       89
<PAGE>

aggregating at least $1,000,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After any retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation or removal as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Section 10 and Section 11.5 shall inure to its benefit and the benefit of its
agents and their respective Related Parties as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by any of them while it was acting under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

            10.10. Agents Generally.Except as expressly set forth herein, no
Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as
such.

            10.11. Lead Arrangers and Syndication Agent.Each of the Lead
Arrangers and the Syndication Agent, in its capacity as such, shall have no
duties or responsibilities, and shall incur no liability, under this Agreement
and other Loan Documents.

                           Section 11. MISCELLANEOUS

            11.1. Amendments and Waivers.Neither this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or
modified except in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4 or this Section
11.1; provided that Incremental Term Loan Amendments pursuant to and in
compliance with Section 2.4 shall not be subject to this Section 11.1. The
Required Lenders and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may,
or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent
and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time,
(a) enter into written amendments, consents, supplements or modifications hereto
and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of
the Lenders or of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such
terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its
consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment,
supplement or modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount of any Loan or
L/C Disbursement or extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan,
extend the scheduled date of any amortization payment in respect of any Tranche
B Term Loan, extend the required date of reimbursement of any L/C Disbursement,
reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except (x) in
connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in
interest rates, which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Majority
Facility Lenders of each adversely affected Facility and (y) that any amendment
or modification of defined terms used in the financial covenants in this
Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for
purposes of this clause (i)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment
thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's
Revolving Commitment under either Revolving Facility, in each case without the
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or
reduce the voting rights of any Lender under this Section 11.1 without the
written consent of such Lender; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the
definition of Required Lenders or any other provision of any Loan Document
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, modify or
amend any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
release all or substantially all of the Collateral or release any material
guarantee under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement or limit the applicable
Loan Party's liability in respect of such guarantee, in each case without the


                                       90
<PAGE>

written consent of all Lenders; (iv) amend, modify or waive any condition
precedent to any extension of credit under a Revolving Facility set forth in
Section 6.2 (including in connection with any waiver of an existing Default or
Event of Default) without the written consent of the Majority Facility Lenders
with respect to such Revolving Facility; (v) amend, modify or waive any
provision of Section 4.8 without the written consent of the Majority Facility
Lenders in respect of each Facility adversely affected thereby; (vi) reduce the
amount of Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied to prepay Tranche B Term
Loans under this Agreement without the written consent of the Majority Facility
Lenders with respect to the Tranche B Term Loan Facility; (vii) reduce the
percentage specified in the definition of Majority Facility Lenders with respect
to any Facility without the written consent of all Lenders under such Facility;
(viii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10 without the written
consent of each Agent adversely affected thereby; (ix) amend, modify or waive
any provision of Section 3.3 or 3.4 without the written consent of the Swingline
Lender; (x) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its
terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding
Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class,
without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the
outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided,
further, that any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by
its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of one Class of
Lenders (but not other Classes) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and requisite percentage in interest of the
affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this
Section if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the
time; or (xi) amend, modify or waive any provision of Sections 3.7 to 3.14
without the written consent of each Issuing Lender. Any such waiver and any such
amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders
and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Agents and all
future holders of the Loans; provided that no such agreement shall amend, modify
or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case
may be. In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agents
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed
to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be
amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower, the Required
Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are
affected thereby, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender) if (i) by the
terms of such

                                       91
<PAGE>

agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided
for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at
the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto
receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan
made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under
this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a) to add one or more additional credit
facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to
time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof
to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
with the Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Extensions of Credit and the accrued
interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the
Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required
Lenders and Majority Facility Lenders.

            In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and
the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to
permit the refinancing of all outstanding Tranche B Term Loans ("Refinanced Term
Loans") with a replacement term loan tranche hereunder ("Replacement Term
Loans"), provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Replacement
Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced
Term Loans, (b) the Applicable Margin for such Replacement Term Loans shall not
be higher than the Applicable Margin for such Refinanced Term Loans, (c) the
weighted average life to maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be
shorter than the weighted average life to maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans
at the time of such refinancing and (d) all other terms applicable to such
Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to
the Lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans than, those applicable to such
Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants
and other terms applicable to any period after the latest final maturity of the
Tranche B Term Loans in effect immediately prior to such refinancing.

      Attention of Donald Shokrian (Telecopy No. (646) 534-0574); and; and

            (v) if to any other Lender or Issuing Lender, to it at its address
      (or telecopy number) set forth in its Administrative Questionnaire;

provided that any notice, request or demand to or upon any Agent, the Issuing
Lender or the Lenders shall not be effective until received.

            (b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be
delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures
approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not

Borrower may, in their discretion, agree to accept notices and other
communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

            11.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of any Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges that would otherwise be provided
by law. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any
departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by Section 11.1, and then such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
Issuing Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                                       93

            11.4. Survival.All representations and warranties made by the Loan
Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and
the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at
the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any
fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid
or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not
expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and 11.5 and
11.13(e) and Section 10 shall survive and remain in full force and effect
regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit
and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision
hereof.

            11.5. Payment of Expenses and Taxes.The Borrower agrees (a) to pay
or reimburse the Syndication Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arrangers for all their respective reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and
any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith,
and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to such
Agent and filing and recording fees and expenses, with statements with respect
to the foregoing to be submitted to the Borrower prior to the Effective Date (in
the case of amounts to be paid on the Effective Date) and from time to time
thereafter (not less frequently than quarterly, if accrued and unbilled fees
exceed $15,000) as such Agent shall deem appropriate, (b) to pay or reimburse
each Lender, Issuing Lender and Agent for all its costs and reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including
the fees and disbursements of counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses
of in-house counsel) to each Lender and Issuing Lender and of counsel to such
Agent, provided that, the fees and disbursements of counsel to any such Lender
shall only be paid or reimbursed to the extent incurred in connection with a
Default or an Event of Default, (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender,
Issuing Lender and Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees
and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in
paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined
to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation
or administration of any of the transactions contemplated by, or any amendment,
supplement or modification of, or any waiver or consent under or in respect of,

<PAGE>

directors, employees, affiliates, agents, trustees, advisors and controlling
persons (each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from and against any and all other
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect
to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including any
of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation
of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to
the operations or current or former properties of any Group Member or any of the
Properties and the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel in connection
with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee against any Loan Party
under any Loan Document (all the foregoing in this clause (e), collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"), provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Without limiting
the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby
waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for
contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims,
demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses
of whatever kind or nature, arising under or related to Environmental Laws, that
any of them may have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee, except to
the extent resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
of such Indemnitee. All amounts due under this Section 11.5 shall be payable not
later than ten days after written demand therefor. Statements payable by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be submitted to Robert C. Becker
(Telephone No.: (212) 754-2233 and Telecopy No: (212) 754-2372), at the address
of the Borrower set forth in Section 11.2, or to such other Person or address as
may be hereafter designated by the Borrower in a written notice to the
Administrative Agent. The agreements in this Section 11.5 shall survive
repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            11.6. Successors and Assigns.(a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of
any Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Lender that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this

                                       95
<PAGE>

Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the
time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

            (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be
      required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an
      Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
      any other assignee;

            (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the
      Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of all or any
      portion of a Tranche B Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
      an Approved Fund; and

            (C) each Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender; provided that no
      consent of any Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender shall be required for an
      assignment of all or any portion of a Tranche B Term Loan.

            (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

            (A) no assignment may be made to an Ineligible Assignee;

            (B) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate
      of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining
      amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the
      amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each
      such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
      with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent)
      shall not be less than $5,000,000 or, in the case of Tranche B Term Loans,
      $1,000,000, unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
      consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required
      if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

            (C) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
      proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
      under this Agreement, except that this clause (C) shall not be construed
      to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
      Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Facility;

            (D) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
      Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
      processing and recordation fee of $3,500 to be paid by the assignor or
      assignee; provided that only one such fee shall be payable in connection
      with simultaneous assignments to or by two or more related Approved Funds;
      and

            (E) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
      Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

            (F) in the case of an assignment by a Lender to a CLO (as defined
      below) managed or administered by such Lender or an Affiliate of such
      Lender, the assigning Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any
      amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and
      the other Loan Documents, provided that the

                                       96
<PAGE>

      Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and such CLO may provide
      that such Lender will not, without the consent of such CLO, agree to any
      amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each
      Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second
      sentence of Section 11.1 and (2) directly affects such CLO.

            For purposes of this Section 11.6, the terms "Approved Fund" and
"CLO" have the following meanings:

            "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that
is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar
extensions of credit in the ordinary course and that is administered or managed
by, or has as its principal investment advisor, a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender or an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a
Lender or is the principal investment advisor of a Lender.

            "CLO" means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or
otherwise) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing
in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business and is administered or managed by a Lender or an affiliate of such
Lender.

            (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 11.5 and 11.13(e)). Any assignment or
transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this Section 11.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as
a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

            (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and each of the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Lender
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.

            (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire

                                       97
<PAGE>

(unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written
consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective
for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph.

            (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders or the Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver (1) that requires the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 11.1
and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii)
of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.7 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 11.7(a) as though it were a
Lender.

            (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 4.9 or 4.11 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
applicable Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a
Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 4.11 unless the applicable Borrower is notified of the participation
sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of such
Borrower, to comply with Section 4.10(a) as though it were a Lender.

            (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment
of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security
interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.


                                       98

            (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any
or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender
without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without
regard to the limitations set forth in Section 11.6(b). The Borrower, each
Lender and each Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a
Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender
any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day
after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by
such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit
Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party
hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to
institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of
forbearance.

            11.7. Adjustments; Set-off. Except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the
Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a "Benefitted Lender")
shall, at any time after the Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall
immediately become due and payable pursuant to Section 9, receive any payment of
all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect
thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or
proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 9(f), or otherwise), in a
greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other
Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such
Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating
interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or
shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as
shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment
or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.

            (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower,
any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted
by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set
off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time
held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made
by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such setoff and application.

            11.8. Counterparts.This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile transmission shall be effective as

                                       99

delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this
Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

            11.9. Severability.Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

            11.10. Integration.This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises,

to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the
other Loan Documents.

            11.11. GOVERNING LAW.THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

      to plead or claim the same;

            (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding
      may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
      (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the
      Borrower at its address set forth in Section 11.2 or at such other address
      of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant
      thereto;

            (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
      service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the

      relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection
      with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the
      relationship between the Agents, the Issuing Lender and Lenders, on one
      hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or
      therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

            (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan

to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (without
requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender except as expressly required

of releasing any Collateral or guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary
to permit consummation of any transaction not prohibited by any Loan Document or
that has been consented to in accordance with Section 11.1 or (ii) under the
circumstances described in paragraph (b) below.

            (b) At such time as the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and the
other obligations under the Loan Documents (other than obligations under or in
respect of Hedge Agreements) shall have been paid in full, the Commitments have
been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, the Collateral
shall be released from the Liens created by the Security Documents, and the
Security Documents and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to
survive such termination) of the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party under

the provisions of this Section, to any actual or prospective Transferee or any

confidentiality of information as provided in this Section shall be considered

Person would accord to its own confidential information.

            11.16. WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL.THE BORROWER, THE AGENTS AND THE
LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL

            11.18. Conversion of Currencies.(a) If, for the purpose of obtaining
judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one
currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent
that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at
which, in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant
jurisdiction, the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on
the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.

            (b) The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any
party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "Applicable
Creditor") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "Judgment
Currency") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due
hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that, on
the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase
the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section 11.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

            11.19. Interest Rate Limitation.Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in



                                      102

<PAGE>

accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.

The Applicable Margin shall be adjusted, on and after the first Adjustment Date
(as defined below) occurring after the date which is six months after the
Effective Date, based on changes in the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, with such
adjustments to become effective on the date (the "Adjustment Date") that is
three Business Days after the date on which the relevant financial statements
are delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 7.1 and to remain in effect
until the next adjustment to be effected pursuant to this paragraph. If any
financial statements referred to above are not delivered within the time periods
specified in Section 7.1, then, until the date that is three Business Days after
the date on which such financial statements are delivered, the highest rate set
forth in each column of the Pricing Grid shall apply. On each Adjustment Date,
the Applicable Margin shall be adjusted to be equal to the Applicable Margins
opposite the Pricing Level determined to exist on such Adjustment Date from the
financial statements relating to such Adjustment Date. Prior to the date on
which the financial statements specified in Section 7.1 for the fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2005 are required to be delivered, the Applicable Margin shall be
determined by reference to Pricing Level II.

            As used herein, the following rules shall govern the determination
of Pricing Levels on each Adjustment Date:

            "Pricing Level I"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is greater than or equal
to 3.25 to 1.00.

            "Pricing Level II"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is less than 3.25 to 1.00
but greater than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00.

            "Pricing Level III"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is less than 2.50 to 1.00
but greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00.

            "Pricing Level IV"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is less than 2.00 to 1.00.
