Item 1.01   Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

      On November 24, 2004, Scientific Games Corporation (the "Company")
commenced (a) a cash tender offer for any and all of its outstanding 12 1/2%
Senior Subordinated Notes due 2010 (the "Notes") and (b) a solicitation of
consents to amend the Indenture, dated as of August 14, 2000, by and among
the Company (formerly known as Autotote Corporation), certain of the
Company's subsidiaries, and The Bank of New York as trustee (as supplemented,
the "Indenture"), under which the Notes were issued.  As of 5:00 p.m., New
York City time, on December 8, 2004, the Company received the requisite
number of consents to permit it to amend the Indenture.  On December 22,
2004, the Company, certain of the Company's subsidiaries, and The Bank of New
York, as trustee, executed a Third Supplemental Indenture (the "Third
Supplemental Indenture"), amending the Indenture as described in the Offer to
Purchase and Solicitation of Consents dated November 24, 2004 (the
"Amendments").

      The Amendments eliminate substantially all of the restrictive covenants
and certain event of default provisions contained in the Indenture.  The
Amendments became operative on December 23, 2004, when the tendered Notes
were accepted for purchase by the Company.  Notes that were not tendered for
purchase in the tender offer remain outstanding and are subject to the terms
of the Indenture as modified by the Amendments.  The Third Supplemental
Indenture is attached hereto as Exhibit 4.1.

      Scientific Games Corporation issued a press release dated December 23,
