Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

A.  Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures.
    ------------------------------------------

On December 23, 2004, Scientific Games Corporation (the "Company") issued $250
million of 0.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2024, and on
December 30, 2004, the Company issued an additional $25 million of 0.75%
Convertible Senior Subordinated Debentures due 2024 (collectively, the
"Debentures"), in a private offering to qualified institutional buyers in
accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act"). In connection with the offering of the Debentures, the
Company received proceeds of $275 million less initial purchasers' discounts of
$8.25 million. The Debentures were issued pursuant to an indenture dated as of
December 23, 2004, among the Company, the subsidiary guarantors named therein
and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (the "CD Indenture"). The
CD Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.1 to this Form 8-K. The description of the
terms of the CD Indenture in this Item 1.01 are qualified in their entirety by
reference to such exhibit. The Debentures were sold to the initial purchasers in
reliance upon representations and warranties of the initial purchasers,
including, among others, that each of the initial purchasers is a qualified
institutional buyer within the meaning of Rule 144A and an accredited investor
within the meaning of Rule 501(c) of the Securities Act.

The Debentures bear interest at a rate of 0.75% per annum until June 1, 2010 and
will bear interest at a rate of 0.50% per annum thereafter. Interest on the
Debentures is payable semiannually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each
year, beginning on June 1, 2005. The Debentures mature on December 1, 2024,
unless earlier converted, redeemed or repurchased, and are subject to the terms
and conditions set forth in the CD Indenture.

The Debentures are convertible into cash and shares of Scientific Games Class A
common stock, if any, prior to stated maturity under the following
circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar
quarter) commencing after December 31, 2004 and before December 31, 2019, if the
last reported sale price of the Company's common stock for at least 20 trading
days in the period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day
of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 120% of the
conversion price; (2) at any time on or after December 31, 2019 if the last
reported sale price of the Company's common stock on December 31, 2019 or any
date thereafter is greater than or equal to 120% of the conversion price; (3) if
the Company calls the Debentures for redemption, except for certain redemptions
described in the CD Indenture; or (4) upon the occurrence of certain corporate
transactions described in the CD Indenture.

The conversion rate will initially be 34.3643 shares of Class A common stock per
$1,000 principal amount of Debentures, representing an initial effective
conversion price of approximately $29.10 per share. Upon any conversion of
Debentures, the Company will deliver cash equal to the lesser of (x) the
aggregate principal amount of Debentures to be converted and (y) its total
conversion obligation, and will deliver shares of the Company's Class A common
stock in respect of the remainder, if any, of its conversion obligation.

The Company may redeem all or some of the Debentures for cash at any time on or
after June 1, 2010, at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of the Debentures being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to
the redemption date. Holders may require the Company to repurchase the
Debentures for cash on June 1, 2010, December 1, 2014 and December 1, 2019 at a
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the Debentures being
repurchased plus any accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the
applicable repurchase date.

The Debentures are subordinated to all of the Company's existing and future
senior debt, rank equally with all of its existing and future senior
subordinated debt and rank senior to all of its future subordinated debt that is
expressly subordinated in right of payment to the Debentures. The Debentures are
guaranteed on a senior subordinated basis by those of the Company's subsidiaries
that incur or guarantee other senior subordinated debt and rank junior to any
senior debt of the subsidiary guarantors. The Debentures are effectively
subordinated to all liabilities of the Company's subsidiaries that do not issue
guarantees of the Debentures.

<PAGE>

The Company has agreed to file a registration statement under the Securities Act
to provide for resales of the Debentures and the shares of the Company's Class A
common stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures by holders of the same
who provide certain information to the Company.

B.  Senior Subordinated Notes
    -------------------------

On December 23, 2004, the Company issued $200 million of 6 1/4% Senior
Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Notes") in a private offering to qualified
institutional buyers in accordance with Rule 144A under the Securities Act and
to persons outside the United States under Regulation S. The Notes were issued
pursuant to an indenture dated as of December 23, 2004, among the Company, the
subsidiary guarantors named therein and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association,
as trustee (the "Notes Indenture"). The Notes Indenture is filed as Exhibit 4.2
to this Form 8-K. The description of the terms of the Notes Indenture in this
Item 1.01 are qualified in their entirety by reference to such exhibit.

The Notes bear interest at the rate of 6 1/4% per annum which accrues from
December 23, 2004 and is payable semiannually in arrears on June 15 and December
15 of each year, commencing on June 15, 2005. The Notes mature on December 15,
2012, unless earlier redeemed or repurchased, and are subject to the terms and
conditions set forth in the Notes Indenture.

The Company may redeem some or all of the Notes for cash at any time on or after
December 15, 2008 at prices specified in the Notes Indenture. In addition, at
any time prior to December 15, 2007, the Company may redeem up to 35% of the
aggregate principal amount of the Notes at a redemption price of 106.25% of the
principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the date
of redemption, with the net cash proceeds of certain equity offerings. If the
Company sells certain of its assets or experiences specific kinds of changes in
control, it must offer to purchase the Notes.

The Notes are subordinated to all of the Company's existing and future senior
debt, rank equally with all of its existing and future senior subordinated debt
and rank senior to all of its future subordinated debt that is expressly
subordinated in right of payment to the Notes. The Notes are guaranteed on a
senior subordinated basis by the Company's wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries.
The Notes are effectively subordinated to all liabilities of the Company's
subsidiaries that do not issue guarantees of the Notes.

The Company will be subject to a number of financial and other covenants under
the Notes Indenture. The Company has agreed to file a registration statement
under the Securities Act to enable holders of the Notes to exchange their Notes
for registered notes having substantially the same terms.

C.  New Credit Facility
    -------------------

The Company entered into a Credit Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2004,
among the Company, as Borrower, the several lenders from time to time parties
thereto, and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent, J.P. Morgan
Securities Inc. and Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc., as joint lead arrangers and
joint bookrunners, and Bear Stearns Corporate Lending Inc., as syndication
agent (the "Credit Agreement"), and a related Guarantee and Collateral
Agreement, dated as of December 23, 2004, among the Company and each of the
Company's subsidiaries listed on the signature pages thereto in favor of
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., as administrative agent (the "Guarantee and
Collateral Agreement").

The Credit Agreement replaces the Amended and Restated Credit Agreement, dated
as of November 6, 2003, among the Company, the several lenders from time to time
parties thereto, Bear, Stearns & Co., Inc., as sole lead arranger and sole book
runner, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc. and Credit Suisse First Boston, as
co-arrangers and co-

<PAGE>

documentation agents, Bear Stearns Corporate Lending Inc., as syndication agent,
and The Bank of New York, as administrative agent (the "Old Credit Agreement").
All amounts outstanding under the Old Credit Agreement were paid by the Company
on December 23, 2004, which was earlier than the scheduled expiration dates of
September 20, 2006 for the revolving credit facility commitment period and
December 31, 2009 for the term loan facility. No early termination penalties
were incurred by the Company. The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement replaces
the Amended and Restated Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, dated as of
November 6, 2003, by the Company and each of the subsidiaries party thereto in
favor of The Bank of New York, as administrative agent.

The Credit Agreement provides for a new $250 million senior secured revolving
credit facility and a new $100 million senior secured term loan credit facility.
Under the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Company also has the ability,
subject to certain terms and conditions, to borrow additional amounts under an
incremental senior secured term loan credit facility for an aggregate amount of
up to $100 million for certain purposes. Amounts under the revolving credit
facility may be borrowed, repaid and reborrowed by the Company from time to time
until maturity. The Credit Agreement will terminate on December 23, 2009.
Voluntary prepayments and commitment reductions under the Credit Agreement are
permitted at any time without fee upon proper notice and subject to a minimum
dollar requirement.

At the Company's option, borrowings under the Credit Agreement are based on
either LIBOR or the higher of the prime rate of J.P. Morgan Chase Bank, N.A. or
the Federal Funds Effective Rate plus .50%. The interest rates under the Credit
Agreement vary depending upon the Company's consolidated leverage ratio. The
interest rate varies from 125 basis points to 200 basis points above LIBOR for
eurocurrency loans and 25 basis points to 100 basis points above the prime rate
or Federal Funds Effective Rate plus .50% for base rate loans.

During the term of the Credit Agreement, the Company will pay its lenders a fee
equal to the product of 0.50% per annum and the available portion of the
revolving credit facility.

The Company and its wholly-owned domestic subsidiaries have provided an
unconditional guarantee of the full and punctual payment of the Company's
obligations under the Credit Agreement as set forth in the Guarantee and
Collateral Agreement.

The Credit Agreement contains affirmative, negative and financial covenants
customary for financings of this type, including, among other things, limits on
the incurrence of liens, a limit on the ratio of debt to earnings before
interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization and a limit on the ratio
of earnings before interest, income taxes, depreciation, and amortization to
fixed charges. The Credit Agreement contains events of default customary for
facilities of this type (with customary grace periods, as applicable) and
provides that, upon the occurrence of an event of default, the interest rate on
all outstanding obligations will be increased and payment of all outstanding
loans may be accelerated and/or the lenders' commitments may be terminated. In
addition, upon the occurrence of certain insolvency or bankruptcy related events
of default, all amounts payable under the Credit Agreement shall automatically
become immediately due and payable, and the lenders' commitments will
automatically terminate.

As of December 23, 2004, the Company had borrowed $22 million under the
revolving credit facility and had borrowed $100 million under the term loan
facility.

Other than with respect to the transactions described in this Form 8-K, there is
no material relationship between the Company or its affiliates and any of the
parties to the Credit Agreement.

The foregoing does not constitute a complete summary of the terms of the Credit
Agreement and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, which are attached hereto
as Exhibits 10.1 and 10.2, respectively. The descriptions of the terms of the
Credit Agreement and the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement are qualified in
their entirety by reference to such exhibits.


Item 1.02  Termination of a Material Definitive Agreement.

The disclosure required by this item is included in Item 1.01 and is
incorporated herein by reference.

Item 2.03 Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

The disclosure required by this item is included in Item 1.01 and is
incorporated herein by reference.

<PAGE>

Item 3.02  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

The disclosure relating to the issuance of the Debentures required by this item
is included in Item 1.01 and is incorporated herein by reference.

As of December 23, 2004, the Company entered into convertible bond hedge and
warrant option transactions (the "Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions") with
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. ("JPM") and Bear Stearns International Limited ("Bear"
and each of JPM and Bear, a "Counterparty"), which are affiliates of the initial
purchasers of the Debentures. In connection with the Convertible Bond Hedge
Transactions, among other things, the Company entered into International Swaps
and Derivatives Association, Inc. (ISDA) confirmations, together with letter
agreement amendments thereto, with each Counterparty as of December 23, 2004
(collectively, the "Confirmations") for the issuance of warrants to purchase the
Company's Class A common stock. The Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions are
expected to reduce the potential dilution upon conversion of the Debentures. The
Convertible Bond Hedge Transactions are subject to early termination as
described in the Confirmations. The Confirmations are filed as Exhibits 4.3,
4.4, 4.5 and 4.6 to this Form 8-K. The description of the terms of the
Confirmations in this Item 3.02 are qualified in their entirety by reference to
such exhibits.

The warrants (the "Warrants") constituting part of the Convertible Bond Hedge
Transactions provide that subject to the terms and conditions of the
Confirmations relating to the warrant transactions, the Company will issue
shares of its Class A common stock to the Counterparty or its assigns upon
exercise of the Warrants as described in the applicable Confirmation. The
aggregate number of Warrants issued pursuant to the Convertible Bond Hedge
Transactions to JPM was 4,725,085 and to Bear was 4,725,086. Such Warrants
become exercisable ratably over a sixty (60) business day period commencing on
June 1, 2010 subject to the terms and conditions of the applicable Confirmation.
Each Warrant is exercisable only on its expiration date at which time it is
deemed automatically exercised under the Confirmation. The Warrants provide for
net share settlement upon exercise such that each Warrant is exercisable for
that number of shares of Class A common stock as determined on the exercise date
equal to a fraction the numerator of which is, if positive, the difference
between the official closing price per share of Class A common stock quoted on
the NASDAQ National Market System (the "Settlement Price") less USD 37.248 (the
"Strike Price"), and the denominator of which is the Settlement Price. If the
Settlement Price on the exercise date of a Warrant is less than the Strike
Price, then no shares of Class A common stock are issuable upon exercise of the
Warrant. Since the number of shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the
exercise of the Warrants is dependent upon the Settlement Price on the exercise
date of the Warrant, it is not possible at this time to ascertain the number of
shares of Class A common stock issuable upon the exercise of the Warrants. The
aggregate premium received by the Company in cash in respect of the issuance of
the Warrants by the Company was $18,964,956.32 from each Counterparty. The
Warrants were issued to JPM and Bear pursuant to the exemption from registration
set forth in Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

                  Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as Trustee (the

            Each party agrees as follows for the benefit of the other parties
and for the equal and ratable benefit of the Holders of the Company's Initial
Securities and Exchange Securities (each as defined in Appendix A hereto, and
collectively, the "Securities").

                   Definitions and Incorporation by Reference
                   ------------------------------------------

            SECTION 1.01. Definitions.

            "Acquired Indebtedness" means Indebtedness of a Person or any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries existing at the time such Person becomes a Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company or at the time it merges or consolidates with the
Company or any of its Subsidiaries or is assumed in connection with the
acquisition of assets from such Person and not incurred by such Person in
connection with, or in anticipation or contemplation of, such Person becoming a
Restricted Subsidiary of the Company or such acquisition, merger or
consolidation.

            "Additional Securities" means Securities issued under this Indenture
after the Issue Date and in compliance with Sections 2.15 and 4.04, it being
understood that any Securities issued in exchange for or replacement of any
Initial Security issued on the Issue Date shall not be an Additional Security,
including any such Securities issued pursuant to a Registration Rights
Agreement.

            "Affiliate" means, with respect to any Person, any Person who
directly or indirectly through one or more intermediaries controls, or is
controlled by, or is under common control with, such Person; provided, however,
that with respect to the Company the term Affiliate shall not include the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company so long as no Affiliate of the Company
has any direct or indirect interest therein, except through the Company or its
Subsidiaries. The term "control" means the possession, directly or indirectly,
of the power to direct or cause the direction of the management and policies of
a Person, whether through the ownership of voting securities, by contract or
otherwise.

      Company,

<PAGE>

      or shall be merged with or into the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
      of the Company; or

            (b) the acquisition by the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of
      the Company of the assets of any Person which constitute all or
      substantially all of the assets of such Person, any division or line of
      business of such Person or any other properties or assets of such Person
      other than in the ordinary course of business.

            "Asset Sale" means any direct or indirect sale, conveyance,
transfer, lease (other than operating leases entered into in the ordinary course
of business), assignment or other transfer for value by the Company or any of
its Restricted Subsidiaries, including any Sale and Leaseback Transaction that
does not give rise to a Capitalized Lease Obligation, to any Person other than

            (a) any Capital Stock of any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company;
      or

            (b) any other property or assets, other than cash or Cash

      Transaction Date may optionally be determined at an interest rate based
      upon a factor of a prime or similar rate, a eurocurrency interbank offered

                                   ARTICLE 2

                                 The Securities
                                 --------------

            SECTION 2.01. Form and Dating. Provisions relating to the Initial
Securities and the Exchange Securities are set forth in Appendix A hereto which
is hereby incorporated in, and expressly made part of, this Indenture. The
Initial Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication thereof shall
be substantially in the form of Exhibit 1 to Appendix A hereto, which is hereby
incorporated in, and expressly made a part of, this Indenture. The Exchange
Securities and the Trustee's certificate of authentication thereof shall be
substantially in the form of Exhibit 2 to Appendix A hereto, which is hereby
incorporated in and expressly made a part of this Indenture. The Securities may
have notations, legends or endorsements required by law, stock exchange rule or
usage. The Company and the Trustee shall approve the form of the Securities and
any notation, legend or endorsement on them. Each Security shall be dated the
date of its authentication and shall show the date of its issuance. The terms of
the Securities set forth in Appendix A and the exhibits thereto are part of the
terms of this Indenture.

            SECTION 2.02. Execution and Authentication. An Officer shall sign
the Securities for the Company by manual or facsimile signature.

            If an Officer whose signature is on a Security was an Officer at the
time of such execution but no longer holds that or any office at the time the
Trustee authenticates the Security, the Security shall be valid nevertheless.

            A Security shall not be valid until an authorized signatory of the
Trustee manually signs the certificate of authentication on the Security. The
signature shall be conclusive evidence that the Security has been authenticated
under this Indenture.

            The Trustee shall authenticate Securities for original issue on the
Issue Date in the aggregate principal amount of $200,000,000 and, at any time
and from time to time thereafter, the Trustee shall authenticate Securities for
original issue in an aggregate principal amount specified in a written order of
the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate. The Officers' Certificate
shall specify the amount of Securities to be authenticated and the date on which
the Securities are to be authenticated and, in the case of an issuance of
Additional Securities pursuant to Section 2.15 after the Issue Date, shall
certify that such issuance is in compliance with Section 4.04. Upon receipt of a
written order of the Company in the form of an Officers' Certificate, the
Trustee shall authenticate Securities in substitution for Securities originally
issued to reflect any name change of the Company. The Trustee may appoint an
authenticating agent reasonably acceptable to the Company to authenticate
Securities. Unless otherwise provided in the appointment, an authenticating
agent may authenticate Securities whenever the Trustee may do so. Each reference
in this Indenture to authentication by the Trustee includes authentication by
such agent. An authenticating agent has the same rights as an Agent to deal with
the Company and Affiliates of the Company.

            The Securities shall be issuable only in registered form without
coupons in denominations of $1,000 and any integral multiple thereof.


                                       26

            SECTION 2.03. Registrar and Paying Agent. The Company shall maintain
an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, where (a)
Securities may be presented or surrendered for registration of transfer or for
exchange (the "Registrar"), (b) Securities may be presented or surrendered for
payment (the "Paying Agent") and (c) notices and demands in respect of the
Securities and this Indenture may be served. The Registrar shall keep a register
of the Securities and of their transfer and exchange. The Company, upon notice
to the Trustee, may have one or more additional Paying Agents reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee. The term "Paying Agent" includes any additional
Paying Agent.

            The Company shall enter into an appropriate agency agreement with
any Agent not a party to this Indenture, which agreement shall incorporate the
provisions of the TIA and implement the provisions of this Indenture that relate
to such Agent. The Company shall notify the Trustee of the name and address of
any such Agent. If the Company fails to maintain a Registrar or Paying Agent, or
fails to give the foregoing notice, the Trustee shall act as such. The Company
or any Subsidiary of the Company incorporated or organized within The United
States of America may act as Agent.

            The Company initially appoints the Trustee as Registrar, Paying
Agent and agent for service of demands and notices in connection with the
Securities, until such time as the Trustee has resigned or a successor has been
appointed. The Paying Agent or Registrar may resign upon 45 days notice to the
Company.

            SECTION 2.04. Paying Agent to Hold Assets in Trust. The Company
shall require each Paying Agent other than the Trustee to agree in writing that
each Paying Agent shall hold in trust for the benefit of Holders or the Trustee
all assets held by the Paying Agent for the payment of principal of, or interest
on, the Securities (whether such assets have been distributed to it by the
Company or any other obligor on the Securities), and shall notify the Trustee of
any Default by the Company (or any other obligor on the Securities) in making
any such payment. If the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company acts as Paying
Agent, it shall segregate the money and hold it in a separate trust. The Company
at any time may require a Paying Agent to distribute all assets held by it to
the Trustee and account for any assets disbursed and the Trustee may at any time
during the continuance of any payment Default, upon written request to a Paying
Agent, require such Paying Agent to distribute all assets held by it to the
Trustee and to account for any assets distributed. Upon distribution to the
Trustee of all assets that shall have been delivered by the Company to the
Paying Agent, the Paying Agent shall have no further liability for such assets.

            SECTION 2.05. Securityholder Lists. The Trustee shall preserve in as
current a form as is reasonably practicable the most recent list available to it
of the names and addresses of Holders and otherwise comply with TIA ss.312(a).
If the Trustee is not the Registrar, the Company shall furnish or cause the
Registrar to furnish to the Trustee by each Record Date and at such other times
as the Trustee may reasonably request in writing a list as of such date and in
such form as the Trustee may reasonably require of the names and addresses of
Holders, which list (subject to Section 7.01 hereof) may be conclusively relied
upon by the Trustee.


                                       27
<PAGE>

            SECTION 2.06. Transfer and Exchange. The Securities shall be issued
in registered form and shall be transferable only upon the surrender of a
Security for registration of transfer. When a Security is presented to the
Registrar with a request to register a transfer, the Registrar shall register
the transfer as requested if the requirements of this Indenture (including
Appendix A hereto) and Section 8-401(1) of the Uniform Commercial Code are met.
When Securities are presented to the Registrar with a request to exchange them
for an equal principal amount of Securities of other denominations, the
Registrar shall make the exchange as requested if the same requirements are met.

            SECTION 2.07. Replacement Securities. If a mutilated Security is
surrendered to the Trustee or if the Holder of a Security claims that the
Security has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, the Company shall issue
and the Trustee shall authenticate a replacement Security if the Trustee's and
Company's requirements are met. If required by the Trustee or the Company, such
Holder shall provide an indemnity bond or other indemnity, sufficient in the
judgment of both the Company and the Trustee, to protect the Company, the
Guarantors, the Trustee and any Agent from any loss which any of them may suffer
if a Security is replaced. The Company may charge such Holder for its reasonable
out-of-pocket expenses in replacing a Security, including reasonable fees and
expenses of counsel. Every replacement Security shall constitute an additional
obligation of the Company and every replacement Guarantee shall constitute an
additional obligation of the Guarantors.

            SECTION 2.08. Outstanding Securities. Securities outstanding at any
time are all the Securities that have been authenticated by the Trustee except
those cancelled by it, those delivered to it for cancellation and those
described in this Section as not outstanding. Subject to Section 2.09, a
Security does not cease to be outstanding because the Company or any of its
Affiliates holds the Security.

            If a Security is replaced pursuant to Section 2.07 (other than a
mutilated Security surrendered for replacement), it ceases to be outstanding
unless the Trustee receives proof satisfactory to it that the replaced Security
is held by a bona fide purchaser. A mutilated Security ceases to be outstanding
upon surrender of such Security and replacement thereof pursuant to Section
2.07.

            If on a Redemption Date or the Final Maturity Date the Paying Agent
holds (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company acts as Paying Agent,
segregates and holds in trust) in accordance with the terms of this Indenture
U.S. Legal Tender sufficient to pay all of the principal and interest due on the
Securities payable on that date, and the Paying Agent is not prohibited from
paying such money to the Holders on that date pursuant to the terms of this
Indenture, then on and after that date such Securities cease to be outstanding
and interest on them ceases to accrue.

            SECTION 2.09. Treasury Securities. In determining whether the
Holders of the required principal amount of Securities have concurred in any
direction, waiver or consent, Securities owned by the Company or any of its
Affiliates shall be disregarded, except that, for the purposes of determining
whether the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, waiver
or consent, only Securities that the Trustee has received notice are so owned
shall be disregarded.


                                       28
<PAGE>

            The Trustee may require an Officers' Certificate listing Securities
owned by the Company or its Affiliates.

            SECTION 2.10. Temporary Securities. Until definitive Securities are
ready for delivery, the Company may prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate
temporary Securities upon receipt of a written order of the Company in the form
of an Officers' Certificate. The Officers' Certificate shall specify the amount
of temporary Securities to be authenticated and the date on which the temporary
Securities are to be authenticated. Temporary Securities shall be substantially
in the form of definitive Securities but may have variations that the Company
considers appropriate for temporary Securities. Without unreasonable delay, the
Company shall prepare and the Trustee shall authenticate upon receipt of a
written order of the Company pursuant to Section 2.02 definitive Securities in
exchange for temporary Securities.

            SECTION 2.11. Cancellation. The Company at any time may deliver
Securities to the Trustee for cancellation. The Registrar and the Paying Agent
shall forward to the Trustee any Securities surrendered to them for transfer,
exchange or payment. The Trustee, or at the direction of the Trustee, the
Registrar or the Paying Agent, and no one else, shall cancel and dispose of all
Securities surrendered for transfer, exchange, payment or cancellation, in
accordance with its customary practices. Subject to Section 2.07, the Company
may not issue new Securities to replace Securities that it has paid or delivered
to the Trustee for cancellation. If the Company shall acquire any of the
Securities, such acquisition shall not operate as a redemption or satisfaction
of the Indebtedness represented by such Securities unless and until the same are
surrendered to the Trustee for cancellation pursuant to this Section 2.11.

            SECTION 2.12. Defaulted Interest. The Company will pay interest on
overdue principal from time to time on demand at the rate of interest then borne
by the Securities. The Company shall, to the extent lawful, pay interest on
overdue installments of interest (without regard to any applicable grace
periods) from time to time on demand at the rate of interest then borne by the
Securities. Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised
of twelve 30-day months.

            If the Company defaults in a payment of interest on the Securities,
it shall pay the defaulted interest, plus (to the extent lawful) any interest
payable on the defaulted interest, to the Persons who are Holders on a
subsequent special record date, which date shall be the fifteenth day next
preceding the date fixed by the Company for the payment of defaulted interest.
At least 15 days before the subsequent special record date, the Company shall
mail to each Holder, with a copy to the Trustee (or cause the Trustee to mail) a
notice that states the subsequent special record date, the payment date and the
amount of defaulted interest, and interest payable on such defaulted interest,
if any, to be paid.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, any interest which is paid prior to
the expiration of the 30-day period set forth in Section 6.01(a) shall be paid
to Holders as of the regular Record Date for the Interest Payment Date for which
interest has not been paid.


                                       29

<PAGE>

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may make payment of
defaulted interest in any other lawful manner not inconsistent with the
requirements of any securities exchange on which the Securities may be listed.

            SECTION 2.13. CUSIP Number. The Company in issuing the Securities
may use one or more "CUSIP" numbers, and if so, the Trustee shall use the CUSIP
numbers in notices of redemption or exchange as a convenience to Holders;
provided, however, that no representation is hereby deemed to be made as to the
correctness or accuracy of the CUSIP numbers printed in the notice or on the
Securities, and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification
numbers printed on the Securities. The Company shall promptly notify the Trustee
of any change in the CUSIP number.

            SECTION 2.14. Deposit of Moneys. Prior to 10:00 a.m. New York City
time on each Interest Payment Date and the Final Maturity Date, the Company
shall have deposited with the Paying Agent in immediately available funds U.S.
Legal Tender sufficient to make cash payments, if any, due on such Interest
Payment Date or Final Maturity Date, as the case may be, in a timely manner
which permits the Paying Agent to remit payment to the Holders on such Interest
Payment Date or Final Maturity Date, as the case may be.

            SECTION 2.15. Issuance of Additional Securities. After the Issue
Date, the Company shall be entitled, subject to its compliance with Section
4.04, to issue Additional Securities under this Indenture in an unlimited
aggregate principal amount, which Securities shall have identical terms as the
Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date, other than with respect to the date
of issuance and issue price. The Initial Securities issued on the Issue Date,
any Additional Securities and all Exchange Securities issued in exchange
therefor shall be treated as a single class for all purposes under this
Indenture, including waivers, amendments, redemptions and offers to purchase.

            With respect to any Additional Securities, the Company shall set
forth in a Board Resolution of the Board of Directors of the Company and an
Officers' Certificate, a copy of each which shall be delivered to the Trustee,

            (1) the aggregate principal amount of such Additional Securities to
      be authenticated and delivered pursuant to this Indenture and the
      provision of Section 4.04 that the Company is relying on to issue such
      Additional Securities;

            (2) the issue price, the issue date and the CUSIP number of such
      Additional Securities; provided, however, that Additional Securities may
      be issued only if they are fungible with the other Securities issued under
      this Indenture for United States federal income tax purposes; and

            (3) whether such Additional Securities shall be Initial Securities
      or shall be issued in the form of Exchange Securities as set forth in

                                   Redemption
                                   ----------

            SECTION 3.01. Notices to Trustee. If the Company elects to redeem
Securities pursuant to the optional redemption provisions of Paragraph 5 or
Paragraph 6 of the Securities, it shall notify the Trustee in writing of the
Redemption Date, the Redemption Price and the principal amount of Securities to
be redeemed. The Company shall give notice of redemption to the Paying Agent and
Trustee at least 45 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date
(unless a shorter notice shall be satisfactory to the Trustee), together with an
Officers' Certificate stating that such redemption will comply with the
conditions contained herein. Any such notice may be cancelled at any time prior
to notice of such redemption being mailed to any Holder and shall thereby be
void and of no effect.

            SECTION 3.02. Selection of Securities to be Redeemed. In the event
that less than all of the Securities are to be redeemed at any time pursuant to
the optional redemption provisions of Paragraph 5 or Paragraph 6 of the
Securities, selection of such Securities for redemption will be made by the
Trustee by lot, pro rata or in such manner as the Trustee shall deem appropriate
and fair and in such manner as complies with any applicable requirements of the
principal national securities exchange, if any, on which the Securities are
listed and in such manner as complies with applicable law; provided, however,
that if a partial redemption is made with the proceeds of an Equity Offering
pursuant to Paragraph 6 of the Securities, selection of the Securities or
portions thereof for redemption shall be made by the Trustee only on a pro rata
basis (subject to the procedures of the Depositary (as defined in Appendix A
hereto)), unless such method is otherwise prohibited.

            The Trustee shall make the selection from the Securities outstanding
and not previously called for redemption and shall promptly notify the Company
in writing of the Securities selected for redemption and, in the case of any
Security selected for partial redemption, the principal amount thereof to be
redeemed. Securities in denominations of $1,000 or less may be redeemed only in
whole. The Trustee may select for redemption portions (equal to $1,000 or any
integral multiple thereof) of the principal amount of Securities that have
denominations larger than $1,000. Provisions of this Indenture that apply to
Securities called for redemption also apply to portions of Securities called for
redemption.

            SECTION 3.03. Notice of Optional Redemption. In the case of an
optional redemption pursuant to the provisions of Paragraph 5 or Paragraph 6 of
the Securities, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before a Redemption
Date, the Company shall mail a notice of redemption by first class mail, postage
prepaid, to each Holder whose Securities are to be redeemed at its registered
address. At the Company's request, the Trustee shall give the notice of
redemption in the Company's name and at the Company's expense. Each notice for
redemption shall identify the Securities to be redeemed (including the CUSIP
number(s), if any) and shall state:

            (1) the Redemption Date;


                                       31
<PAGE>

            (2) the Redemption Price and the amount of accrued interest, if any,
      to be paid;

            (3) the name and address of the Paying Agent;

            (4) that Securities called for redemption must be surrendered to the
      Paying Agent to collect the Redemption Price plus accrued interest, if
      any;

            (5) that, unless the Company defaults in making the redemption
      payment or the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such payment
      pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, interest on Securities called for
      redemption ceases to accrue on and after the Redemption Date, and the only
      remaining right of the Holders of such Securities is to receive payment of
      the Redemption Price upon surrender to the Paying Agent of the Securities
      redeemed;

            (6) if any Security is being redeemed in part, the portion of the
      principal amount of such Security to be redeemed and that, after the
      Redemption Date, and upon surrender of such Security, a new Security or
      Securities in aggregate principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion
      thereof will be issued upon surrender of the original Security;

            (7) if fewer than all the Securities are to be redeemed, the
      identification of the particular Securities (or portion thereof) to be
      redeemed, as well as the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be
      redeemed and the aggregate principal amount of Securities to be
      outstanding after such partial redemption; and

            (8) the paragraph of the Securities pursuant to which the Securities
      are to be redeemed.

            SECTION 3.04. Effect of Notice of Redemption. Once notice of
redemption is mailed in accordance with Section 3.03, Securities called for
redemption become due and payable on the Redemption Date and at the Redemption
Price plus accrued interest, if any. Upon surrender to the Trustee or Paying
Agent, such Securities called for redemption shall be paid at the Redemption
Price (which shall include accrued interest thereon to the Redemption Date), but
installments of interest, the maturity of which is on or prior to the Redemption
Date, shall be payable to Holders of record at the close of business on the
relevant Record Dates.

            SECTION 3.05. Deposit of Redemption Price. On or before 11:00 a.m.
New York Time on the Redemption Date, the Company shall deposit with the Paying
Agent (or, if the Company or a Subsidiary is the Paying Agent, shall segregate
and hold in trust) U.S. Legal Tender sufficient to pay the Redemption Price plus
accrued interest, if any, of all Securities to be redeemed on that date (other
than Securities or portions thereof called for redemption on that date which
have been delivered by the Company to the Trustee for cancellation). The Paying
Agent or Trustee shall promptly return to the Company any U.S. Legal Tender so
deposited which is not required for that purpose.


                                       32
<PAGE>

            If the Company complies with the preceding paragraph, then, unless
the Company defaults in the payment when due of such Redemption Price plus
accrued interest, if any, or the Paying Agent is prohibited from making such
payment pursuant to the terms of this Indenture, interest on the Securities to
be redeemed will cease to accrue on and after the applicable Redemption Date,
whether or not such Securities are presented for payment.

            SECTION 3.06. Securities Redeemed in Part. Upon surrender and
cancellation of a Security that is to be redeemed in part only, the Trustee
shall authenticate for the Holder a new Security or Securities in a principal
amount equal to the unredeemed portion of the Security surrendered.

                                   ARTICLE 4

                                    Covenants
                                    ---------

            SECTION 4.01. Payment of Securities. The Company will pay the
principal of and interest on the Securities in the manner provided in the
Securities and in this Indenture. An installment of principal of or interest on
the Securities shall be considered paid on the date it is due if the Trustee or
Paying Agent (other than the Company or a Subsidiary of the Company) holds on
that date U.S. Legal Tender designated for and sufficient to pay the installment
in full and is not prohibited from paying such money to the Holders pursuant to
the terms of this Indenture. Interest, including defaulted interest, if any,
will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day
months and in the case of a partial month, the actual number of days elapsed.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Indenture, the Company may, to the extent it is required to do so by law, deduct
or withhold income or other similar taxes imposed by the United States of
America from principal or interest payments hereunder.

            SECTION 4.02. Maintenance of Office or Agency. The Company will
maintain in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York, the office or agency
required under Section 2.03. The Company shall give prompt written notice to the
Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or
agency. If at any time the Company shall fail to maintain any such required
office or agency or shall fail to furnish the Trustee with the address thereof,
such presentations, surrenders, notices and demands may be made or served at the
address of the Trustee set forth in Section 13.02. The Company hereby initially
designates the office or agency of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan, The
City of New York (the address for which may be obtained from the Company or the
Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office) where presentations and surrenders may be
made and notices or demands may be served on the Company.

            SECTION 4.03. Limitation on Restricted Payments. The Company will
not, and will not cause or permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly,

            (a) declare or pay any dividend or make any distribution (other than
dividends or distributions payable in Qualified Capital Stock of the Company or

acquire Qualified Capital Stock of the Company) on or in respect of shares of
the Company's Capital Stock to holders of such Capital Stock;

            (b) purchase, redeem or otherwise acquire or retire for value any
Capital Stock of the Company or any warrants, rights or options (other than debt
securities or Disqualified Capital Stock) to purchase or acquire shares of any

            (c) make any Restricted Investment (other than Permitted
Investments)

referred to as a "Restricted Payment"), if at the time of such Restricted
Payment or immediately after giving effect thereto,

            (1) a Default or an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
      continuing;

            (2) the Company is not able to incur at least $1.00 of additional
      Indebtedness (other than Permitted Indebtedness) in compliance with
      Section 4.04; or

            (3) the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made subsequent to
      the Issue Date (without duplication and excluding Restricted Payments
      permitted by clauses (2)(a), (4) and (5) of the following paragraph) shall
      exceed the sum of:

                  (w) 50% of the cumulative Consolidated Net Income, or if
            cumulative Consolidated Net Income shall be a loss, minus 100% of
            such loss, of the Company earned subsequent to September 30, 2004
            and on or prior to the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter
            for which internal financial statements are available treating such
            period as a single accounting period; plus

            Restricted Subsidiary is reduced on the Company's consolidated
            balance sheet upon the conversion or exchange (other than by a
            Subsidiary of the Company) subsequent to the Issue Date of any
            Indebtedness of the Company or a

            Restricted Subsidiary convertible or exchangeable for Qualified
            Capital Stock of the Company (less the amount of any cash, or the
            fair value of any other property, distributed by the Company upon

            paragraph):

                        (i) any disposition of any such Restricted Investments
                  sold or otherwise liquidated or repaid, to the extent of the
                  net cash proceeds received by the Company or a Restricted
                  Subsidiary;

                        (ii) cash dividends or repayments of loans or advances
                  in cash to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or, to the
                  extent that a guarantee issued by the Company or a Restricted
                  Subsidiary constitutes a Restricted Investment, the release of
                  such guarantee; or

                        (iii) a Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, to the
                  extent of the Company's portion (proportionate to the
                  Company's equity interest in such Person) of the fair market
                  value of the net assets of such Person;

provided, that in no event shall the net reduction in Restricted Investments
attributable to any particular Restricted Investment exceed the amount of such
Restricted Investment on the date originally made; provided, further, that any
net reduction in Restricted Investments pursuant to this clause (z) shall only
be included in the calculation required by clause (3) above to the extent that
such net reduction in Restricted Investments is not included in the Company's
Consolidated Net Income.

immediately preceding paragraph shall not prohibit

      any securities within 60 days after the date of declaration of such
      dividend or distribution or the giving of formal notice by the Company of
      such redemption, if the dividend or distribution would have been permitted
      on the date of declaration or the redemption would have been permitted on
      the date of the giving of the formal notice thereof;

            (2) so long as no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred

            warrants, rights or options (other than debt securities or
            Disqualified Capital Stock) to acquire Qualified Capital Stock; or

            cash (other than to a Subsidiary of the Company) of shares of
            Qualified Capital Stock and/or warrants, rights or options (other
            than debt securities or Disqualified Capital Stock) to acquire

      Payment made pursuant to this clause (3) is in the form of a Restricted
      Investment, the net reduction of such Restricted Investments as a result

            to the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary or, to the extent that a
            guarantee issued by the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary

            or

                  (c) a Person becoming a Restricted Subsidiary, to the extent
            of the Company's portion (proportionate to the Company's equity
            interest in such Person) of the fair market value of the net assets
            of such Person;

      provided that in no event shall the net reduction in Restricted
      Investments attributable to any particular Restricted Investment exceed
      the amount of such Restricted Investment on the date originally made;
      provided, further, that any net reduction in Restricted Investments
      pursuant to this clause (3) shall only be included in the calculation
      required by this clause (3) to the extent that such net reduction in
      Restricted Investments is not included in the Company's Consolidated Net
      Income;

            (4) the repurchase of any Capital Stock of the Company or any
      warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire shares of any such

      acquire Qualified Capital Stock or other similar arrangements to acquire
      Qualified Capital Stock if such repurchased Capital Stock or warrants,
      rights or options to acquire shares of any such Capital Stock represent a
      portion of the exercise price thereof and applicable withholding taxes, if
      any; and

            (5) the entrance into and making of any payments pursuant to the
      Convertible Debentures Hedge and Warrant Option Transactions.

            In determining the aggregate amount of Restricted Payments made
subsequent to the Issue Date in accordance with clause (3) of the immediately
preceding paragraph,

                                       36
<PAGE>

amounts expended (to the extent such expenditure is in the form of cash)
pursuant to clauses (1), (2)(b) and (3) of this paragraph shall be included in
such calculation.

            SECTION 4.04. Limitation on Incurrence of Additional Indebtedness.
The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
incur any Indebtedness, other than Permitted Indebtedness; provided, however,
that if no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing at
the time or as a consequence of the incurrence of any such Indebtedness, the
Company or any Guarantor may incur Indebtedness if on the date of the incurrence
of such Indebtedness, after giving effect to the incurrence thereof, the
Consolidated Fixed Charge Coverage Ratio of the Company is equal to or greater
than 2.0 to 1.0.

            Neither the Company nor any Guarantor will, directly or indirectly,
in any event incur any Indebtedness which, by its terms or by the terms of any
agreement governing such Indebtedness, is both subordinated pursuant to its
terms in right of payment to any other Indebtedness of the Company or such
Guarantor, as the case may be, and senior in right of payment to the Securities
or any such Guarantor's Guarantee, as the case may be.

            SECTION 4.05. Corporate Existence. Except as otherwise permitted by
Article Five, the Company shall do or cause to be done, at its own cost and
expense, all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and effect its
corporate existence and the corporate, partnership or other existence of each of
its Subsidiaries in accordance with the respective organizational documents of
the Company or the Subsidiary, as the case may be, and the rights (charter and
statutory) and material franchises of the Company and each of its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to preserve any such
right or franchise, or the corporate existence of any Subsidiary, if the Board
of Directors of the Company shall determine that the preservation thereof is no
longer desirable in the conduct of the business of the Company and each of its
Subsidiaries, taken as a whole.

            SECTION 4.06. Payment of Taxes and Other Claims. The Company will
pay or discharge or cause to be paid or discharged, before the same shall become
delinquent, (a) all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges levied
or imposed upon it or any of its Subsidiaries or upon the income, profits or
property of it or any of its Subsidiaries and (b) all lawful claims for labor,
materials and supplies which, in each case, if unpaid, might by law become a
material liability or Lien upon the property of it or any of its Subsidiaries;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay or discharge or
cause to be paid or discharged any such tax, assessment, charge or claim the
amount, applicability or validity of which is being contested in good faith by
appropriate proceedings and for which adequate provision has been made or for
which adequate reserves, to the extent required under GAAP, have been
established or where the failure to effect such payment or discharge is not
adverse in any material respect to the Holders.

            SECTION 4.07. Maintenance of Properties and Insurance. (a) The
Company shall cause all material properties owned by or leased by it or any of
its Subsidiaries used or useful to the conduct of its business or the business
of any of its Subsidiaries to be maintained and kept in normal condition, repair
and working order and supplied with all necessary equipment and shall cause to
be made all necessary repairs, renewals and

                                       37
<PAGE>

replacements thereof, all as in its judgment may be reasonably necessary, so
that the business carried on in connection therewith may be properly conducted
at all times; provided, however, that nothing in this Section 4.07 shall prevent
the Company or any of its Subsidiaries from discontinuing the use, operation or
maintenance of any of such properties, or disposing of any of them, if such
properties are, in the reasonable and good faith judgment of the Board of
Directors of the Company or such Subsidiary, as the case may be, no longer
reasonably necessary in the conduct of their respective businesses or such
disposition is otherwise permitted by this Indenture.

            (b) The Company shall provide or cause to be provided, for itself
and each of its Subsidiaries, insurance (including appropriate self-insurance)
against loss or damage of the kinds that, in the reasonable, good faith judgment
of the Board of Directors of the Company, are adequate and appropriate for the
conduct of the business of the Company and such Subsidiaries in a prudent
manner, with reputable insurers or with the government of the United States of
America or an agency or instrumentality thereof, in such amounts, with such
deductibles and by such methods as shall be customary, in the good faith
judgment of the Board of Directors of the Company, for companies similarly
situated in the industry.

            SECTION 4.08. Compliance Certificate; Notice of Default. (a) The
Company shall deliver to the Trustee, within 90 days after the end of each of
the Company's fiscal years, an Officers' Certificate (signed by the principal
executive officer, principal financial officer and principal accounting officer)
stating that a review of its activities and the activities of its Subsidiaries
during the preceding fiscal year has been made under the supervision of the
signing officers with a view to determining whether it has kept, observed,
performed and fulfilled its Obligations under this Indenture and further
stating, as to each such officer signing such certificate, that to the best of
his knowledge the Company during such preceding fiscal year has kept, observed,
performed and fulfilled each and every such Obligation and no Default or Event
of Default has occurred during such year and at the date of such certificate
there is no Default or Event of Default that has occurred and is continuing or,
if such signers do know of such Default or Event of Default, the certificate
shall describe the Default or Event of Default and its status in reasonable
detail. The Officers' Certificate shall also notify the Trustee should the
Company elect to change the manner in which it fixes its fiscal year end.

            (b) The annual financial statements delivered to the Trustee
pursuant to Section 4.10 shall be accompanied by a written report of the
Company's independent accountants that in conducting their audit of the
financial statements which are a part of such annual report or such annual
financial statements nothing has come to their attention that would lead them to
believe that the Company has violated any provisions of Article Four, Five or
Six insofar as they relate to accounting matters or, if any such violation has
occurred, specifying the nature and period of existence thereof, it being
understood that such accountants shall not be liable directly or indirectly to
any Person for any failure to obtain knowledge of any such violation.

            (c) So long as any of the Securities are outstanding, if any Default
or Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Trustee by registered or certified mail or by telegram, telex or
facsimile transmission an Officers'

                                       38
<PAGE>

Certificate specifying such event, notice or other action within 30 Business
Days of its becoming aware of such occurrence.

            SECTION 4.09. Compliance with Laws. The Company will comply, and
will cause each of its Subsidiaries to comply, with all applicable statutes,
rules, regulations, orders and restrictions of the United States, all states and
municipalities thereof, and of any governmental department, commission, board,
regulatory authority, bureau, agency and instrumentality of the foregoing, in
respect of the conduct of their respective businesses and the ownership of their
respective properties, except for such noncompliances as are being contested in
good faith and by appropriate proceedings and except for such noncompliances as
would not in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on the financial
condition or results of operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries taken as
a whole.

            SECTION 4.10. Commission Reports. (a) The Company promptly will
deliver to the Trustee, but in any event no later than 15 days after it files
with the Commission, copies of the quarterly and annual reports and of the
information, documents and other reports, if any, which the Company is required
to file with the Commission pursuant to Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act.
Notwithstanding that the Company may not be required to remain subject to the
reporting requirements of Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, the Company
will file with the Commission all information, documents and reports required to
be filed with the Commission to the extent permitted, and provide the Trustee
and the Holders with such annual reports and such information, documents and
other reports specified in Sections 13 and 15(d) of the Exchange Act. The
Company shall also comply with the other provisions of TIA ss. 314(a).

            (b) Regardless of whether the Company is required to furnish such
reports to its stockholders pursuant to the Exchange Act, the Company (at its
own expense) shall cause its consolidated financial statements, comparable to
those which would have been required to appear in annual or quarterly reports,
to be delivered to the Trustee and the Holders.

            (c) For so long as any of the Securities remain outstanding, the
Company will make available to any prospective purchaser of the Securities or
beneficial owner of the Securities in connection with any sale thereof the
information required by Rule 144A(d)(4) under the Securities Act during any
period when the Company is not subject to Section 13 or 15(d) under the Exchange
Act.

            (d) Delivery of such reports, information and documents to the
Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's receipt of such
shall not constitute constructive notice of any information contained therein or
determinable from information contained therein, including the Company's
compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the Trustee is
entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).

            SECTION 4.11. Waiver of Stay, Extension or Usury Laws. The Company
covenants (to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it will not at any
time insist upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit
or advantage of, any stay or extension law or any usury law or other law that
would prohibit or forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the
principal of and/or interest on the Securities as contemplated

                                       39
<PAGE>

herein, wherever enacted, now or at any time hereafter in force, or which may
affect the covenants or the performance of this Indenture, and (to the extent
that it may lawfully do so) the Company hereby expressly waives all benefit or
advantage of any such law, and covenants that it will not hinder, delay or
impede the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer
and permit the execution of every such power as though no such law had been
enacted.

            SECTION 4.12. Limitations on Transactions with Affiliates. The
Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to,
directly or indirectly, enter into or permit to exist any transaction or series
of related transactions with any of its Affiliates (an "Affiliate Transaction"),
other than

            (x) Affiliate Transactions permitted under the next paragraph; and

            (y) Affiliate Transactions on terms that are no less favorable to
      the Company or such Restricted Subsidiary than those that might reasonably
      have been obtained in a comparable transaction at such time on an
      arm's-length basis from a Person that is not an Affiliate;

provided, however, that for a transaction or series of related transactions
with an aggregate value of $5.0 million or more

            (1) such determination shall be made in good faith by a majority of
      the disinterested members of the Board of the Directors of the Company; or

            (2) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have received an
      opinion from an independent nationally recognized investment banking,
      accounting or valuation firm, selected by the Company, that such
      transaction or series of related transactions is on terms which are fair,
      from a financial point of view, to the Company or such Restricted
      Subsidiary;

and provided, further, that for a transaction or series of related
transactions with an aggregate value of $20.0 million or more,

            (1) such determination shall be made in good faith by a majority of
      the disinterested members of the Board of Directors of the Company; and

            (2) the Board of Directors of the Company shall have received an
      opinion from an independent nationally recognized investment banking,
      accounting or valuation firm, selected by the Company, that such
      transaction or series of related transactions is on terms which are fair,
      from a financial point of view, to the Company or such Restricted
      Subsidiary.

            The foregoing restrictions shall not apply to

            (1) reasonable fees and compensation paid to, and indemnity provided
      on behalf of, officers, directors, employees or consultants of the Company
      or any

                                       40
<PAGE>

      Subsidiary as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors
      or senior management;

            (2) transactions between or among the Company and any of its
      Restricted Subsidiaries so long as no portion of the minority interest in
      such Restricted Subsidiary is owned by an Affiliate of the Company (other
      than a Wholly Owned Subsidiary of the Company or directors or officers of
      such Subsidiary that hold stock of such Subsidiary to the extent that
      local law requires a resident of such jurisdiction to own stock of such
      company) or between or among such Restricted Subsidiaries; provided such
      transactions are not otherwise prohibited by this Indenture;

            (3) any agreement as in effect as of the Issue Date or any amendment
      thereto or any transaction contemplated thereby (including pursuant to any
      amendment thereto) or in any replacement agreement thereto so long as any
      such amendment or replacement agreement is not more disadvantageous to the
      Holders in any material respect than the original agreement as in effect
      on the Issue Date;

            (4) Permitted Investments and Restricted Payments permitted by this
      Indenture;

            (5) commercially reasonable transactions between the Company or a
      Restricted Subsidiary and any Joint Venture in the ordinary course of
      business that have been determined by the Board of Directors of the
      Company to comply with clause (y) of the first paragraph above; and

            (6) the issuance or sale of any Qualified Capital Stock of the
      Company.

            SECTION 4.13. Limitation on Dividend and Other Payment Restrictions
Affecting Subsidiaries.

            The Company will not, and will not permit any of its Restricted
Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly, create or otherwise cause or permit to
exist or become effective any consensual encumbrance or restriction on the
ability of any Restricted Subsidiary to

            (a) pay dividends or make any other distributions on or in respect
      of its Capital Stock;

            (b) make loans or advances to or pay any Indebtedness or other
      obligation owed to the Company or any other Restricted Subsidiary of the
      Company; or

            (c) transfer any of its property or assets to the Company or any
      other Restricted Subsidiary of the Company,

            except for such encumbrances or restrictions existing under or by
      reason of:

            (1) applicable law and agreements with governmental authorities with
      respect to assets located in their jurisdiction;


                                       41
<PAGE>

            (2) the Securities, this Indenture or any Guarantee;

            (3) (A) customary provisions restricting (1) the subletting or
      assignment of any lease or (2) the transfer of copyrighted or patented
      materials, (B) provisions in agreements that restrict the assignment of
      such agreements or rights thereunder or (C) provisions of a customary
      nature contained in the terms of Capital Stock restricting the payment of
      dividends and the making of distributions on Capital Stock;

            (4) any agreement or instrument governing Acquired Indebtedness,
      which encumbrance or restriction is not applicable to any Person, or the
      properties or assets of any Person, other than (a) the Person or the
      properties or assets of the Person so acquired (including the Capital
      Stock of such Person), or (b) any Restricted Subsidiary having no assets
      other than (i) the Person or the properties or assets of the Person so
      acquired (including the Capital Stock of such Person) and (ii) other
      assets having a fair market value not in excess of $50,000, and, in each
      case, the monetary proceeds thereof;

            (5) any agreement or instrument (A) in effect at or entered into on
      the Issue Date or (B) governing Senior Debt or Guarantor Senior Debt,
      including the New Credit Agreement;

            (6) any agreement or instrument governing Indebtedness incurred
      pursuant to clause (9), (13) or (16) of the definition of Permitted
      Indebtedness;

            (7) restrictions on the transfer of assets subject to any Lien
      permitted under this Indenture;

            (8) restrictions imposed by any agreement to sell assets not in
      violation of this Indenture to any Person pending the closing of such
      sale;

            (9) customary rights of first refusal with respect to the Company's
      and its Restricted Subsidiaries' interests in their respective Restricted
      Subsidiaries and Joint Ventures;

            (10) Indebtedness of a Person that was a Restricted Subsidiary at
      the time of incurrence and the incurrence of which Indebtedness is
      permitted by Section 4.04; provided that such encumbrances and
      restrictions apply only to such Restricted Subsidiary and its assets; and
      provided, further, that the Board of Directors of the Company has
      determined in good faith, at the time of creation of each such encumbrance
      or restriction, that such encumbrances and restrictions would not singly
      or in the aggregate have a materially adverse effect on the Holders of the
      Securities;

            (11) the subordination of any Indebtedness owed by the Company or
      any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to the Company or any other Restricted
      Subsidiary to any other Indebtedness of the Company or any of its
      Restricted Subsidiaries; provided (A) such other Indebtedness is permitted
      under this Indenture and (B) the Board of Directors of the Company has
      determined in good faith, at the time of creation of

                                       42
<PAGE>

      each such encumbrance or restriction, that such encumbrances and
      restrictions would not singly or in the aggregate have a materially
      adverse effect on the Holders of the Securities; or

            (12) an agreement effecting a refinancing, replacement or
      substitution of Indebtedness issued, assumed or incurred pursuant to an
      agreement referred to in clauses (2), (4) and (5) above or any other
      agreement evidencing Indebtedness permitted under this Indenture;
      provided, however, that the provisions relating to such encumbrance or
      restriction contained in any such refinancing, replacement or substitution
      agreement or any such other agreement are not less favorable to the
      Company in any material respect as determined by the Board of Directors of
      the Company than the provisions of the Indebtedness being refinanced.

            SECTION 4.14. Limitation on Liens. The Company will not, and will
not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, directly or indirectly,
create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien securing Indebtedness (other
than Permitted Liens) upon any property or asset now owned or hereafter acquired
by them, or any income or profits therefrom, or assign or convey any right to
receive income therefrom; provided, however, that in addition to creating
Permitted Liens on their properties or assets, the Company and any of its
Restricted Subsidiaries may create, incur, assume or suffer to exist any Lien
securing Indebtedness upon any of their properties or assets (including, but not
limited to, any Capital Stock of its Subsidiaries) if the Securities are equally
and ratably secured.

            SECTION 4.15. Change of Control. (a) Upon the occurrence of a Change
of Control, each Holder will have the right to require that the Company
repurchase all or a portion of such Holder's Securities, at a purchase price
equal to 101% of the principal amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest,
if any, to the date of repurchase.

            (b) Prior to the mailing of the notice described in paragraph (c)
below, but in any event within 30 days following any Change of Control, the
Company covenants to

            (1) repay in full and terminate all commitments under Indebtedness
      under the New Credit Agreement and all other Senior Debt, the terms of
      which require repayment upon a Change of Control or offer to repay in
      full, and terminate all commitments under all Indebtedness under the New
      Credit Agreement and all other such Senior Debt and to repay the
      Indebtedness owed to each lender which has accepted such offer; or

            (2) obtain the requisite consents under the New Credit Agreement and
      all such other Senior Debt to permit the purchase of the Securities as
      provided below.

The Company shall first comply with the covenant in the immediately preceding
sentence before it shall be required to repurchase Securities pursuant to the
provisions described below. The Company's failure to comply with this Section
4.15 shall constitute an Event of Default described in clause (c) and not in
clause (b) of Section 6.01.


                                       43
<PAGE>

            (c) Within 30 days following the date upon which the Change of
Control occurred, the Company shall send, by first class mail, a notice to each
Holder, with a copy to the Trustee, which notice shall govern the terms of the
Change of Control offer to purchase (the "Change of Control Offer"). The notice
to the Holders shall contain instructions and materials necessary to enable such
Holders to tender Securities pursuant to the Change of Control Offer. Such
notice shall state:

            (1) that the Change of Control Offer is being made pursuant to this
      Section 4.15 and that all Securities tendered and not withdrawn will be
      accepted for payment;

            (2) the purchase price (including the amount of accrued interest)
      and the purchase date, which shall be no earlier than 30 days nor later
      than 60 days from the date such notice is mailed, other than as may be
      required by law (the "Change of Control Payment Date");

            (3) that any Security not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

            (4) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment therefor,
      any Security accepted for payment pursuant to the Change of Control Offer
      shall cease to accrue interest after the Change of Control Payment Date;

            (5) that Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant to a
      Change of Control Offer will be required to surrender the Security, with
      the form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of
      the Security completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in
      the notice prior to 5:00 p.m. New York City time on the third Business Day
      prior to the Change of Control Payment Date;

            (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the
      Paying Agent receives, not later than 5:00 p.m. New York time on the
      second Business Day prior to the Change of Control Payment Date, a
      telegram, telex, facsimile transmission or letter setting forth the name
      of the Holder, the principal amount of the Securities the Holder delivered
      for purchase and a statement that such Holder is withdrawing his election
      to have such Security purchased;

            (7) that Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part will be
      issued new Securities in a principal amount equal to the unpurchased
      portion of the Securities surrendered; and

            (8) the circumstances and relevant facts regarding such Change of
      Control.

            On or before the Change of Control Payment Date, the Company shall
(i) accept for payment Securities or portions thereof tendered (in integral
multiples of $1,000) pursuant to the Change of Control Offer, (ii) deposit with
the Paying Agent U.S. Legal Tender sufficient to pay the purchase price plus
accrued interest, if any, of all Securities so tendered and (iii) deliver to the
Trustee Securities so accepted together with an Officers' Certificate stating
the Securities or portions thereof being purchased by the Company. The

                                       44
<PAGE>

Paying Agent shall promptly mail to the Holders of Securities so accepted
payment in an amount equal to the purchase price plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, thereon to the Change of Control Payment Date and the Trustee
shall promptly authenticate and mail to such Holders new Securities equal in
principal amount to any unpurchased portion of the Securities surrendered. Any
Securities not so accepted shall be promptly mailed by the Company to the Holder
thereof. For purposes of this Section 4.15, the Trustee shall act as the Paying
Agent.

            Any amounts remaining after the purchase of Securities pursuant to a
Change of Control Offer promptly shall be returned by the Trustee to the
Company.

            The Company shall comply with the requirements of Rule 14e-1 under
the Exchange Act and any other securities laws and regulations thereunder to the
extent such laws and regulations are applicable in connection with the
repurchase of Securities pursuant to a Change of Control Offer. To the extent
the provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with the
provisions under this Section 4.15, the Company shall comply with the applicable
securities laws and regulations and shall not be deemed to have breached its
obligations under this Section 4.15 by virtue thereof.

            SECTION 4.16. Limitation on Asset Sales. The Company will not, and
will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries to, consummate an Asset Sale
unless:

            (1) the Company or the applicable Restricted Subsidiary, as the case
      may be, receives consideration at the time of such Asset Sale at least
      equal to the fair market value of the assets sold or otherwise disposed
      of, as determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors;

            (2) at least 75% of the consideration received by the Company or
      such Restricted Subsidiary exclusive of indemnities, as the case may be,
      from such Asset Sale shall be cash or Cash Equivalents and is received at
      the time of such disposition; provided that the amount of (a) any
      liabilities of the Company or any such Restricted Subsidiary, as shown on
      the Company's or such Restricted Subsidiary's most recent balance sheet,
      that are assumed by the transferee of any such assets, (b) any notes or
      other obligations received by the Company or any such Restricted
      Subsidiary from such transferee that are converted by the Company or such
      Restricted Subsidiary into cash or Cash Equivalents within 60 days of the
      time of such disposition, to the extent of the cash or Cash Equivalents
      received and (c) any Designated Non-Cash Consideration received by the
      Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in such Asset Sale having an
      aggregate fair market value, taken together with all other Designated
      Non-Cash Consideration received pursuant to this clause (c), not to exceed
      $25.0 million, with the fair market value of each item of Designated
      Non-Cash Consideration being measured at the time received and without
      giving effect to subsequent changes in value, shall be deemed to be cash
      for the purposes of this clause (2); and

            (3) upon the consummation of an Asset Sale, the Company shall apply
      directly or through a Restricted Subsidiary, or cause such Restricted
      Subsidiary to

                                       45
<PAGE>

      apply, the Net Cash Proceeds relating to such Asset Sale within 360 days
      of receipt thereof either (A) to repay Senior Debt (and in the case of any
      Indebtedness outstanding under a revolving credit facility and repaid in
      satisfaction of this covenant, to permanently reduce the amounts that may
      be reborrowed thereunder by an equivalent amount), with the Net Cash
      Proceeds received in respect thereof, (B) to reinvest in Productive
      Assets, or (C) a combination of prepayment, reduction and investment
      permitted by the foregoing clauses (3)(A) and (3)(B);

provided that the 75% limitation referred to above shall not apply to any sale,
transfer or other disposition of assets in which the cash portion of the
consideration received therefor is equal to or greater than what the after-tax
net proceeds would have been had such transaction complied with the
aforementioned 75% limitation. On the 361st day after an Asset Sale or such
earlier date, if any, as the Board of Directors of the Company or of such
Restricted Subsidiary determines not to apply the Net Cash Proceeds relating to
such Asset Sale as set forth in clauses (3)(A), (3)(B) and (3)(C) of the
preceding sentence (each, a "Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date"), such aggregate
amount of Net Cash Proceeds which have not been so applied on or before such Net
Proceeds Offer Trigger Date as permitted in clauses (3)(A), (3)(B) and (3)(C) of
the preceding sentence (each, a "Net Proceeds Offer Amount") shall be applied by
the Company to make an offer to repurchase (the "Net Proceeds Offer") on a date
(the "Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date") not less than 30 nor more than 45 days
following the applicable Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date, from all Holders on a
pro rata basis that amount of Securities equal to the Net Proceeds Offer Amount
multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the aggregate principal
amount of Securities then outstanding and the denominator of which is the sum of
the aggregate principal amount of Securities and Pari Passu Indebtedness then
outstanding (the "Pro Rata Share"), at a price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Securities to be repurchased, plus accrued interest to the date of
repurchase.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Net Proceeds Offer Amount is
less than $20.0 million, the application of the Net Cash Proceeds constituting
such Net Proceeds Offer Amount to a Net Proceeds Offer may be deferred until
such time as such Net Proceeds Offer Amount plus the aggregate amount of all Net
Proceeds Offer Amounts arising subsequent to the Net Proceeds Offer Trigger Date
relating to such initial Net Proceeds Offer Amount from all Asset Sales by the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries aggregates at least $20.0 million, at
which time the Company shall apply all Net Cash Proceeds constituting all Net
Proceeds Offer Amounts that have been so deferred to make a Net Proceeds Offer,
the first date the aggregate of all such deferred Net Proceeds Offer Amounts is
equal to $20.0 million or more being deemed to be a Net Proceeds Offer Trigger
Date. To the extent that the aggregate purchase price of Securities tendered
pursuant to any Net Proceeds Offer is less than the Pro Rata Share, the Company
or any Guarantor may use such amount for general corporate purposes. Upon
completion of any Net Proceeds Offer, the Net Proceeds Offer Amount shall be
reset to zero.

            Notwithstanding the first two paragraphs of this Section 4.16, the
Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries will be permitted to consummate an Asset
Sale without complying with such paragraphs to the extent


                                       46
<PAGE>

            (1) at least 50% of the consideration for such Asset Sale
      constitutes Productive Assets; and

            (2) such Asset Sale is for fair market value; provided that if the
      fair market value is determined to exceed $25.0 million, such
      determination shall be made in good faith by the Company's Board of
      Directors; provided, further, that the fair market value of any
      consideration not constituting Productive Assets received by the Company
      or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries in connection with any Asset Sale
      permitted to be consummated under this paragraph shall constitute Net Cash
      Proceeds subject to the provisions of the first two paragraphs of this
      Section 4.16.

            In the event of the transfer of substantially all, but not all, of
the property and assets of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries as an
entirety to a Person in a transaction permitted under Section 5.01, the
successor corporation shall be deemed to have sold the properties and assets of
the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries not so transferred for purposes of
this Section 4.16, and shall comply with the provisions of this Section 4.16
with respect to such deemed sale as if it were an Asset Sale. In addition, the
fair market value of such properties and assets of the Company or its Restricted
Subsidiaries deemed to be sold shall be deemed to be Net Cash Proceeds for
purposes of this Section 4.16.

            Notice of a Net Proceeds Offer shall be mailed, by first class mail,
by the Company to Holders at their last registered address not less than 30 days
nor more than 60 days before the Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date, with a copy to
the Trustee. The notice shall contain instructions and materials necessary to
enable such Holders to tender Securities pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer and
shall state the following terms:

            (1) that the Net Proceeds Offer is being made pursuant to this
      Section 4.16, that all Securities tendered will be accepted for payment;
      provided, however, that if the aggregate principal amount of Securities
      tendered in a Net Proceeds Offer plus accrued interest at the expiration
      of such offer exceeds the aggregate amount of the Net Proceeds Offer, the
      Company shall select the Securities to be purchased on a pro rata basis
      (with such adjustments as may be deemed appropriate by the Company so that
      only Securities in denominations of $1,000 or multiples thereof shall be
      purchased) and that the Net Proceeds Offer shall remain open for a period
      of 20 Business Days or such longer period as may be required by law;

            (2) the Net Proceeds Offer Amount (including the amount of accrued
      interest) and the Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date (which shall be not less
      than 30 nor more than 45 days following the applicable Net Proceeds Offer
      Trigger Date and which shall be at least five Business Days after the
      Trustee receives notice thereof from the Company);

            (3) that any Security not tendered will continue to accrue interest;

            (4) that, unless the Company defaults in making payment therefor,
      any Security accepted for payment pursuant to the Net Proceeds Offer shall
      cease to accrue interest after the Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date;

                                       47
<PAGE>

            (5) that Holders electing to have a Security purchased pursuant to a
      Net Proceeds Offer will be required to surrender the Security, with the
      form entitled "Option of Holder to Elect Purchase" on the reverse of the
      Security completed, to the Paying Agent at the address specified in the
      notice prior to the close of business on the Business Day prior to the Net
      Proceeds Offer Payment Date;

            (6) that Holders will be entitled to withdraw their election if the
      Paying Agent receives, not later than the second Business Day prior to the
      Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date, a telegram, telex, facsimile transmission
      or letter setting forth the name of the Holder, the principal amount of
      the Securities such Holder delivered for purchase and a statement that
      such Holder is withdrawing his election to have such Securities purchased;
      and

            (7) that Holders whose Securities are purchased only in part will be
      issued new Securities in a principal amount equal to the unpurchased
      portion of the Securities surrendered; provided, however, that each
      Security purchased and each new Security issued shall be in an original
      principal amount of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof.

            On or before the Net Proceeds Offer Payment Date, the Company shall
(i) accept for payment Securities or portions thereof tendered pursuant to the
Net Proceeds Offer which are to be purchased in accordance with item (1) above,
(ii) deposit with the Paying Agent U.S. Legal Tender sufficient to pay the
purchase price plus accrued interest, if any, of all Securities to be purchased
and (iii) deliver to the Trustee Securities so accepted together with an
Officers' Certificate stating the Securities or portions thereof being purchased
by the Company. The Paying Agent shall promptly mail to the Holders of
Securities so accepted payment in an amount equal to the purchase price plus
accrued interest, if any. For purposes of this Section 4.16, the Trustee shall
act as the Paying Agent.

            Any amounts remaining after the purchase of Securities pursuant to a
Net Proceeds Offer promptly shall be returned by the Trustee to the Company.

            If an offer is made to repurchase the Securities pursuant to a Net
Proceeds Offer, the Company will and will cause its Restricted Subsidiaries to
comply with all tender offer rules under state and federal securities laws,
including, but not limited to, Section 14(e) under the Exchange Act and Rule
14e-1 thereunder, to the extent applicable to such offer. To the extent that the
provisions of any securities laws or regulations conflict with this Section
4.16, the Company shall comply with the applicable securities laws and
obligations and shall not be deemed to have breached its obligations hereunder
by virtue thereof.

            SECTION 4.17. Limitation on Preferred Stock of Restricted
Subsidiaries. The Company will not permit any of its Restricted Subsidiaries
that are not Guarantors of the Securities to issue any Preferred Stock (other
than to the Company or to a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company)
or permit any Person (other than the Company or a Wholly Owned Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company) to own any Preferred Stock of any Restricted
Subsidiary of the Company that is not a Guarantor of the Securities.

            SECTION 4.18. Limitation on Sale and Leaseback Transactions. The
Company will not, and will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary to, enter into
any Sale and Leaseback Transaction; provided that the Company and any Guarantor
may enter into a Sale and Leaseback Transaction if

            (1) the Company or such Guarantor could have

            (a) incurred Indebtedness in an amount equal to the Attributable
      Debt relating to such Sale and Leaseback Transaction pursuant to Section
      4.04; and

            (b) incurred a Lien to secure such Indebtedness pursuant to Section
      4.14;

            (2) the gross cash proceeds of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction
      are at least equal to the fair market value, as determined in good faith
      by the Board of Directors of the Company and set forth in an Officers'
      Certificate delivered to the Trustee, of the property that is the subject
      of such Sale and Leaseback Transaction; and

            (3) the transfer of assets in such Sale and Leaseback Transaction is
      permitted by, and the Company or the applicable Guarantor applies the
      proceeds of such transaction in accordance with, Section 4.16.

            SECTION 4.19. Limitation of Guarantees by Restricted Subsidiaries.
The Company will not permit any Restricted Subsidiary that is not a Guarantor,
directly or indirectly, by way of the pledge of any intercompany note or
otherwise, to assume, guarantee or in any other manner become liable with
respect to any Indebtedness of the Company, other than

            (A) Indebtedness incurred in reliance on clause (12) (to the extent
      the Indebtedness being refinanced, modified, replaced, renewed, restated,
      refunded, deferred, extended, substituted, supplemented, reissued or
      resold was permitted to be guaranteed by Restricted Subsidiaries) of the
      definition of Permitted Indebtedness or under Currency Agreements in
      reliance on clause (5) of the definition of Permitted Indebtedness;

            (B) Interest Swap Obligations incurred in reliance on clause (4) of
      the definition of Permitted Indebtedness; or

            (C) additional Indebtedness incurred in reliance on clause (13) of
      the definition of Permitted Indebtedness;

unless, in any such case (except as otherwise provided in Section 11.17)

            (a) such Restricted Subsidiary has executed and delivered or
      executes and delivers a supplemental indenture to this Indenture,
      providing a guarantee of payment of the Securities by such Restricted
      Subsidiary in the form required by this Indenture; and


                                       49
<PAGE>

            (b) if such assumption, guarantee or other liability of such
      Restricted Subsidiary is provided in respect of Indebtedness that is
      expressly subordinated to the Securities, the guarantee or other
      instrument provided by such Restricted Subsidiary in respect of such
      subordinate Indebtedness shall be similarly subordinated to the Guarantee
      of the Securities.

            Any Guarantee of the Securities by a Restricted Subsidiary shall
provide by its terms that it shall be automatically and unconditionally released
and discharged, without any further action required on the part of the Trustee
or any Holder, upon:

            (1) the unconditional release of such Restricted Subsidiary from its
      liability in respect of the Indebtedness in connection with which such
      Guarantee of the Securities was executed and delivered pursuant to the
      preceding paragraph; or

            (2) any sale or other disposition (by merger or otherwise) to any
      Person which is not a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, of all of the
      Company's Capital Stock in, or all or substantially all of the assets of,
      such Restricted Subsidiary; provided, however, that

            (a) such sale or disposition of such Capital Stock or assets is
      otherwise in compliance with the terms of this Indenture; and

            (b) such assumption, guarantee or other liability of such Restricted
      Subsidiary has been released by the holders of the other Indebtedness so
      guaranteed.

            SECTION 5.01. Merger, Consolidation and Sale of Assets. The Company
will not, in a single transaction or series of related transactions, consolidate
or merge with or into any Person, or sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or
otherwise dispose of (or cause or permit any Restricted Subsidiary of the
Company to sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of) all or
substantially all of the Company's assets (determined on a consolidated basis
for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries) whether as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to any Person unless:

            (1) either (A) the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company
      shall be the surviving or continuing Person or (B) the Person, if other
      than the Company or a Restricted Subsidiary of the Company, formed by such
      consolidation or into which the Company is merged or the Person which
      acquires by sale, assignment, transfer, lease, conveyance or other
      disposition of all or substantially all of the Company's assets determined
      on a consolidated basis for the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries
      (the "Surviving Entity") (x) shall be a Person organized and validly
      existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or the
      District of Columbia and (y) shall expressly assume, by supplemental
      indenture, in form

                                       50
<PAGE>

      reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the
      Trustee, the due and punctual payment of the principal of and interest on
      all of the Securities and the performance of every covenant of the
      Securities, this Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement (as
      defined in Appendix A hereto) on the part of the Company to be performed
      or observed;

            (2) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the
      assumption contemplated by clause (1)(B)(y) above, including giving effect
      to any Indebtedness and Acquired Indebtedness incurred or anticipated to
      be incurred in connection with or in respect of such transaction, the
      Company or such Surviving Entity, as the case may be, shall be able to
      incur at least $1.00 of additional Indebtedness, other than Permitted
      Indebtedness, pursuant to Section 4.04;

            (3) immediately before and immediately after giving effect to such
      transaction and the assumption contemplated by clause (1)(B)(y) above,
      including, without limitation, giving effect to any Indebtedness and
      Acquired Indebtedness incurred or anticipated to be incurred and any Lien
      granted in connection with or in respect of the transaction, no Default or
      Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

            (4) the Company or the Surviving Entity shall have delivered to the
      Trustee an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each stating
      that such consolidation, merger, sale, assignment, transfer, lease,
      conveyance or other disposition and, if a supplemental indenture is
      required in connection with such transaction, such supplemental indenture,
      shall comply with the applicable provisions of this Indenture and that all
      conditions precedent in this Indenture relating to the execution of such
      supplemental indenture have been satisfied.

            For purposes of the foregoing, the transfer, by lease, assignment,
sale or otherwise, in a single transaction or series of transactions, of all or
substantially all of the properties or assets of one or more Restricted
Subsidiaries of the Company, other than to a Wholly Owned Subsidiary that is a
Guarantor, the Capital Stock of which constitutes all or substantially all of
the properties and assets of the Company, shall be deemed to be the transfer of
all or substantially all of the properties and assets of the Company.

            Upon any consolidation, combination or merger or any transfer of all
or substantially all of the assets of the Company in accordance with the
foregoing, in which the Company is not the continuing Person, the successor
Person formed by such consolidation or into which the Company is merged or to
which such conveyance, lease or transfer is made shall succeed to, and be
substituted for, and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under
this Indenture and the Securities with the same effect as if such Surviving
Entity had been named as such and the Company shall be relieved of all of its
obligations and duties under this Indenture and the Securities.

            Each Guarantor, other than any Guarantor whose Guarantee is to be
released in accordance with the terms of the Guarantee and this Indenture, will
not, and the Company

                                       51
<PAGE>

will not cause or permit any Guarantor to, consolidate with or merge with or
into any Person other than the Company or any other Guarantor unless:

            (1) the entity formed by or surviving any such consolidation or
      merger, if other than the Guarantor, or to which such sale, lease,
      conveyance or other disposition shall have been made is a Person organized
      and existing under the laws of the United States or any State thereof or
      the District of Columbia;

            (2) such entity assumes by supplemental indenture all of the
      obligations of the Guarantor on the Guarantee;

            (3) immediately after giving effect to such transaction, no Default
      or Event of Default shall have occurred and be continuing; and

            (4) immediately after giving effect to such transaction and the use
      of any net proceeds therefrom on a pro forma basis, the Company could
      satisfy the provisions of clause (2) of the first paragraph of this
      Section 5.01.

            Any merger or consolidation of a Guarantor with and into the
Company, with the Company being the Surviving Entity, or another Guarantor that
is a Wholly Owned Restricted Subsidiary of the Company need not comply with this
Section 5.01.

            SECTION 5.02. Successor Substituted. Upon any such consolidation,
merger, conveyance, lease or transfer of all or substantially all of the assets
of the Company in accordance with Section 5.01, in which the Company is not the
surviving Person, the Surviving Entity will succeed to, and be substituted for,
and may exercise every right and power of, the Company under this Indenture and
the Securities with the same effect as if such successor had been named as the
Company therein. When a Surviving Entity assumes all of the Obligations of the
Company hereunder and under the Securities and agrees to be bound hereby and
thereby, the predecessor shall be released from such Obligations.

                              Default and Remedies
                              --------------------

            SECTION 6.01. Events of Default. An "Event of Default" means any of
the following events:

            (a) the failure to pay interest on any Securities when the same
      becomes due and payable and the Default continues for a period of 30 days;

            (b) the failure to pay the principal on any Securities, when such
      principal becomes due and payable, at maturity, upon redemption or
      otherwise, including the failure to make a payment to repurchase
      Securities tendered pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or a Net
      Proceeds Offer;

            (c) a Default in the observance or performance of any other covenant
      or agreement contained in this Indenture, which Default continues for a
      period of 45

                                       52
<PAGE>

      days after the Company receives written notice specifying the Default, and
      demanding that such Default be remedied, from the Trustee or the Holders
      of at least 25% of the outstanding principal amount of the Securities;

            (d) the failure to pay at final maturity, giving effect to any
      extensions thereof, the principal amount of any Indebtedness of the
      Company or any Restricted Subsidiary of the Company that is a Significant
      Subsidiary, other than intercompany Indebtedness, and such failure
      continues for a period of 20 days or more, or the acceleration of the
      final stated maturity of any such Indebtedness, which acceleration is not
      rescinded, annulled or otherwise cured within 20 days of receipt by the
      Company or such Restricted Subsidiary of notice of any such acceleration,
      if, in either case, the aggregate principal amount of such Indebtedness,
      together with the principal amount of any other such Indebtedness in
      default for failure to pay principal at final maturity or which has been
      accelerated, in each case with respect to which the 20-day period
      described above has passed, aggregates $25.0 million or more at any time;

            (e) any final judgment or final judgments for the payment of money
      in excess (net of amounts covered by third-party insurance with insurance
      carriers who in the reasonable judgment of the Board of Directors of the
      Company are creditworthy and who have not disclaimed liability with
      respect to such judgment or judgments) of $25.0 million shall be rendered
      against the Company or any of its Restricted Subsidiaries that is a
      Significant Subsidiary and shall not be discharged for any period of 60
      consecutive days during which a stay of enforcement shall not be in
      effect;

            (f) the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary that is a Significant
      Subsidiary (i) admits in writing its inability to pay its debts generally
      as they become due, (ii) commences a voluntary case or proceeding under
      any Bankruptcy Law with respect to itself, (iii) consents to the entry of
      a judgment, decree or order for relief against it in an involuntary case
      or proceeding under any Bankruptcy Law, (iv) consents to the appointment
      of a Custodian of it or for substantially all of its property, (v)
      consents to or acquiesces in the institution of a bankruptcy or an
      insolvency proceeding against it, (vi) makes a general assignment for the
      benefit of its creditors or (vii) takes any partnership or corporate
      action, as the case may be, to authorize or effect any of the foregoing;

            (g) a court of competent jurisdiction enters a judgment, decree or
      order for relief in respect of the Company or any Restricted Subsidiary
      that is a Significant Subsidiary in an involuntary case or proceeding
      under any Bankruptcy Law, which shall (i) approve as properly filed a
      petition seeking reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition in
      respect of the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary, (ii) appoint a
      Custodian of the Company or any such Significant Subsidiary or for
      substantially all of any of their property or (iii) order the winding-up
      or liquidation of its affairs; and such judgment, decree or order shall
      remain unstayed and in effect for a period of 60 consecutive days; or


                                       53
<PAGE>

            (h) any of the Guarantees ceases to be in full force and effect or
      any of the Guarantees is held in a judicial proceeding to be null and void
      and unenforceable or any of the Guarantees is found to be invalid by a
      final judgment or order that is not appealable or any of the Guarantors
      denies its liability under its Guarantee, other than by reason of release
      of a Guarantor in accordance with the terms of this Indenture.

            SECTION 6.02. Acceleration. If an Event of Default (other than an
Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(f) or (g) with respect to the
Company) shall occur and be continuing, the Trustee or the Holders of at least
25% in principal amount of outstanding Securities may declare the principal of
and accrued and unpaid interest on all the Securities to be due and payable by
notice in writing to the Company and the Trustee specifying the respective Event
of Default and that it is a "notice of acceleration", and the same shall become
immediately due and payable. If an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01(f)
or (g) with respect to the Company occurs and is continuing, then all unpaid
principal of and accrued and unpaid interest on all of the outstanding
Securities shall ipso facto become and be immediately due and payable without
any declaration or other act on the part of the Trustee or any Holder.

            At any time after a declaration of acceleration with respect to the
Securities as described in the preceding paragraph, the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities may rescind and cancel such declaration and
its consequences (i) if the rescission would not conflict with any judgment or
decree, (ii) if all existing Events of Default have been cured or waived except
nonpayment of principal or interest that has become due solely because of the
acceleration, (iii) to the extent the payment of such interest is lawful,
interest on overdue installments of interest and overdue principal, which has
become due otherwise than by such declaration of acceleration, has been paid,
(iv) if the Company has paid the Trustee its reasonable compensation and
reimbursed the Trustee for its reasonable expenses, disbursements and advances
and (v) in the event of the cure or waiver of an Event of Default of the type
described in clause (f) or (g) of Section 6.01, the Trustee shall have received
an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel that such Event of Default
has been cured or waived. No such rescission shall affect any subsequent Default
or impair any right consequent thereto.

            SECTION 6.03. Other Remedies. If an Event of Default occurs and is
continuing, the Trustee may pursue any available remedy by proceeding at law or
in equity to collect the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities
or to enforce the performance of any provision of the Securities or this
Indenture.

            The Trustee may maintain a proceeding even if it does not possess
any of the Securities or does not produce any of them in the proceeding. A delay
or omission by the Trustee or any Securityholder in exercising any right or
remedy accruing upon an Event of Default shall not impair the right or remedy or
constitute a waiver of or acquiescence in the Event of Default. No remedy is
exclusive of any other remedy. All available remedies are cumulative to the
extent permitted by law.

            SECTION 6.04. Waiver of Past Defaults. Subject to Sections 2.09,
6.07 and 9.02, the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of
the outstanding Securities

                                       54
<PAGE>

by written notice to the Trustee may waive an existing Default or Event of
Default and its consequences, except a Default in the payment of principal of or
interest on any Security as specified in clauses (a) and (b) of Section 6.01.
When a Default or Event of Default is waived, it is cured and ceases.

            SECTION 6.05. Control by Majority. The Holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may direct the time,
method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the
Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred on it. Subject to Section
7.01, however, the Trustee may refuse to follow any direction that conflicts
with any law or this Indenture, that the Trustee determines may be unduly
prejudicial to the rights of another Securityholder, or that may, in the sole
judgment of the Trustee, give rise to or subject the Trustee to personal
liability; provided that the Trustee may take any other action deemed proper by
the Trustee.

            In the event the Trustee takes any action or follows any direction
pursuant to this Indenture, the Trustee shall be entitled to indemnification
satisfactory to it in its sole discretion against any loss or expense caused by
taking such action or following such direction.

            SECTION 6.06. Limitation on Suits. A Securityholder may not pursue
any remedy with respect to this Indenture or the Securities unless:

            (1) the Holder gives to the Trustee written notice of a continuing
      Event of Default;

            (2) the Holder or Holders of at least 25% in principal amount of the
      outstanding Securities make a written request to the Trustee to pursue the
      remedy;

            (3) such Holder or Holders offer to the Trustee indemnity or
      security satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole judgment, against any
      loss, liability or expense;

            (4) the Trustee does not comply with the request within 30 days
      after receipt of the request and the offer described in clause (3) above;
      and

            (5) during such 30-day period the Holder or Holders of a majority in
      principal amount of the outstanding Securities do not give the Trustee a
      written direction which, in the opinion of the Trustee, is inconsistent
      with the request.

            A Securityholder may not use this Indenture to prejudice the rights
of another Securityholder or to obtain a preference or priority over such other
Securityholder.

            SECTION 6.07. Rights of Holders to Receive Payment. Notwithstanding
any other provision of this Indenture, the right of any Holder to receive
payment of principal of and interest on a Security, on or after the respective
due dates expressed in such Security, or to bring suit for the enforcement of
any such payment on or after such respective dates, shall not be impaired or
affected without the written consent of the Holder.


                                       55
<PAGE>

            SECTION 6.08. Collection Suit by Trustee. If an Event of Default in
payment of principal or interest specified in clause (a) or (b) of Section 6.01
occurs and is continuing, the Trustee may recover judgment in its own name and
as trustee of an express trust against the Company or any other obligor on the
Securities for the whole amount of principal and accrued interest and fees
remaining unpaid, together with interest on overdue principal and, to the extent
that payment of such interest is lawful, interest on overdue installments of
interest, in each case at the rate per annum borne by the Securities and such
further amount as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of
collection, including the actual, documented and reasonable compensation,
expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee, its agents and counsel.

            SECTION 6.09. Trustee May File Proofs of Claim. The Trustee may file
such proofs of claim and other papers or documents as may be necessary or
advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee (including any claim for
the reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the
Trustee, its agents and counsel) and the Securityholders allowed in any judicial
proceedings relating to the Company, its Subsidiaries, their creditors or their
property and shall be entitled and empowered to collect and receive any monies
or other property payable or deliverable on any such claims and to distribute
the same, and any Custodian in any such judicial proceedings is hereby
authorized by each Securityholder to make such payments to the Trustee and, in
the event that the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly
to the Securityholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due to it for the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agent and counsel, and any other amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07.
Nothing herein contained shall be deemed to authorize the Trustee to authorize
or consent to or accept or adopt on behalf of any Securityholder any plan of
reorganization, arrangement, adjustment or composition affecting the Securities
or the rights of any Holder thereof, or to authorize the Trustee to vote in
respect of the claim of any Securityholder in any such proceeding.

            SECTION 6.10. Priorities. If the Trustee collects any money or
property pursuant to this Article Six, it shall pay out the money or property in
the following order:

            First: to the Trustee for amounts due under Section 7.07;

            Second: if the Holders are forced to proceed against the Company
      directly without the Trustee, to Holders for their reasonable
      collection costs;

            Third: to holders of Senior Debt of the Company and, if such
      money or property has been collected from a Guarantor, to the holders
      of Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor, in each case if and to the
      extent required by Article 10 or 12, respectively;

            Fourth: to Holders for amounts due and unpaid on the Securities
      for principal and interest, ratably, without preference or priority of
      any kind, according to the amounts due and payable on the Securities
      for principal and interest, respectively; and

            Fifth: to the Company.

            The Trustee, upon prior written notice to the Company, may fix a
record date and payment date for any payment to Securityholders pursuant to this
Section 6.10.

            SECTION 6.11. Undertaking for Costs. Each party to this Indenture
agrees and each Holder of any Security by its acceptance thereof shall be deemed
to have agreed that, in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy
under this Indenture or in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or
omitted by it as Trustee, a court in its discretion may require the filing by
any party litigant in the suit of an undertaking to pay the costs of the suit,
and the court in its discretion may assess reasonable costs, including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any party litigant in the suit,
having due regard to the merits and good faith of the claims or defenses made by
the party litigant. This Section 6.11 does not apply to a suit instituted by the
Company, any suit instituted by the Trustee, any suit instituted by a Holder
pursuant to Section 6.07, or any suit instituted by a Holder or Holders of more
than 10% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities.

            SECTION 6.12. Restoration of Rights and Remedies. If the Trustee or
any Holder has instituted any proceeding to enforce any right or remedy under
this Indenture and such proceeding has been discontinued or abandoned for any
reason, or has been determined adversely to the Trustee or to such Holders, then
and in every such case, subject to any determination in such proceeding, the
Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and the Holders shall be restored severally
and respectively to their former positions hereunder and thereafter all rights
and remedies of the Trustee and the Holders shall continue as though no such
proceeding had been instituted.

                                   ARTICLE 7

                                     Trustee

            SECTION 7.01. Duties of Trustee. (a) If an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, the Trustee shall exercise such of the rights and
powers vested in it by this Indenture and use the same degree of care and skill
in their exercise as a prudent person would exercise or use under the
circumstances in the conduct of his or her own affairs.

            (b) Except during the continuance of an Event of Default:

            (1) The Trustee need perform only those duties as are expressly and
      specifically set forth in this Indenture or the TIA and no covenants,
      duties or obligations whatsoever shall be implied under this Indenture
      that are adverse to the Trustee.

            (2) In the absence of bad faith on its part, the Trustee may
      conclusively rely, as to the truth of the statements and the correctness
      of the opinions expressed therein, upon certificates or opinions and such
      other documents delivered to it pursuant to Section 13.04 hereof furnished
      to the Trustee and conforming to the requirements of this Indenture.
      However, the Trustee shall examine the certificates and opinions to
      determine whether or not they conform to the requirements of this
      Indenture.


                                       57
<PAGE>

            (c) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein contained, the
Trustee may not be relieved from liability for its own negligent action, its own
negligent failure to act, or its own willful misconduct, except that:

            (1) This paragraph does not limit the effect of paragraph (b) of
      this Section 7.01.

            (2) The Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made
      in good faith by a Responsible Officer, unless it is proved that the
      Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts.

            (3) The Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action it
      takes or omits to take in good faith in accordance with a direction
      received by it pursuant to Section 6.02, 6.04 or 6.05.

            (d) No provision of this Indenture shall require the Trustee to
expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability in the
performance of any of its duties hereunder or to take or omit to take any action
under this Indenture or take any action at the request or direction of Holders
if it shall reasonably believe that repayment of such funds is not assured to it
or it does not receive an indemnity that is, in its sole discretion, adequate
against such risk, liability, loss, fee or expense which might be incurred by it
in compliance with such request or direction.

            (e) Every provision of this Indenture that in any way relates to the
Trustee is subject to paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) of this Section 7.01.

            (f) The Trustee shall not be liable for interest on any money or
assets received by it except as the Trustee may agree in writing with the
Company. Assets held in trust by the Trustee need not be segregated from other
assets of the Trustee except to the extent required by law.

            (g) In the absence of bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct on
the part of the Trustee, the Trustee shall not be accountable for the use of any
of the Securities delivered hereunder or the proceeds thereof.

            SECTION 7.02. Rights of Trustee. Subject to Section 7.01:

            (a) The Trustee may rely conclusively on any document believed by it
      to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper Person.
      The Trustee need not investigate any fact or matter stated in the
      document.

            (b) Before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require
      an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, which shall conform to
      the provisions of Sections 13.04 and 13.05. The Trustee shall not be
      liable for any action it takes or omits to take in good faith in reliance
      on such certificate or opinion.


                                       58
<PAGE>

            (c) The Trustee may act through its attorneys and agents and shall
      not be responsible for the misconduct or negligence of any agent (other
      than an agent who is an employee of the Trustee) appointed with due care.

            (d) The Trustee shall not be liable for any action it takes or omits
      to take in good faith which it reasonably believes to be authorized or
      within its rights or powers.

            (e) The Trustee may consult with counsel of its selection and the
      advice or opinion of such counsel as to matters of law shall be full and
      complete authorization and protection from liability in respect of any
      action taken, omitted or suffered by it hereunder in good faith and in
      accordance with the advice or opinion of such counsel.

            (f) The Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
      rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or
      direction of any of the Holders pursuant to the provisions of this
      Indenture, unless such Holders shall have offered to the Trustee
      reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to the Trustee in its sole
      judgment against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred
      therein or thereby.

            (g) The Trustee shall not be deemed to have notice of any Event of
      Default unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written
      notice thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in fact such
      a Default is received by the Trustee at the Corporate Trust Office of the
      Trustee, and such notice references the Securities and this Indenture.

            (h) The Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into
      the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate (including any
      Officers' Certificate), statement, instrument, opinion (including any
      Opinion of Counsel), notice, request, direction, consent, order, bond,
      debenture, or other paper or document, but the Trustee, in its discretion,
      may make such further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters
      as it may see fit and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further
      inquiry or investigation, it shall be entitled, upon reasonable notice to
      the Company, to examine the books, records, and premises of the Company,
      personally or by agent or attorney.

            (i) The rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits
      given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be
      indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in
      each of its capacities hereunder, and to each agent, custodian and other
      Person employed to act hereunder.

            (j) The Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers'
      Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of
      officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to
      this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any Person
      authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any Person
      specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered
      and not superseded.

<PAGE>

            SECTION 7.03. Individual Rights of Trustee. The Trustee in its
individual or any other capacity may become the owner or pledgee of Securities
and may otherwise deal with the Company, its Subsidiaries, or their respective
Affiliates with the same rights it would have if it were not Trustee. Any Agent
may do the same with like rights. However, the Trustee must comply with Sections
7.10 and 7.11.

            SECTION 7.04. Trustee's Disclaimer. The Trustee shall not be
responsible for and makes no representation as to the validity or adequacy of
this Indenture or the Securities (other than the certificate of authentication
of the Trustee), it shall not be accountable for the Company's use of the
proceeds from the Securities, and it shall not be responsible for any statement
of the Company in this Indenture or any document issued in connection with the
sale of Securities or any statement in the Securities other than the Trustee's
certificate of authentication.

            SECTION 7.05. Notice of Default. If an Event of Default occurs and
is continuing and the Trustee receives actual notice of such event, the Trustee
shall mail to each Securityholder, as their names and addresses appear on the
Securityholder list described in Section 2.05, notice of the uncured Event of
Default within 90 days after the Trustee receives such notice. Except in the
case of an Event of Default in payment of principal of, or interest on, any
Security, including the failure to make payment on (i) the Change of Control
Payment Date pursuant to a Change of Control Offer or (ii) the Net Proceeds
Offer Payment Date pursuant to a Net Proceeds Offer, the Trustee shall not be
deemed to have actual knowledge or actual notice of an Event of Default unless a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee has received written notice of such Event of
Default. The Trustee may withhold the notice if and so long as the Board of
Directors, the executive committee, or a trust committee of directors and/or
Responsible Officers, of the Trustee in good faith determines that withholding
the notice is in the interest of the Securityholders. As used herein, the term
"actual knowledge" means the actual fact or state of knowing, without any duty
to make any investigation with regard thereto.

            SECTION 7.06. Reports by Trustee to Holders. Within 60 days after
June 15 of each year, beginning with June 15, 2005, the Trustee shall, to the
extent that any of the events described in TIA ss. 313(a) occurred within the
previous twelve months, but not otherwise, mail to each Securityholder a brief
report dated as of June 15 that complies with TIA ss. 313(a). The Trustee also
shall comply with TIA ss.ss. 313(b), 313(c) and 313(d).

            A copy of each report at the time of its mailing to Securityholders
shall be mailed to the Company and filed with the Commission and each securities
exchange, if any, on which the Securities are listed.

            The Company shall notify the Trustee if the Securities become listed
on any securities exchange or of any delisting thereof.

            SECTION 7.07. Compensation and Indemnity. The Company shall pay to
the Trustee from time to time reasonable compensation for its services hereunder
(which shall be agreed to from time to time in writing by the Company and the
Trustee). The Trustee's compensation shall not be limited by any law on
compensation of a trustee of an


                                       60
<PAGE>

express trust. The Company shall reimburse the Trustee upon written request for
all reasonable and documented out-of-pocket disbursements, expenses and advances
(including reasonable and documented fees and expenses of counsel) incurred or
made by it in addition to the compensation for its services, except any such
disbursements, expenses and advances as may be attributable to the Trustee's
negligence or willful misconduct. Such expenses shall include the reasonable and
documented compensation, disbursements and expenses of the Trustee's agents,
accountants, experts and counsel.

            The Company shall indemnify the Trustee or any predecessor Trustee
and its agents, employees, officers, stockholders and directors for, and hold
them harmless against, any loss, liability or expense, including taxes (other
than taxes based upon, measured or determined by the income of the Trustee),
incurred by them except for such actions to the extent caused by any negligence,
bad faith or willful misconduct on their part, arising out of or in connection
with the acceptance or administration of this trust including the reasonable
costs and expenses of defending themselves against or investigating any claim or
liability in connection with the exercise or performance of any of the Trustee's
rights, powers or duties hereunder. The Trustee shall notify the Company
promptly of any claim asserted against the Trustee or any of its agents,
employees, officers, stockholders and directors for which it may seek indemnity.
At the Trustee's reasonable discretion, the Company shall defend the claim and
the Trustee shall cooperate and may participate in the defense; provided that
any settlement of a claim shall be approved in writing by the Trustee.
Alternatively, the Trustee may at its option have separate counsel of its own
choosing and the Company shall pay the reasonable fees and expenses of such
counsel; provided, however, that the Company will not be required to pay such
fees and expenses if it assumes the Trustee's defense and there is no conflict
of interest between the Company and the Trustee and its agents, employees,
officers, stockholders and directors subject to the claim in connection with
such defense as reasonably determined by the Trustee. The Company need not pay
for any settlement made without its written consent. The Company need not
reimburse any expense or indemnify against any loss or liability to the extent
incurred by the Trustee through its negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct.

            To secure the Company's payment Obligations in this Section 7.07,
the Trustee shall have a lien prior to the Securities against all money or
property held or collected by the Trustee, in its capacity as Trustee.

            When the Trustee incurs expenses or renders services after an Event
of Default specified in clause (f) or (g) of Section 6.01 occurs, the expenses
and the compensation for the services shall be paid to the extent allowable
under any Bankruptcy Law. The Company's Obligations under this Section 7.07 and
any claim arising hereunder shall survive the resignation or removal of any
Trustee, the discharge of the Company's Obligations pursuant to Article Eight
and any rejection or termination under any Bankruptcy Law.

            SECTION 7.08. Replacement of Trustee. The Trustee may resign at any
time by so notifying the Company in writing at least 30 days in advance. The
Holders of a majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may
remove the Trustee by so notifying the Company and the Trustee in writing and
may appoint a successor trustee. A

                                       61
<PAGE>

resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a successor Trustee
shall become effective only with the successor Trustee's acceptance of
appointment as provided in this Section 7.08. The Company may remove the Trustee
if:

            (1) the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10;

            (2) the Trustee is adjudged bankrupt or insolvent;

            (3) a receiver or other public officer takes charge of the Trustee
      or its property; or

            (4) the Trustee becomes incapable of acting.

            If the Trustee resigns or is removed or if a vacancy exists in the
office of Trustee for any reason, the Company shall notify in writing each
Holder of such event and shall promptly appoint a successor Trustee. Within one
year after the successor Trustee takes office, the Holders of a majority in
principal amount of the Securities may appoint a successor Trustee to replace
the successor Trustee appointed by the Company.

            A successor Trustee shall deliver a written acceptance of its
appointment to the retiring Trustee and to the Company. Immediately after that,
the retiring Trustee shall transfer, after payment of all sums then owing to the
Trustee pursuant to Section 7.07, all property held by it as Trustee to the
successor Trustee, subject to the lien provided in Section 7.07, the resignation
or removal of the retiring Trustee shall become effective, and the successor
Trustee shall have all the rights, powers and duties of the Trustee under this
Indenture. A successor Trustee shall mail notice of its succession to each
Securityholder.

            If a successor Trustee does not take office within 30 days after the
retiring Trustee resigns or is removed, the retiring Trustee, the Company or the
Holders of at least 10% in principal amount of the outstanding Securities may
petition any court of competent jurisdiction at the expense of the Company for
the appointment of a successor Trustee.

            If the Trustee fails to comply with Section 7.10, any Securityholder
may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee
and the appointment of a successor Trustee.

            Notwithstanding replacement of the Trustee pursuant to this Section
7.08, the Company's Obligations under Section 7.07 shall continue for the
benefit of the retiring Trustee.

            SECTION 7.09. Successor Trustee by Merger, etc. If the Trustee
consolidates with, merges or converts into, or transfers all or substantially
all of its corporate trust business to, another Person, the resulting, surviving
or transferee Person without any further act shall, if such resulting, surviving
or transferee Person is otherwise eligible hereunder, be the successor Trustee;
provided, however, that such Person shall be otherwise qualified and eligible
under this Article Seven.

                                       62
<PAGE>

            SECTION 7.10. Eligibility; Disqualification. This Indenture shall
always have a Trustee who satisfies the requirement of TIA ss.ss. 310(a)(1),
310(a)(2), if applicable, and 310(a)(5). The Trustee shall be a commercial bank
with trust powers or a trust company, which shall have (or, in the case of a
financial institution, commercial bank with trust powers or a trust company
included in a bank holding company system, the related bank holding company
shall have) a combined capital and surplus of at least $50,000,000 as set forth
in its most recent published annual report of condition, and subject to
supervision or examination by federal or state authorities, so long as any of
the Securities are outstanding. The Trustee shall comply with TIA ss. 310(b);
provided, however, that there shall be excluded from the operation of TIA ss.
310(b)(1) any indenture or indentures under which other securities, or
certificates of interest or participation in other securities, of the Company
are outstanding, if the requirements for such exclusion set forth in TIA ss.
310(b)(1) are met.

            SECTION 7.11. Preferential Collection of Claims Against Company. The
Trustee shall comply with TIA ss. 311(a), excluding any creditor relationship
listed in TIA ss. 311(b). A Trustee who has resigned or been removed shall be
subject to TIA ss. 311(a) to the extent indicated therein. The provisions of TIA
ss. 311 shall apply to the Company and any other obligor of the Securities.

                                   ARTICLE 8

                       Discharge of Indenture; Defeasance
                       ----------------------------------

            SECTION 8.01. Termination of the Company's Obligations. The Company
may terminate all of its obligations under this Indenture (except as provided
below) when

            (i) all outstanding Securities theretofore authenticated have been
      delivered to the Trustee for cancellation and the Company has paid or
      caused to be paid all sums payable under this Indenture by the Company; or

            (ii) the Company has called for redemption pursuant to this
      Indenture all of the Securities under arrangements satisfactory to the
      Trustee, deposited the amounts described in Section 8.03(a), satisfied the
      conditions in clauses (i) and (ii) of the proviso to Section 8.03(a) and
      delivered the Officers' Certificate and Opinion of Counsel described in
      Section 8.03(g).

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by
clause (ii) above need not be delivered if all Securities not theretofore
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and payable, (ii)
will become due and payable on the maturity date within one year or (iii) are to
be called for redemption within one year under arrangements satisfactory to the
Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the Trustee in the name, and
at the expense, of the Company.

            Notwithstanding the first paragraph of this Section 8.01, the
Company's obligations in Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08, 4.01, 4.02, 7.07, 8.05
and 8.06 shall survive until the Securities are no longer outstanding pursuant
to the last paragraph of Section 2.08.

                                       63
<PAGE>

After the Securities are no longer outstanding, only the Company's obligations
in Sections 7.07, 8.05 and 8.06 shall survive.

            After such delivery or irrevocable deposit, the Trustee shall
acknowledge in writing the discharge of the Company's and Guarantors'
obligations under the Securities and this Indenture except for those surviving
obligations specified above.

            SECTION 8.02. Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance. (a) The
Company may, at its option by Board Resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Company, at any time, elect to have either paragraph (b) or (c) below be applied
to all outstanding Securities upon compliance with the conditions set forth in
Section 8.03.

            (b) Upon the Company's exercise under paragraph (a) hereof of the
option applicable to this paragraph (b), the Company and each Guarantor shall,
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.03, be
deemed to have been discharged from its obligations with respect to all
outstanding Securities on the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied
(hereinafter, "Legal Defeasance"). For this purpose, Legal Defeasance means that
the Company shall be deemed to have paid and discharged the entire Indebtedness
represented by the outstanding Securities, which shall thereafter be deemed to
be "outstanding" only for the purposes of Section 8.04 and the other Sections of
this Indenture referred to in (i) and (ii) below, and to have satisfied all its
other obligations under such Securities and this Indenture (and the Trustee, on
demand of and at the expense of the Company, shall execute proper instruments
acknowledging the same), and Holders of the Securities and any amounts deposited
under Section 8.03 shall cease to be subject to any other obligations, except
for the following provisions, which shall survive until otherwise terminated or
discharged hereunder: (i) the rights of Holders of outstanding Securities to
receive solely from the trust fund described in Section 8.04, and as more fully
set forth in such Section, payments in respect of the principal of and interest
on such Securities when such payments are due, (ii) the Company's obligations
with respect to such Securities under Sections 2.05, 2.06, 2.07, 2.08 and 4.02,
(iii) the rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee under this Indenture
and (iv) this Article Eight. Subject to compliance with this Section 8.02, the
Company may exercise its option under this paragraph (b) notwithstanding the
prior exercise of its option under paragraph (c) hereof.

            (c) Upon the Company's exercise under paragraph (a) hereof of the
option applicable to this paragraph (c), the Company shall, subject to the
satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.03, be released from its
Obligations under the covenants contained in Sections 4.03, 4.04 and 4.12
through 4.19 and Article Five with respect to the outstanding Securities on and
after the date the conditions set forth below are satisfied (hereinafter,
"Covenant Defeasance"), and the Securities shall thereafter be deemed not
"outstanding" for the purposes of any direction, waiver, consent or declaration
or act of Holders (and the consequences of any thereof) in connection with such
covenants, but shall continue to be deemed "outstanding" for all other purposes
hereunder (it being understood that such Securities shall not be deemed
outstanding for accounting purposes) and Holders of the Securities and any
amounts deposited under Section 8.03 shall cease to be subject to any other
obligations. For this purpose, such Covenant Defeasance means that, with respect
to the outstanding Securities, the Company may omit to comply with and shall
have no liability in

                                       64
<PAGE>

respect of any term, condition or limitation set forth in any such covenant,
whether directly or indirectly, by reason of any reference elsewhere herein to
any such covenant or by reason of any reference in any such covenant to any
other provision herein or in any other document and such omission to comply
shall not constitute a Default or an Event of Default under Section 6.01(c),
but, except as specified above, the remainder of this Indenture and such
Securities shall be unaffected thereby. In addition, upon the Company's exercise
under paragraph (a) hereof of the option applicable to this paragraph (c),
subject to the satisfaction of the conditions set forth in Section 8.03,
Sections 6.01(c), 6.01(d), 6.01(e) and 6.01(h) shall not constitute Events of
Default.

            SECTION 8.03. Conditions to Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance.
The following shall be the conditions to the application of either Section
8.02(b) or 8.02(c) to the outstanding Securities:

            (a) the Company irrevocably deposits, or causes to be deposited,
with the Trustee, in trust for the benefit of the Holders pursuant to an
irrevocable trust and security agreement in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee (i) U.S. Legal Tender, (ii) U.S. Government
Obligations or (iii) a combination thereof, in an amount sufficient after
payment of all federal, state and local taxes or other charges or assessments in
respect thereof payable by the Trustee, which through the payment of interest
and principal will provide, not later than one day before the due date of
payment in respect of the Securities, U.S. Legal Tender in an amount which, in
the opinion of a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants expressed in a written certification thereof (in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee) delivered to the Trustee, is sufficient
to pay the principal of and interest on the Securities then outstanding on the
dates on which any such payments are due and payable in accordance with the
terms of this Indenture and of the Securities; provided, however, that (i) the
trustee of the irrevocable trust shall have been irrevocably instructed to pay
such money or the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to the Trustee;
and (ii) the Trustee shall have been irrevocably instructed to apply such U.S.
Legal Tender or the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations to the payment
of said principal and interest with respect to the Securities;

            (b) in the case of Legal Defeasance, the Company shall have
delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel from independent counsel
reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee or a tax ruling from the Internal Revenue
Service to the effect that the Holders will not recognize income, gain or loss
for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and Legal Defeasance
and will be subject to federal income tax in the same amounts and in the same
manner and at the same times as would have been the case if such deposit and
Legal Defeasance had not occurred;

            (c) in the case of Covenant Defeasance, the Company shall have
delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel in the United States reasonably
acceptable to the Trustee confirming that the Holders will not recognize income,
gain or loss for federal income tax purposes as a result of such deposit and
Covenant Defeasance and will be subject to federal income tax at the same
amounts and in the same manner and at the same times as would have been the case
if such deposit and Covenant Defeasance had not occurred;


                                       65
<PAGE>

            (d) no Default or Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing on the date of such deposit (other than a Default or Event of Default
with respect to this Indenture resulting from the incurrence of Indebtedness all
or a portion of which will be used to defease the Securities concurrently with
such incurrence);

            (e) such Legal Defeasance or Covenant Defeasance shall not result in
a default under this Indenture or any other material agreement or instrument to
which the Company is a party or by which the Company is bound;

            (f) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that after the 91st day following the deposit, such money
or the proceeds of such U.S. Government Obligations will not be subject to the
effect of any applicable Bankruptcy Law; and

            (g) the Company shall have delivered to the Trustee an Officers'
Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel, each in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, each stating that all conditions precedent relating
to the satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture have been complied with or
waived.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Opinion of Counsel required by
clauses (b), (c) and (f) above need not be delivered if all Securities not
theretofore delivered to the Trustee for cancellation (i) have become due and
payable, (ii) will become due and payable on the maturity date within one year
or (iii) are to be called for redemption within one year under arrangements
satisfactory to the Trustee for the giving of notice of redemption by the
Trustee in the name, and at the expense, of the Company.

            SECTION 8.04. Application of Trust Money. The Trustee or Paying
Agent shall hold in trust U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations
deposited with it pursuant to this Article Eight, and shall apply the deposited
U.S. Legal Tender and the U.S. Legal Tender from U.S. Government Obligations in
accordance with this Indenture to the payment of principal of and interest on
the Securities. The Trustee shall be under no obligation to invest said U.S.
Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations except as it may agree with the
Company.

            The Company shall pay and indemnify the Trustee against any tax, fee
or other charge imposed on or assessed against the U.S. Legal Tender or U.S.
Government Obligations deposited pursuant to Section 8.03 or the principal and
interest received in respect thereof other than any such tax, fee or other
charge which by law is for the account of the Holders of the outstanding
Securities.

            Anything in this Article Eight to the contrary notwithstanding, the
Trustee shall deliver or pay to the Company from time to time upon the Company's
request any U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations held by it as
provided in Section 8.03 which, in the opinion of a nationally recognized firm
of independent public accountants expressed in a written certification thereof
delivered to the Trustee, are in excess of the amount thereof that would then be
required to be deposited to effect an equivalent Legal Defeasance or Covenant
Defeasance.


                                       66
<PAGE>

            SECTION 8.05. Repayment to the Company. Subject to Section 8.01, the
Trustee and the Paying Agent shall promptly pay to the Company upon request any
excess U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations held by them at any time
and thereupon shall be relieved from all liability with respect to such money.
The Trustee and the Paying Agent shall pay to the Company upon request any money
held by them for the payment of principal or interest that remains unclaimed for
one year; provided that the Trustee or such Paying Agent, before being required
to make any payment, may at the expense of the Company cause to be published
once in a newspaper of general circulation in The City of New York or mail to
each Holder entitled to such money notice that such money remains unclaimed and
that after a date specified therein which shall be at least 30 days from the
date of such publication or mailing any unclaimed balance of such money then
remaining will be repaid to the Company. After payment to the Company, Holders
entitled to such money must look to the Company for payment as general creditors
unless an applicable law abandoned property designates another Person.

            SECTION 8.06. Reinstatement. If the Trustee or Paying Agent is
unable to apply any U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations in
accordance with Article Eight by reason of any legal proceeding or by reason of
any order or judgment of any court or governmental authority enjoining,
restraining or otherwise prohibiting such application, the Company's Obligations
under this Indenture and the Securities shall be revived and reinstated as
though no deposit had occurred pursuant to Article Eight until such time as the
Trustee or Paying Agent is permitted to apply all such U.S. Legal Tender or U.S.
Government Obligations in accordance with Article Eight; provided that if the
Company has made any payment of interest on or principal of any Securities
because of the reinstatement of its Obligations, the Company shall be subrogated
to the rights of the Holders of such Securities to receive such payment from the
U.S. Legal Tender or U.S. Government Obligations held by the Trustee or Paying
Agent.

                                    ARTICLE 9

                       Amendments, Supplements and Waivers
                       -----------------------------------

            SECTION 9.01. Without Consent of Holders. The Company and the
Trustee, together, may amend or supplement this Indenture or the Securities
without notice to or consent of any Securityholder:

            (1) to cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency so long as such
      change does not adversely affect the rights of any Holders in any material
      respect;

            (2) to evidence the succession in accordance with Article Five
      hereof of another Person to the Company and the assumption by any such
      successor of the covenants of the Company herein and in the Securities;

            (3) to provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in
      place of certificated Securities;


                                       67
<PAGE>

            (4) to comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection
      with the qualification of this Indenture under the TIA;

            (5) to make any change that would provide any additional benefit or
      rights to the Securityholders or that does not adversely affect the rights
      of any Holder in any material respect;

            (6) to add a Guarantor;

            (7) to make any change to Article 10 or Article 12 that would limit
      or terminate the benefits available to any holder of Senior Debt or
      Guarantor Senior Debt under Article 10 or Article 12, respectively; or

            (8) to secure the Securities and the Guarantees;

provided that the Company has delivered to the Trustee an Opinion of Counsel and
an Officers' Certificate, each stating that such amendment or supplement
complies with the provisions of this Section 9.01.

            SECTION 9.02. With Consent of Holders. Subject to Section 6.07, the
Company and the Trustee, together, with the written consent of the Holder or
Holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount, unless a greater
principal amount is specified herein, of the outstanding Securities, may amend
or supplement this Indenture or the Securities, without notice to any other
Securityholders. Subject to Section 6.07, the Holder or Holders of a majority in
aggregate principal amount, unless a greater principal amount is specified
herein, of the outstanding Securities may waive compliance by the Company with
any provision of this Indenture or the Securities without notice to any other
Securityholder. Without the consent of each Securityholder affected, however, no
amendment, supplement or waiver, including a waiver pursuant to Section 6.04,
may:

            (1) reduce the amount of Securities whose Holders must consent to an
      amendment, supplement or waiver;

            (2) reduce the rate of or extend the time for payment of interest,
      including defaulted interest, on any Securities;

            (3) reduce the principal of or change or have the effect of changing
      the fixed maturity of any Securities, or change the date on which any
      Securities may be subject to redemption, or reduce the redemption price
      therefor;

            (4) make any Securities payable in money other than that stated in
      the Securities;

            (5) make any change in provisions of this Indenture protecting the
      right of each Holder to receive payment of principal of and interest on
      such Security on or after the due date thereof or to bring suit to enforce
      such payment, or permitting Holders of a majority in principal amount of
      the Securities to waive Defaults or

                                       68
<PAGE>

      Events of Default (other than Defaults or Events of Default with respect
      to the payment of principal of or interest on the Securities); or

            (6) adversely affect the ranking of the Securities or the
      Guarantees.

            In addition, following the occurrence of a Change of Control or an
Asset Sale (if the Company is obligated to make and consummate a Net Proceeds
Offer as a result of such Asset Sale), as the case may be, without the consent
of Holders of at least 75% of the outstanding aggregate principal amount of
Securities, an amendment, supplement or waiver may not make any change to the
Company's obligations to make and consummate the required Change of Control
Offer or Net Proceeds Offer, as the case may be, or modify any of the provisions
or definitions with respect thereto.

            It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Holders under this
Section 9.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment,
supplement or waiver, but it shall be sufficient if such consent approves the
substance thereof.

            After an amendment, supplement or waiver under this Section 9.02
becomes effective, the Company shall mail to the Holders affected thereby a
notice briefly describing the amendment, supplement or waiver. Any failure of
the Company to mail such notice, or any defect therein, shall not, however, in
any way impair or affect the validity of any such amendment, supplement, waiver
or supplemental indenture.

            SECTION 9.03. Compliance with TIA. From the date on which this
Indenture is qualified under the TIA, every amendment, waiver or supplement of
this Indenture or the Securities shall comply with the TIA as then in effect.

            SECTION 9.04. Revocation and Effect of Consents. Until an amendment,
waiver or supplement becomes effective, a consent to it by a Holder is a
continuing consent by the Holder and every subsequent Holder of a Security or
portion of a Security that evidences the same debt as the consenting Holder's
Security, even if notation of the consent is not made on any Security. However,
any such Holder or subsequent Holder may revoke the consent as to his Security
or portion of his Security by notice to the Trustee or the Company received
before the date on which the Trustee receives an Officers' Certificate
certifying that the Holders of the requisite principal amount of Securities have
consented (and not theretofore revoked such consent) to the amendment,
supplement or waiver.

            The Company may, but shall not be obligated to, fix a record date
for the purpose of determining the Holders entitled to consent to any amendment,
supplement or waiver. If a record date is fixed, then notwithstanding the last
sentence of the immediately preceding paragraph, those Persons who were Holders
at such record date (or their duly designated proxies), and only those Persons,
shall be entitled to revoke any consent previously given, whether or not such
Persons continue to be Holders after such record date. No such consent shall be
valid or effective for more than 90 days after such record date.

            SECTION 9.05. Notation on or Exchange of Securities. If an
amendment, supplement or waiver changes the terms of a Security, the Company may
require the Holder

                                       69
<PAGE>

of the Security to deliver it to the Trustee. The Trustee may place an
appropriate notation on the Security about the changed terms and return it to
the Holder. Alternatively, if the Company or the Trustee so determines, the
Company in exchange for the Security shall issue and the Trustee shall
authenticate a new Security that reflects the changed terms. Failure to make the
appropriate notation or issue a new Security shall not affect the validity and
effect of such amendment, supplement or waiver.

            SECTION 9.06. Trustee to Sign Amendments, etc. The Trustee shall
execute any amendment, supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article
Nine; provided that the Trustee may, but shall not be obligated to, execute any
such amendment, supplement or waiver which affects the Trustee's own rights,
duties or immunities under this Indenture. The Trustee shall be entitled to
receive, and shall be fully protected in relying upon, an Opinion of Counsel and
an Officers' Certificate each stating that the execution of any amendment,
supplement or waiver authorized pursuant to this Article Nine is authorized or
permitted by this Indenture and constitutes the legal, valid and binding
obligations of the Company enforceable in accordance with its terms (subject to
customary exceptions).

                                   ARTICLE 10

                           Subordination of Securities
                           ---------------------------

            SECTION 10.01. Securities Subordinated to Senior Debt. The Company
covenants and agrees, and the Trustee and each Holder by accepting a Security
likewise covenants and agrees, that all Securities shall be issued subject to
the provisions of this Article Ten; and each Person holding any Security,
whether upon original issue or upon transfer, assignment or exchange thereof,
accepts and agrees that all payments of the principal of and interest on the
Securities by the Company shall, to the extent and in the manner set forth in
this Article Ten, be subordinated and junior in right of payment to the prior
payment in full in cash of all amounts payable under Senior Debt, whether
outstanding on the Issue Date or thereafter incurred.

            SECTION 10.02. No Payment on Securities in Certain Circumstances.
(a) No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of the Company of principal of
or interest on the Securities, including any deposit to the defeasance trust
pursuant to Section 8.03, whether pursuant to the terms of the Securities, upon
acceleration, pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or Change of Control Offer or
otherwise, shall be made to the Holders (except that Holders may receive and
retain payments made from the defeasance trust described under Article Eight) if
(i) a default in the payment of the principal of or interest on Designated
Senior Debt occurs and is continuing beyond any applicable period of grace or
(ii) any other default occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated
Senior Debt that permits holders of the Designated Senior Debt as to which such
default relates to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a written
notice of such other default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from the Company or
the holders of any Designated Senior Debt (with a copy to the Company) until all
Obligations with respect to such Designated Senior Debt are paid in full in
cash; provided, that payments on the Securities shall be resumed (x) in the case
of a payment default, upon the date on which such default is cured, waived or
ceases to exist and (y) in case of a nonpayment default, the earlier of the date
on which such nonpayment default

                                       70
<PAGE>

is cured, waived or ceases to exist and 179 days after the date on which the
applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received by the Trustee (such period being
referred to herein as the "Payment Blockage Period"), unless the maturity of any
Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated (and written notice of such
acceleration has been received by the Trustee).

            Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Securities to the
contrary, (x) in no event shall a Payment Blockage Period extend beyond 179 days
from the date the Payment Blockage Notice in respect thereof was given and (y)
not more than one Payment Blockage Period may be commenced with respect to the
Securities during any period of 360 consecutive days. No nonpayment default that
existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Payment Blockage Notice
to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Payment Blockage
Notice (it being understood that any subsequent action, or any breach of any
covenant for a period commencing after the date of receipt by the Trustee of
such Payment Blockage Notice, that, in either case, would give rise to such a
default pursuant to any provisions under which a default previously existed or
was continuing shall constitute a new default for this purpose).

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment
shall be received by the Trustee or any Holder when such payment is prohibited
by Section 10.02(a), such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and
shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Designated Senior Debt or
their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees under any
indenture pursuant to which any of such Designated Senior Debt may have been
issued, as their respective interests may appear, but only to the extent that,
upon notice from the Trustee to the holders of Designated Senior Debt that such
prohibited payment has been made, the holders of such Designated Senior Debt (or
their representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee in
writing of the amounts then due and owing on the Designated Senior Debt, if any,
and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall be paid to
the holders of Designated Senior Debt.

            SECTION 10.03. Payment Over of Proceeds upon Dissolution, etc. (a)
Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Company of any
kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, upon any dissolution
or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary
or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar
proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the
Company's assets, the holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be entitled to
receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior
Debt before the Holders or the Trustee on behalf of such Holders shall be
entitled to receive any payment by the Company of the principal of or interest
on the Securities, or any payment by the Company to acquire any of the
Securities for cash, property or securities, or any distribution with respect to
the Securities of any cash, property or securities (except that the Holders may
receive and retain (I) Permitted Junior Securities and (II) payments made from
the defeasance trust described under Article Eight). Before any payment (other
than Permitted Junior Securities or by virtue of the defeasance trust) may be
made by, or on behalf of, the Company of the principal of or interest on the
Securities upon any such dissolution or winding-up or liquidation or
reorganization, any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the
Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,

                                       71
<PAGE>

property or securities, to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee on
their behalf would be entitled, but for the subordination provisions of this
Indenture, shall be made by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in
bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or
distribution, directly to the holders of the Senior Debt (pro rata to such
holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Debt held by such
holders) or their representatives or to the trustee or trustees or agent or
agents under any agreement or indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior
Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the
extent necessary to pay all such Senior Debt in full in cash after giving effect
to any prior or concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for
the holders of such Senior Debt.

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision
prohibiting such payment or distribution, any payment or distribution of assets
or securities of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property
or securities, shall be received by the Trustee or any Holder of Securities at a
time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 10.03(a) and
before all Obligations in respect of Senior Debt are paid in full in cash, or
payment provided for, such payment or distribution shall be received and held in
trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of
Senior Debt of the Company (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the
respective amounts of Senior Debt held by such holders) or their respective
representatives, or to the trustee or trustees or agent or agents under any
indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Debt may have been issued, as
their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of Senior
Debt remaining unpaid until all such Senior Debt has been paid in full in cash
after giving effect to any prior or concurrent payment, distribution or
provision therefor to or for the holders of such Senior Debt; provided that the
Trustee shall be entitled to receive from the holders of such Senior Debt
written notice of the amounts owing on such Senior Debt.

            The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the Company
with or into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the Company
following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or
substantially as an entirety, to another Person upon the terms and conditions
provided in Article Five shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 10.03 if such
other Person shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or
transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article Five.

            SECTION 10.04. Subrogation. Upon the payment in full in cash of all
Senior Debt of the Company, or provision for payment, the Holders of the
Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Debt to
receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company
made on such Senior Debt until the principal of and interest on the Securities
shall be paid in full in cash; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no
payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Debt of any cash,
property or securities to which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee on
their behalf would be entitled except for the provisions of this Article Ten,
and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article Ten to the
holders of Senior Debt by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee on their
behalf shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of Senior
Debt, and the Holders of the Securities, be deemed to be a payment by

                                       72
<PAGE>

the Company to or on account of the Senior Debt. It is understood that the
provisions of this Article Ten are and are intended solely for the purpose of
defining the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand,
and the holders of the Senior Debt, on the other hand.

            If any payment or distribution to which the Holders of the
Securities would otherwise have been entitled but for the provisions of this
Article Ten shall have been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this Article
Ten, to the payment of all amounts payable under Senior Debt, then and in such
case, the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to receive from the
holders of such Senior Debt any payments or distributions received by such
holders of any Senior Debt in excess of the amount required to make payment in
full, or provision for payment, of such Senior Debt.

            SECTION 10.05. Obligations of Company Unconditional. Nothing
contained in this Article Ten or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the
Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company and the
Holders of the Securities, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of and
interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in
accordance with their terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative
rights of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the Company other than
the holders of Senior Debt, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the
Holder of any Security or the Trustee on their behalf from exercising all
remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under this
Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article Ten of the holders
of Senior Debt in respect of cash, property or securities of the Company
received upon the exercise of any such remedy.

            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing contained
in this Article Ten shall restrict the right of the Trustee or the Holders of
Securities to take any action to declare the Securities to be due and payable
prior to their stated maturity pursuant to Article Six or to pursue any rights
or remedies hereunder; provided, however, that all Senior Debt then due and
payable shall first be paid in full before the Holders of the Securities or the
Trustee are entitled to receive any direct or indirect payment from the Company
of principal of or interest on the Securities.

            SECTION 10.06. Notice to Trustee. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would
prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the
Securities pursuant to the provisions of this Article Ten. The Trustee shall not
be charged with knowledge of the existence of any event of default with respect
to any Senior Debt or of any other facts which would prohibit the making of any
payment to or by the Trustee unless and until the Trustee shall have received
notice in writing at its Corporate Trust Office to that effect signed by an
Officer of the Company, or by a holder of Senior Debt or trustee or agent
therefor; and prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee
shall, subject to Article Seven, be entitled to assume that no such facts exist;
provided that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in
this Section 10.06 at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by
the terms of this Indenture any moneys shall become payable for any purpose
(including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of or interest on
any Security), then,

                                       73
<PAGE>

regardless of anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee shall have full power
and authority to receive any moneys from the Company and to apply the same to
the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be affected by any
notice to the contrary which may be received by it on or after such prior date.
Nothing contained in this Section 10.06 shall limit the right of the holders of
Senior Debt to recover payments as contemplated by Section 10.03. The Trustee
shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a written notice by a Person
representing himself or itself to be a holder of any Senior Debt (or a trustee
on behalf of, or other representative of, such holder) to establish that such
notice has been given by a holder of such Senior Debt or a trustee or
representative on behalf of any such holder.

            In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that any
evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of
Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this
Article Ten, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Debt held by
such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in such
payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of such
Person under this Article Ten, and if such evidence is not furnished, the
Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial determination as
to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

            SECTION 10.07. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities
referred to in this Article Ten, the Trustee and the Holders of the Securities
shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of
competent jurisdiction in which bankruptcy, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation
or reorganization proceedings are pending, or upon a certificate of the
receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders
of the Securities for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to
participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other
Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount
or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or
to this Article Ten.

            SECTION 10.08. Trustee's Relation to Senior Debt. The Trustee and
any Paying Agent shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article
Ten with respect to any Senior Debt which may at any time be held by it in its
individual or any other capacity to the same extent as any other holder of
Senior Debt, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee or any
Paying Agent of any of its rights as such holder.

            With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee undertakes
to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations as are
specifically set forth in this Article Ten, and no implied covenants or
obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt shall be read into this
Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any
fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt. The Trustee shall not be liable to
any such holders if the Trustee shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or
distribute to Holders of Securities or to the Company or to any other Person
cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be
entitled by virtue of this Article Ten or otherwise.

            SECTION 10.09. Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or
Omissions of the Company or Holders of Senior Debt. No right of any present or
future holders of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as provided herein
shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act, including any
amendment to this Article Ten without the consent of the holders of such Senior
Debt, or failure to act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to
act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company
with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any
such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. The provisions of this
Article Ten are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
directly by, the holders of Senior Debt.

            SECTION 10.10. Securityholders Authorize Trustee to Effectuate
Subordination of Securities. Each Holder of Securities by his acceptance of such
Securities authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on its or his behalf to
take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
subordination provided in this Article Ten, and appoints the Trustee its or his
attorney-in-fact for such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company (whether in bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership, reorganization or similar proceedings or upon an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise) tending towards
liquidation of the business and assets of the Company, the filing of a claim for
the unpaid balance of its or his Securities in the form required in those
proceedings.

            SECTION 10.11. This Article Not to Prevent Events of Default. The
failure to make a payment on account of principal of or interest on the
Securities by reason of any provision of this Article Ten shall not be construed
as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in Section 6.01.

            SECTION 10.12. Trustee's Compensation Not Prejudiced. Nothing in
this Article Ten shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to other
sections in this Indenture.

            SECTION 10.13. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. Without in any
way limiting the generality of Section 10.09, the holders of Senior Debt may, at
any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee
or the Holders of the Securities, without incurring responsibility to the
Holders of the Securities and without impairing or releasing the subordination
provided in this Article Ten or the obligations hereunder of the Holders of the
Securities to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following:
(a) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment
of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any
agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding or secured; (b) sell, exchange,
release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise
securing Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the
collection of Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any
rights against the Company and any other Person.

            SECTION 10.14. Subordination Provisions Not Applicable to Assets
Held in Trust for Securityholders; Payments May be Paid Prior to Dissolution.
All money and United States Government Obligations deposited in trust with the
Trustee pursuant to and in

                                       75
<PAGE>

accordance with Article Eight shall be for the sole benefit of the Holders and
shall not be subject to this Article Ten.

            Nothing contained in this Article Ten or elsewhere in this Indenture
shall prevent (i) the Company, except under the conditions described in Section
10.02, from making payments of principal of and interest on the Securities, or
from depositing with the Trustee any moneys for such payments or from effecting
a termination of the Company's and the Guarantors' Obligations under the
Securities and this Indenture as provided in Article Eight or (ii) the
application by the Trustee of any moneys deposited with it for the purpose of
making such payments of principal of and interest on the Securities, to the
Holders entitled thereto unless at least two Business Days prior to the date
upon which such payment becomes due and payable, the Trustee shall have received
the written notice provided for in Section 10.02(b) or in Section 10.06. The
Company shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of the Company.

            SECTION 10.15. Acceleration of Securities. If payment of the
Securities is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company (or the
Trustee at the direction of the Company) shall promptly notify the holders of
Designated Senior Debt of the Company (or the representative of such Designated
Senior Debt) of the acceleration.

                                   ARTICLE 11

                             Guarantee of Securities
                             -----------------------

            SECTION 11.01. Unconditional Guarantee. Each of the Guarantors
hereby, jointly and severally and unconditionally guarantees, on a senior
subordinated basis (such guarantee to be referred to herein as a "Guarantee") to
each Holder of a Security authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the
Trustee and its successors and assigns that: (a) the principal of and interest
on the Securities shall be promptly paid in full when due (subject to any
applicable grace periods) whether at maturity, upon redemption, upon repurchase
at the option of Holders pursuant to the provisions of the Securities relating
thereto, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and
(to the extent permitted by law) interest, if any, on the Securities and all
other Obligations of the Company to the Holders or the Trustee hereunder or
thereunder (including amounts due the Trustee under Section 7.07 hereof) and all
other Obligations shall be promptly paid in full or performed, all in accordance
with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case of any extension of time of
payment or renewal of any Securities or any of such other Obligations, the same
shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed in accordance with the
terms of the extension or renewal, subject to any applicable grace period,
whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise, subject, however, in the case
of (a) and (b) to the limitations set forth in Section 11.04. Failing payment
when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing performance of any other
obligation of the Company to the Holders under this Indenture or under the
Securities, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be obligated to pay, or to
perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. An Event of Default
under this Indenture or the Securities shall constitute an event of default
under this Guarantee, and shall entitle the Holders of Securities to accelerate
the Obligations of the Guarantors hereunder in the same manner and to the same
extent as the Obligations of the Company.


                                       76
<PAGE>

            Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Obligations hereunder
shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Securities or this Indenture, the absence of any action to
enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any Holder of the Securities with
respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other Guarantor,
the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to enforce the
same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular Security, or any
other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal or equitable
discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each of the Guarantors hereby waives the
benefit of diligence, presentment, demand of payment, filing of claims with a
court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the Company, any right to
require a proceeding first against the Company, protest, notice and all demands
whatsoever and covenants that its Guarantee shall not be discharged except by
complete performance of the Obligations contained in the Securities, this
Indenture and this Guarantee. This Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not
of collection. If any Holder or the Trustee is required by any court or
otherwise to return to the Company or to any Guarantor, or any custodian,
trustee, liquidator or other similar official acting in relation to the Company
or such Guarantor, any amount paid by the Company or such Guarantor to the
Trustee or such Holder, this Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged,
shall be reinstated in full force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees
that, as between it, on the one hand, and the Holders of Securities and the
Trustee, on the other hand, (a) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed
hereby may be accelerated as provided in Article Six for the purposes of this
Guarantee, notwithstanding any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing
such acceleration in respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in
the event of any acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article Six
hereof, such Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become
due and payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee.

            No stockholder, officer, director, employee, agent or incorporator,
past, present or future, of any Guarantor, as such, shall have any personal
liability under this Guarantee by reason of his, her or its status as such
stockholder, officer, director, employee, agent or incorporator.

            Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its
Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an
amount pro rata, based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in
accordance with GAAP.

            SECTION 11.02. Limitations on Guarantees. The Obligations of each
Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited to the maximum amount which, after
giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor
and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf
of any other Guarantor in respect of the Obligations of such other Guarantor
under its Guarantee or pursuant to its contribution Obligations under this
Indenture, will result in the Obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee
not constituting a fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under any laws
of the United States, any state or territory of the United States or the
District of Columbia.

            SECTION 11.03. Execution and Delivery.


                                       77
<PAGE>

            Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Guarantee set forth in
Section 11.01 shall remain in full force and effect (unless released in
accordance with Section 11.04) notwithstanding any failure to endorse on any
Security a notation of such Guarantee.

            If an Officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture no
longer holds that or any office at the time the Trustee authenticates any
Security, such Guarantor's Guarantee of such Security shall be valid
nevertheless.

            The delivery of any Security by the Trustee, after the
authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any Guarantee
set forth in this Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor.

            SECTION 11.04. Release of a Guarantor. (a) Upon (i) the sale or
disposition of all of the Capital Stock of a Guarantor by the Company in
compliance with Section 4.16 or the consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with
or into any Person in compliance with Article Five, in each case, (A) other than
to the Company or an Affiliate of the Company and (B) in a transaction following
which all liability of such Guarantor with respect to Indebtedness of the
Company shall have been released by the holders of such Indebtedness, (ii) the
liquidation or dissolution of any Guarantor in accordance with this Indenture or
(iii) a Guarantor ceasing to be a Restricted Subsidiary, such Guarantor's
Guarantee pursuant to this Article Eleven shall be released, and such Guarantor
shall be deemed released from all Obligations under this Indenture and the
Securities without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any
Holder. Any Guarantor not so released or the entity surviving such Guarantor, as
applicable, shall remain or be liable under its Guarantee as provided in this
Article Eleven. Concurrently with the defeasance or satisfaction and discharge
of the Securities under Article Eight hereof, the Guarantors shall be released
from all of their obligations under this Indenture and the Securities. In
addition, a Guarantor's Guarantee will also be released and such Guarantor will
also be released from all Obligations under this Indenture and the Securities if
such Guarantor (1) is released from any and all guarantees of Indebtedness of
the Company and (2) has no other outstanding Indebtedness other than
Indebtedness which could be incurred by a Restricted Subsidiary that is not a
Guarantor of the Securities on the date of the proposed release of such
Guarantor's Guarantee.

            (b) The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing
the release of a Guarantor upon receipt of a request by the Company or such
Guarantor accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and, upon request, an Opinion
of Counsel certifying as to the compliance with this Section 11.04; provided the
legal counsel delivering such Opinion of Counsel may rely as to matters of fact
on one or more Officers' Certificates of the Company.

            The Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably requested by the
Company or a Guarantor in order to evidence the release of such Guarantor from
its Obligations under its Guarantee pursuant to this Article Eleven.

            Except as set forth in Articles Four and Five and this Section
11.04, nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Securities shall
prevent any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or
another Guarantor or shall prevent any

                                       78
<PAGE>

sale or conveyance of the property of a Guarantor as an entirety or
substantially as an entirety to the Company or another Guarantor.

            SECTION 11.05. Waiver of Subrogation. Until this Indenture is
discharged and all of the Securities are discharged and paid in full, each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any claim or
other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that
arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Company's
Obligations under the Securities or this Indenture and such Guarantor's
Obligations under its Guarantee under this Indenture, in any such instance
including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution, indemnification, and any right to participate in any
claim or remedy of the Holders against the Company, whether or not such claim,
remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or common law,
including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the Company,
directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in any other
manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights. If any
amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding sentence and
any amounts owing to the Trustee or the Holders of Securities under the
Securities, this Indenture, or any other document or instrument delivered under
or in connection with such agreements or instruments, shall not have been paid
in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such Guarantor
for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Trustee or the
Holders and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the benefit of itself or
such Holders to be credited and applied to the Obligations in favor of the
Trustee or the Holders, as the case may be, whether matured or unmatured, in
accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Each Guarantor acknowledges that it
will receive direct and indirect benefits from the financing arrangements
contemplated by this Indenture and that the waiver set forth in this Section
11.05 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

            SECTION 11.06. Obligations Continuing. Subject to Section 11.04, the
Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing and shall remain in
full force and effect until all the Obligations have been paid and satisfied in
full.

            SECTION 11.07. Obligations Reinstated. Subject to Section 11.04, the
Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall continue to be effective or shall
be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment which would
otherwise have reduced the Obligations of any Guarantor hereunder (whether such
payment shall have been made by or on behalf of the Company or by or on behalf
of a Guarantor) is rescinded or reclaimed from any of the Holders upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any
Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If demand
for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by the Company is stayed upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, all such
Obligations otherwise subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall
nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor as provided herein.

            SECTION 11.08. Waiver. Without in any way limiting the provisions of
Section 11.01, each Guarantor hereby waives notice or proof of reliance by the
Holders upon the Obligations of any Guarantor hereunder, and diligence,
presentment, demand for payment on the Company, protest or notice of dishonor of
any of the Obligations.


                                       79
<PAGE>

            SECTION 11.09. No Obligation to Take Action Against the Company.
Neither the Trustee nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or
exhaust any rights or remedies or to take any other steps under any security for
the Obligations or against the Company or any other Person or any property of
the Company or any other Person before the Trustee is entitled to demand payment
and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and Obligations
under this Indenture.

            SECTION 11.10. Default and Enforcement. If any Guarantor fails to
pay in accordance with Section 11.01, the Trustee may proceed in its name as
trustee hereunder in the enforcement of the Guarantee of any such Guarantor and
such Guarantor's Obligations hereunder by any remedy provided by law, whether by
legal proceedings or otherwise, and to recover from such Guarantor the
Obligations under this Indenture.

            SECTION 11.11. Amendment, Etc. No amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of this Indenture relating to any Guarantor or consent to any
departure by any Guarantor or any other Person from any such provision will in
any event be effective unless it is signed by such Guarantor and the Trustee,
other than a release pursuant to Section 11.04.

            SECTION 11.12. Acknowledgment. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges
communication of the terms of this Indenture and the Securities and consents to
and approves of the same.

            SECTION 11.13. Costs and Expenses. Each Guarantor shall pay on
demand by the Trustee any and all reasonable costs, fees and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and disbursements)
incurred by the Trustee, its agents, advisors and counsel or any of the Holders
in enforcing any of their rights under any Guarantee.

            SECTION 11.14. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to
exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the Holders,
any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Indenture or the Securities,
shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Indenture or the Securities
preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any other
right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and privileges
in the Guarantee under this Indenture, the Securities and any other document or
instrument between a Guarantor and/or the Company and the Trustee are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privilege provided by law.

            SECTION 11.15. Successors and Assigns. Each Guarantee shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Guarantor and the Trustee and the
other Holders and their respective successors and permitted assigns, except that
no Guarantor may assign any of its Obligations hereunder.

            SECTION 11.16. Contribution. In order to provide for just and
equitable contribution among the Guarantors, the Guarantors agree, inter se,
that in the event any payment or distribution is made by any Guarantor (a
"Funding Guarantor") under its Guarantee, such Funding Guarantor shall be
entitled to contribution from all other

                                       80
<PAGE>

Guarantors in a pro rata amount based on the net assets (determined in
accordance with GAAP) of each Guarantor (including the Funding Guarantor) for
all payments, damages and expenses incurred by that Funding Guarantor in
discharging the Company's Obligations with respect to the Securities or any
other Guarantor's Obligations with respect to its Guarantee hereunder.

            SECTION 11.17. Future Guarantors. The Company shall cause each of
the Company's Restricted Subsidiaries to the extent required by Section 4.19, in
each case, to execute and deliver a supplemental indenture in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee and thereby become a Guarantor bound by the
Guarantee of the Securities on the terms set forth in this Article Eleven;
provided that no Subsidiary organized outside the United States of America and
no Unrestricted Subsidiary shall be required to become a Guarantor.

                                   ARTICLE 12

                           Subordination of Guarantee

            SECTION 12.01. Guarantee Obligations Subordinated to Guarantor
Senior Debt. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees, and the Trustee and each
Holder of the Securities by its or his acceptance thereof likewise covenant and
agree, that all Guarantees shall be issued subject to the provisions of this
Article Twelve; and each Person holding any Guarantee, whether upon original
issue or upon transfer, assignment or exchange thereof, accepts and agrees that
all payments of the principal of and interest on the Securities pursuant to the
Guarantee made by or on behalf of such Guarantor shall, to the extent and in the
manner set forth in this Article Twelve, be subordinated and junior in right of
payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all amounts payable under
Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor, whether outstanding on the Issue Date
or thereafter incurred.

            SECTION 12.02. No Payment on Guarantee in Certain Circumstances. (a)
No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of any Guarantor of principal of
or interest on the Securities, whether pursuant to the terms of the Securities
or the Guarantees, including any deposit to the defeasance trust pursuant to
Section 8.03, upon acceleration, pursuant to an Asset Sale Offer or Change of
Control Offer or otherwise, shall be made to the Holders of Securities (except
that holders of Securities may receive and retain payments made from the
defeasance trust described under Article Eight) if (i) a default in the payment
of the principal of or interest on Designated Guarantor Senior Debt occurs and
is continuing beyond any applicable period of grace or (ii) any other default
occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Guarantor Senior Debt that
permits holders of the Designated Guarantor Senior Debt as to which such default
relates to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a written notice of
such other default (a "Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice") from the Company or a
Guarantor or the holders of any Designated Guarantor Senior Debt (with a copy to
the Company) until all Obligations with respect to such Designated Guarantor
Senior Debt are paid in full in cash; provided, that payments on the Securities
shall be resumed (x) in the case of a payment default, upon the date on which
such default is cured, waived or ceases to exist and (y) in case of a nonpayment
default, the earlier of the date on which such nonpayment default is cured,
waived or ceases to exist and 179 days after the date on which the applicable
Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice is received by the Trustee (such period

                                       81
<PAGE>

being referred to herein as the "Guarantor Payment Blockage Period"), unless the
maturity of any Designated Guarantor Senior Debt has been accelerated (and
written notice of such acceleration has been received by the Trustee).

            Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Securities to the
contrary, (x) in no event shall a Guarantor Payment Blockage Period extend
beyond 179 days from the date the Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice in respect
thereof was given and (y) not more than one Guarantor Payment Blockage Period
may be commenced with respect to the Securities during any period of 360
consecutive days. No nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the
date of delivery of any Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall
be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice (it
being understood that any subsequent action, or any breach of any covenant for a
period commencing after the date of receipt by the Trustee of such Guarantor
Payment Blockage Notice, that, in either case, would give rise to such a default
pursuant to any provisions under which a default previously existed or was
continuing shall constitute a new default for this purpose).

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment
shall be received by the Trustee or any Holder when such payment is prohibited
by Section 12.02(a), such payment shall be held in trust for the benefit of, and
shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of such Designated Guarantor
Senior Debt or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees
under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Designated Guarantor Senior
Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, but only to
the extent that, upon notice from the Trustee to the holders of such Designated
Guarantor Senior Debt that such prohibited payment has been made, the holders of
such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt (or their representative or
representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee in writing of the amounts then
due and owing on such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt, if any, and only the
amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall be paid to the holders of
such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt.

            SECTION 12.03. Payment Over of Proceeds upon Dissolution, etc. (a)
Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of any Guarantor of any
kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, upon any dissolution
or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of such Guarantor, whether
voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other
similar proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any
marshaling of such Guarantor's assets, the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt of
such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all
Obligations due in respect of such Guarantor Senior Debt before the Holders of
the Securities or the Trustee on behalf of such Holders shall be entitled to
receive any payment by such Guarantor of the principal of or interest on the
Securities pursuant to its Guarantee, or any payment to acquire any of the
Securities for cash, property or securities, or any distribution with respect to
the Securities of any cash, property or securities (except that Holders may
receive and retain (I) Permitted Junior Securities and (II) payments made from
the defeasance trust described under Article Eight). Before any payment (other
than Permitted Junior Securities or by virtue of the defeasance trust) may be
made by, or on behalf of, any Guarantor of the principal of or interest on the
Securities upon any such dissolution or

                                       82
<PAGE>

winding-up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment or distribution of
assets or securities of such Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in
cash, property or securities, to which the Holders of the Securities or the
Trustee on their behalf would be entitled, but for the subordination provisions
of this Indenture, shall be made by such Guarantor or by any receiver, trustee
in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or
distribution, directly to the holders of the Guarantor Senior Debt of such
Guarantor (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of
such Guarantor Senior Debt held by such holders) or their representatives or to
the trustee or trustees or agent or agents under any agreement or indenture
pursuant to which any such Guarantor Senior Debt may have been issued, as their
respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay all such
Guarantor Senior Debt in full in cash after giving effect to any prior or
concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for the holders of
such Guarantor Senior Debt.

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision
prohibiting such payment or distribution, any payment or distribution of assets
or securities of a Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, property
or securities, shall be received by the Trustee or any Holder of Securities at a
time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 12.03(a) and
before all Obligations in respect of the Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor
are paid in full in cash, or payment provided for, such payment or distribution
shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over
or delivered to, the holders of such Guarantor Senior Debt (pro rata to such
holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Guarantor Senior Debt held by
such holders) or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees
or agent or agents under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Guarantor
Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for
application to the payment of the Guarantor Senior Debt remaining unpaid until
all such Guarantor Senior Debt has been paid in full in cash after giving effect
to any prior or concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for
the holders of such Guarantor Senior Debt; provided that the Trustee shall be
entitled to receive from the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt written notice of
the amounts owing on the Guarantor Senior Debt.

            The consolidation of a Guarantor with, or the merger of a Guarantor
with or into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of a Guarantor
following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety, or
substantially as an entirety, to another Person upon the terms and conditions
provided in Article Five shall not be deemed a dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section 12.03 if such
other Person shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger, conveyance or
transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article Five.

            SECTION 12.04. Subrogation. Upon the payment in full in cash of all
Guarantor Senior Debt of a Guarantor, or provision for payment, the Holders of
the Securities shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Guarantor
Senior Debt to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities
of such Guarantor made on Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor until the
principal of and interest on the Securities shall be paid in full in cash; and,
for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to the
holders of Guarantor Senior Debt of any cash, property or securities to

                                       83
<PAGE>

which the Holders of the Securities or the Trustee on their behalf would be
entitled except for the provisions of this Article Twelve, and no payment over
pursuant to the provisions of this Article Twelve to the holders of the
Guarantor Senior Debt by Holders of the Securities or the Trustee on their
behalf shall, as between such Guarantor, its creditors other than holders of
such Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor, and the Holders of the Securities,
be deemed to be a payment by such Guarantor to or on account of the Guarantor
Senior Debt of such Guarantor. It is understood that the provisions of this
Article Twelve are and are intended solely for the purpose of defining the
relative rights of the Holders of the Securities, on the one hand, and the
holders of Guarantor Senior Debt, on the other hand.

            If any payment or distribution to which the Holders of the
Securities would otherwise have been entitled but for the provisions of this
Article Twelve shall have been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this
Article Twelve, to the payment of all amounts payable under Guarantor Senior
Debt, then and in such case, the Holders of the Securities shall be entitled to
receive from the holders of such Guarantor Senior Debt any payments or
distributions received by such holders of Guarantor Senior Debt in excess of the
amount required to make payment in full, or provision for payment, of such
Guarantor Senior Debt.

            SECTION 12.05. Obligations of Guarantor Unconditional. Nothing
contained in this Article Twelve or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the
Securities is intended to or shall impair, as between any Guarantor and the
Holders of the Securities, the obligation of such Guarantor, which is absolute
and unconditional, to pay to the Holders of the Securities the principal of and
interest on the Securities as and when the same shall become due and payable in
accordance with the terms of its Guarantee, or is intended to or shall affect
the relative rights of the Holders of the Securities and creditors of the
Guarantors other than the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt, nor shall anything
herein or therein prevent the Holder of any Security or the Trustee on their
behalf from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon
default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article
Twelve of the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt in respect of cash, property or
securities of the Guarantors received upon the exercise of any such remedy.

            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing contained
in this Article Twelve shall restrict the right of the Trustee or the Holders of
Securities to take any action to declare the Securities to be due and payable
prior to their stated maturity pursuant to Section 6.01 or to pursue any rights
or remedies hereunder; provided, however, that all Guarantor Senior Debt of any
Guarantor then due and payable shall first be paid in full before the Holders of
the Securities or the Trustee are entitled to receive any direct or indirect
payment from such Guarantor of principal of or interest on the Securities
pursuant to such Guarantor's Guarantee.

            SECTION 12.06. Notice to Trustee. The Company and the Guarantors
shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company
or the Guarantors which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the
Trustee in respect of the Guarantees pursuant to the provisions of this Article
Twelve. The Trustee shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any
event of default with respect to any Guarantor Senior Debt or of any other facts
which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee unless and
until the Trustee shall have received notice in writing at its

                                       84
<PAGE>

Corporate Trust Office to that effect signed by an Officer of the Company or a
Guarantor, or by a holder of Guarantor Senior Debt or trustee or agent therefor;
and prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee shall, subject
to Article Seven, be entitled to assume that no such facts exist; provided that
if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in this Section
12.06 at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms of
this Indenture any moneys shall become payable for any purpose (including,
without limitation, the payment of the principal of or interest on any
Security), then, regardless of anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee
shall have full power and authority to receive any moneys from the Guarantors
and to apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not
be affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it on or
after such prior date. Nothing contained in this Section 12.06 shall limit the
right of the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt to recover payments as
contemplated by Section 12.03. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the
delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself or itself to
be a holder of any Guarantor Senior Debt (or a trustee on behalf of, or other
representative of, such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by
a holder of Guarantor Senior Debt or a trustee or representative on behalf of
any such holder.

            In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that any
evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of
Guarantor Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to
this Article Twelve, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to
the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Guarantor Senior
Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to
participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the
rights of such Person under this Article Twelve, and if such evidence is not
furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial
determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

            SECTION 12.07. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of
any Guarantor referred to in this Article Twelve, the Trustee and the Holders of
the Securities shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any
court of competent jurisdiction in which bankruptcy, dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or upon a certificate of
the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the Holders
of the Securities for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to
participate in such distribution, the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt and other
Indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the
amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent
thereto or to this Article Twelve.

            SECTION 12.08. Trustee's Relation to Guarantor Senior Debt. The
Trustee and any Paying Agent shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in
this Article Twelve with respect to any Guarantor Senior Debt which may at any
time be held by it in its individual or any other capacity to the same extent as
any other holder of Guarantor Senior Debt, and nothing in this Indenture shall
deprive the Trustee or any Paying Agent of any of its rights as such holder.


                                       85
<PAGE>

            With respect to the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt, the Trustee
undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and obligations
as are specifically set forth in this Article Twelve, and no implied covenants
or obligations with respect to the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt shall be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed to
owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt. The Trustee
shall not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall in good faith
mistakenly pay over or distribute to Holders of Securities or to the Company or
to any other Person cash, property or securities to which any holders of
Guarantor Senior Debt shall be entitled by virtue of this Article Twelve or
otherwise.

            SECTION 12.09. Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or
Omissions of the Guarantors or Holders of Guarantor Senior Debt. No right of any
present or future holders of any Guarantor Senior Debt to enforce subordination
as provided herein shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any
act, including any amendment to this Article Twelve without the consent of the
holders of such Senior Debt, or failure to act on the part of any Guarantor or
by any act or failure to act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any
noncompliance by any Guarantor with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of
any knowledge thereof which any such holder may have or otherwise be charged
with. The provisions of this Article Twelve are intended to be for the benefit
of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt.

            SECTION 12.10. Securityholders Authorize Trustee to Effectuate
Subordination of Guarantees. Each Holder of Securities by its or his acceptance
of such Securities authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on its or his
behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the
subordination provided in this Article Twelve, and appoints the Trustee its or
his attorney-in-fact for such purposes, including, in the event of any
dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or reorganization of any Guarantor (whether
in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership, reorganization or similar proceedings
or upon an assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise) tending towards
liquidation of the business and assets of such Guarantor, the filing of a claim
for the unpaid balance of its or his Securities in the form required in those
proceedings.

            SECTION 12.11. This Article Not to Prevent Events of Default. The
failure to make a payment on account of principal of or interest on the
Securities by reason of any provision of this Article Twelve shall not be
construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default specified in
Section 6.01.

            SECTION 12.12. Trustee's Compensation Not Prejudiced. Nothing in
this Article Twelve shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to other
sections in this Indenture.

            SECTION 12.13. No Waiver of Guarantee Subordination Provisions.
Without in any way limiting the generality of Section 12.09, the holders of
Guarantor Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the
consent of or notice to the Trustee or the Holders of the Securities, without
incurring responsibility to the Holders of the Securities and without impairing
or releasing the subordination provided in this Article Twelve or the
obligations hereunder of the Holders of the Securities to the holders of


                                       86
<PAGE>

Guarantor Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following: (a) change the
manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or
alter, Guarantor Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any
agreement under which Guarantor Senior Debt is outstanding or secured; (b) sell,
exchange, release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or
otherwise securing Guarantor Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any
manner for the collection of Guarantor Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain
from exercising any rights against the Guarantor and any other Person.

            SECTION 12.14. Payments May be Paid Prior to Dissolution. Nothing
contained in this Article Twelve or elsewhere in this Indenture shall prevent
(i) the Guarantors, except under the conditions described in Section 12.02, from
making payments of principal of and interest on the Securities, or from
depositing with the Trustee any moneys for such payments or from effecting a
termination of the Guarantors' obligations under the Securities and this
Indenture as provided in Article Eight, or (ii) the application by the Trustee
of any moneys deposited with it for the purpose of making such payments of
principal of and interest on the Securities, to the Holders entitled thereto
unless at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which such payment
becomes due and payable, the Trustee shall have received the written notice
provided for in Section 12.02(b) or in Section 12.06. The Company shall give
prompt written notice to the Trustee of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation
or reorganization of any Guarantor.

                                   ARTICLE 13

                                  Miscellaneous

            SECTION 13.01. TIA Controls. If any provision of this Indenture
limits, qualifies, or conflicts with another provision which is required to be
included in this Indenture by the TIA, the required provision shall control. If
any provision of this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the TIA
that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to
apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case may be.

            SECTION 13.02. Notices. Any notices or other communications required
or permitted hereunder shall be in writing, and shall be sufficiently given if

      counsel, all such conditions precedent have been complied with.

            SECTION 13.05. Statements Required in Certificate or Opinion. Each

provided for in this Indenture, other than the Officers' Certificate required by
Section 4.08(a), shall include:

            (1) a statement that the Person making such certificate or opinion
      has read such covenant or condition and the definitions relating thereto;

            (4) a statement as to whether or not, in the opinion of each such
      Person, such condition or covenant has been complied with; provided,
      however, that with respect to matters of fact an Opinion of Counsel may
      rely on an Officers' Certificate or certificates of public officials.

            SECTION 13.06. Rules by Trustee, Paying Agent, Registrar. The
Trustee may make reasonable rules in accordance with the Trustee's customary
practices for action by or at a meeting of Holders. The Paying Agent or

to a particular place of payment is a Saturday, a Sunday or a day on which
banking institutions in New York, New York, or at such place of payment are not
required to be open. If a payment date is a Legal Holiday at such place, payment
may be made at such place on the next succeeding day that is not a Legal
Holiday, and no interest shall accrue for the intervening period.

            SECTION 13.08. Governing Law. THIS INDENTURE AND THE SECURITIES WILL
BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK, BUT WITHOUT GIVING EFFECT TO APPLICABLE PRINCIPLES OF CONFLICTS OF LAW TO

REQUIRED THEREBY. Each of the parties hereto agrees to submit to the
jurisdiction of the courts of the

                                       89
<PAGE>

debt agreement may not be used to interpret this Indenture.

            SECTION 13.10. No Recourse Against Others. A director, officer,
employee, stockholder or incorporator, as such, of the Company or any Guarantor
shall not have any liability for any Obligations of the Company or any Guarantor
under the Securities, the Guarantees or this Indenture or for any claim based
on, in respect of or by reason of such Obligations or their creation. Each
Securityholder by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability.
Such waiver and release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the
Securities.

Indenture and the Securities shall bind its successors. All agreements of the
Trustee in this Indenture shall bind its successor.

of copies of this Indenture. Each signed copy or counterpart shall be an
original, but all of them together shall represent the same agreement.

            SECTION 13.13. Severability. In case any one or more of the
provisions in this Indenture or in the Securities shall be held invalid, illegal
or unenforceable, in any respect for any reason, the validity, legality and
enforceability of any such provision in every other respect and of the remaining
provisions shall not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, it being
intended that all of the provisions hereof shall be enforceable to the full
extent permitted by law.

      available) Rule 144 under the Securities Act. In the case of a transfer of
      a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Security or the Rule 144A
      Global Security for an interest in the IAI Global Security, the transferee
      must furnish a signed letter substantially in the form of Exhibit 3 to
      this Appendix to the Trustee and an opinion of counsel or other evidence
      reasonably satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee as to compliance
      with the restrictions set forth in the legend set forth in Section
      2.3(e)(i).

            (ii) If the proposed transfer is a transfer of a beneficial interest
      in one Global Security to a beneficial interest in another Global
      Security, the Registrar shall reflect on its books and records the date
      and an increase in the principal amount of the Global Security to which
      such interest is being transferred in an amount equal to the principal
      amount of the interest to be so transferred, and the Registrar shall
      reflect on

                                      A-6
<PAGE>

      its books and records the date and a corresponding decrease in the
      principal amount of the Global Security from which such interest is being
      transferred.

            (iii) Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Appendix (other
      than the provisions set forth in Section 2.4), a Global Security may not
      be transferred as a whole except by the Depositary to a nominee of the
      Depositary or by a nominee of the Depositary to the Depositary or another
      nominee of the Depositary or by the Depositary or any such nominee to a
      successor Depositary or a nominee of such successor Depositary.

            (iv) In the event that a Global Security is exchanged for Definitive
      Securities pursuant to Section 2.4 prior to the consummation of a
      Registered Exchange Offer or the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration
      Statement with respect to such Securities, such Securities may be
      exchanged only in accordance with such procedures as are substantially
      consistent with the provisions of this Section 2.3 (including the
      certification requirements set forth on the reverse of the Initial
      Securities intended to ensure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A,
      Regulation S or such other applicable exemption from registration under
      the Securities Act, as the case may be) and such other procedures as may
      from time to time be adopted by the Company.

            (d) Restrictions on Transfer of Regulation S Global Security. (i)
Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period, interests in the
Regulation S Global Security may only be sold, pledged or transferred in
accordance with the Applicable Procedures and only (1) to the Company, (2) so
long as such Security is eligible for resale pursuant to Rule 144A, to a person
whom the selling holder reasonably believes is a QIB that purchases for its own
account or for the account of a QIB to whom notice is given that the resale,
pledge or transfer is being made in reliance on Rule 144A, (3) in an offshore
transaction in accordance with Regulation S, (4) pursuant to an exemption from
registration under the Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if applicable) under
the Securities Act, (5) to an IAI purchasing for its own account, or for the
account of such an IAI, in a minimum principal amount of Securities of $250,000
or (6) pursuant to an effective registration statement under the Securities Act,
in each case in accordance with any applicable securities laws of any state of
the United States. Prior to the expiration of the Distribution Compliance
Period, transfers by an owner of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S
Global Security to a transferee who takes delivery of such interest through the
Rule 144A Global Security or the IAI Global Security shall be made only in
accordance with Applicable Procedures and upon receipt by the Trustee of a
written certification from the transferor of the beneficial interest in the form
provided on the reverse of the Initial Security to the effect that such transfer
is being made to (1) a QIB within the meaning of Rule 144A in a transaction
meeting the requirements of Rule 144A or (2) an IAI purchasing for its own
account, or for the account of such an IAI, in a minimum principal amount of the
Securities of $250,000. Such written certification shall no longer be required
after the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period. In the case of a
transfer of a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global Security for an
interest in the IAI Global Security, the transferee must furnish a signed letter
substantially in the form of Exhibit 3 to this Appendix to the Trustee and an
opinion of

                                      A-7
<PAGE>

counsel or other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee
as to compliance with the restrictions set forth in the legend set forth in
Section 2.3(e)(i)

            (ii) Upon the expiration of the Distribution Compliance Period,
      beneficial ownership interests in the Regulation S Global Security shall
      be transferable in accordance with applicable law and the other terms of
      this Indenture.

            (e) Legend.

            (i) Except as permitted by the following paragraphs (ii), (iii) or
      (iv), each Security certificate evidencing the Global Securities and the
      Definitive Securities (and all Securities issued in exchange therefor or
      in substitution thereof) shall bear a legend in substantially the
      following form (each defined term in the legend being defined as such for
      purposes of the legend only):

      THIS SECURITY HAS NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT OF 1933, AS

      PLEDGED, ENCUMBERED OR OTHERWISE DISPOSED OF IN THE ABSENCE OF SUCH

      SUCH REGISTRATION. THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE HEREOF,
      AGREES ON ITS OWN BEHALF AND ON BEHALF OF ANY INVESTOR ACCOUNT FOR WHICH
      IT HAS PURCHASED SECURITIES, TO OFFER, SELL OR OTHERWISE TRANSFER SUCH
      SECURITY, PRIOR TO THE DATE (THE "RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE")
      THAT IS [IN THE CASE OF RULE 144A NOTES: TWO YEARS] [IN THE CASE OF
      REGULATION S NOTES: 40 DAYS] AFTER THE LATER OF THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE
      HEREOF AND THE LAST DATE ON WHICH THE ISSUER OR ANY AFFILIATE OF THE
      ISSUER WAS THE OWNER OF THIS SECURITY (OR ANY PREDECESSOR OF SUCH
      SECURITY), ONLY (A) TO THE ISSUER, (B) PURSUANT TO A REGISTRATION
      STATEMENT THAT HAS BEEN DECLARED EFFECTIVE UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (C)
      FOR SO LONG AS THE SECURITIES ARE ELIGIBLE FOR RESALE PURSUANT TO RULE
      144A UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, TO A PERSON IT REASONABLY BELIEVES IS A
      "QUALIFIED INSTITUTIONAL BUYER" AS DEFINED IN RULE 144A UNDER THE
      SECURITIES ACT THAT PURCHASES FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR

                                      A-8

      THAT THE TRANSFER IS BEING MADE IN RELIANCE ON RULE 144A, (D) PURSUANT TO

      OF REGULATION S UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT, (E) TO AN INSTITUTIONAL
      "ACCREDITED INVESTOR" WITHIN THE MEANING OF RULE 501(a)(1), (2), (3) OR
      (7) UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT THAT IS AN INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED INVESTOR
      ACQUIRING THE SECURITY FOR ITS OWN ACCOUNT OR FOR THE ACCOUNT OF SUCH AN
      INSTITUTIONAL ACCREDITED INVESTOR, IN EACH CASE IN A MINIMUM PRINCIPAL
      AMOUNT OF THE SECURITIES OF $250,000, FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES AND NOT WITH
      A VIEW TO OR FOR OFFER OR SALE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY DISTRIBUTION IN
      VIOLATION OF THE SECURITIES ACT, OR (F) PURSUANT TO ANOTHER AVAILABLE
      EXEMPTION FROM THE REGISTRATION REQUIREMENTS OF THE SECURITIES ACT,
      SUBJECT TO THE ISSUER'S AND THE TRUSTEE'S RIGHT PRIOR TO ANY SUCH OFFER,
      SALE OR TRANSFER PURSUANT TO CLAUSES (D), (E) OR (F) TO REQUIRE THE
      DELIVERY OF AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, CERTIFICATION AND/OR OTHER INFORMATION
      SATISFACTORY TO EACH OF THEM. THIS LEGEND WILL BE REMOVED UPON THE REQUEST
      OF THE HOLDER AFTER THE RESALE RESTRICTION TERMINATION DATE.

            Each Definitive Security shall also bear the following additional
legend:

      IN CONNECTION WITH ANY TRANSFER, THE HOLDER WILL DELIVER TO THE REGISTRAR
      AND TRANSFER AGENT SUCH CERTIFICATES AND OTHER INFORMATION AS SUCH
      TRANSFER AGENT MAY REASONABLY REQUIRE TO CONFIRM THAT THE TRANSFER
      COMPLIES WITH THE FOREGOING RESTRICTIONS.

            (ii) Upon any sale or transfer of a Transfer Restricted Security
      that is a Definitive Security, the Registrar shall permit the Holder
      thereof to exchange such Transfer Restricted Security for a Definitive
      Security that does not bear the legends set forth above and rescind any
      restriction on the transfer of such Transfer Restricted Security if the
      Holder certifies in writing to the Registrar that its request for such
      exchange was made in reliance on Rule 144 (such certification to be in the
      form set forth on the reverse of the Initial Security).

            (iii) After a transfer of any Initial Securities during the period
      of the effectiveness of a Shelf Registration Statement with respect to
      such Initial Securities, all requirements pertaining to the Restricted
      Securities Legend on such Initial Securities shall cease to apply and the
      requirements that any such Initial Securities be issued in global form
      shall continue to apply.

            (iv) Upon the consummation of a Registered Exchange Offer with
      respect to the Initial Securities pursuant to which Holders of such
      Initial Securities are offered Exchange Securities in exchange for their
      Initial Securities, all requirements pertaining to Initial Securities that
      Initial Securities be issued in global form shall continue to apply, and
      Exchange Securities in global form without the Restricted Securities
      Legend shall be available to Holders that exchange such Initial Securities
      in such Registered Exchange Offer.

            (v) Upon a sale or transfer after the expiration of the Distribution
      Compliance Period of any Initial Security acquired pursuant to Regulation
      S, all requirements that such Initial Security bear the Restricted
      Securities Legend shall cease to apply and the

                                      A-9
<PAGE>

      requirements requiring any such Initial Security be issued in global form
      shall continue to apply.

            (vi) Any Additional Securities sold in a registered offering shall
      not be required to bear the Restricted Securities Legend.

            (f) Cancelation or Adjustment of Global Security. At such time as
      all beneficial interests in a Global Security have either been exchanged
      for Definitive Securities, transferred, redeemed, repurchased or canceled,
      such Global Security shall be returned by the Depositary to the Trustee
      for cancelation or retained and canceled by the Trustee. At any time prior
      to such cancelation, if any beneficial interest in a Global Security is
      exchanged for Definitive Securities, transferred in exchange for an
      interest in another Global Security, redeemed, repurchased or canceled,
      the principal amount of Securities represented by such Global Security
      shall be reduced and an adjustment shall be made on the books and records
      of the Trustee (if it is then the Securities Custodian for such Global
      Security) with respect to such Global Security, by the Trustee or the
      Securities Custodian, to reflect such reduction.

            (g) Obligations with Respect to Transfers and Exchanges of
      Securities.

            (i) To permit registrations of transfers and exchanges, the Company
      shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate, Definitive Securities
      and Global Securities at the Registrar's request.

            (ii) No service charge shall be made for any registration of
      transfer or exchange, but the Company may require payment of a sum
      sufficient to cover any transfer tax, assessments, or similar governmental
      charge payable in connection therewith (other than any such transfer
      taxes, assessments or similar governmental charge payable upon exchanges
      pursuant to Sections 2.06, 3.06, 4.16 and 9.05 of this Indenture).

            (iii) Prior to the due presentation for registration of transfer of
      any Security, the Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar
      may deem and treat the person in whose name a Security is registered as
      the absolute owner of such Security for the purpose of receiving payment
      of principal of and interest on such Security and for all other purposes
      whatsoever, whether or not such Security is overdue, and none of the
      Company, the Trustee, the Paying Agent or the Registrar shall be affected
      by notice to the contrary.

            (iv) All Securities issued upon any transfer or exchange pursuant to
      the terms of this Indenture shall evidence the same debt and shall be
      entitled to the same benefits under this Indenture as the Securities
      surrendered upon such transfer or exchange.

            (h) No Obligation of the Trustee.

            (i) The Trustee shall have no responsibility or obligation to any
      beneficial owner of a Global Security, a member of, or a participant in
      the Depositary or any

                                      A-10

      other Person with respect to the accuracy of the records of the Depositary
      or its nominee or of any participant or member thereof, with respect to
      any ownership interest in the Securities or with respect to the delivery
      to any participant, member, beneficial owner or other Person (other than
      the Depositary) of any notice (including any notice of redemption or
      repurchase) or the payment of any amount, under or with respect to such
      Securities. All notices and communications to be given to the Holders and
      all payments to be made to Holders under the Securities shall be given or
      made only to the registered Holders (which shall be the Depositary or its
      nominee in the case of a Global Security). The rights of beneficial owners
      in any Global Security shall be exercised only through the Depositary
      subject to the applicable rules and procedures of the Depositary. The
      Trustee may rely and shall be fully protected in relying upon information
      furnished by the Depositary with respect to its members, participants and
      any beneficial owners.

            (ii) The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor,
      determine or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer
      imposed under this Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any
      transfer of any interest in any Security (including any transfers between
      or among Depositary participants, members or beneficial owners in any
      Global Security) other than to require delivery of such certificates,
      opinions and other documentation or evidence as are expressly required by,
      and to do so if and when expressly required by, the terms of this
      Indenture, and to examine the same to determine substantial compliance as
      to form with the express requirements hereof.

after the Company becomes aware of such cessation, (ii) an Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing or (iii) the Company, in its sole discretion,
notifies the Trustee in writing that it elects to cause the issuance of
certificated Securities under this Indenture.

            (b) Any Global Security that is transferable to the beneficial
owners thereof pursuant to this Section 2.4 shall be surrendered by the

in part, without charge, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, upon
such transfer of each portion of such Global Security, an equal aggregate
principal amount of Definitive Securities of authorized denominations. Any

executed, authenticated and delivered only in denominations of $1,000 and any
integral multiple thereof and registered in such names as the Depositary shall
direct. Any certificated Initial

Indenture or the Securities.

            (d) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified in
Section 2.4(a)(i), (ii) or (iii), the Company will promptly make available to
the Trustee a reasonable supply of Definitive Securities in fully registered

1. Interest
   --------

            SCIENTIFIC GAMES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation (the
"Company"), promises to pay interest on the principal amount of this Security at
the rate per annum shown above; provided, however, that if a Registration
Default (as defined in the Registration Rights Agreement) occurs, additional
interest will accrue on this Security at a rate of 0.25% per annum (increasing
by an additional 0.25% per annum after each consecutive 90-day period that
occurs after the date on which such Registration Default occurs up to a maximum
additional interest rate of 1.00%) from and including the date on which any such
Registration Default shall occur to but excluding the date on which all
Registration Defaults have been cured. All references in this Security and in
the Indenture to interest payable on any Security shall include any such
additional interest. The Company will pay interest semi-annually on June 15 and
December 15 of each year (each an "Interest Payment Date"), commencing June 15,
2005. Interest on the Securities will accrue from the most recent date to which
interest has been paid or, if no interest has been paid, from December 23, 2004.
Interest will be computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve 30-day
months.

            The Company shall pay interest at the rate of interest then borne by
the Securities on overdue installments of principal and on overdue installments
of interest to the extent lawful as provided in the Indenture.

2. Method of Payment
   -----------------

            The Company shall pay interest on the Securities (except defaulted
interest) to the Persons who are the registered Holders at the close of business
on the Record Date immediately preceding the Interest Payment Date even if the
Securities are cancelled after such Record Date and before the corresponding
Interest Payment Date. Holders must surrender Securities to a Paying Agent to
collect principal payments. The Company shall pay principal and interest in
money of the United States that at the time of payment is legal tender for
payment of public and private debts ("U.S. Legal Tender"). However, the Company
may pay principal and interest by wire transfer of federal funds, or interest by
check payable in such U.S. Legal Tender. The Company may deliver any such
interest payment to the Paying Agent or to a Holder at the Holder's registered
address.

3. Paying Agent and Registrar
   --------------------------

            Initially, Wells Fargo Bank, National Association (the "Trustee")
will act as Paying Agent and Registrar. The Company may change any Paying Agent
or Registrar without notice to the Holders. The Company or any of its
Subsidiaries may act as Registrar or Paying Agent.

4. Indenture
   ---------

            The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated as of
December 23, 2004 (the "Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Guarantors
named therein and the Trustee. Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in
the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The terms of the Securities
include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by
reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. ss.ss. 77aaa-77bbbb)
(the "TIA"), as in effect on the date of the Indenture until such time as the
Indenture is qualified under the TIA, and thereafter as in effect on the date on
which the Indenture is qualified under the TIA and as it may be amended from
time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Securities
are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the
TIA for a statement of them. The Securities are senior subordinated obligations
of the Company initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $200,000,000
on the Issue Date, and, subject to compliance with Section 4.04 of the
Indenture, unlimited in aggregate principal amount thereafter.

5. Optional Redemption
   -------------------

            The Securities will be redeemable, at the Company's option, in whole
at any time or in part from time to time, on and after December 15, 2008, upon
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount thereof) if redeemed
during the twelve-month period commencing on December 15 of the years set forth
below, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date:

      Period                                           Percentage
      ------                                           ----------
      2008......................................       103.125%
      2009......................................       101.563%
      2010 and thereafter.......................       100.000%

6. Optional Redemption upon Equity Offering
   ----------------------------------------

            At any time, or from time to time, on or prior to December 15, 2007,
the Company may, at its option, use the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity
Offerings (as defined below) to redeem in the aggregate up to 35% of the
original principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional
Securities, if any) at a redemption price equal to 106.25% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption;
provided, however, that at least 65% of the original principal amount of the
Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) remains outstanding
immediately after any such redemption. In order to effect the foregoing
redemption with the proceeds of any Equity Offering, the Company shall make such
redemption not more than 120 days after the consummation of any such Equity
Offering.

            As used in the preceding paragraph, "Equity Offering" means any
private or public offering of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company.


                                      B-5
<PAGE>

7. Notice of Optional Redemption
   -----------------------------

            Notice of redemption will be sent, by first class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date
to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address.
Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part.

            Except as set forth in the Indenture, if monies for the redemption
of the Securities called for redemption shall have been deposited with the
Paying Agent for redemption on such Redemption Date, then, unless the Company
defaults in the payment of such Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, the Securities called for redemption will cease to bear
interest from and after such Redemption Date and the only right of the Holders
of such Securities will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.

8. Offers to Purchase
   ------------------

            Sections 4.15 and 4.16 of the Indenture provide that upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) and after
certain Asset Sales (as defined in the Indenture), and subject to further
limitations contained therein, the Company will make an offer to purchase
certain amounts of the Securities in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture.

9. Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
   ---------------------------------

            The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder shall
register the transfer of or exchange Securities in accordance with the
Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer
taxes or similar governmental charges payable in connection therewith as
permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or
exchange any Securities or portions thereof (i) during a period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of
Securities and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing and
(ii) selected for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any Security
being redeemed in part.

10.   Persons Deemed Owners
      ---------------------

            The registered Holder of this Security shall be treated as the owner
of it for all purposes.

11.   Unclaimed Funds
      ---------------

            If funds for the payment of principal or interest remain unclaimed
for one year, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will repay the funds to the
Company at its request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying
Agent with respect to such funds shall cease.


                                      B-6
<PAGE>

12.   Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
      ----------------------------------------

            The Company may be discharged from its Obligations under the
Indenture and the Securities except for certain provisions thereof, and may be
discharged from its Obligations to comply with certain covenants contained in
the Indenture and the Securities, in each case upon satisfaction of certain
conditions specified in the Indenture.

13.   Amendment; Supplement; Waiver
      -----------------------------

            Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture and the Securities may
be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, and
any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any
Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture and the
Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency,
provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated
Securities or comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with
the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or make any other change that
does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.

14.   Restrictive Covenants
      ---------------------

            The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things,
limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur
additional Indebtedness, create certain liens, pay dividends or make certain
other restricted payments, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain
transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with any other person or
sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company. The limitations are subject to a
number of important qualifications and exceptions. The Company must annually
report to the Trustee on compliance with such covenants.

15.   Subordination
      -------------

            The Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is, to the extent and
in the manner provided in the Indenture, subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt, and this Security is issued
subject to such provisions. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same,
(a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs
the Trustee, on behalf of such Holder, to take such action as may be necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in the Indenture and
(c) appoints the Trustee attorney-in-fact of such Holder for such purpose.

16.   Defaults and Remedies
      ---------------------

            If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then
outstanding may declare the principal of and accrued interest on all the
Securities to be due and payable immediately in

                                      B-7
<PAGE>

the manner and with the effect provided in the Indenture. Holders of Securities
may not enforce the Indenture or the Securities except as provided in the
Indenture. The Trustee is not obligated to enforce the Indenture or the
Securities unless it has received indemnity satisfactory to it. The Indenture
permits, subject to certain limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority
in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding to direct the
Trustee in its exercise of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from
Holders of Securities notice of certain continuing Defaults or Events of Default
if it determines that withholding notice is in their interest.

17.   Trustee Dealings with Company
      -----------------------------

            The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal
with the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates as if it were
not the Trustee.

18.   No Recourse Against Others
      --------------------------

            No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as
such, of the Company shall have any liability for any obligation of the Company
under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of
or by reason of, such Obligations or their creation. Each Holder of a Security
by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Securities.

19.   Authentication
      --------------

            This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or authenticating
agent signs the certificate of authentication on this Security by its manual
signature.

20.   Guarantees
      ----------

            The payment by the Company of the principal of and interest on the
Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior
subordinated basis by each of the Guarantors to the extent set forth in the
Indenture.

21.   Abbreviations
      -------------

            Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a
Security or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

22.   CUSIP Numbers
      -------------

            Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform
Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused a CUSIP number to be
printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders. No representation is
made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.

obligations of the Holders with respect to a registration and the
indemnification of the Company to the extent provided therein.

24.   Governing Law
      -------------

            This Security and the Indenture shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, but without giving effect
to applicable principles of conflicts of laws to the extent that the application
of the law of another jurisdiction would be required thereby. Each of the
parties hereto agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State
of New York in any action or proceeding arising out of or relating to this
Security.

<PAGE>

            The Company issued the Securities under an Indenture, dated as of
December 23, 2004 (the "Indenture"), by and among the Company, the Guarantors
named therein and the Trustee. Capitalized terms herein are used as defined in
the Indenture unless otherwise defined herein. The terms of the Securities
include those stated in the Indenture and those made part of the Indenture by
reference to the Trust Indenture Act of 1939 (15 U.S.C. ss.ss. 77aaa-77bbbb)
(the "TIA"), as in effect on the date of the Indenture until such time as the
Indenture is qualified under the TIA, and thereafter as in effect on the date on
which the Indenture is qualified under the TIA and as it may be amended from
time to time. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Securities
are subject to all such terms, and Holders are referred to the Indenture and the
TIA for a statement of them. The Securities are senior subordinated obligations
of the Company initially limited in aggregate principal amount to $200,000,000
on the Issue Date, and, subject to compliance with Section 4.04 of the
Indenture, unlimited in aggregate principal amount thereafter.

5.    Optional Redemption
      -------------------

            The Securities will be redeemable, at the Company's option, in whole
at any time or in part from time to time, on and after December 15, 2008, upon
not less than 30 nor more than 60 days' notice, at the following redemption
prices (expressed as percentages of the principal amount thereof) if redeemed
during the twelve-month period commencing on December 15 of the years set forth
below, plus, in each case, accrued and unpaid interest to the Redemption Date:


      Period                                          Percentage
      ------                                          ----------

      2008......................................       103.125%
      2009......................................       101.563%
      2010 and thereafter.......................       100.000%

6.    Optional Redemption upon Equity Offering
      ----------------------------------------

            At any time, or from time to time, on or prior to December 15, 2007,
the Company may, at its option, use the net cash proceeds of one or more Equity
Offerings (as defined below) to redeem in the aggregate up to 35% of the
original principal amount of the Securities (which includes Additional
Securities, if any) at a redemption price equal to 106.25% of the principal
amount thereof, plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption;
provided, however, that at least 65% of the original principal amount of the
Securities (which includes Additional Securities, if any) remains outstanding
immediately after any such redemption. In order to effect the foregoing
redemption with the proceeds of any Equity Offering, the Company shall make such
redemption not more than 120 days after the consummation of any such Equity
Offering.

            As used in the preceding paragraph, "Equity Offering" means any
private or public offering of Qualified Capital Stock of the Company.

7.    Notice of Optional Redemption
      -----------------------------


                                      C-4
<PAGE>

            Notice of redemption will be sent, by first class mail, postage
prepaid, at least 30 days but not more than 60 days before the Redemption Date
to each Holder of Securities to be redeemed at such Holder's registered address.
Securities in denominations larger than $1,000 may be redeemed in part.

            Except as set forth in the Indenture, if monies for the redemption
of the Securities called for redemption shall have been deposited with the
Paying Agent for redemption on such Redemption Date, then, unless the Company
defaults in the payment of such Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid
interest, if any, the Securities called for redemption will cease to bear
interest from and after such Redemption Date and the only right of the Holders
of such Securities will be to receive payment of the Redemption Price plus
accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the Redemption Date.

8.    Offers to Purchase
      ------------------

            Sections 4.15 and 4.16 of the Indenture provide that upon the
occurrence of a Change of Control (as defined in the Indenture) and after
certain Asset Sales (as defined in the Indenture), subject to further
limitations contained therein, the Company will make an offer to purchase
certain amounts of the Securities in accordance with the procedures set forth in
the Indenture.

9.    Denominations; Transfer; Exchange
      ---------------------------------

            The Securities are in registered form, without coupons, in
denominations of $1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000. A Holder shall
register the transfer of or exchange Securities in accordance with the
Indenture. The Registrar may require a Holder, among other things, to furnish
appropriate endorsements and transfer documents and to pay certain transfer
taxes or similar governmental charges payable in connection therewith as
permitted by the Indenture. The Registrar need not register the transfer of or
exchange any Securities or portions thereof (i) during a period beginning at the
opening of business 15 days before the mailing of a notice of redemption of
Securities and ending at the close of business on the day of such mailing and
(ii) selected for redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any Security
being redeemed in part.

10.   Persons Deemed Owners
      ---------------------

            The registered Holder of this Security shall be treated as the owner
of it for all purposes.

11.   Unclaimed Funds
      ---------------

            If funds for the payment of principal or interest remain unclaimed
for one year, the Trustee and the Paying Agent will repay the funds to the
Company at its request. After that, all liability of the Trustee and such Paying
Agent with respect to such funds shall cease.

12.   Legal Defeasance and Covenant Defeasance
      ----------------------------------------

                                      C-5
<PAGE>

            The Company may be discharged from its Obligations under the
Indenture and the Securities except for certain provisions thereof, and may be
discharged from its Obligations to comply with certain covenants contained in
the Indenture and the Securities, in each case upon satisfaction of certain
conditions specified in the Indenture.

13.   Amendment; Supplement; Waiver
      -----------------------------

            Subject to certain exceptions, the Indenture and the Securities may
be amended or supplemented with the written consent of the Holders of at least a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Securities then outstanding, and
any existing Default or Event of Default or compliance with any provision may be
waived with the consent of the Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities then outstanding. Without notice to or consent of any
Holder, the parties thereto may amend or supplement the Indenture and the
Securities to, among other things, cure any ambiguity, defect or inconsistency,
provide for uncertificated Securities in addition to or in place of certificated
Securities or comply with any requirements of the Commission in connection with
the qualification of the Indenture under the TIA, or make any other change that
does not adversely affect the rights of any Holder in any material respect.

14.   Restrictive Covenants
      ---------------------

            The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things,
limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries to incur
additional Indebtedness, create certain liens, pay dividends or make certain
other restricted payments, consummate certain asset sales, enter into certain
transactions with affiliates and merge or consolidate with any other person or
sell, assign, transfer, lease, convey or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company. The limitations are subject to a
number of important qualifications and exceptions. The Company must annually
report to the Trustee on compliance with such covenants.

15.   Subordination
      -------------

            The Indebtedness evidenced by the Securities is, to the extent and
in the manner provided in the Indenture, subordinated in right of payment to the
prior payment in full in cash of all Senior Debt, and this Security is issued
subject to such provisions. Each Holder of this Security, by accepting the same,
(a) agrees to and shall be bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs
the Trustee, on behalf of such Holder, to take such action as may be necessary
or appropriate to effectuate the subordination as provided in the Indenture and
(c) appoints the Trustee attorney-in-fact of such Holder for such purpose.

16.   Defaults and Remedies
      ---------------------

            If an Event of Default occurs and is continuing, the Trustee or the
Holders of at least 25% in aggregate principal amount of Securities then
outstanding may declare the principal of and accrued interest on all the
Securities to be due and payable immediately in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Indenture. Holders of Securities may not enforce the Indenture
or the Securities except as provided in the Indenture. The Trustee is not


                                      C-6
<PAGE>

obligated to enforce the Indenture or the Securities unless it has received
indemnity satisfactory to it. The Indenture permits, subject to certain
limitations therein provided, Holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Securities then outstanding to direct the Trustee in its exercise
of any trust or power. The Trustee may withhold from Holders of Securities
notice of certain continuing Defaults or Events of Default if it determines that
withholding notice is in their interest.

17.   Trustee Dealings with Company
      -----------------------------

            The Trustee under the Indenture, in its individual or any other
capacity, may become the owner or pledgee of Securities and may otherwise deal
with the Company, its Subsidiaries or their respective Affiliates as if it were
not the Trustee.

18.   No Recourse Against Others
      --------------------------

            No stockholder, director, officer, employee or incorporator, as
such, of the Company shall have any liability for any obligation of the Company
under the Securities or the Indenture or for any claim based on, in respect of
or by reason of, such Obligations or their creation. Each Holder of a Security
by accepting a Security waives and releases all such liability. The waiver and
release are part of the consideration for the issuance of the Securities.

19.   Authentication
      --------------

            This Security shall not be valid until the Trustee or authenticating
agent signs the certificate of authentication on this Security by its manual
signature.

20.   Guarantees
      ----------

            The payment by the Company of the principal of and interest on the
Securities is fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior
subordinated basis by each of the Guarantors to the extent set forth in the
Indenture.

21.   Abbreviations
      -------------

            Customary abbreviations may be used in the name of a Holder of a
Security or an assignee, such as: TEN COM (= tenants in common), TEN ENT (=
tenants by the entireties), JT TEN (= joint tenants with right of survivorship
and not as tenants in common), CUST (= Custodian), and U/G/M/A (= Uniform Gifts
to Minors Act).

22.   CUSIP Numbers
      -------------

            Pursuant to a recommendation promulgated by the Committee on Uniform
Security Identification Procedures, the Company has caused a CUSIP number to be
printed on the Securities as a convenience to the Holders. No representation is
made as to the accuracy of such numbers as printed on the Securities and
reliance may be placed only on the other identification numbers printed hereon.

agrees to the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement, including the
obligations of the Holders with respect to a registration and the
indemnification of the Company to the extent provided therein.

24.   Governing Law
      -------------

            This Security and the Indenture shall be governed by and construed
in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, but without giving effect
to applicable principles of conflicts of law to the extent that the application
of the law of another jurisdiction would be required thereby. Each of the
parties hereto agrees to submit to the jurisdiction of the courts of the State

Scientific Games Corporation
750 Lexington Avenue
New York, NY 10022

Attention: General Counsel

Ladies and Gentlemen:

      This certificate is delivered to request a transfer of $[ ] principal
amount of the 6 1/4% Senior Subordinated Notes due 2012 (the "Securities") of
Scientific Games Corporation (the "Company").

      Upon transfer, the Securities would be registered in the name of the new
beneficial owner as follows:

Name:________________________

Address:______________________

Taxpayer ID Number:____________

      The undersigned represents and warrants to you that:

      1. We are an institutional "accredited investor" (as defined in Rule
501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act")), purchasing for our own account or for the account of such an
institutional "accredited investor" at least $250,000 principal amount of the
Securities, and we are acquiring the Securities not with a view to, or for offer
or sale in connection with, any distribution in violation of the Securities Act.
We have such knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
capable of evaluating the merits and risks of our investment in the Securities,
and we invest in or purchase securities similar to the Securities in the normal
course of our business. We, and any accounts for which we are acting, are each
able to bear the economic risk of our or its investment.

      2. We understand that the Securities have not been registered under the
Securities Act and, unless so registered, may not be sold except as permitted in
the following sentence. We agree on our own behalf and on behalf of any investor
account for which we are purchasing Securities to offer, sell or otherwise
transfer such Securities prior to the date that is two years after the later of
the date of original issue and the last date on which the Company or any
affiliate of the Company was the owner of such Securities (or any predecessor
thereto) (the "Resale Restriction Termination Date") only (i) to the


                                       D-1

<PAGE>

Company, (ii) in the United States to a person whom the seller reasonably
believes is a qualified institutional buyer in a transaction meeting the
requirements of Rule 144A, (iii) to an institutional "accredited investor"
within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Securities Act
that is an institutional accredited investor purchasing for its own account or
for the account of an institutional accredited investor, in each case in a
minimum principal amount of the Securities of $250,000, (iv) outside the United
States in a transaction complying with the provisions of Rule 904 under the
Securities Act, (v) pursuant to an exemption from registration under the
Securities Act provided by Rule 144 (if available) or (vi) pursuant to an
effective registration statement under the Securities Act, in each of cases (i)
through (vi) subject to any requirement of law that the disposition of our
property or the property of such investor account or accounts be at all times
within our or their control and in compliance with any applicable state
securities laws. The foregoing restrictions on resale will not apply subsequent
to the Resale Restriction Termination Date. If any resale or other transfer of
the Securities is proposed to be made pursuant to clause (iii) above prior to
the Resale Restriction Termination Date, the transferor shall deliver a letter
from the transferee substantially in the form of this letter to the Company and
the Trustee, which shall provide, among other things, that the transferee is an
institutional "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule 501(a)(1), (2),
(3) or (7) under the Securities Act and that it is acquiring such Securities for
investment purposes and not for distribution in violation of the Securities Act.
Each purchaser acknowledges that the Company and the Trustee reserve the right
prior to the offer, sale or other transfer prior to the Resale Restriction
Termination Date of the Securities pursuant to clause (iii), (iv) or (v) above
to require the delivery of an opinion of counsel, certifications or other
information satisfactory to the Company and the Trustee.

violation of the agreement or agreements governing such other Indebtedness;

                                   ARTICLE II

     Issue, Description, Execution, Registration and Exchange of Debentures
     ----------------------------------------------------------------------

            Section 2.01. Designation Amount and Issue of Debentures. The
Debentures shall be designated as "0.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated
Debentures due 2024". Debentures not to exceed the aggregate principal amount of
$250,000,000 (or up to $275,000,000, if the Initial Purchasers' option to
purchase additional Debentures as set forth in the Purchase Agreement is
exercised in full) (except pursuant to Sections 2.05, 2.06, 3.04, 3.05 and 15.02
hereof) upon the execution of this Indenture, or from time to time thereafter,
may be executed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee for authentication,
and the Trustee shall thereupon authenticate and deliver said Debentures to or
upon the written order of the Company, signed by its Chief Executive Officer,
its President, its Chief Operating Officer or any Vice President (whether or not
designated by a number or numbers or word or words added before or after the
title "Vice President"), without any further action by the Company hereunder.

            Section 2.02. Form of Debentures. The Debentures and the Trustee's
certificate of authentication to be borne by such Debentures shall be
substantially in the form set forth in Exhibit A. The terms and provisions
contained in the form of Debenture attached as Exhibit A hereto shall
constitute, and are hereby expressly made, a part of this Indenture and, to the
extent applicable, the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee, by their
execution and delivery of this Indenture, expressly agree to such terms and
provisions and to be bound thereby.

            Any of the Debentures may have such letters, numbers or other
marks of identification and such notations, legends, endorsements or changes
as the officers executing the same may approve (execution thereof to be
conclusive evidence of such approval) and as are not inconsistent with the
provisions of this Indenture, or as may be required by the Custodian, the
Depositary or by the National Association of Securities Dealers, Inc. in
order for the Debentures to be tradable on the Portal Market or as may be
required for the Debentures to be tradable on any other market developed for
trading of securities pursuant to Rule 144A or as may be required to comply
with any applicable law or with any rule or regulation made pursuant thereto
or with any rule or regulation of any securities exchange or automated
quotation system on which the Debentures may be listed, or to conform to
usage, or to indicate any special limitations or restrictions to which any
particular Debentures are subject.

            So long as the Debentures are eligible for book-entry settlement
with the Depositary, or unless otherwise required by law, or otherwise
contemplated by Section 2.05(a), all of the Debentures will be represented by
one or more Debentures in global form registered in the name of the
Depositary or the nominee of the Depositary (a "Global Debenture").  The
transfer and exchange of beneficial interests in any such Global Debenture
shall be effected through the Depositary in accordance with this Indenture
and the applicable procedures of the Depositary.  Except as provided in
Section 2.05(a), beneficial holders of a Global Debenture will not receive or
be entitled to

                                       17
<PAGE>

receive physical delivery of certificates in definitive form and will not be
considered holders of such Global Debenture.

            Any Global Debenture shall represent such of the outstanding
Debentures as shall be specified therein and shall provide that it shall
represent the aggregate principal amount of outstanding Debentures from time
to time endorsed thereon and that the aggregate principal amount of
outstanding Debentures represented thereby may from time to time be increased
or reduced to reflect redemptions, repurchases, conversions, transfers or
exchanges permitted hereby.  Any endorsement of a Global Debenture to reflect
the amount of any increase or decrease in the principal amount of outstanding
Debentures represented thereby shall be made by the Trustee or the Custodian,
at the direction of the Trustee, in such manner and upon instructions given
by the holder of such Debentures in accordance with this Indenture.  Payment
of principal of and Interest on any Global Debenture shall be made to the
holder of such Debenture.

            Section 2.03. Date and Denomination of Debentures; Payments of
Interest. The Debentures shall be issuable in fully registered form without
interest coupons in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and integral
multiples thereof. Each Debenture shall be dated the date of its authentication
and shall bear Interest from the date specified on the face of the form of
Debenture attached as Exhibit A hereto. Interest on the Debentures shall be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year comprised of twelve 30-day months.

            The Person in whose name any Debenture (or its Predecessor
Debenture) is registered on the Debenture Register at the close of business
on the Regular Record Date with respect to an Interest Payment Date shall be
entitled to receive the Interest payable on such Interest Payment Date,
except that (i) Interest payable at Stated Maturity will be payable to the
Person to whom the principal amount is payable and (ii) the Interest payable
upon redemption or repurchase will be payable to the Person to whom the
principal amount is payable pursuant to such redemption or repurchase (unless
the Redemption Date or the Repurchase Date, as the case may be, is after a
Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment
Date, in which case the semi-annual payment of Interest becoming due on such
date shall be payable to the holders of such Debentures registered as such on
the applicable Regular Record Date).  Interest shall be payable at the office
of the Company maintained by the Company for such purposes in the Borough of
Manhattan, The City of New York, which shall initially be an office or agency
of the Trustee.  The Company shall pay Interest (i) on any Debentures in
certificated form by check mailed to the address of the Person entitled
thereto as it appears in the Debenture Register (or upon written notice, by
wire transfer in immediately available funds, if such Person is entitled to
Interest on Debentures with an aggregate principal amount in excess of
$2,000,000) (provided that at Stated Maturity Interest on any Debenture will
be payable with the principal amount at the Company's office or agency in New
York City) or (ii) on any Global Debenture by wire transfer of immediately
available funds to the account of the Depositary or its nominee.


                                       18
<PAGE>

            Any Interest on any Debenture which is payable, but is not
punctually paid or duly provided for, on any June 1 or December 1 (herein
called "Defaulted Interest") shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
Debentureholder on the relevant Regular Record Date by virtue of its having
been such Debentureholder, and such Defaulted Interest shall be paid by the
Company, at its election in each case, as provided in clause (a) or (b) below:

            (a) The Company may elect to make payment of any Defaulted Interest
      to the Persons in whose names the Debentures (or their respective
      Predecessor Debentures) are registered at the close of business on a
      "Special Record Date" for the payment of such Defaulted Interest, which
      shall be the date fixed in the following manner. The Company shall notify
      the Trustee in writing of the amount of Defaulted Interest proposed to be
      paid on each Debenture and the date of the proposed payment (which shall
      be not less than 25 days after the receipt by the Trustee of such notice,
      unless the Trustee shall consent to an earlier date), and at the same time
      the Company shall deposit with the Trustee an amount of money equal to the
      aggregate amount to be paid in respect of such Defaulted Interest or shall
      make arrangements satisfactory to the Trustee for such deposit on or prior
      to the date of the proposed payment, such money when deposited to be held
      in trust for the benefit of the Persons entitled to such Defaulted
      Interest as in this clause provided. Thereupon the Trustee shall fix a
      Special Record Date for the payment of such Defaulted Interest which shall
      be not more than 15 days and not less than 10 days prior to the date of
      the proposed payment, and not less than 10 days after the receipt by the
      Trustee of the notice of the proposed payment. The Trustee shall promptly
      notify the Company of such Special Record Date and, in the name and at the
      expense of the Company, shall cause notice of the proposed payment of such
      Defaulted Interest and the Special Record Date therefor to be mailed,
      first-class postage prepaid, to each holder at his address as it appears
      in the Debenture Register, not less than 10 days prior to such Special
      Record Date. Notice of the proposed payment of such Defaulted Interest and
      the Special Record Date therefor having been so mailed, such Defaulted
      Interest shall be paid to the Persons in whose names the Debentures (or
      their respective Predecessor Debentures) are registered at the close of
      business on such Special Record Date and shall no longer be payable
      pursuant to the following clause (b) of this Section 2.03.

            (b) The Company may make payment of any Defaulted Interest in any
      other lawful manner not inconsistent with the requirements of any
      securities exchange or automated quotation system on which the Debentures
      may be listed or designated for issuance, and upon such notice as may be
      required by such exchange or automated quotation system, if, after notice
      given by the Company to the Trustee of the proposed payment pursuant to
      this clause, such manner of payment shall be deemed practicable by the
      Trustee.

            Section 2.04. Execution of Debentures. The Debentures shall be
      signed in the name and on behalf of the Company by the manual or facsimile
      signature of

                                       19
<PAGE>

      its Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Operating Officer or any
      Vice President (whether or not designated by a number or numbers or word
      or words added before or after the title "Vice President"). Only such
      Debentures as shall bear thereon a certificate of authentication
      substantially in the form set forth on the form of Debenture attached as
      Exhibit A hereto, manually executed by the Trustee, shall be entitled to
      the benefits of this Indenture or be valid or obligatory for any purpose.
      Such certificate by the Trustee upon any Debenture executed by the Company
      shall be conclusive evidence that the Debenture so authenticated has been
      duly authenticated and delivered hereunder and that the holder is entitled
      to the benefits of this Indenture.

            In case any officer of the Company who shall have signed any of
the Debentures shall cease to be such officer before the Debentures so signed
shall have been authenticated and delivered by the Trustee, or disposed of by
the Company, such Debentures nevertheless may be authenticated and delivered
or disposed of as though the person who signed such Debentures had not ceased
to be such officer of the Company, and any Debenture may be signed on behalf
of the Company by such persons as, at the actual date of the execution of
such Debenture, shall be the proper officers of the Company, although at the
date of the execution of this Indenture any such person was not such an
officer.

            Section 2.05. Exchange and Registration of Transfer of Debentures;
Restrictions on Transfer. (a) The Company shall cause to be kept at the
Corporate Trust Office a register (the register maintained in such office and in
any other office or agency of the Company designated pursuant to Section 5.02
being herein sometimes collectively referred to as the "Debenture Register") in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Company
shall provide for the registration of Debentures and of transfers of Debentures.
The Debenture Register shall be in written form or in any form capable of being
converted into written form within a reasonably prompt period of time. The
Trustee is hereby appointed "Debenture Registrar" for the purpose of registering
Debentures and transfers of Debentures as herein provided. The Company may
appoint one or more co-registrars in accordance with Section 5.02.

            Upon surrender for registration of transfer of any Debenture to
the Debenture Registrar or any co-registrar, and satisfaction of the
requirements for such transfer set forth in this Section 2.05, the Company
shall execute, and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver, in the name of
the designated transferee or transferees, one or more new Debentures of any
authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount and bearing
such restrictive legends as may be required by this Indenture.

            Debentures may be exchanged for other Debentures of any
authorized denominations and of a like aggregate principal amount, upon
surrender of the Debentures to be exchanged at any such office or agency
maintained by the Company pursuant to Section 5.02.  Whenever any Debentures
are so surrendered for exchange, the Company shall execute, and the Trustee
shall authenticate and deliver, the Debentures which the Debentureholder
making the exchange is entitled to receive bearing registration numbers not
contemporaneously outstanding.


                                       20
<PAGE>

            All Debentures issued upon any registration of transfer or
exchange of Debentures shall be the valid obligations of the Company,
evidencing the same debt, and entitled to the same benefits under this
Indenture, as the Debentures surrendered upon such registration of transfer
or exchange.

            All Debentures presented or surrendered for registration of
transfer or for exchange, redemption, repurchase or conversion shall (if so
required by the Company or the Debenture Registrar) be duly endorsed, or be
accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of transfer in form
satisfactory to the Company, duly executed by the Debentureholder thereof or
his attorney duly authorized in writing.

            No service charge shall be made to any holder for any
registration of, transfer or exchange of Debentures, but the Company may
require payment by the holder of a sum sufficient to cover any tax,
assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in connection
with any registration of transfer or exchange of Debentures.

            Neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Debenture Registrar
shall be required to exchange or register a transfer of (a) any Debentures
for a period of 15 days next preceding the mailing of a notice of redemption
of Debentures to be redeemed, (b) any Debentures or portions thereof called
for redemption pursuant to Section 3.01, (c) any Debentures or portions
thereof surrendered for conversion pursuant to Article XV, (d) any Debentures
or portions thereof tendered for repurchase (and not withdrawn) pursuant to
Section 3.04 or (e) any Debentures or portions thereof tendered for
repurchase (and not withdrawn) pursuant to Section 3.05.

            (b) The following provisions shall apply only to Global Debentures:

            (i) Each Global Debenture authenticated under this Indenture shall
      be registered in the name of the Depositary or a nominee thereof and
      delivered to such Depositary or a nominee thereof or Custodian therefor,
      and each such Global Debenture shall constitute a single Debenture for all
      purposes of this Indenture.

            (ii) Notwithstanding any other provision in this Indenture, no
      Global Debenture may be exchanged in whole or in part for Debentures
      registered, and no transfer of a Global Debenture in whole or in part may
      be registered, in the name of any Person other than the Depositary or a
      nominee thereof unless (A) the Depositary (i) has notified the Company
      that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for such Global
      Debenture or (ii) has ceased to be a clearing agency registered under the
      Exchange Act, and a successor depositary has not been appointed by the
      Company within 90 days, (B) an Event of Default has occurred and is
      continuing, (C) the Company, in its sole discretion, notifies the Trustee
      in writing that it no longer wishes to have all the Debentures represented
      by Global Debentures or (D) any beneficial holder reasonably requests such
      exchange on terms acceptable to the Company and the Depositary, which in
      the case of the Trustee may include, in the Trustee's sole discretion,
      among other things, the requirement that (i) the Trustee and any Debenture
      Registrar receive (a) from the

                                       21
<PAGE>

      Company or the Depositary, a written order, in either case requesting such
      exchange, and an Opinion of Counsel (which upon receipt thereof the
      Trustee and such Debenture Registrar shall be fully protected in relying)
      to the effect that (x) all securities laws in connection with such
      exchange have been complied with and (y) such exchange is otherwise
      authorized or permitted by this Indenture; and (b) from such beneficial
      holder (x) an affidavit as to its beneficial ownership interest in such
      Global Debenture and/or (y) an indemnity, reasonably satisfactory to the
      Trustee and such Debenture Registrar, against any loss, liability or
      expense to the Trustee and such Debenture Registrar to the extent that the
      Trustee or Debenture Registrar acts upon such order, affidavit and/or
      indemnity; and (ii) such exchange can be accomplished in a manner that is
      practicable and not inconsistent with the rules of any applicable
      Depositary or securities exchange upon which the Debentures may be listed
      for trading. Any Global Debenture exchanged pursuant to clause (A) or (B)
      above shall be so exchanged in whole and not in part and any Global
      Debenture exchanged pursuant to clause (C) or (D) above may be exchanged
      in whole or from time to time in part as directed by the Company. Any
      Debenture issued in exchange for a Global Debenture or any portion thereof
      shall be a Global Debenture; provided that any such Debenture so issued
      that is registered in the name of a Person other than the Depositary or a
      nominee thereof shall not be a Global Debenture.

            (iii) Debentures issued in exchange for a Global Debenture or any
      portion thereof pursuant to clause (ii) above shall be issued in
      definitive, fully registered form, without interest coupons, shall have an
      aggregate principal amount equal to that of such Global Debenture or
      portion thereof to be so exchanged, shall be registered in such names and
      be in such authorized denominations as the Depositary shall designate and
      shall bear any legends required hereunder. Any Global Debenture to be
      exchanged in whole shall be surrendered by the Depositary to the Trustee,
      as Debenture Registrar. With regard to any Global Debenture to be
      exchanged in part, either such Global Debenture shall be so surrendered
      for exchange or, if the Trustee is acting as Custodian for the Depositary
      or its nominee with respect to such Global Debenture, the principal amount
      thereof shall be reduced, by an amount equal to the portion thereof to be
      so exchanged, by means of an appropriate adjustment made on the records of
      the Trustee. Upon any such surrender or adjustment, the Trustee shall
      authenticate and make available for delivery the Debenture issuable on
      such exchange to or upon the written order of the Depositary or an
      authorized representative thereof.

            (iv) In the event of the occurrence of any of the events specified
      in clause (ii) above, the Company will promptly make available to the
      Trustee a reasonable supply of certificated Debentures in definitive,
      fully registered form, without interest coupons.

            (v) Neither any members of, or participants in, the Depositary
      ("Agent Members") nor any other Persons on whose behalf Agent Members may
      act shall have any rights under this Indenture with respect to any Global
      Debenture

                                       22
<PAGE>

      registered in the name of the Depositary or any nominee thereof, and the
      Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, may be treated by the
      Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee and any agent of the Company, the
      Guarantors or the Trustee as the absolute owner and holder of such Global
      Debenture for all purposes whatsoever. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
      nothing herein shall prevent the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee or
      any agent of the Company, the Guarantors or the Trustee from giving effect
      to any written certification, proxy or other authorization furnished by
      the Depositary or such nominee, as the case may be, or impair, as between
      the Depositary, its Agent Members and any other Person on whose behalf an
      Agent Member may act, the operation of customary practices of such Persons
      governing the exercise of the rights of a beneficial holder of any
      Debenture.

            (vi) At such time as all interests in a Global Debenture have been
      redeemed, repurchased, converted, canceled or exchanged for Debentures in
      certificated form, such Global Debenture shall, upon receipt thereof, be
      canceled by the Trustee in accordance with standing procedures and
      instructions existing between the Depositary and the Custodian. At any
      time prior to such cancellation, if any interest in a Global Debenture is
      redeemed, repurchased, converted, canceled or exchanged for Debentures in
      certificated form, the principal amount of such Global Debenture shall, in
      accordance with the standing procedures and instructions existing between
      the Depositary and the Custodian, be appropriately reduced, and an
      endorsement shall be made on such Global Debenture, by the Trustee or the
      Custodian, at the direction of the Trustee, to reflect such reduction.

            (c) Every Debenture that bears or is required under this Section
2.05(c) to bear the legend set forth in this Section 2.05(c) (together with any
Common Stock issued upon conversion of the Debentures and required to bear the
legend set forth in Section 2.05(d), collectively, the "Restricted Securities")
shall be subject to the restrictions on transfer set forth in this Section
2.05(c) (including those set forth in the legend below) unless such restrictions
on transfer shall be waived by written consent of the Company, and the holder of
each such Restricted Security, by such holder's acceptance thereof, agrees to be
bound by all such restrictions on transfer. As used in Section 2.05(c) and
2.05(d), the term "transfer" encompasses any sale, pledge, loan, transfer or

COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.

            Any Debenture (or security issued in exchange or substitution
therefor) as to which such restrictions on transfer shall have expired in
accordance with their terms or as to conditions for removal of the foregoing
legend set forth therein have been satisfied may, upon surrender of such
Debenture for exchange to the Debenture Registrar in accordance with the
provisions of this Section 2.05, be exchanged for a new Debenture or Debentures,
of like tenor and aggregate principal amount, which shall not bear the
restrictive legend required by this Section 2.05(c). If the Restricted Security
surrendered for exchange is represented by a Global Debenture bearing the legend
set forth in this Section 2.05(c), the principal amount of the legended Global
Debenture shall be reduced by the appropriate principal amount and the principal
amount of a Global Debenture without the legend set forth in this Section
2.05(c) shall be increased by an equal principal amount. If a Global Debenture
without the legend set forth in this Section 2.05(c) is not then outstanding,
the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and deliver an
unlegended Global Debenture to the Depositary.

            (d) Until the expiration of the holding period applicable to sales
thereof under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or any successor provision),
any stock certificate representing Common Stock issued upon conversion of any

THIS SECURITY UNDER RULE 144 UNDER THE SECURITIES ACT (OR ANY SUCCESSOR

            THE HOLDER OF THIS SECURITY IS ENTITLED TO THE BENEFITS OF A
REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT DATED DECEMBER 23, 2004 AND, BY ITS ACCEPTANCE
HEREOF, AGREES TO BE BOUND BY AND TO COMPLY WITH THE PROVISIONS OF SUCH
REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT.

            Any such Common Stock as to which such restrictions on transfer
shall have expired in accordance with their terms or as to which the
conditions for removal of the foregoing legend set forth therein have been
satisfied may, upon surrender of the certificates representing such shares of
Common Stock for exchange in accordance with the procedures of the transfer
agent for the Common Stock, be exchanged for a new certificate or
certificates for a like number of shares of Common Stock, which shall not
bear the restrictive legend required by this Section 2.05(d).

            (e) Any Debenture or Common Stock issued upon the conversion of a
Debenture that, prior to the expiration of the holding period applicable to
sales thereof under Rule 144(k) under the Securities Act (or any successor
provision), is purchased or owned by the Company or any Affiliate thereof may
not be resold by the Company or such Affiliate unless registered under the
Securities Act or resold pursuant to an exemption from the registration
requirements of the Securities Act in a transaction which results in such
Debentures or Common Stock, as the case may be, no longer being "restricted
securities" (as defined under Rule 144).

            The Trustee shall have no obligation or duty to monitor, determine
or inquire as to compliance with any restrictions on transfer imposed under this
Indenture or under applicable law with respect to any transfer of any interest
in any Debenture (including any transfers between or among Agent Members or
beneficial holders of interests in any Global Debenture) other than to require
delivery of such certificates and other documentation or evidence as are
expressly required by, and to do so if and when

                                       26
<PAGE>

expressly required by, the terms of this Indenture, and to examine the same to
determine substantial compliance as to form with the express requirements
hereof.

            Section 2.06. Mutilated, Destroyed, Lost or Stolen Debentures. In
case any Debenture shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen, the
Company in its discretion may execute, and upon its written request the Trustee
shall authenticate and make available for delivery, a new Debenture, bearing a
number not contemporaneously outstanding, in exchange and substitution for the
mutilated Debenture, or in lieu of and in substitution for the Debenture so
destroyed, lost or stolen. In every case, the applicant for a substituted
Debenture shall furnish to the Company and to the Trustee such security or
indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them harmless for any loss,
liability, cost or expense caused by or connected with such substitution, and,
in every case of destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to
the Company and to the Trustee evidence to their satisfaction of the
destruction, loss or theft of such Debenture and of the ownership thereof.

            Following receipt by the Trustee of satisfactory security or
indemnity and evidence, as described in the preceding paragraph, the Trustee
may authenticate any such substituted Debenture and make available for
delivery such Debenture. Upon the issuance of any substituted Debenture, the
Company may require the payment by the holder of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that may be imposed in
relation thereto and any other expenses connected therewith.  In case any
Debenture which has matured or is about to mature or has been called for
redemption or has been tendered for repurchase upon a Fundamental Change (and
not withdrawn) or has been surrendered for repurchase on a Repurchase Date
(and not withdrawn) or is to be converted into cash or a combination of cash
and Common Stock (or other property pursuant to the terms of this Indenture),
as the case may be, shall become mutilated or be destroyed, lost or stolen,
the Company may, instead of issuing a substitute Debenture, pay or authorize
the payment of or convert or authorize the conversion of the same (without
surrender thereof except in the case of a mutilated Debenture), as the case
may be, if the applicant for such payment or conversion shall furnish to the
Company and to the Trustee such security or indemnity as may be required by
them to save each of them harmless from any loss, liability, cost or expense
caused by or in connection with such substitution, and, in every case of
destruction, loss or theft, the applicant shall also furnish to the Company,
the Trustee and, if applicable, any Paying Agent or Conversion Agent evidence
to their satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of such Debenture and
of the ownership thereof.

            Every substitute Debenture issued pursuant to the provisions of
this Section 2.06 by virtue of the fact that any Debenture is destroyed, lost
or stolen shall constitute an additional contractual obligation of the
Company, whether or not the destroyed, lost or stolen Debenture shall be
found at any time, and shall be entitled to all the benefits of (but shall be
subject to all the limitations set forth in) this Indenture equally and
proportionately with any and all other Debentures duly issued hereunder.  To
the extent permitted by law, all Debentures shall be held and owned upon the
express condition that the foregoing provisions are exclusive with respect to
the replacement or

                                       27
<PAGE>

payment or conversion or redemption or repurchase of mutilated, destroyed, lost
or stolen Debentures and shall preclude any and all other rights or remedies
notwithstanding any law or statute existing or hereafter enacted to the contrary
with respect to the replacement or payment or conversion or redemption or
repurchase of negotiable instruments or other securities without their
surrender.

            Section 2.07. Temporary Debentures. Pending the preparation of
Debentures in certificated form, the Company may execute and the Trustee shall,
upon the written request of the Company, authenticate and deliver temporary
Debentures (printed or lithographed). Temporary Debentures shall be issuable in
any authorized denomination, and substantially in the form of the Debentures in
certificated form, but with such omissions, insertions and variations as may be
appropriate for temporary Debentures, all as may be determined by the Company.
Every such temporary Debenture shall be executed by the Company and
authenticated by the Trustee upon the same conditions and in substantially the
same manner, and with the same effect, as the Debentures in certificated form.
Without unreasonable delay, the Company will execute and deliver to the Trustee
Debentures in certificated form and thereupon any or all temporary Debentures
may be surrendered in exchange therefor, at each office or agency maintained by
the Company pursuant to Section 5.02 and the Trustee shall authenticate and make
available for delivery in exchange for such temporary Debentures an equal
aggregate principal amount of Debentures in certificated form. Such exchange
shall be made by the Company at its own expense and without any charge therefor.
Until so exchanged, the temporary Debentures shall in all respects be entitled
to the same benefits and subject to the same limitations under this Indenture as
Debentures in certificated form authenticated and delivered hereunder.

            Section 2.08. Cancellation of Debentures. All Debentures surrendered
for the purpose of payment, redemption, repurchase, conversion, exchange or
registration of transfer shall, if surrendered to the Company or any Paying
Agent or any Debenture Registrar or any Conversion Agent, be surrendered to the
Trustee and promptly canceled by it, or, if surrendered to the Trustee, shall be
promptly canceled by it, and no Debentures shall be issued in lieu thereof
except as expressly permitted by any of the provisions of this Indenture. The
Trustee shall dispose of such canceled Debentures in accordance with its
customary procedures. If the Company shall acquire any of the Debentures, such
acquisition shall not operate as a redemption, repurchase or satisfaction of the
Indebtedness represented by such Debentures unless and until the same are
delivered to the Trustee for cancellation.

            Section 2.09. CUSIP Numbers. The Company in issuing the Debentures
may use "CUSIP" or "ISIN" numbers and/or similar numbers (if then generally in
use), and, if so, the Trustee shall use "CUSIP" and/or "ISIN" numbers in notices
of redemption as a convenience to Debentureholders; provided that any such
notice may state that no representation is made as to the correctness of such
numbers either as printed on the Debentures or as contained in any notice of a
redemption and that reliance may be placed only on the other identification
numbers printed on the Debentures, and any such redemption shall not be affected
by any defect in or omission

                                       28
<PAGE>

of such numbers. The Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any change in
the "CUSIP" and/or similar numbers.

                                  ARTICLE III

                     Redemption and Repurchase of Debentures
                     ---------------------------------------

            Section 3.01. Company's Right to Redeem. Prior to June 1, 2010, the
Debentures will not be redeemable, except in accordance with Article IV. At any
time on or after June 1, 2010 and prior to Stated Maturity, the Company, at its
option, may redeem the Debentures, in whole or in part, in accordance with the
provisions of Section 3.02 and Section 3.03, on the applicable Redemption Date
for a redemption price in cash equal to 100% of the principal amount of the
Debentures to be redeemed (the "Redemption Price"), plus any accrued and unpaid
Interest on the Debentures to be redeemed to but excluding the Redemption Date.

            Section 3.02. Notice of Optional Redemption; Selection of
Debentures. (a) In case the Company shall desire to exercise the right to redeem
all or, as the case may be, any part of the Debentures pursuant to Section 3.01,
it shall fix a date for redemption (the "Redemption Date") and it or, at its
written request received by the Trustee not fewer than 45 days prior (or such
shorter period of time as may be acceptable to the Trustee) to the Redemption
Date, the Trustee in the name of and at the expense of the Company, shall mail
or cause to be mailed a notice of such redemption (a "Redemption Notice") not
fewer than 30 nor more than 60 days prior to the Redemption Date to each holder
of Debentures so to be redeemed as a whole or in part at its last address as the
same appears on the Debenture Register; provided that if the Company shall give
such notice, it shall also give written notice of the Redemption Date to the
Trustee. Such mailing shall be by first class mail. The notice, if mailed in the
manner herein provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given,
whether or not the holder receives such notice. In any case, failure to give
such notice by mail or any defect in the notice to the holder of any Debenture
designated for redemption as a whole or in part shall not affect the validity of
the proceedings for the redemption of any other Debenture. Concurrently with the
mailing of any such Redemption Notice, the Company shall issue a press release
announcing such redemption, the form and content of which press release shall be
determined by the Company in its sole discretion. The failure to issue any such
press release or any defect therein shall not affect the validity of the
Redemption Notice or any of the proceedings for the redemption of any Debenture
called for redemption.

            (b) Each such Redemption Notice shall specify the aggregate
principal amount of Debentures to be redeemed, the CUSIP, ISIN or similar number
or numbers of the Debentures being redeemed, the Redemption Date (which shall be
a Business Day), the Redemption Price at which Debentures are to be redeemed,
the place or places of payment, that payment will be made upon presentation and
surrender of such Debentures, that Interest accrued to the Redemption Date will
be paid as specified in said notice, and

                                       29
<PAGE>

that on and after said date Interest thereon or on the portion thereof to be
redeemed will cease to accrue (unless payment is prohibited by Article XVI or
XVIII of this Indenture). Such notice shall also state the current Conversion
Rate and the date on which the right to convert such Debentures or portions
thereof into cash or a combination of cash and Common Stock (or other property
pursuant to the terms of this Indenture) will expire. If fewer than all the
Debentures are to be redeemed, the Redemption Notice shall identify the
Debentures to be redeemed (including CUSIP, ISIN or similar numbers, if any). In
case any Debenture is to be redeemed in part only, the Redemption Notice shall
state the portion of the principal amount thereof to be redeemed and shall state
that, on and after the Redemption Date, upon surrender of such Debenture, a new
Debenture or Debentures in principal amount equal to the unredeemed portion
thereof will be issued.

            (c) On or prior to the Redemption Date specified in the Redemption
Notice given as provided in this Section 3.02, the Company will deposit with the
Trustee or with one or more Paying Agents (or, if the Company is acting as its
own Paying Agent, set aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section
5.04) an amount of money in immediately available funds sufficient to redeem on
the Redemption Date all the Debentures (or portions thereof) so called for
redemption (other than those theretofore surrendered for conversion) at the
appropriate Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid Interest to but excluding
the Redemption Date; provided that if such payment is made on the Redemption
Date it must be received by the Trustee or Paying Agent, as the case may be, by
11:00 a.m., New York City time, on such date. The Company shall be entitled to
retain any interest, yield or gain on amounts deposited with the Trustee or any
Paying Agent pursuant to this Section 3.02(c) in excess of amounts required
hereunder to pay the Redemption Price and accrued Interest to, but excluding,
the Redemption Date. Subject to the last sentence of Section 8.05, if any
Debenture called for redemption is converted pursuant hereto prior to such
Redemption Date, any money deposited with the Trustee or any Paying Agent or so
segregated and held in trust for the redemption of such Debenture shall be paid
to the Company upon its written request, or, if then held by the Company, shall
be discharged from such trust. Whenever any Debentures are to be redeemed, the
Company will give the Trustee written notice in the form of an Officers'
Certificate not fewer than 45 days (or such shorter period of time as may be
acceptable to the Trustee) prior to the Redemption Date as to the aggregate
principal amount of Debentures to be redeemed.

            (d) If less than all of the outstanding Debentures are to be
redeemed, the Trustee shall select the Debentures or portions thereof of the
Global Debenture or the Debentures in certificated form to be redeemed (in
principal amounts of $1,000 or integral multiples thereof) by lot, on a pro rata
basis or by another method the Trustee deems fair and appropriate, and in such
manner as complies with any applicable requirements of the principal national
securities exchange, if any, on which the Debentures are listed. If any
Debenture selected for partial redemption is submitted for conversion in part
after such selection and prior to redemption, the portion of such Debenture
submitted for conversion shall be deemed (so far as may be possible) to be from
the portion selected for redemption. The Debentures (or portions thereof) so
selected shall be deemed duly selected for redemption for all purposes hereof,


                                       30
<PAGE>

notwithstanding that any such Debenture is submitted for conversion in part
before the mailing of the Redemption Notice.

            Upon any redemption of less than all of the outstanding Debentures,
the Company and the Trustee may (but need not), solely for purposes of
determining the pro rata allocation among such Debentures as are unconverted and
outstanding at the time of redemption, treat as outstanding any Debentures
surrendered for conversion during the period of 15 days next preceding the
mailing of a Redemption Notice and may (but need not) treat as outstanding any
Debenture authenticated and delivered during such period in exchange for the
unconverted portion of any Debenture converted in part during such period.

            Section 3.03. Payment of Debentures Called for Redemption by the
Company. If notice of redemption has been given as provided in Section 3.02, the
Debentures or portion of Debentures with respect to which such notice has been
given shall, unless converted into cash or a combination of cash and Common
Stock (or other property pursuant to the terms of this Indenture), as the case
may be, pursuant to the terms hereof, become due and payable on the Redemption
Date and at the place or places stated in such notice at the applicable
Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid Interest to but excluding the
Redemption Date, and on and after the Redemption Date (unless the Company shall
default in the payment of such Debentures at the Redemption Price plus accrued
and unpaid Interest to but excluding the Redemption Date or unless such payment
is prohibited by the terms of Article XVI or XVIII) Interest on the Debentures
or portion of Debentures so called for redemption shall cease to accrue and,
after the close of business on the second Business Day immediately preceding the
Redemption Date (unless the Company shall default in the payment of such
Debentures at the Redemption Price plus accrued and unpaid Interest to but
excluding the Redemption Date or unless such payment is prohibited by the terms
of Article XVI or XVIII) such Debentures shall cease to be convertible and,
except as provided in Section 8.05, to be entitled to any benefit or security
under this Indenture, and the holders thereof shall have no right in respect of
such Debentures except the right to receive the Redemption Price plus accrued
and unpaid Interest to but excluding the Redemption Date. On presentation and
surrender of such Debentures at a place of payment in said notice specified, the
said Debentures or the specified portions thereof shall be paid and redeemed by
the Company at the applicable Redemption Price plus Interest accrued to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date; provided that if the applicable Redemption Date
is after a Regular Record Date and on or before the corresponding Interest
Payment Date, the Interest payable on such Interest Payment Date shall be paid
on the applicable Redemption Date to the holders of record of such Debentures on
the applicable Regular Record Date instead of the holders surrendering such
Debentures for redemption on such date.

            Upon presentation of any Debenture redeemed in part only, the
Company shall execute and the Trustee shall authenticate and make available
for delivery to the holder thereof, at the expense of the Company, a new
Debenture or Debentures, of authorized denominations, in principal amount
equal to the unredeemed portion of the Debentures so presented.


                                       31
<PAGE>

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Trustee shall not redeem any
Debentures or mail any Redemption Notice during the continuance of a default
in payment of Interest on the Debentures.  If any Debenture called for
redemption shall not be so paid upon surrender thereof for redemption, the
principal shall, until paid or duly provided for, continue to bear Interest
at the rate borne by the Debenture, compounded semi-annually, and such
Debenture shall remain convertible until the principal and Interest shall
have been paid or duly provided for.  The Company will notify all of the
holders if the Company redeems any of the Debentures.

            Section 3.04. Repurchase of Debentures by the Company at Option of
Holders Upon a Fundamental Change. (a) If a Fundamental Change shall occur at
any time prior to Stated Maturity, each holder shall have the right, at such
holder's option, to require the Company to repurchase for cash any or all of
such holder's outstanding Debentures, or any portion of the principal amount
thereof that is equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000, on the date
specified in the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice, which date shall be no
more than 35 days after the date of the Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice
(subject to extension to comply with applicable law) (the "Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date"). The Company shall repurchase such Debentures at a price equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof (the "Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price") plus any accrued and unpaid Interest to but excluding the Fundamental
Change Repurchase Date. If the applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is
after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest
Payment Date, the Interest payable on such Interest Payment Date shall be paid
on such Interest Payment Date to the holders of record of such Debentures on the
applicable Regular Record Date instead of the holders surrendering such
Debentures for repurchase on such date.

            (b) On or before the 30th day after the occurrence of a Fundamental
Change, the Company, or at its written request the Trustee in the name of and at
the expense of the Company (which request must be received by the Trustee at
least five Business Days prior to the date the Trustee is requested to give
notice as described below, unless the Trustee shall agree to a shorter period),
shall mail or cause to be mailed, by first class mail, to all holders of record
on such date, a notice (the "Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice") of the
occurrence of such Fundamental Change and of the repurchase right at the option
of the holders arising as a result thereof to each holder of Debentures at its
last address as the same appears on the Debenture Register, and to beneficial
owners as required by applicable law; provided that if the Company shall give
such notice, it shall also give written notice of the Fundamental Change to the
Trustee and Paying Agent, if other than the Trustee, at such time as it is
mailed to Debentureholders. Such notice, if mailed in the manner herein
provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not
the holder receives such notice. Each Fundamental Change Repurchase Notice shall
state, among other things:

            (i) the events causing the Fundamental Change;

            (ii) the date of the Fundamental Change;


                                       32
<PAGE>

            (iii) the last date on which a holder may exercise the repurchase
      right;

            (iv) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Price, the applicable
      Conversion Rate at the time of such notice (and any applicable adjustments
      to the Conversion Rate that will result from the Fundamental Change) and,
      to the extent known at the time of such notice, the amount of Interest

                        and conditions specified in the Debentures and in the

      the Debentures so delivered or transferred to the Paying Agent shall
      conform in all respects to the description thereof in the related
      Fundamental Change Repurchase Election. All questions as to the validity,
      eligibility (including time of receipt) and acceptance of any Debenture
      for repurchase shall be determined by the Company, whose determination
      shall be final and binding absent manifest error.

of and at the expense of the Company (which request must be received by the

Register, and to beneficial owners as required by applicable law;

                                       34

provided that if the Company shall give such notice, it shall also give written
notice to the Trustee and Paying Agent, if other than the Trustee, at such time
as it is mailed to Debentureholders. Such notice, if mailed in the manner herein
provided, shall be conclusively presumed to have been duly given, whether or not
the holder receives such notice. Each Company Repurchase Notice shall state,

      the time of such notice (and any applicable adjustments to the Conversion

      provided that the Debentures are otherwise convertible in accordance with
      Section 15.01;

            (vi) that the holder shall have the right to withdraw any Debentures
      surrendered prior to the close of business on the Business Day immediately

      follow to exercise such repurchase right or to withdraw any surrendered
      Debentures;

            (viii) the CUSIP, ISIN or similar number or numbers of the
      Debentures (if then generally in use); and

            (ix) briefly, the conversion rights of the holders of Debentures and
      whether, at the time of such notice, the Debentures are eligible for
      conversion.

            No failure of the Company to give the foregoing notices and no
defect therein shall limit the Debentureholders' repurchase rights or affect the
validity of the proceedings for the repurchase of the Debentures pursuant to
this Section 3.05.

            (c) Debentures shall be repurchased pursuant to this Section 3.05 at
the option of the holder upon:

            (i) delivery to the Paying Agent by a holder of a duly completed
      notice (a "Company Repurchase Election") in the form set forth on the
      reverse of the Debenture at any time from the opening of business on the

                                       35
<PAGE>

      preceding the Company Repurchase Date until the close of business on the
      date that is two Business Days prior to the Company Repurchase Date
      stating:

                  (A) if certificated, the certificate numbers of the Debentures
             which the holder shall deliver to be repurchased;

                  (B) the portion of the principal amount of the Debentures that
             the holder shall deliver to be repurchased, which portion must be
             $1,000 or an integral multiple thereof; and

                  (C) that such Debentures shall be repurchased as of the
             Company Repurchase Date pursuant to the terms and conditions
             specified in the Debentures and in the Indenture; and

            (ii) delivery or book-entry transfer of the Debentures to the Paying
      Agent simultaneously with or at any time after delivery of the Company
      Repurchase Election (together with all necessary endorsements) at the
      office of the Paying Agent in the Borough of Manhattan, such delivery or
      transfer being a condition to receipt by the holder of the Company
      Repurchase Price therefor; provided that such Company Repurchase Price
      shall be so paid pursuant to this Section 3.05 only if the Debentures so
      delivered or transferred to the Paying Agent shall conform in all respects
      to the description thereof in the related Company Repurchase Election. All
      questions as to the validity, eligibility (including time of receipt) and
      acceptance of any Debenture for repurchase shall be determined by the
      Company, whose determination shall be final and binding absent manifest
      error.

            If the Debentures are not in certificated form, holders must
provide notice of their election in accordance with the appropriate
procedures of the Depositary.

            Section 3.06. Conditions and Procedures for Repurchase at Option of
Holders. (a) The Company shall repurchase from the holder thereof, pursuant to
Section 3.04 or Section 3.05, a portion of a Debenture, if the principal amount
of such portion is $1,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000. Provisions of this
Indenture that apply to the repurchase of all of a Debenture also apply to the
repurchase of such portion of such Debenture. Upon presentation of any Debenture
repurchased in part only, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and make available for delivery to the holder thereof, at the
expense of the Company, a new Debenture or Debentures, of any authorized
denomination, in aggregate principal amount equal to the portion of the
Debentures presented not repurchased.

            (b) On or prior to a Repurchase Date, the Company will deposit with
the Paying Agent (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, set
aside, segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 5.04) an amount of
money sufficient to repurchase on the Repurchase Date all the Debentures or
portions thereof to be repurchased on such date at the Repurchase Price plus
accrued and unpaid Interest, if any,

                                       36
<PAGE>

to but excluding the Repurchase Date; provided that if such deposit is made on
the Repurchase Date it must be received by the Paying Agent by 11:00 a.m., New
York City time, on such date.

            If the Paying Agent holds (or the Company, if acting as the Paying
Agent, segregates and holds in trust as provided in Section 5.04) money
sufficient to pay the aggregate Repurchase Price of all the Debentures or
portions thereof that are to be repurchased plus accrued and unpaid Interest, if
any, to but excluding the Repurchase Date (and such payment is not prohibited by
Article XVI or XVIII), then, on the Business Day following such date (i) such
Debentures will cease to be outstanding, (ii) Interest on such Debentures will
cease to accrue (whether or not book-entry transfer of the Debentures has been
made or the Debentures have been delivered to the Paying Agent) and (iii) all
other rights of the holders of such Debentures will terminate (other than the
right to receive the Repurchase Price plus accrued and unpaid Interest, if any,
to but excluding the Repurchase Date, if applicable, upon book-entry transfer or
delivery of the Debentures, as the case may be).

            (c) Upon receipt by the Paying Agent of a Repurchase Election, the
holder of the Debenture in respect of which such Repurchase Election was given
shall (unless such Repurchase Election is validly withdrawn) thereafter be
entitled to receive solely the Repurchase Price plus accrued and unpaid
Interest, if any, to but excluding the Repurchase Date, if applicable, with
respect to such Debenture. Such Repurchase Price plus accrued and unpaid
Interest, if any, to but excluding the Repurchase Date, if applicable, shall be
paid to such holder, subject to receipt of funds and/or Debentures by the Paying
Agent, promptly (but in no event more than five Business Days) following the
later of (x) the Repurchase Date with respect to such Debenture (provided the
holder has satisfied the conditions in Section 3.04(c) or Section 3.05(c), as
applicable) and (y) the time of book-entry transfer or delivery, as the case may
be, of such Debenture to the Paying Agent by the holder thereof in the manner
required by Section 3.04(c) or Section 3.05(c), as applicable. Debentures in
respect of which a Repurchase Election has been given by the holder thereof may
not be converted pursuant to Article XV hereof on or after the date of the
delivery of such Repurchase Election unless such Repurchase Election has first
been validly withdrawn.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, any holder
delivering to the office of the Paying Agent a Repurchase Election shall have
the right to withdraw such election, in whole or in part, at any time prior to
the close of business on the Business Day preceding the Repurchase Date (or any
such later time as may be required by applicable law) by delivery of a written
notice of withdrawal to the Paying Agent specifying:

            (i) the principal amount of the Debenture with respect to which such
      notice of withdrawal is being submitted,

            (ii) the certificate number, if any, of the Debenture in respect of
      which such notice of withdrawal is being submitted, or the appropriate
      Depositary


                                       37
<PAGE>

      information if the Debenture in respect of which such notice of withdrawal
      is being submitted is represented by a Global Debenture, and

            (iii) the principal amount, if any, of such Debenture which remains
      subject to the original Repurchase Election and which has been or will be
      delivered for repurchase by the Company.

            If the Debentures are not in certificated form, holders must provide
notice of their withdrawal in accordance with the appropriate procedures of the
Depositary.

            The Paying Agent shall promptly notify the Company of the receipt by
it of any Repurchase Election or written notice of withdrawal thereof.

            (e) The Company will comply with the provisions of Rule 13e-4 and
any other tender offer rules under the Exchange Act to the extent then
applicable in connection with the repurchase rights of the holders of Debentures
in the event of a Fundamental Change or on any Company Repurchase Date. If then
required by applicable rules, the Company will file a Schedule TO or any other
schedule required in connection with any offer by the Company to repurchase
Debentures.

            (f) There shall be no repurchase of any Debentures pursuant to
Section 3.04 or Section 3.05 if there has occurred at any time prior to, and is
continuing on, the Repurchase Date an Event of Default (other than an Event of
Default that is cured by the payment of the Repurchase Price with respect to
such Debentures). The Paying Agent will promptly return to the respective
holders thereof any Debentures (x) with respect to which a Repurchase Election
has been withdrawn in compliance with this Indenture, or (y) held by it during
the continuance of an Event of Default (other than a default in the payment of
the Repurchase Price with respect to such Debentures) in which case, upon such
return, the Repurchase Election with respect thereto shall be deemed to have
been withdrawn.

            (g) The Paying Agent shall return to the Company any cash that
remains unclaimed as provided in Section 13.03, together with interest, if any,
thereon, held by them for the payment of the Repurchase Price; provided that to
the extent that the aggregate amount of cash deposited by the Company pursuant
to Section 3.06(b) exceeds the aggregate Repurchase Price of the Debentures or
portions thereof which the Company is obligated to purchase as of the Repurchase
Date then, unless otherwise agreed in writing with the Company, promptly after
the Business Day following the Repurchase Date, the Paying Agent shall return
any such excess to the Company together with interest, if any, thereon.

            (h) In the case of a reclassification, change, consolidation,
merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance to which Section
15.06 applies, in which the Common Stock of the Company is changed or exchanged
as a result into the right to receive cash, securities or other property, which
includes shares of Common Stock of the Company or shares of common stock of
another Person that are, or upon


                                       38

<PAGE>

issuance will be, traded on a United States national securities exchange or
approved for trading on an established automated over-the-counter trading market
in the United States and such shares constitute at the time such change or
exchange becomes effective in excess of 50% of the aggregate fair market value
of such cash, securities or other property (as determined by the Company, which
determination shall be conclusive and binding), then the Person formed by such
consolidation or resulting from such merger or which acquires such assets, as
the case may be, shall execute and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental
indenture (accompanied by an Opinion of Counsel that such supplemental indenture
complies with the Trust Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of
such supplemental indenture) modifying the provisions of this Indenture relating
to the right of holders of the Debentures to cause the Company to repurchase the
Debentures following a Fundamental Change, including without limitation the
applicable provisions of this Article III and the definition of Fundamental
Change, as appropriate, as determined in good faith by the Company (which
determination shall be conclusive and binding), to make such provisions apply to
such other Person if different from the Company (in lieu of the Company).

            (i) In the event that at the time of a Fundamental Change or Company
Repurchase Date, as the case may be, the terms of any Senior Debt of the Company
(including the Credit Agreement) restrict or prohibit the repurchase of
Debentures pursuant to Section 3.04 or Section 3.05, as the case may be, then
prior to the mailing of the notice to holders provided for in Section 3.04(b) or
3.05(b), as the case may be, but in any event within 30 days following any
Fundamental Change or 30 days in advance of such Company Repurchase Date, as the
case may be, the Company shall (1) repay in full all such Senior Debt or (2)
obtain the requisite consents under the agreements governing such Senior Debt to
permit the repurchase of the Debentures as provided for in Section 3.04 or
Section 3.05, as the case may be.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                  Mandatory Disposition Pursuant to Gaming Laws
                  ---------------------------------------------

            (a) If a holder or a beneficial owner of a Debenture is required by
any Gaming Authority to be found suitable to hold the Debentures or a beneficial
interest therein under applicable gaming laws, such holder or beneficial owner,
as the case may be, shall apply for a finding of suitability within the time
period required by such Gaming Authority.

            (b) If a holder or beneficial owner of a Debenture is required to be
found suitable to hold the Debentures or beneficial interest therein as provided
in clause (a) and is not found suitable by the applicable Gaming Authority,
whether as a result of the failure to apply for such finding of suitability
within the required time period or a finding of unsuitability, such holder or
beneficial owner, as the case may be, shall, to the extent required by
applicable gaming law, dispose of its Debentures or beneficial interest therein


                                       39
<PAGE>

within 30 days following such failure or finding, or within such other time
period as may be prescribed by the applicable Gaming Authority, whichever is
less.

            (c) If the holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, fails to
dispose of its Debentures or beneficial interest therein as provided in clause
(b), the Company may, at its option, redeem such Debentures at, subject to
applicable law, (1) the lower of (x) 100% of the principal amount thereof,
together with accrued and unpaid Interest to the date of the failure to apply or
the finding of unsuitability by a Gaming Authority, as the case may be, and (y)
the amount that such holder or beneficial owner paid for the Debentures or (2)
such other amount as may be determined by the applicable Gaming Authority. The
Company shall give 30 days prior written notice (or such other time period as
may be prescribed by the applicable Gaming Authority, whichever is less) to the
holder or beneficial owner of its election to redeem the Debentures in the event
such holder or beneficial owner, as the case may be, fails to dispose of its
Debentures in accordance with clause (b), which notice shall set forth the
redemption price therefor.

            (d) The Company shall notify the Trustee in writing of any
redemption pursuant to clause (c) as soon as reasonably practicable. The Company
shall not be responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by any such holder
or beneficial owner of a Debenture in connection with any such application or
investigation for a finding of suitability.

                                   ARTICLE V

                       Particular Covenants of the Company

maintain an office or agency in the Borough of Manhattan, The City of New York,
where the Debentures may be surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange
or for presentation for payment or for conversion, redemption or repurchase and
where notices and demands to or upon the Company in respect of the Debentures
and this Indenture may be served. The Company will give prompt written notice to
the Trustee of the location, and any change in the location, of such office or
agency not designated or appointed by the Trustee. If at any time the Company
shall fail to maintain any such required office or agency or shall fail to
furnish the Trustee with the address thereof, such presentations, surrenders,
notices and demands may be made or served at the Corporate Trust Office.


                                       40
<PAGE>

            The Company may also from time to time designate co-registrars and
one or more offices or agencies where the Debentures may be presented or
surrendered for any or all such purposes and may from time to time rescind such
designations. The Company will give prompt written notice of any such
designation or rescission and of any change in the location of any such other
office or agency.

            The Company hereby initially designates the Trustee as Paying Agent,
Debenture Registrar, Custodian and Conversion Agent, and each of the Corporate
Trust Office and the office or agency of the Trustee in the Borough of Manhattan
shall be considered as one such office or agency of the Company for each of the
aforesaid purposes.

            So long as the Trustee is the Debenture Registrar, the Trustee
agrees to mail, or cause to be mailed, the notices set forth in Section 8.10
and the third paragraph of Section 8.11.  If co-registrars have been
appointed in accordance with this Section, the Trustee shall mail such
notices only to the Company and the holders of Debentures it can identify
from its records.

            Section 5.03. Appointments to Fill Vacancies in Trustee's Office.
The Company, whenever necessary to avoid or fill a vacancy in the office of
Trustee, will appoint, in the manner provided in Section 8.10, a Trustee, so
that there shall at all times be a Trustee hereunder.

            Section 5.04. Provisions as to Paying Agent. (a) If the Company
shall appoint a Paying Agent other than the Trustee, the Company will cause such
Paying Agent to execute and deliver to the Trustee an instrument in which such
Paying Agent shall agree with the Trustee, subject to the provisions of this
Section 5.04:

            (i) that it will hold all sums held by it as such agent for the
      payment of the principal of or Interest on the Debentures (whether such
      sums have been paid to it by the Company or by any other obligor on the
      Debentures) in trust for the benefit of the holders of the Debentures;

            (ii) that it will give the Trustee notice of any failure by the
      Company (or by any other obligor on the Debentures) to make any payment of
      the principal of or Interest on the Debentures when the same shall be due
      and payable; and

            (iii) that at any time during the continuance of an Event of
      Default, upon request of the Trustee, it will forthwith pay to the Trustee
      all sums so held in trust.

            The Company shall, on or before each due date of the principal of or
Interest on the Debentures, deposit with the Paying Agent a sum (in funds which
are immediately available on the due date for such payment) sufficient to pay
such principal or Interest, and (unless such Paying Agent is the Trustee) the
Company will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action;
provided that if such deposit is made

                                       41

before each due date of the principal of or Interest on the Debentures, set
aside, segregate and hold in trust for the benefit of the holders of the
Debentures a sum sufficient to pay such principal or Interest so becoming due
and will promptly notify the Trustee of any failure to take such action and of
any failure by the Company (or any other obligor under the Debentures) to make
any payment of the principal of or Interest on the Debentures when the same
shall become due and payable.

            (c) Anything in this Section 5.04 to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Company may, at any time, for the purpose of obtaining a satisfaction and
discharge of this Indenture, or for any other reason, pay or cause to be paid to
the Trustee all sums held in trust by the Company or any Paying Agent hereunder
as required by this Section 5.04, such sums to be held by the Trustee upon the
trusts herein contained and upon such payment by the Company or any Paying Agent
to the Trustee, the Company or such Paying Agent shall be released from all

or cause to be done all things necessary to preserve and keep in full force and
effect its existence and rights (charter and statutory); provided that the

(to the extent that it may lawfully do so) that it shall not at any time insist
upon, plead, or in any manner whatsoever claim or take the benefit or advantage
of, any stay, extension or usury law or other law which would prohibit or
forgive the Company from paying all or any portion of the principal of or
Interest on the Debentures as contemplated herein, wherever enacted, now or at

performance of this Indenture and the Company (to the extent it may lawfully do
so) hereby expressly waives all benefit or advantage of any such law, and
covenants that it will not, by resort to any such law, hinder, delay or impede
the execution of any power herein granted to the Trustee, but will suffer and

default, specifying all such defaults and the nature and the status thereof of
which the signer may have knowledge.

Company to the Trustee so long as the Trustee is acting as the sole Debenture
Registrar.

            Section 6.02. Preservation and Disclosure of Lists. (a) The Trustee
shall preserve, in as current a form as is reasonably practicable, all
information as to the names and addresses of the holders of Debentures contained

            (b) The rights of Debentureholders to communicate with other holders
of Debentures with respect to their rights under this Indenture or under the

made pursuant to the Trust Indenture Act.

shall be filed with the Trustee within 15 days after the same is so required to
be filed with the Commission. Delivery of such reports, information and
documents to the Trustee is for informational purposes only and the Trustee's
receipt of such shall not constitute constructive notice of any information
contained therein or determinable from information contained therein, including
the Company's compliance with any of its covenants hereunder (as to which the
Trustee is entitled to rely exclusively on Officers' Certificates).

                                  ARTICLE VII

                         the final stated maturity of such Indebtedness; or

                                 (ii) shall constitute the failure to pay such

                  and who have not disclaimed liability with respect to such

                  its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar
                  law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the appointment of a
                  trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or other similar
                  official of the Company or any Significant Subsidiary or any
                  substantial part of the property of the Company or any
                  Significant Subsidiary, or consent by the Company or any
                  Significant Subsidiary to any such relief or to the
                  appointment of or taking possession by any such official in an
                  involuntary case or other proceeding commenced against the
                  Company or any Significant Subsidiary, or general assignment
                  by the Company or any Significant Subsidiary for the benefit

<PAGE>

                  Company or any Significant Subsidiary generally to pay its
                  debts as they become due; or

            (j)   commencement of an involuntary case or other proceeding
                  against the Company or any Significant Subsidiary seeking
                  liquidation, reorganization or other relief with respect to
                  such Person or its debts under any bankruptcy, insolvency or
                  other similar law now or hereafter in effect or seeking the
                  appointment of a trustee, receiver, liquidator, custodian or
                  other similar official of the Company or any Significant
                  Subsidiary or any substantial part of the property of the
                  Company or any Significant Subsidiary, and such involuntary
                  case or other proceeding shall remain undismissed and unstayed
                  for a period of 60 consecutive days;

then, and in each and every such case (other than an Event of Default
specified in Section 7.01(i) or 7.01(j)), unless the principal of all of the
Debentures shall have already become due and payable, either the Trustee or
the holders of not less than 25% in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures then outstanding hereunder determined in accordance with Section
9.04, by notice in writing to the Company (and to the Trustee if given by
Debentureholders), may declare the principal of all the Debentures and the
Interest accrued thereon to be due and payable immediately, and upon any such
declaration the same shall become and shall be immediately due and payable,
anything in this Indenture or in the Debentures contained to the contrary
notwithstanding.  If an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(i) or
7.01(j) occurs, the principal of all the Debentures and the Interest accrued
thereon shall be immediately and automatically due and payable without
necessity of further action.  This provision, however, is subject to the
conditions that if, at any time after the principal of the Debentures shall
have been so declared due and payable, and before any judgment or decree for
the payment of the monies due shall have been obtained or entered as
hereinafter provided, the Company shall pay or shall deposit with the Trustee
a sum sufficient to pay all matured installments of Interest upon all
Debentures and the principal of any and all Debentures which shall have
become due otherwise than by acceleration (with interest on overdue
installments of Interest (to the extent that payment of such interest is
enforceable under applicable law) and on such principal at the rate borne by
the Debentures, to the date of such payment or deposit) and amounts due to
the Trustee pursuant to Section 8.06 (and such deposit or payment therefrom
is not prohibited by Article XVI or XVIII), and if any and all defaults under
this Indenture, other than the nonpayment of principal of and accrued
Interest on Debentures which shall have become due by acceleration, shall
have been cured or waived pursuant to Section 7.07, then and in every such
case the holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures then outstanding, by written notice to the Company and to the
Trustee, may waive all defaults or Events of Default and rescind and annul
such declaration and its consequences; but no such waiver or rescission and
annulment shall extend to or shall affect any subsequent default or Event of
Default, or shall impair any right consequent thereon.  The Company shall
notify in writing a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, promptly upon
becoming aware thereof, of any Event of Default.

                                       47
<PAGE>

            In case the Trustee shall have proceeded to enforce any right
under this Indenture and such proceedings shall have been discontinued or
abandoned because of such waiver or rescission and annulment or for any other
reason or shall have been determined adversely to the Trustee, then and in
every such case the Company, the holders of Debentures, and the Trustee shall
be restored respectively to their several positions and rights hereunder, and
all rights, remedies and powers of the Company, the holders of Debentures,
and the Trustee shall continue as though no such proceeding had been taken.

            Section 7.02. Payments of Debentures on Default; Suit Therefor. The
Company covenants that (a) in case default shall be made in the payment of any
installment of Interest upon any of the Debentures as and when the same shall
become due and payable, and such default shall have continued for a period of 30
days, or (b) in case default shall be made in the payment of the principal of
any of the Debentures as and when the same shall have become due and payable,
whether at maturity of the Debentures or in connection with any redemption,
repurchase, acceleration, declaration or otherwise, then, upon demand of the
Trustee, the Company will pay to the Trustee, for the benefit of the holders of
the Debentures, the whole amount that then shall have become due and payable on
all such Debentures for principal or Interest, as the case may be, with interest
upon the overdue principal and (to the extent that payment of such interest is
enforceable under applicable law) upon the overdue installments of Interest at
the rate borne by the Debentures, and, in addition thereto, such further amount
as shall be sufficient to cover the costs and expenses of collection, including
reasonable compensation to the Trustee, its agents, attorneys and counsel, and
all other amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.06. Until such demand by the
Trustee, the Company may pay the principal of and Interest on the Debentures to
the registered holders, whether or not the Debentures are overdue.

            In case the Company shall fail forthwith to pay such amounts upon
such demand, the Trustee, in its own name and as trustee of an express trust,
shall be entitled and empowered to institute any actions or proceedings at law
or in equity for the collection of the sums so due and unpaid, and may prosecute
any such action or proceeding to judgment or final decree, and may enforce any
such judgment or final decree against the Company or any other obligor on the
Debentures and collect in the manner provided by law out of the property of the
Company or any other obligor on the Debentures wherever situated the monies
adjudged or decreed to be payable.

            In case there shall be pending proceedings for the bankruptcy or for
the reorganization of the Company or any other obligor on the Debentures under
Title 11 of the United States Code, or any other applicable law, or in case a
receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator,
sequestrator or similar official shall have been appointed for or taken
possession of the Company or such other obligor, the property of the Company or
such other obligor, or in the case of any other judicial proceedings relative to
the Company or such other obligor upon the Debentures, or to the creditors or
property of the Company or such other obligor, the Trustee, irrespective of
whether the principal of the Debentures shall then be due and payable as therein


                                       48
<PAGE>

expressed or by declaration or otherwise and irrespective of whether the Trustee
shall have made any demand pursuant to the provisions of this Section 7.02,
shall be entitled and empowered, by intervention in such proceedings or
otherwise, to file and prove a claim or claims for the whole amount of principal
and Interest owing and unpaid in respect of the Debentures, and, in case of any
judicial proceedings, to file such proofs of claim and other papers or documents
as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims of the Trustee and
of the Debentureholders allowed in such judicial proceedings relative to the
Company or any other obligor on the Debentures, its or their creditors, or its
or their property, and to collect and receive any monies or other property
payable or deliverable on any such claims, and to distribute the same after the
deduction of any amounts due the Trustee under Section 8.06, and to take any
other action with respect to such claims, including participating as a member of
any official committee of creditors, as it reasonably deems necessary or
advisable, and, unless prohibited by law or applicable regulations, and any
receiver, assignee or trustee in bankruptcy or reorganization, liquidator,
custodian or similar official is hereby authorized by each of the
Debentureholders to make such payments to the Trustee, and, in the event that
the Trustee shall consent to the making of such payments directly to the
Debentureholders, to pay to the Trustee any amount due it for reasonable
compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements, including counsel fees and
expenses incurred by it up to the date of such distribution. To the extent that
such payment of reasonable compensation, expenses, advances and disbursements
out of the estate in any such proceedings shall be denied for any reason,
payment of the same shall be secured by a lien on, and shall be paid out of, any
and all distributions, dividends, monies, securities and other property which
the holders of the Debentures may be entitled to receive in such proceedings,
whether in liquidation or under any plan of reorganization or arrangement or
otherwise.

            All rights of action and of asserting claims under this Indenture,
or under any of the Debentures, may be enforced by the Trustee without the
possession of any of the Debentures, or the production thereof at any trial or
other proceeding relative thereto, and any such suit or proceeding instituted by
the Trustee shall be brought in its own name as trustee of an express trust, and
any recovery of judgment shall, after provision for the payment of the
reasonable compensation, expenses, disbursements and advances of the Trustee,
its agents and counsel, be for the ratable benefit of the holders of the
Debentures.

            In any proceedings brought by the Trustee (and in any proceedings
involving the interpretation of any provision of this Indenture to which the
Trustee shall be a party) the Trustee shall be held to represent all the
holders of the Debentures, and it shall not be necessary to make any holders
of the Debentures parties to any such proceedings.

            Section 7.03. Application of Monies Collected by Trustee. Any monies
or other property collected by the Trustee pursuant to this Article VII, or any
monies or other property otherwise distributable in respect of the Company's
obligations under this Indenture, shall be applied in the order following, at
the date or dates fixed by the Trustee for the distribution of such monies, upon
presentation of the several

other remedy hereunder, unless such holder previously shall have given to the
Trustee written notice of an Event of Default and of the continuance thereof, as
hereinbefore provided, and unless also the holders of not less than 25% in

written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or proceeding in
its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the Trustee such
reasonable security or indemnity as it may require against the costs, expenses

to the Trustee pursuant to Section 7.07; it being understood and intended, and
being expressly covenanted by the taker and holder of every Debenture with every
other taker and holder and the Trustee, that no one or more holders of
Debentures shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue of or by
reference to any provision of this Indenture to affect, disturb or prejudice the
rights of any other holder of Debentures, or to obtain or seek to obtain
priority over or preference to any other such holder, or to enforce any right
under this Indenture, except in the manner herein provided and for the equal,
ratable and common benefit of all holders of Debentures (except as otherwise
provided herein). For the protection and enforcement of this Section 7.04, each
and every Debentureholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to such relief as
can be given either at law or in equity.

            Notwithstanding any other provision of this Indenture and any
provision of any Debenture, the right of any holder of any Debenture to
receive payment of the principal of (including any Redemption Price or
Repurchase Price pursuant to Article III) and accrued Interest on such
Debenture on or after the respective due dates expressed in such Debenture,
or to institute suit for the enforcement of any such payment on or after such
respective dates against the Company, shall not be impaired or affected
without the consent of such holder.

            Anything in this Indenture or the Debentures to the contrary
notwithstanding, the holder of any Debenture, without the consent of either
the Trustee or the holder of any other Debenture, in its own behalf and for
its own benefit, may enforce, and may institute and maintain any proceeding
suitable to enforce, its rights of conversion as provided herein.

            Section 7.05. Proceedings by Trustee. In case of an Event of
Default, the Trustee may, in its discretion, proceed to protect and enforce the
rights vested in it by this Indenture by such appropriate judicial proceedings
as are necessary to protect and enforce any of such rights, either by suit in
equity or by action at law or by proceeding in bankruptcy or otherwise, whether
for the specific enforcement of any covenant or agreement contained in this
Indenture or in aid of the exercise of any power granted in this Indenture, or
to enforce any other legal or equitable right vested in the Trustee by this
Indenture or by law.

            Section 7.06. Remedies Cumulative and Continuing. Except as provided
in Section 2.06, all powers and remedies given by this Article VII to the
Trustee or to the Debentureholders shall, to the extent permitted by law, be
deemed cumulative and not exclusive of any thereof or of any other powers and
remedies available to the Trustee or the holders of the Debentures, by judicial
proceedings or otherwise, to enforce the performance or observance of the
covenants and agreements contained in this Indenture, and no delay or omission
of the Trustee or of any holder of any of the Debentures to exercise any right
or power accruing upon any default or Event of Default occurring and continuing
as aforesaid shall impair any such right or power, or shall be construed to be a
waiver of any such default or any acquiescence therein, and, subject to the
provisions of Section 7.04, every power and remedy given by this Article VII or
by

                                       51
<PAGE>

law to the Trustee or to the Debentureholders may be exercised from time to
time, and as often as shall be deemed expedient, by the Trustee or by the
Debentureholders.

            Section 7.07. Direction of Proceedings and Waiver of Defaults by
Majority of Debentureholders. Upon provision of indemnity reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee, the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding determined in accordance with
Section 9.04 shall have the right to direct the time, method and place of
conducting any proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee or exercising
any trust or power conferred on the Trustee; provided that (a) such direction
shall not be in conflict with any rule of law or with this Indenture, (b) the
Trustee may take any other action which is not inconsistent with such direction
and (c) the Trustee may decline to take any action that would benefit some
Debentureholders to the detriment of other Debentureholders. The holders of a
majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding
determined in accordance with Section 9.04 may, on behalf of the holders of all
of the Debentures, waive any past default or Event of Default hereunder and its
consequences except (i) a default in the payment of Interest on, or the
principal of, the Debentures, (ii) a failure by the Company to convert any
Debentures into cash or a combination of cash and Common Stock, as the case may
be, or, as applicable, such other property into which such Debentures may become
convertible pursuant to this Indenture, (iii) a default in the payment of the
Redemption Price pursuant to Section 3.03, (iv) a default in the payment of the
Fundamental Change Repurchase Price pursuant to Section 3.04 or Company
Repurchase Price pursuant to Section 3.05 or (v) a default in respect of a
covenant or provision hereof which under Article XI cannot be modified or
amended without the consent of the holders of each or all Debentures then
outstanding or affected thereby. Upon any such waiver, the Company, the Trustee
and the holders of the Debentures shall be restored to their former positions
and rights hereunder; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other
default or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon. Whenever any
default or Event of Default hereunder shall have been waived as permitted by
this Section 7.07, said default or Event of Default shall for all purposes of
the Debentures and this Indenture be deemed to have been cured and to be not
continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default
or Event of Default or impair any right consequent thereon.

            Section 7.08. Notice of Defaults. The Trustee shall, within 90 days
after a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has knowledge of the occurrence of a
default, mail to all Debentureholders, as the names and addresses of such
holders appear upon the Debenture Register, notice of all defaults known to a
Responsible Officer, unless such defaults shall have been cured or waived before
the giving of such notice; provided that except in the case of default in the
payment of the principal of or Interest on any of the Debentures, the Trustee
shall be protected in withholding such notice if and so long as a trust
committee of directors and/or Responsible Officers of the Trustee in good faith
determines that the withholding of such notice is in the interests of the
Debentureholders. For the purpose of this Section 7.08, the term "default" means
any event which is, or after notice or lapse of time or both would become, an
Event of Default.

            Section 7.09. Undertaking to Pay Costs. All parties to this
Indenture agree, and each holder of any Debenture by its acceptance thereof
shall be deemed to have agreed, that any court may, in its discretion, require,
in any suit for the enforcement of any right or remedy under this Indenture, or
in any suit against the Trustee for any action taken or omitted by it as
Trustee, the filing by any party litigant in such suit of an undertaking to pay
the costs of such suit and that such court may in its discretion assess
reasonable costs, including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses, against any
party litigant in such suit, having due regard to the merits and good faith of
the claims or defenses made by such party litigant; provided that the provisions
of this Section 7.09 (to the extent permitted by law) shall not apply to any
suit instituted by the Trustee, to any suit instituted by any Debentureholder,
or group of Debentureholders, holding in the aggregate more than 10% in
principal amount of the Debentures at the time outstanding determined in
accordance with Section 9.04, or to any suit instituted by any Debentureholder
for the enforcement of the payment of the principal of or Interest on any
Debenture on or after the due date expressed in such Debenture or to any suit
for the enforcement of the right to convert any Debenture in accordance with the
provisions of Article XV.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                   The Trustee
                                   -----------

            Section 8.01. Duties and Responsibilities of Trustee. The Trustee,
prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the curing of all
Events of Default which may have occurred, undertakes to perform such duties and
only such duties as are specifically set forth in this Indenture. In case an
Event of Default has occurred (which has not been cured or waived), the Trustee
shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Indenture, and
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise, as a prudent person
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such person's
own affairs.

            No provision of this Indenture shall be construed to relieve the
Trustee from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent failure
to act or its own willful misconduct, except that:

            (a) prior to the occurrence of an Event of Default and after the
      curing or waiving of all Events of Default which may have occurred:

                (i) the duties and obligations of the Trustee shall be
           determined solely by the express provisions of this Indenture and the
           Trust Indenture Act, and the Trustee shall not be liable except for
           the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically
           set forth in this Indenture and no implied covenants or obligations
           shall be read into this Indenture and the Trust Indenture Act against
           the Trustee; and


                                       53
<PAGE>

                (ii) in the absence of bad faith on the part of the Trustee, the
           Trustee may conclusively rely as to the truth of the statements and
           the correctness of the opinions expressed therein, upon any
           certificates or opinions furnished to the Trustee and conforming to
           the requirements of this Indenture; but, in the case of any such
           certificates or opinions which by any provisions hereof are
           specifically required to be furnished to the Trustee, the Trustee
           shall be under a duty to examine the same to determine whether or not
           they conform to the requirements of this Indenture;

            (b) the Trustee shall not be liable for any error of judgment made
      in good faith by a Responsible Officer or Officers of the Trustee, unless
      the Trustee was negligent in ascertaining the pertinent facts;

            (c) the Trustee shall not be liable with respect to any action taken
      or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance with the written
      direction of the holders of not less than a majority in principal amount
      of the Debentures at the time outstanding determined as provided in
      Section 9.04 relating to the time, method and place of conducting any
      proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any
      trust or power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Indenture;

            (d) the Trustee shall not be liable in respect of any payment (as to
      the correctness of amount, entitlement to receive or any other matters
      relating to payment) or notice effected by the Company, any Guarantor or
      any Paying Agent or any records maintained by any co-registrar with
      respect to the Debentures; and

            (e) if any party fails to deliver a notice relating to an event the
      fact of which, pursuant to this Indenture, requires notice to be sent to
      the Trustee, the Trustee may conclusively rely on its failure to receive
      such notice as reason to act as if no such event occurred.

            The Trustee shall not be deemed to have knowledge or notice of any
default (as defined in Section 7.08) or Event of Default hereunder unless a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have received at the Corporate Trust
Office written notice of such default or Event of Default from the Company or
the holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures and
such notice refers to such default or Event of Default, the Debentures and the
Indenture.

            None of the provisions contained in this Indenture shall require
the Trustee to expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur personal
financial liability in the performance of any of its duties or in the
exercise of any of its rights or powers, if there is reasonable ground for
believing that the repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against such
risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it.


                                       54

            The Trustee shall cooperate with any Gaming Authority of any
jurisdiction in which the Company or any of its Subsidiaries conducts or
proposes to conduct gaming and shall produce any document or information as
any such Gaming Authority may request in writing; provided that the Trustee
has copies of any such document or knowledge of any such information as any
such Gaming Authority may request.

            Whether or not therein provided, every provision of this
Indenture relating to the conduct or affecting the liability of, or affording
protection to, the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of this Section
8.01.

      acting upon any resolution, certificate, statement, instrument, opinion,
      report, notice, request, consent, order, bond, debenture, note, coupon or
      other paper or document (whether in its original or facsimile form)
      believed by it in good faith to be genuine and to have been signed or
      presented by the proper party or parties;

            (b) any request, direction, order or demand of the Company or any
      Guarantor mentioned herein shall be sufficiently evidenced by an Officers'
      Certificate (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein
      specifically prescribed); and any resolution of the Board of Directors may
      be evidenced to the Trustee by a copy thereof certified by the Secretary
      or an Assistant Secretary of the Company;

            (c) the Trustee may consult with counsel of its own selection and
      any advice or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete authorization
      and protection in respect of any action taken or omitted by it hereunder
      in good faith and in accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

            (d) the Trustee shall be under no obligation to exercise any of the
      rights or powers vested in it by this Indenture at the request, order or
      direction of any of the Debentureholders pursuant to the provisions of
      this Indenture, unless such Debentureholders shall have offered to the
      Trustee reasonable security or indemnity satisfactory to it against the
      costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby;

            (e) the Trustee shall not be bound to make any investigation into
      the facts or matters stated in any resolution, certificate, statement,
      instrument, opinion, report, notice, request, direction, consent, order,
      bond, debenture or other paper or document, but the Trustee may make such
      further inquiry or investigation into such facts or matters as it may see
      fit, and, if the Trustee shall determine to make such further inquiry or
      investigation, it shall be entitled to examine the books, records and
      premises of the Company and the Guarantors, personally or by agent or
      attorney;

      perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or through agents or

      upon it by this Indenture;

            (h) the rights, privileges, protections, immunities and benefits
      given to the Trustee, including, without limitation, its right to be
      indemnified, are extended to, and shall be enforceable by, the Trustee in
      each of its capacities hereunder, and each agent, custodian and other
      Person employed to act hereunder;

            (i) the Trustee may request that the Company deliver an Officers'
      Certificate setting forth the names of individuals and/or titles of
      officers authorized at such time to take specified actions pursuant to
      this Indenture, which Officers' Certificate may be signed by any person
      authorized to sign an Officers' Certificate, including any person
      specified as so authorized in any such certificate previously delivered
      and not superseded; and

            (j) before the Trustee acts or refrains from acting, it may require
      an Officers' Certificate or an Opinion of Counsel or both. The Trustee

      faith in reliance on the Officers' Certificate or Opinion of Counsel.

            Section 8.03. No Responsibility for Recitals, Etc. The recitals
contained herein and in the Debentures (except in the Trustee's certificate of
authentication) shall be taken as the statements of the Company, and the Trustee
assumes no responsibility for the correctness of the same. The Trustee makes no
representations as to the validity or sufficiency of this Indenture or of the
Debentures. The Trustee shall not be accountable for the use or application by
the Company of any Debentures or the proceeds of any Debentures authenticated
and delivered by the Trustee in conformity with the provisions of this
Indenture.

            Section 8.04. Trustee, Paying Agents, Conversion Agents or Registrar
May Own Debentures. The Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Conversion Agent or the
Debenture Registrar, in its individual or any other capacity, may become the
owner or pledgee of Debentures with the same rights it would have if it were not
Trustee, Paying Agent, Conversion Agent or Debenture Registrar.

            Section 8.05. Monies to be Held in Trust. Subject to the provisions
of Section 13.03, all monies received by the Trustee shall, until used or

received by it hereunder except as may be agreed in writing from time to time by
the Company and the Trustee.

            Section 8.06. Compensation and Expenses of Trustee. The Company
covenants and agrees to pay to the Trustee from time to time, and the Trustee
shall be entitled to, such compensation for all services rendered by it
hereunder in any capacity (which shall not be limited by any provision of law in
regard to the compensation of a trustee of an express trust) as mutually agreed
to from time to time in writing between the Company and the Trustee, and the
Company will pay or reimburse the Trustee upon its request for all reasonable
expenses, disbursements and advances reasonably incurred or made by the Trustee
in accordance with any of the provisions of this Indenture (including the
reasonable compensation and the reasonable out-of-pocket expenses and
disbursements of its counsel and of all Persons not regularly in its employ)
except any such expense, disbursement or advance as may arise from its
negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith. The Company also covenants to
indemnify the Trustee and any predecessor Trustee (or any officer, director or
employee of the Trustee), in any capacity under this Indenture and its agents
for, and to hold them harmless against, any and all loss, liability, damage,
claim or expense including taxes (other than taxes based on the income of the
Trustee) incurred without negligence, willful misconduct or bad faith on the
part of the Trustee or such officers, directors, employees and agent, as the
case may be, and arising out of or in connection with the acceptance or
administration of this trust or in any other capacity hereunder, including the
costs and expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses) of
defending themselves against any claim (whether asserted by the Company, any
holder or any other Person) of liability in connection with the exercise or
performance of any of its powers or duties hereunder. The obligations of the
Company under this Section 8.06 to compensate or indemnify the Trustee and to
pay or reimburse the Trustee for expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees
and expenses), disbursements and advances shall be secured by a lien prior to
that of the Debentures upon all property and funds held or collected by the
Trustee as such, except funds held in trust for the benefit of the holders of
particular Debentures. The obligation of the Company under this Section shall
survive the resignation or removal of the Trustee and the satisfaction and
discharge or termination of this Indenture.

            When the Trustee and its agents incur expenses or render services
after an Event of Default specified in Section 7.01(i) or Section 7.01(j)
with respect to the Company occurs, the expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses) and the compensation for the services are
intended to constitute expenses of administration under any bankruptcy,
insolvency or similar laws.

provided in Section 8.01, whenever in the administration of the provisions of
this Indenture the Trustee shall deem it necessary or desirable that a matter be
proved or established prior to taking or omitting any action hereunder, such
matter (unless other evidence in respect thereof be herein specifically
prescribed) may, in the absence of bad faith or willful misconduct on the part
of the Trustee, be deemed to be conclusively proved and established by an
Officers' Certificate delivered to the Trustee.

            Section 8.08. Conflicting Interests of Trustee. If the Trustee has
or shall acquire a conflicting interest within the meaning of the Trust
Indenture Act, the Trustee shall either eliminate such interest or resign, to
the extent and in the manner provided by, and subject to the provisions of, the
Trust Indenture Act and this Indenture.

            Section 8.09. Eligibility of Trustee. There shall at all times be a
Trustee hereunder which shall be a Person that is eligible pursuant to the Trust
Indenture Act to act as such and has a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000 (or if such Person is a member of a bank holding company system, its
bank holding company shall have a combined capital and surplus of at least
$50,000,000). If such Person publishes reports of condition at least annually,
pursuant to law or to the requirements of any supervising or examining
authority, then for the purposes of this Section the combined capital and
surplus of such Person shall be deemed to be its combined capital and surplus as
set forth in its most recent report of condition so published. If at any time
the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the provisions of this
Section 8.09, it shall resign immediately in the manner and with the effect
hereinafter specified in this Article.

            Section 8.10. Resignation or Removal of Trustee. (a) The Trustee may
at any time resign by giving written notice of such resignation to the Company
and to the holders of Debentures. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the
Company shall promptly appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, in
duplicate, executed by order of the Board of Directors, one copy of which
instrument shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee and one copy to the
successor trustee. If no successor trustee shall have been so appointed and have
accepted appointment 60 days after the mailing of such notice of resignation to
the Debentureholders, the resigning Trustee may, upon 10 Business Days' notice
to the Company and the Debentureholders, appoint a successor identified in such
notice or may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of competent
jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee, or any Debentureholder
who has been a bona fide holder of a Debenture or Debentures for at least six
months may, subject to the provisions of Section 7.09, on behalf of himself and
all others similarly situated, petition any such court for the appointment of a
successor trustee. Such court may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it
may deem proper and prescribe, appoint a successor trustee.

            (b) In case at any time any of the following shall occur:

            (i) the Trustee shall fail to comply with Section 8.08 after written
      request therefor by the Company or by any Debentureholder who has been a
      bona fide holder of a Debenture or Debentures for at least six months; or

            (ii) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in accordance with the
      provisions of Section 8.09 and shall fail to resign after written request
      therefor by the Company or by any such Debentureholder; or


                                       58
<PAGE>

            (iii) the Trustee shall become incapable of acting, or shall be
      adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver of the Trustee or of its
      property shall be appointed, or any public officer shall take charge or
      control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for the purpose of
      rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation,

then, in any such case, the Company may remove the Trustee and appoint a
successor trustee by written instrument, in duplicate, executed by order of
the Board of Directors, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to
the Trustee so removed and one copy to the successor trustee, or, subject to
the provisions of Section 7.09, any Debentureholder who has been a bona fide
holder of a Debenture or Debentures for at least six months may, on behalf of
himself and all others similarly situated, petition any court of competent
jurisdiction for the removal of the Trustee and the appointment of a
successor trustee; provided that if no successor Trustee shall have been
appointed and have accepted appointment 60 days after either the Company or
the Debentureholders has removed the Trustee, or the Trustee resigns, the
Trustee so removed may petition, at the expense of the Company, any court of
competent jurisdiction for an appointment of a successor trustee.  Such court
may thereupon, after such notice, if any, as it may deem proper and
prescribe, remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee.

            (c) The holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures at the time outstanding may at any time remove the Trustee and
nominate a successor trustee which shall be deemed appointed as successor
trustee unless, within 10 days after notice to the Company of such nomination,
the Company objects thereto, in which case the Trustee so removed or any
Debentureholder, or if such Trustee so removed or any Debentureholder fails to
act, the Company, upon the terms and conditions and otherwise as in Section 8.10
provided, may petition any court of competent jurisdiction for an appointment of
a successor trustee.

            (d) Any resignation or removal of the Trustee and appointment of a
successor trustee pursuant to any of the provisions of this Section 8.10 shall
become effective upon acceptance of appointment by the successor trustee as
provided in Section 8.11.

            Section 8.11. Acceptance by Successor Trustee. Any successor trustee
appointed as provided in Section 8.10 shall execute, acknowledge and deliver to
the Company and to its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such
appointment hereunder, and thereupon the resignation or removal of the
predecessor trustee shall become effective and such successor trustee, without
any further act, deed or conveyance, shall become vested with all the rights,
powers, duties and obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as
if originally named as trustee herein; but, nevertheless, on the written request
of the Company or of the successor trustee, the trustee ceasing to act shall,
upon payment of any amount then due it pursuant to the provisions of Section
8.06, execute and deliver an instrument transferring to such successor trustee
all the rights and powers of the trustee so ceasing to act. Upon request of any
such successor trustee, the Company shall execute any and all instruments in
writing for more fully and certainly vesting in and confirming to such successor
trustee all such rights and powers. Any

                                       59
<PAGE>

trustee ceasing to act shall, nevertheless, retain a lien upon all property and
funds held or collected by such trustee as such, except for funds held in trust
for the benefit of holders of particular Debentures, to secure any amounts then
due it pursuant to the provisions of Section 8.06.

            No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
Section 8.11 unless, at the time of such acceptance, such successor trustee
shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 8.08 and be eligible under
the provisions of Section 8.09.

            Upon acceptance of appointment by a successor trustee as provided
in this Section 8.11, the Company (or the former trustee, at the written
direction of the Company) shall mail or cause to be mailed notice of the
succession of such trustee hereunder to the holders of Debentures at their
addresses as they shall appear on the Debenture Register.  If the Company
fails to mail such notice within 10 days after acceptance of appointment by
the successor trustee, the successor trustee shall cause such notice to be
mailed at the expense of the Company.

            Section 8.12. Succession by Merger. Any Person into which the
Trustee may be merged or converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any
Person resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Trustee shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to all or substantially all
of the corporate trust business of the Trustee (including any trust created by
this Indenture), shall be the successor to the Trustee hereunder without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, provided that in the case of any Person succeeding to all or
substantially all of the corporate trust business of the Trustee, such Person
shall be qualified under the provisions of Section 8.08 and eligible under the
provisions of Section 8.09.

            In case at the time such successor to the Trustee shall succeed
to the trusts created by this Indenture, any of the Debentures shall have
been authenticated but not delivered, any such successor to the Trustee may
adopt the certificate of authentication of any predecessor trustee, and
deliver such Debentures so authenticated; and in case at that time any of the
Debentures shall not have been authenticated, any successor to the Trustee
may authenticate such Debentures in the name of the successor trustee; and in
all such cases such certificates shall have the full force that is provided
in the Debentures or in this Indenture; provided that the right to adopt the
certificate of authentication of any predecessor Trustee or authenticate
Debentures in the name of any predecessor Trustee shall apply only to its
successor or successors by merger, conversion or consolidation.

            Section 8.13. Preferential Collection of Claims. If and when the
Trustee shall be or become a creditor of the Company (or any other obligor upon
the Debentures), the Trustee shall be subject to the provisions of the Trust
Indenture Act regarding the collection of the claims against the Company (or any
such other obligor).

                              The Debentureholders
                              --------------------

            Section 9.01. Action by Debentureholders. Whenever in this Indenture
it is provided that the holders of a specified percentage in aggregate principal
amount of the Debentures may take any action (including the making of any demand
or request, the giving of any notice, consent or waiver or the taking of any
other action), the fact that at the time of taking any such action, the holders
of such specified percentage have joined therein may be evidenced (a) by any
instrument or any number of instruments of similar tenor executed by
Debentureholders in person or by agent or proxy appointed in writing, or (b) by
the record of the holders of Debentures voting in favor thereof at any meeting
of Debentureholders duly called and held in accordance with the provisions of
Article X, or (c) by a combination of such instrument or instruments and any
such record of such a meeting of Debentureholders. Whenever the Company or the
Trustee solicits the taking of any action by the holders of the Debentures, the
Company or the Trustee may fix in advance of such solicitation, a date as the
record date for determining holders entitled to take such action. The record
date shall be not more than 15 days prior to the date of commencement of
solicitation of such action.

            Section 9.02. Proof of Execution by Debentureholders. Subject to the
provisions of Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 10.05, proof of the execution of any
instrument by a Debentureholder or its agent or proxy shall be sufficient if
made in accordance with such reasonable rules and regulations as may be
prescribed by the Trustee or in such manner as shall be satisfactory to the
Trustee. The holding of Debentures shall be proved by the Debenture Register or
by a certificate of the Debenture Registrar.

            The record of any Debentureholders' meeting shall be proved in
the manner provided in Section 10.06.

            Section 9.03. Who Are Deemed Absolute Owners. The Company, the
Guarantors, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Conversion Agent and any
Debenture Registrar may deem the Person in whose name such Debenture shall be
registered upon the Debenture Register to be, and may treat it as, the absolute
owner of such Debenture (whether or not such Debenture shall be overdue and
notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing thereon made by any
Person other than the Company or any Debenture Registrar) for the purpose of
receiving payment of or on account of the principal of and Interest on such
Debenture, for conversion of such Debenture and for all other purposes; and none
of the Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, any Conversion
Agent or any Debenture Registrar shall be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

            Section 9.04. Company-owned Debentures Disregarded. In determining
whether the holders of the requisite aggregate principal amount of Debentures
have concurred in any direction, consent, waiver or other action under this
Indenture, Debentures which are owned by the Company or any other obligor on the
Debentures or any Affiliate of the Company or any other obligor on the


                                       61
<PAGE>

Debentures shall be disregarded and deemed not to be outstanding for the purpose
of any such determination; provided that for the purposes of determining whether
the Trustee shall be protected in relying on any such direction, consent, waiver
or other action, only Debentures which a Responsible Officer knows are so owned
shall be so disregarded. Debentures so owned which have been pledged in good
faith may be regarded as outstanding for the purposes of this Section 9.04 if
the pledgee shall establish to the satisfaction of the Trustee the pledgee's
right to vote such Debentures and that the pledgee is not the Company, any other
obligor on the Debentures or any Affiliate of the Company or any such other
obligor. In the case of a dispute as to such right, any decision by the Trustee
taken upon the advice of counsel shall be full protection to the Trustee. Upon
request of the Trustee, the Company shall furnish to the Trustee promptly an
Officers' Certificate listing and identifying all Debentures, if any, known by
the Company to be owned or held by or for the account of any of the above
described Persons, and, subject to Section 8.01, the Trustee shall be entitled
to accept such Officers' Certificate as conclusive evidence of the facts therein
set forth and of the fact that all Debentures not listed therein are outstanding
for the purpose of any such determination.

            Section 9.05. Revocation of Consents, Future Holders Bound. At any
time prior to (but not after) the evidencing to the Trustee, as provided in
Section 9.01, of the taking of any action by the holders of the percentage in
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures specified in this Indenture in
connection with such action, any holder of a Debenture which is shown by the
evidence to be included in the Debentures the holders of which have consented to
such action may, by filing written notice with the Trustee at its Corporate
Trust Office and upon proof of holding as provided in Section 9.02, revoke such
action so far as concerns such Debenture. Except as aforesaid, any such action
taken by the holder of any Debenture shall be conclusive and binding upon such
holder and upon all future holders and owners of such Debenture and of any
Debentures issued in exchange or substitution therefor, irrespective of whether
any notation in regard thereto is made upon such Debenture or any Debenture
issued in exchange or substitution therefor.

            Any meeting of Debentureholders shall be valid without notice if

proxy or if notice is waived before or after the meeting by the holders of
all Debentures outstanding, and if the Company and the Trustee are either
present by duly authorized representatives or have, before or after the
meeting, waived notice.

            Section 10.03. Call of Meetings by Company or Debentureholders. In
case at any time the Company, pursuant to a resolution of its Board of
Directors, or the holders of at least 10% in aggregate principal amount of the

            Subject to the provisions of Section 9.04, at any meeting each
Debentureholder or proxyholder shall be entitled to one vote for each $1,000
principal amount of Debentures held or represented by him; provided that no
vote shall be cast or counted at any meeting in respect of any Debenture
challenged as not outstanding and ruled by the chairman of the meeting to be
not outstanding.  The chairman of the meeting shall have no right to vote
other than by virtue of Debentures held by him or instruments in writing as

on any vote by ballot taken thereat and affidavits by one or more persons having

any resolution. The record shall be signed and verified by the affidavits of the

this Article X shall be deemed or construed to authorize or permit, by reason of
any call of a meeting of Debentureholders or any rights expressly or impliedly

      all or any of the several remedies provided in this Indenture as herein
      set forth; provided that in respect of any such additional covenant such
      supplemental indenture may provide for a particular period of grace after
      default (which period may be shorter or longer than that allowed in the
      case of other defaults) or may provide for an immediate enforcement upon
      such default or may limit the remedies available to the Trustee upon such
      default;

            (f) to cure any ambiguity or correct or supplement any inconsistent
      or otherwise defective provision contained in this Indenture or make any

<PAGE>

      provision with respect to matters or questions arising under this
      Indenture which the Company may deem necessary or desirable and which
      shall not be inconsistent with provisions of this Indenture, provided that
      such modification or amendment does not, in the good faith opinion of the
      Board of Directors, adversely affect the interests of the holders of
      Debentures in any material respect;

            (g) to evidence the acceptance of appointment hereunder by a
      successor Trustee with respect to the Debentures;

      change or modification does not, in the good faith opinion of the Board of
      Directors, adversely affect the interests of the holders of Debentures in
      any material respect; and

            (j) to add or modify any other provisions with respect to matters or
      questions arising under this Indenture which the Company and the Trustee
      may deem necessary or desirable and which will not adversely affect the
      interests of the holders of Debentures.

            An amendment under this Section may not make any change that
adversely affects the rights under Article XVI or XVIII of any holder of
Senior Debt or Guarantor Senior Debt of a Guarantor then outstanding unless
the holders of such Senior Debt or Guarantor Senior Debt (or their
Representative) consent to such change.

            Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a copy of
the resolutions of the Board of Directors certified by its Secretary or
Assistant Secretary authorizing the execution of any supplemental indenture,
the Trustee is hereby authorized to join with the Company and the Guarantors
in the execution of any such supplemental indenture, to make any further
appropriate agreements and stipulations that may be therein contained and to
accept the conveyance, transfer and assignment of any property thereunder,
but the Trustee shall not be obligated to, but may in its discretion, enter
into any supplemental indenture that affects the Trustee's own rights, duties
or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise.

            Any supplemental indenture authorized by the provisions of this
Section 11.01 may be executed by the Company, the Guarantors and the Trustee
without the consent of the holders of any of the Debentures at the time
outstanding, notwithstanding any of the provisions of Section 11.02.

<PAGE>

            Notwithstanding any other provision of the Indenture or the
Debentures, the Registration Rights Agreement and the obligation to pay
Additional Amounts thereunder may be amended, modified or waived in
accordance with the provisions of the Registration Rights Agreement.

            Section 11.02. Supplemental Indenture with Consent of
Debentureholders. With the consent (evidenced as provided in Article IX) of the
holders of at least a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Debentures
at the time outstanding, the Company and the Guarantors, when authorized by the
resolutions of the Board of Directors, and the Trustee may, from time to time
and at any time, enter into an indenture or indentures supplemental hereto for
the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating
any of the provisions of this Indenture or any supplemental indenture or of
modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Debentures; provided
that no such supplemental indenture shall (i) extend the Stated Maturity of any
Debenture, or reduce the rate or extend the time for payment of Interest
thereon, or reduce the principal amount thereof, or reduce any amount payable on
redemption or repurchase thereof, or impair the right of any Debentureholder to
institute suit for the payment thereof, or make the principal thereof or
Interest thereon payable in any coin or currency other than that provided in the
Debentures, or affect the obligation of the Company to redeem any Debenture on a
Redemption Date in a manner adverse to the holders of Debentures, or affect the
obligation of the Company to repurchase any Debenture upon the happening of a
Fundamental Change in a manner adverse to the holders of Debentures, or affect
the obligation of the Company to repurchase any Debenture on a Company
Repurchase Date in a manner adverse to the holders of Debentures, or impair the
right to convert the Debentures subject to the terms set forth herein, including
Section 15.06, or reduce the number of shares of Common Stock, the amount of
cash or the amount of other property receivable upon conversion, in each case,
without the consent of the holder of each Debenture so affected, or modify any
of the provisions of this Section 11.02 or Section 7.07, except to increase any
such percentage of aggregate principal amount of Debentures necessary for the
purposes specified therein or to provide that certain other provisions of this
Indenture cannot be modified or waived without the consent of the holder of each
Debenture so affected, or change any obligation of the Company to maintain an
office or agency in the places and for the purposes set forth in Section 5.02,
or reduce the quorum or voting requirements set forth in Article X or (ii)
reduce the aforesaid percentage of Debentures, the holders of which are required
to consent to any such supplemental indenture, without the consent of the
holders of all Debentures then outstanding.

            An amendment under this Section may not make any change that
adversely affects the rights under Article XVI or XVIII of any holder of Senior
Debt or Guarantor Senior Debt of a Guarantor then outstanding unless the holders
of such Senior Debt or Guarantor Senior Debt (or their Representative) consent
to such change.

            Upon the written request of the Company, accompanied by a copy of
the resolutions of the Board of Directors certified by its Secretary or
Assistant Secretary authorizing the execution of any such supplemental
indenture, and upon the filing with

                                       67
<PAGE>

the Trustee of evidence of the consent of Debentureholders as aforesaid, the
Trustee shall join with the Company and the Guarantors in the execution of such
supplemental indenture unless such supplemental indenture affects the Trustee's
own rights, duties or immunities under this Indenture or otherwise, in which
case the Trustee may in its discretion, but shall not be obligated to, enter
into such supplemental indenture.

            It shall not be necessary for the consent of the Debentureholders
under this Section 11.02 to approve the particular form of any proposed
supplemental indenture, but it shall be sufficient if such consent shall
approve the substance thereof.

            Section 11.03. Effect of Supplemental Indenture. Any supplemental
indenture executed pursuant to the provisions of this Article XI shall comply
with the Trust Indenture Act, as then in effect, provided that this Section
11.03 shall not require such supplemental indenture or the Trustee to be
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act prior to the time such qualification is
in fact required under the terms of the Trust Indenture Act or the Indenture has
been qualified under the Trust Indenture Act, nor shall it constitute any
admission or acknowledgment by any party to such supplemental indenture that any
such qualification is required prior to the time such qualification is in fact
required under the terms of the Trust Indenture Act or the Indenture has been
qualified under the Trust Indenture Act. Upon the execution of any supplemental
indenture pursuant to the provisions of this Article XI, this Indenture shall be
and be deemed to be modified and amended in accordance therewith and the
respective rights, limitation of rights, obligations, duties and immunities
under this Indenture of the Trustee, the Company, the Guarantors and the holders
of Debentures shall thereafter be determined, exercised and enforced hereunder,
subject in all respects to such modifications and amendments and all the terms
and conditions of any such supplemental indenture shall be and be deemed to be
part of the terms and conditions of this Indenture for any and all purposes.

            Section 11.04. Notation on Debentures. Debentures authenticated and
delivered after the execution of any supplemental indenture pursuant to the
provisions of this Article XI may bear a notation in form approved by the
Trustee as to any matter provided for in such supplemental indenture. If the
Company or the Trustee shall so determine, new Debentures so modified as to
conform, in the opinion of the Trustee and the Board of Directors, to any
modification of this Indenture contained in any such supplemental indenture may,
at the Company's expense, be prepared and executed by the Company, authenticated
by the Trustee and delivered in exchange for the Debentures then outstanding,
upon surrender of such Debentures then outstanding.

            Section 11.05. Evidence of Compliance of Supplemental Indenture to
be Furnished to Trustee. Prior to entering into any supplemental indenture, the
Trustee shall be provided with an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of
Counsel as conclusive evidence that any supplemental indenture executed pursuant
hereto complies with the requirements of this Article XI and is otherwise
authorized or permitted by this Indenture.

                Consolidation, Merger, Sale, Conveyance and Lease
                -------------------------------------------------

            Section 12.01. Consolidation on Certain Terms. Subject to the
provisions of Section 12.02, neither the Company nor any Guarantor shall
consolidate with or merge with or into any other Person or Persons (whether or
not affiliated with the Company or such Guarantor), nor shall the Company or any
Guarantor or their successor or successors be a party or parties to successive
consolidations or mergers, nor shall the Company or any Guarantor sell, convey,
transfer or lease their respective property and assets substantially as an
entirety, to any other Person (whether or not affiliated with such Person),
unless: (i) the Company or Guarantor, as the case may be, is the surviving
Person, or the resulting, surviving or transferee Person, if other than the
Company or such Guarantor, is organized and existing under the laws of the
United States of America, any state thereof or the District of Columbia; (ii)
upon any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease, (a)
the due and punctual payment of the principal of and Interest on all of the
Debentures, according to their tenor and the due and punctual performance and
observance of all of the covenants and conditions of this Indenture and the
Debentures to be performed by the Company or such Guarantor, shall be expressly
assumed, by supplemental indenture satisfactory in form to the Trustee, executed
and delivered to the Trustee by the Person (if other than the Company or such
Guarantor) formed by such consolidation, or into which the Company or such
Guarantor shall have been merged, or by the Person that shall have acquired or
leased such property, and, in the case of such transaction involving the
Company, such supplemental indenture shall provide for the applicable conversion
rights set forth in Section 15.06 or, if applicable, Section 15.12, and (b) the
due and punctual performance and observance of all of the obligations and
conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement to be performed by the Company
or such Guarantor, shall be expressly assumed by novation satisfactory in form
to the Trustee, executed and delivered to the Trustee by the Person (if other
than the Company or such Guarantor) formed by such consolidation, or into which
the Company or such Guarantor shall have been merged, or by the Person that
shall have acquired or leased such property; and (iii) immediately after giving
effect to the transaction described above, no default or Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing.

            Section 12.02. Successor to be Substituted. In case of any such
consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or lease and upon the
assumption by the successor Person (a) by supplemental indenture, executed and
delivered to the Trustee and satisfactory in form to the Trustee, of the due and
punctual payment of the principal of and Interest on all of the Debentures and
the due and punctual performance and observance of all of the covenants and
conditions of this Indenture to be performed or satisfied by the Company or
Guarantor, as the case may be, and (b) by amendment and novation of the
Registration Rights Agreement, executed and delivered to the Trustee in a form
satisfactory to the Trustee, of the due and punctual performance and observance
of all of the obligations and conditions of the Registration Rights Agreement to
be performed by the Company or such Guarantor, such successor Person shall
succeed to and be substituted for the Company or such Guarantor, in each case,
with the same effect

                                       69
<PAGE>

as if it had been named therein as the party of the first part. Such successor
Person thereupon may, in the case of a successor to the Company, cause to be
signed, and may issue either in its own name or in the name of Scientific Games
Corporation any or all of the Debentures issuable hereunder that theretofore
shall not have been signed by the Company and delivered to the Trustee; and,
upon the order of such successor Person instead of the Company and subject to
all the terms, conditions and limitations in this Indenture prescribed, the
Trustee shall authenticate and shall deliver, or cause to be authenticated and
delivered, any Debentures that previously shall have been signed and delivered
by the officers of the Company to the Trustee for authentication, and any
Debentures that such successor Person thereafter shall cause to be signed and
delivered to the Trustee for that purpose. All the Debentures so issued shall in
all respects have the same legal rank and benefit under this Indenture as the
Debentures theretofore or thereafter issued in accordance with the terms of this
Indenture as though all of such Debentures had been issued at the date of the
execution hereof. In the event of any such consolidation, merger, sale,
conveyance, transfer or lease, the Person named as the "Company" in the first
paragraph of this Indenture or any successor that shall thereafter have become
such in the manner prescribed in this Article XII shall be released from its
liabilities as obligor and maker of the Debentures and from its obligations
under this Indenture and the Registration Rights Agreement.

            In case of any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance,
transfer or lease, such changes in phraseology and form (but not in substance)
may be made in the Debentures thereafter to be issued as may be appropriate.

            Section 12.03. Opinion of Counsel to be Given Trustee. The Trustee
shall receive an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as conclusive
evidence that any such consolidation, merger, sale, conveyance, transfer or
lease and any such assumption complies with the provisions of this Article XII.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                     Satisfaction and Discharge of Indenture
                     ---------------------------------------

            Section 13.01. Discharge of Indenture. When (a) the Company shall
deliver to the Trustee for cancellation all Debentures theretofore authenticated
(other than any Debentures that have been destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu
of or in substitution for which other Debentures shall have been authenticated
and delivered) and not theretofore canceled, or (b) all the Debentures not
theretofore canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancellation shall have
become due and payable and the Company shall deposit (and such deposit is not
prohibited by Article XVI or XVIII) with the Trustee or with one or more Paying
Agents (or, if the Company is acting as its own Paying Agent, set aside,
segregate and hold in trust as provided in Section 5.04), in trust, funds
sufficient to pay all amounts due and owing on Debentures (other than any
Debentures that shall have been mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen and in lieu
of or in substitution for which other Debentures shall have been authenticated
and delivered) not theretofore

                                       70
<PAGE>

canceled or delivered to the Trustee for cancelation, and if in either case the
Company shall also pay or cause to be paid all other sums payable hereunder by
the Company, then this Indenture shall cease to be of further effect (except as
to (i) remaining rights of registration of transfer, substitution and exchange
and conversion of Debentures, (ii) rights hereunder of Debentureholders to
receive payments of principal of and Interest on the Debentures and the other
rights, duties and obligations of Debentureholders, as beneficiaries hereof with
respect to the amounts, if any, so deposited with the Trustee and (iii) the
rights, obligations and immunities of the Trustee hereunder, including those
pursuant to Section 8.06), and the Trustee, on written demand of the Company
accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and an Opinion of Counsel as required by
Section 19.05 and at the cost and expense of the Company, shall execute proper
instruments acknowledging satisfaction of and discharging this Indenture; the
Company, however, hereby agrees to reimburse the Trustee for any costs or
expenses thereafter reasonably and properly incurred by the Trustee and to
compensate the Trustee for any services thereafter reasonably and properly
rendered by the Trustee in connection with this Indenture or the Debentures.
Amounts so held in trust are not subject to Article XVI or XVIII.

            Section 13.02. Paying Agent to Repay Monies Held. Upon the
satisfaction and discharge of this Indenture, all monies then held by any Paying
Agent of the Debentures (other than the Trustee) shall, upon written request of
the Company, be repaid to it or paid to the Trustee, and thereupon such Paying
Agent shall be released from all further liability with respect to such monies.

            Section 13.03. Return of Unclaimed Monies. Subject to the
requirements of applicable law, any monies deposited with or paid to the Trustee
for payment of the principal of or Interest on Debentures and not applied but
remaining unclaimed by the holders of Debentures for two years after the date
upon which the principal of or Interest on such Debentures, as the case may be,
shall have become due and payable, shall be repaid to the Company by the Trustee
on demand and all liability of the Trustee shall thereupon cease with respect to
such monies; and the holder of any of the Debentures shall thereafter look only
to the Company for any payment that such holder may be entitled to collect
unless an applicable abandoned property law designates another Person.

                                  ARTICLE XIV

         Immunity of Incorporators, Stockholders, Officers and Directors
         ---------------------------------------------------------------

            Section 14.01. Indenture and Debentures Solely Corporate
Obligations. No recourse for the payment of the principal of or Interest on any
Debenture, or for any claim based thereon or otherwise in respect thereof, and
no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the Company
in this Indenture or in any supplemental indenture or in any Debenture, or
because of the creation of any Indebtedness represented thereby, shall be had
against any incorporator,

                                       71
<PAGE>

stockholder, employee, agent, officer, director or subsidiary, as such, past,
present or future, of the Company or of any successor Person, either directly or
through the Company or any successor Person, whether by virtue of any
constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any assessment or
penalty or otherwise; it being expressly understood that all such liability is
hereby expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as a consideration
for, the execution of this Indenture and the issue of the Debentures.

                                   ARTICLE XV

                            Conversion of Debentures
                            ------------------------

            Section 15.01. Right to Convert. (a) Subject to and upon compliance
with the provisions of this Indenture, prior to Stated Maturity, the holder of
any Debenture shall have the right, at such holder's option, to convert the
principal amount of the Debenture, or any portion of such principal amount which
is an integral multiple of $1,000, into cash and fully paid and non-assessable
shares (if any) of Common Stock (as such shares shall then be constituted) at
the Conversion Rate in effect at such time, subject to Section 15.01(d), by
surrender of the Debenture so to be converted in whole or in part, together with
any required funds, under the circumstances described in this Section 15.01 and
in the manner provided in Section 15.02. The Debentures shall be convertible
only during the following periods upon the occurrence of one of the following
events:

            (i) (A) during any calendar quarter (and only during such calendar
      quarter) commencing after December 31, 2004 and before December 31, 2019
      if the Last Reported Sale Price for the Common Stock for at least 20
      Trading Days during the period of 30 consecutive Trading Days ending on
      the last Trading Day of the preceding calendar quarter is greater than or
      equal to 120% of the Conversion Price on such last Trading Day and (B) at
      any time on or after December 31, 2019 if the Last Reported Sale Price for
      the Common Stock on any date on or after December 31, 2019 is greater than
      or equal to 120% of the Conversion Price;

            (ii) in the event that the Company calls any or all of the
      Debentures for redemption (other than pursuant to Article IV) at any time
      prior to the close of business on the second Business Day immediately
      preceding the Redemption Date (unless the Company fails to pay the
      Redemption Price); provided that only those Debentures that are called for
      redemption may be converted following such an event; or

            (iii) as provided in Section (b) of this Section 15.01.

            The Company or its designated agent shall determine on a daily
basis during the time period specified in Section 15.01(a)(i) whether the
Debentures shall be

                                       72
<PAGE>

convertible as a result of the occurrence of an event specified in clause (i)
above and, if the Debentures shall be so convertible, the Company shall promptly
deliver to the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company)
written notice thereof. Whenever the Debentures shall become convertible
pursuant to this Section 15.01, the Company or, at the Company's request, the
Trustee in the name and at the expense of the Company, shall notify the holders
of the event triggering such convertibility in the manner provided in Section
19.03, and the Company shall also publicly announce such information by
publication on the Company's website and through such other public medium as it
may use at such time. Any notice so given shall be conclusively presumed to have
been duly given, whether or not the holder receives such notice.

            (b) In addition, if:

            (i) (A) the Company distributes to all holders of Common Stock
      rights or warrants entitling them to subscribe for or purchase (for a
      period expiring within 45 days of the date of the distribution) shares of
      Common Stock at less than the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock
      on the Trading Day immediately preceding the declaration date of the
      distribution, or (B) the Company distributes to all holders of Common
      Stock assets, debt securities or rights to purchase securities of the
      Company, which distribution has a per share value as determined by the
      Board of Directors and set forth in a board resolution exceeding 10% of
      the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the Trading Day
      immediately preceding the declaration date for such distribution, then, in
      either case, the Debentures may be surrendered for conversion at any time
      on and after the date that the Company gives notice to the holders of such
      distribution, which shall be not less than 20 Business Days prior to the
      Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution, until the earlier of the close of
      business on the Business Day immediately preceding, but not including, the
      Ex-Dividend Date or the date the Company publicly announces that such
      distribution will not take place; provided that no holder may exercise
      this right to convert if the holder will otherwise participate in such
      distribution without conversion as a result of holding Debentures; and

            (ii) the Company is a party to a consolidation, merger, binding
      share exchange or transfer of all or substantially all of its assets, in
      each case pursuant to which the Common Stock would be converted into (A)
      cash or property other than securities or (B) cash, securities or other
      property, provided that, in the case of clause (B), such transaction also
      constitutes a Fundamental Change (or would have constituted a Fundamental
      Change but for the Trading Price Exception), then the Debentures may be
      surrendered for conversion at any time from and after the date which is 15
      days prior to the anticipated effective date of the transaction until and
      including the date which is 15 days after the actual effective date (the
      "Effective Date") of the transaction or, in the case of clause (B), until
      and including the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental
      Change Repurchase Date in respect of such transaction. The Board of
      Directors shall determine the anticipated Effective Date of the
      transaction, and such

                                       73
<PAGE>

      determination shall be conclusive and binding on the holders and shall be
      publicly announced by the Company by publication on its website and
      through such other public medium as it may use at that time not later than
      two Business Days prior to such 15th day.

            (c) A Debenture in respect of which a holder is electing to exercise
its option to require repurchase upon a Fundamental Change pursuant to Section
3.04 or repurchase pursuant to Section 3.05 may be converted only if such holder
withdraws its election in accordance with Section 3.06(d). A holder of
Debentures is not entitled to any rights of a holder of Common Stock until such
holder has converted his Debentures into Common Stock, and only to the extent
such Debentures are deemed to have been converted to Common Stock under this
Article XV.

            (d) Subject to Section 15.12, if a holder elects to convert a
Debenture in connection with a transaction that occurs on or prior to June 1,
2010 that is a Fundamental Change as described under clause (i) or (ii) of the
definition thereof (or that would have been a Fundamental Change under such
clause (i) or (ii) but for the existence of the Trading Price Exception) and
pursuant to which 10% or more of the consideration for the Common Stock (other
than cash payments for fractional shares and cash payments made in respect of
dissenters' appraisal rights) in such transaction consists of cash or securities
(or other property) that are not traded or scheduled to be traded immediately
following such transaction on a U.S. national securities exchange or The NASDAQ
National Market (a "Non-Stock Change of Control"), the Company shall deliver to
such holder upon conversion, in addition to the cash or combination of cash and
shares of Common Stock, as the case may be, equal to the Conversion Value, an
additional number of shares of Common Stock (the "Additional Common Stock") as
set forth below.

            The number of shares of Additional Common Stock will be
determined by reference to the table below, based on the Effective Date of
such Non-Stock Change of Control and the price paid per share for the Common
Stock in the Non-Stock Change of Control (the "Stock Price").  If holders of
Common Stock receive only cash in the Non-Stock Change of Control, the Stock
Price shall be the cash amount paid per share.  Otherwise, the Stock Price
shall be the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock on
the five Trading Days prior to but not including the Effective Date of such
Non-Stock Change of Control.

            The Stock Prices set forth in the table and in clauses (ii) and
(iii) below will be adjusted as of any date on which the Conversion Rate is
adjusted pursuant to Section 15.05.  On such date, the Stock Prices shall be
adjusted by multiplying the Stock Prices applicable immediately prior to such
adjustment by a fraction, the numerator of which shall be the Conversion Rate
immediately prior to the adjustment giving rise to the Stock Price
adjustment, and the denominator of which shall be the Conversion Rate as so
adjusted.

The number of shares of Additional Common Stock shall be correspondingly
adjusted in the same manner as the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section
15.05.

</TABLE>

            If the Stock Price and Effective Date are not set forth in the
table above and the Stock Price is:

            (i) between two Stock Prices on the table or the Effective Date is
      between two dates on the table, the number of shares of Additional Common
      Stock will be determined by straight-line interpolation between the number
      of shares of Additional Common Stock set forth for the higher and lower
      Stock Price and the two dates, as applicable, based on a 360-day year;

            (ii) in excess of $64.00 per share (subject to adjustment as
      provided above), no shares of Additional Common Stock will be issued upon
      conversion; or

            (iii) less than $23.28 per share (subject to adjustment as provided
      above), no shares of Additional Common Stock will be issued upon
      conversion.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the total number
of shares of Common Stock issuable upon conversion exceed 42.9553 per $1,000
principal amount of Debentures, subject to adjustment in the same manner as
the Conversion Rate as set forth in Section 15.05.

            Section 15.02. Exercise of Conversion Right; Issuance of Common
Stock on Conversion; No Adjustment for Interest or Dividends. In order to
exercise the conversion right with respect to any Debenture in certificated
form, the Company must receive at the office or agency of the Conversion Agent
such Debenture with the original or facsimile of the form entitled "Form of
Conversion Notice" on the reverse thereof, which is irrevocable, duly completed
and manually signed, together with such Debentures duly endorsed for transfer,
accompanied by the funds, if any, required by this Section 15.02. Such notice
shall also state the name or names (with address or addresses) in which the
certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock which shall be issuable
on such conversion, if any, shall be issued, and to whom the cash payable on
such conversion shall be delivered, and shall be accompanied by appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents if required by the Company, the Conversion
Agent or the Trustee, and any transfer or similar taxes, if required pursuant to
Section 15.07.


                                       75

            In order to exercise the conversion right with respect to any
interest in a Global Debenture, the beneficial holder must complete, or cause
to be completed, the appropriate instruction form for conversion pursuant to
the Depositary's book-entry conversion program, deliver, or cause to be
delivered, by book-entry delivery an interest in such Global Debenture,
furnish appropriate endorsements and transfer documents if required by the
Company or the Trustee or Conversion Agent, and pay the funds, if any,
required by this Section 15.02 and any transfer taxes if required pursuant to
Section 15.07.

            The Company will deliver the Settlement Amount to converting
holders on the Business Day immediately following the last day of the Cash
Settlement Averaging Period.  Subject to compliance with any restrictions on
transfer if shares issuable on conversion are to be issued in a name other
than that of the holder of the converted Debenture (as if such transfer were
a transfer of the Debenture or Debentures (or portion thereof) so converted),
the Company shall issue and shall deliver through the Conversion Agent to
such holder at the office or agency maintained by the Company for such
purpose pursuant to Section 5.02, a check or cash in respect of the lesser of
the aggregate principal amount of Debentures being converted and the
Conversion Value in respect of such Debentures, calculated by the Company as
provided in Section 15.03, and a certificate or certificates for the number
of full shares of Common Stock, if any, issuable upon the conversion of such
Debenture or Debentures (or portion thereof) so converted as determined by
the Company as provided in Section 15.03, or if the Common Stock is eligible
for transfer through the Depositary, the Company shall make a book-entry
transfer of such number of shares of Common Stock through the Depositary, and
a check or cash in respect of any fractional interest in respect of any share
of Common Stock arising upon such conversion.  In case any Debenture of a
denomination greater than $1,000 shall be surrendered for partial conversion,
and subject to Section 2.03, the Company shall execute and the Trustee shall
authenticate and deliver to the holder of the Debenture so surrendered,
without charge to him, a new Debenture or Debentures in authorized
denominations in an aggregate principal amount equal to the unconverted
portion of the surrendered Debenture.

            Each conversion shall be deemed to have been effected as to any
such Debenture (or portion thereof) on the date on which the requirements set
forth above in this Section 15.02 have been satisfied as to such Debenture
(or portion thereof) (such date, the "Conversion Date"), and the Person in
whose name any certificate or certificates for shares of Common Stock shall
be issuable upon such conversion shall be deemed to have become on said date
the holder of record of the shares represented thereby; provided that any
such surrender on any date when the stock transfer books of the Company shall
be closed shall constitute the Person in whose name the certificates are to
be issued as the record holder thereof for all purposes on the next
succeeding day on which such stock transfer books are open, but such
conversion shall be at the Conversion Rate in effect on the date upon which
such Debenture shall be surrendered.

            Any Debenture or portion thereof surrendered for conversion
during the period from the close of business on any Regular Record Date to
the opening of business

                                       76
<PAGE>

on the immediately following Interest Payment Date shall be accompanied by
payment, in immediately available funds or other funds acceptable to the
Company, of an amount equal to the Interest otherwise payable on such Interest
Payment Date on the principal amount being converted; provided that no such
payment need be made (1) if the Company has specified a Redemption Date that is
after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding Interest
Payment Date, (2) if the Company has specified a Fundamental Change Repurchase
Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding
Interest Payment Date or (3) to the extent of any overdue Interest, if any
overdue Interest exists at the time of conversion with respect to such
Debenture. Except as provided in this Section 15.02, no payment or other
adjustment shall be made for Interest accrued on any Debenture converted or for
dividends on any shares issued upon the conversion of such Debenture as provided
in this Article XV.

            Upon the conversion of an interest in a Global Debenture, the
Trustee (or other Conversion Agent appointed by the Company), or the
Custodian at the direction of the Trustee (or other Conversion Agent
appointed by the Company), shall make a notation on such Global Debenture as
to the reduction in the principal amount represented thereby.  The Company
shall notify the Trustee in writing of any conversions of Debentures effected
through any Conversion Agent other than the Trustee.

            Upon the conversion of a Debenture, that portion of the accrued
but unpaid Interest with respect to the converted Debenture shall not be
cancelled, extinguished or forfeited, but rather shall be deemed to be paid
in full to the holder thereof through delivery of cash or a combination of
cash and shares of Common Stock (or other property pursuant to the terms of
this Indenture), as the case may be (together with the cash payment, if any,
in lieu of fractional shares and Additional Common Stock, if applicable) in
exchange for the Debenture being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof;
and the cash or combination of cash and shares of Common Stock (or other
property pursuant to the terms of this Indenture), as the case may be
(together with any such cash payment in lieu of fractional shares and
Additional Common Stock) shall be treated as issued, to the extent thereof,
first in exchange for and in satisfaction of the Company's obligation to pay
the principal amount of the converted Debenture and the accrued but unpaid
Interest, and the balance, if any, of such fair market value of such Common
Stock (and any such cash payment or, as applicable, other property) shall be
treated as issued in exchange for and in satisfaction of the right to convert
the Debenture being converted pursuant to the provisions hereof.

            Notwithstanding the preceding paragraph, if Debentures are
surrendered for conversion during the period from the close of business on
any Regular Record Date to the opening of business on the corresponding
Interest Payment Date, holders of such Debentures at the close of business on
the Regular Record Date will receive the Interest payable on such Debentures
on such corresponding Interest Payment Date notwithstanding the conversion.

            Section 15.03. Payment Upon Conversion; Cash Payments in Lieu of
Fractional Shares. (a) Upon conversion of Debentures pursuant to Section 15.02,
the

                                       77
<PAGE>

Company will deliver to holders in respect of each $1,000 principal amount of
Debentures being converted a settlement amount (the "Settlement Amount")
consisting of:

            (i) cash equal to the lesser of (A) $1,000 and (B) the Conversion
      Value, and

            (ii) to the extent the Conversion Value exceeds $1,000, a number of
      shares equal to the sum of, for each day of the Cash Settlement Averaging
      Period, (A) 5% of the difference between the Conversion Value and $1,000,
      divided by (B) the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on such
      day.

            (b) No fractional shares of Common Stock or scrip certificates
representing fractional shares shall be issued upon conversion of Debentures. If
more than one Debenture shall be surrendered for conversion at one time by the
same holder, the number of full shares that shall be issuable upon conversion,
if any, shall be computed on the basis of the aggregate principal amount of the
Debentures so surrendered. If any fractional share of Common Stock would be
issuable upon the conversion of any Debenture or Debentures, the Company shall
make an adjustment and payment therefor in cash to the holder of Debentures at
the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock on the last Trading Day
immediately preceding the applicable Conversion Date.

            Section 15.04. Conversion Rate. Each $1,000 principal amount of the
Debentures shall be convertible into the number of shares of Common Stock
specified in the form of Debenture (herein called the "Conversion Rate")
attached as Exhibit A hereto (initially 34.3643 shares), to be settled in
accordance with, and subject to adjustment as provided in, this Article XV.

            Section 15.05. Adjustment of Conversion Rate. The Conversion Rate
shall be adjusted from time to time by the Company as follows:

            (a) If the Company issues shares of Common Stock as a dividend or
distribution on shares of the Common Stock, or effects a share split or share
combination, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following
formula:

                                               OS(1)
                               CR(1) = CR(o) X -----
                                               OS(o)


   where,

      CR(o) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such event

      CR(1) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such event

      OS(o) =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
               prior to such event


                                       78
<PAGE>

      OS(1) =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
               after such event

      Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the opening of
      business on the Business Day following the date fixed for such
      determination.  The Company will not pay any dividend or make any
      distribution on shares of Common Stock held in treasury by the
      Company.  If any dividend or distribution of the type described in this
      Section 15.05(a) is declared but not so paid or made, the Conversion
      Rate shall again be adjusted to the Conversion Rate that would then be
      in effect if such dividend or distribution had not been declared.

            (b) If the Company issues to all or substantially all holders of its
Common Stock any rights or warrants entitling them for a period of not more than
60 days to subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock, or securities
convertible into shares of Common Stock, at a price per share or a conversion
price per share less than the Last Reported Sale Price of shares of Common Stock
on the Business Day immediately preceding the date of announcement of such
issuance, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula
(provided that the Conversion Rate will be readjusted to the extent that such
rights or warrants are not exercised prior to their expiration):

                                              OS(o)+X
                              CR(1) = CR(o) X -------
                                              OS(o)+Y

      where,

      CR(o) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such event

      CR(1) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such event

      OS(o) =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
               prior to such event

      X     =  the total number of shares of Common Stock issuable pursuant
               to such rights

      Y     =  the number of shares of Common Stock equal to the aggregate
               price payable to exercise such rights divided by the average
               of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock over the
               10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Business Day
               immediately preceding the record date for the issuance of such
               rights

      Such adjustment shall be successively made whenever any such rights or
      warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the
      opening of business on the Business Day following the date fixed for
      such determination.  The Company shall not issue any such rights,
      options or warrants in respect of shares of Common Stock held in
      treasury by the Company.  To the extent that shares of

                                       79
<PAGE>

      Common Stock are not delivered after the expiration of such rights or
      warrants, the Conversion Rate shall be readjusted to the Conversion Rate
      that would then be in effect had the adjustments made upon the issuance of
      such rights or warrants been made on the basis of delivery of only the
      number of shares of Common Stock actually delivered. If such rights or
      warrants are not so issued, the Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to
      be the Conversion Rate that would then be in effect if such date fixed for
      the determination of stockholders entitled to receive such rights or
      warrants had not been fixed.

      In determining whether any rights or warrants entitle the holders to
      subscribe for or purchase shares of Common Stock at less than such Last
      Reported Sale Price, and in determining the aggregate offering price of
      such shares of Common Stock, there shall be taken into account any
      consideration received by the Company for such rights or warrants and
      any amount payable on exercise or conversion thereof, the value of such
      consideration, if other than cash, to be determined by the Board of
      Directors.

            (c) If the Company distributes shares of its Capital Stock,
evidences of its indebtedness or other assets or property of the Company to all
or substantially all holders of the Common Stock, excluding:

            (i) dividends, distributions and rights or warrants referred to in
      clause (a) or (b) above; and

            (ii) dividends or distributions paid exclusively in cash;

   then the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the following formula:

                                                SP(o)
                              CR(1) = CR(o) X ---------
                                              SP(o)-FMV

   where,

      CR(o) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such
               distribution

      CR(1) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such
               distribution

      SP(o) =  the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common
               Stock over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period ending on the
               Trading Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date for
               such distribution

      FMV   =  the fair market value (as determined by the Board of
               Directors) of the shares of Capital Stock, evidences of
               indebtedness, assets or property distributed with respect to
               each outstanding share of Common Stock on the record date for
               such distribution


                                       80
<PAGE>

      Such adjustment shall become effective immediately prior to the opening
      of business on the Business Day following the date fixed for the
      determination of stockholders entitled to receive such distribution.

      With respect to an adjustment pursuant to this clause (c) where there
      has been a payment of a dividend or other distribution on the Common
      Stock of shares of Capital Stock of any class or series, or similar
      equity interest, of or relating to a Subsidiary or other business unit
      (a "Spin-Off") the Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the
      close of business on the record date fixed for determination of
      stockholders entitled to receive the distribution will be increased
      based on the following formula:

                                              FMV(o)+MP(o)
                              CR(1) = CR(o) X -----------
                                                 MP(o)

      where,

      CR(o) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately prior to such
               distribution

      CR(1) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after such
               distribution

      FMV(o)=  the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Capital
               Stock or similar equity interest distributed to holders of
               Common Stock applicable to one share of Common Stock over the
               first 10 consecutive Trading Day period after the effective
               date of the Spin-Off

      MP(o) =  the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock
               over the first 10 consecutive Trading Day period after the
               effective date of the Spin-Off

      Such adjustment shall occur on the tenth Trading Day from, and
      including, the effective date of the Spin-Off.

            (d) If the Company makes any cash dividend or distribution to
holders of Common Stock, the Conversion Rate will be adjusted based on the
following formula:

                                               SP(o)
                              CR(1) = CR(o) X -------
                                              SP(o)-C

      where,

      CR(o) =  the Conversion Rate in effect on the Ex-Dividend Date for such
               distribution

      CR(1) =  the Conversion Rate in effect immediately after the
               Ex-Dividend Date for such distribution


                                       81
<PAGE>

      SP(o) =  the Current Market Price of the Common Stock on the Trading
               Day immediately preceding the Ex-Dividend Date

      C     =  the amount in cash per share the Company distributes to
               holders of Common Stock

      Such adjustment shall become effective immediately after the close of
      business on the date for such determination.

            (e) If the Company or any of its Subsidiaries purchases shares of
the Common Stock pursuant to a tender or exchange offer for Common Stock, to the
extent that the per share consideration paid in such offer exceeds the average
of the Last Reported Sale Price of the Common Stock over the 10 consecutive
Trading Day period prior to the expiration of such tender or exchange offer, the
Conversion Rate will be increased based on the following formula:

                                         AC+(SP(1) x OS(1))
                         CR(1) = CR(o) X -----------------
                                           OS(o) x SP(1)

      where,

      CR(o) =  the Conversion Rate in effect on the date such tender or
               exchange offer expires

      CR(1) =  the Conversion Rate in effect on the day next succeeding the
               date such tender or exchange offer expires

      AC    =  the aggregate value of all cash and any other consideration
               (as determined by the Board of Directors) paid or payable for
               shares purchased in such tender or exchange offer

      OS(o) =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
               prior to the date such tender or exchange offer expires

      OS(1) =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding immediately
               after the date such tender or exchange offer expires

      SP(1) =  the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of Common Stock
               over the 10 consecutive Trading Day period commencing on the
               Trading Day next succeeding the date such tender or exchange
               offer expires

If the Company is obligated to purchase shares pursuant to any such tender or
exchange offer, but the Company is permanently prevented by applicable law
from effecting any such purchases or all such purchases are rescinded, the
Conversion Rate shall again be adjusted to be the Conversion Rate that would
then be in effect if such tender or exchange offer had not been made.

                                       82
<PAGE>

If, however, the application of the foregoing formula would result in a
decrease in the Conversion Rate, no adjustment to the Conversion Rate will be
made.

            (f) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section 15.05,
(1) no adjustment shall be made thereunder, nor shall an adjustment be made to
the ability of a holder of a Debenture to convert, for any distribution
described therein if the holder will otherwise participate in the distribution
as a result of holding Debentures without conversion of such holder's Debentures
and (2) the Company shall not be required to give effect to any adjustment
pursuant to any of Sections 15.05(a) through (e) unless and until the net effect
of one or more adjustments, each of which will be carried forward until counted
toward adjustment, will have resulted in a change in the Conversion Rate by at
least 1%, and when the cumulative net effect of more than one adjustment so
determined will be to change the Conversion Rate by at least 1%, that change in
the Conversion Rate will be given effect.

            Except as stated herein, the Company will not adjust the
Conversion Rate for the issuance of shares of Common Stock or any securities
convertible into or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock or the right to
purchase shares of Common Stock or such convertible or exchangeable
securities.

            (g) The Company may (but is not required to) make such increases in
the Conversion Rate, in addition to those required by clauses (a) through (e) of
this Section 15.05, as the Board of Directors considers to be advisable to avoid
or diminish any income tax to holders of Common Stock or rights to purchase
Common Stock in connection with a dividend or distribution of shares (or rights
to acquire shares) or any similar event treated as such for income tax purposes.

            To the extent permitted by applicable law, the Company from time to
time may increase the Conversion Rate by any amount for any period of at least
20 days if the Board of Directors shall have made a determination that such
increase would be in the best interests of the Company, which determination
shall be conclusive. Whenever the Conversion Rate is increased pursuant to the
preceding sentence, the Company shall mail to holders of record of the
Debentures a notice of the increase at least 15 days prior to the date the
increased Conversion Rate takes effect, and such notice shall state the
increased Conversion Rate and the period during which it will be in effect.

            (h) No adjustment to the Conversion Rate need be made:

            (i) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to any
      present or future plan providing for the reinvestment of dividends or
      interest payable on securities of the Company and the investment of
      additional optional amounts in shares of Common Stock under any plan;

            (ii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock or options or
      rights to purchase shares of Common Stock pursuant to any present or
      future employee,

                                       83
<PAGE>

      director or consultant benefit plan or program of or assumed by the
      Company or any of its Subsidiaries;

            (iii) upon the issuance of any shares of Common Stock pursuant to
      any option, warrant, right, or exercisable, exchangeable or convertible
      security not described in clause (ii) above and outstanding as of the
      Original Issue Date;

            (iv) for a change in the par value of the Common Stock; or

            (v) for accrued and unpaid Interest.

To the extent the Debentures become convertible into cash, assets or property
(other than Capital Stock of the Company or securities to which Section 15.06
or 15.12 applies), no adjustment shall be made thereafter as to the cash,
assets or property.  Interest shall not accrue on such cash, assets or
property.

            (i) All calculations under this Article XV shall be made by the
Company and shall be made to the nearest cent or to the nearest one-ten
thousandth (1/10,000) of a share, as the case may be.

            (j) Whenever the Conversion Rate is adjusted as herein provided, the
Company shall promptly file with the Trustee and any Conversion Agent other than
the Trustee an Officers' Certificate setting forth the Conversion Rate after
such adjustment and setting forth a brief statement of the facts requiring such
adjustment. Unless and until a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have
received such Officers' Certificate, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any adjustment of the Conversion Rate and may assume that the last
Conversion Rate of which it has knowledge is still in effect. Promptly after
delivery of such certificate, the Company shall prepare a notice of such
adjustment of the Conversion Rate setting forth the adjusted Conversion Rate and
the date on which each adjustment becomes effective and shall mail such notice
of such adjustment of the Conversion Rate to the holder of each Debenture at his
last address appearing on the Debenture Register provided for in Section 2.05 of
this Indenture, within 20 days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such
notice shall not affect the legality or validity of any such adjustment.

            (k) In any case in which this Section 15.05 provides that an
adjustment shall become effective immediately after (1) a record date for an
event, (2) the date fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to
receive a dividend or distribution pursuant to Section 15.05(a), (3) a date
fixed for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive rights or
warrants pursuant to Section 15.05(b) or (4) the expiration time for any tender
or exchange offer pursuant to Section 15.05(e), (each a "Determination Date"),
the Company may elect to defer until the occurrence of the applicable Adjustment
Event

                                       84
<PAGE>

(as hereinafter defined) (x) issuing to the holder of any Debenture converted
after such Determination Date and before the occurrence of such Adjustment
Event, the additional shares of Common Stock or other securities issuable upon
such conversion by reason of the adjustment required by such Adjustment Event
over and above the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion before giving
effect to such adjustment and (y) paying to such holder any amount in cash in
lieu of any fraction pursuant to Section 15.03. For purposes of this Section
15.05(k), the term "Adjustment Event" shall mean:

            (i) in any case referred to in clause (1) hereof, the occurrence of
      such event,

            (ii) in any case referred to in clause (2) hereof, the date any such
      dividend or distribution is paid or made,

            (iii) in any case referred to in clause (3) hereof, the date of
      expiration of such rights or warrants, and

            (iv) in any case referred to in clause (4) hereof, the date a sale
      or exchange of Common Stock pursuant to such tender or exchange offer is
      consummated and becomes irrevocable.

            (l) For purposes of this Section 15.05, the number of shares of
Common Stock at any time outstanding shall not include shares held in the
treasury of the Company but shall include shares issuable in respect of scrip
certificates issued in lieu of fractions of shares of Common Stock. The Company
will not pay any dividend or make any distribution on shares of Common Stock
held in the treasury of the Company.

            Section 15.06. Effect of Reclassification, Consolidation, Merger or
Sale. If any of the following events occur, namely (i) any reclassification or
change of the outstanding shares of Common Stock (other than a subdivision or
combination to which Section 15.05(c) applies), (ii) any consolidation, merger,
binding share exchange or combination of the Company with another Person as a
result of which holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash,
securities or other property with respect to or in exchange for such Common
Stock, or (iii) any sale or conveyance of all or substantially all of the
properties and assets of the Company to any other Person as a result of which
holders of Common Stock shall be entitled to receive cash, securities or other


                                       85
<PAGE>

property with respect to or in exchange for such Common Stock, then the Company
or the successor or purchasing Person, as the case may be, shall execute with
the Trustee a supplemental indenture (which shall comply with the Trust
Indenture Act as in force at the date of execution of such supplemental
indenture) providing that each Debenture shall be convertible into the kind and
amount of cash, securities or other property receivable upon such
reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange,
combination, sale or conveyance by a holder of a number of shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of such Debentures (assuming, for such purposes,
a sufficient number of authorized shares of Common Stock are available to
convert all such Debentures and including, if applicable, Additional Common
Stock) immediately prior to such reclassification, change, consolidation,
merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance assuming such
holder of Common Stock did not exercise his rights of election, if any, as to
the kind or amount of cash, securities or other property receivable upon such
reclassification, change, consolidation, merger, binding share exchange,
combination, sale or conveyance (provided that, if the kind or amount of cash,
securities or other property receivable upon such reclassification, change,
consolidation, merger, binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance
is not the same for each share of Common Stock in respect of which such rights
of election shall not have been exercised ("non-electing share"), then for the
purposes of this Section 15.06 the kind and amount of cash, securities or other
property receivable upon such reclassification, change, consolidation, merger,
binding share exchange, combination, sale or conveyance for each non-electing
share shall be deemed to be the kind and amount so receivable per share by a
plurality of the non-electing shares). Such supplemental indenture shall provide
for adjustments which shall be as nearly equivalent as may be practicable to the
adjustments provided for in this Article XV.

            The Company shall cause notice of the execution of such supplemental
indenture to be mailed to each holder of Debentures, at its address appearing on
the Debenture Register provided for in Section 2.05 of this Indenture, within 20
days after execution thereof. Failure to deliver such notice shall not affect
the legality or validity of such supplemental indenture.

            The above provisions of this Section shall similarly apply to
successive reclassifications, changes, consolidations, mergers, binding share
exchanges, combinations, sales and conveyances.

            If this Section 15.06 applies to any event or occurrence,
Section 15.05 shall not apply. Notwithstanding this Section 15.06, if a
Public Acquirer Change of Control occurs and the Company elects to adjust the
Conversion Rate and its conversion obligation pursuant to Section 15.12, the
provisions of Section 15.12 shall apply to the conversion instead of this
Section 15.06.

            Section 15.07. Taxes on Shares Issued. The issue of stock
certificates on conversions of Debentures shall be made without charge to the
converting Debentureholder for any documentary, stamp or similar issue or
transfer tax in respect of the issue thereof. The Company shall not, however, be
required to pay any such tax which may be payable in respect of any transfer
involved in the issue and delivery of Common Stock in any name other than that
of the holder of any Debenture converted, and the Company shall not be required
to issue or deliver any such stock certificate unless and until the Person or
Persons requesting the issue thereof shall have paid to the Company the amount
of such tax or shall have established to the satisfaction of the Company that
such tax has been paid.

            Section 15.08. Reservation of Shares, Shares to be Fully Paid;
Compliance with Governmental Requirements; Listing of Common Stock. The Company
shall provide, free from preemptive rights, out of its authorized but unissued
shares or shares held in treasury, sufficient shares of Common Stock to provide
for the conversion of the Debentures from time to time as such Debentures are
presented for conversion.


                                       86
<PAGE>

            Before taking any action which would cause an adjustment
increasing the Conversion Rate to an amount that would cause the Conversion
Price to be reduced below the then par value, if any, of the shares of Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures, the Company will take all
corporate action which may, in the opinion of its counsel, be necessary in
order that the Company may validly and legally issue shares of such Common
Stock at such adjusted Conversion Rate.

            The Company covenants that all shares of Common Stock which may
be issued upon conversion of Debentures will upon issue be fully paid and
non-assessable by the Company and free from all taxes, liens and charges with
respect to the issue thereof.

            The Company covenants that, if any shares of Common Stock to be
provided for the purpose of conversion of Debentures hereunder require
registration with or approval of any governmental authority under any federal
or state law before such shares may be validly issued upon conversion, the
Company will in good faith and as expeditiously as possible, to the extent
then permitted by the rules and interpretations of the Commission (or any
successor thereto), endeavor to secure such registration or approval, as the
case may be.

            The Company further covenants that, if at any time the Common
Stock shall be listed on the New York Stock Exchange, The NASDAQ National
Market or any other national securities exchange or automated quotation
system, the Company will, if permitted by the rules of such exchange or
automated quotation system, list and keep listed, so long as the Common Stock
shall be so listed on such exchange or automated quotation system, all Common
Stock issuable upon conversion of the Debentures; provided that if the rules
of such exchange or automated quotation system permit the Company to defer
the listing of such Common Stock until the first conversion of the Debentures
into Common Stock in accordance with the provisions of this Indenture, the
Company covenants to list such Common Stock issuable upon conversion of the
Debentures in accordance with the requirements of such exchange or automated
quotation system at such time.

            Section 15.09. Responsibility of Trustee. The Trustee and any other
Conversion Agent shall not at any time be under any duty or responsibility to
the Company or any holder of Debentures to determine the Conversion Rate or
whether any facts exist which may require any adjustment of the Conversion Rate,
or with respect to the nature or extent or calculation of any such adjustment
when made, or with respect to the method employed, or herein or in any
supplemental indenture provided to be employed, in making the same. The Trustee
and any other Conversion Agent shall not be accountable with respect to the
validity or value (or the kind or amount) of any shares of Common Stock, or of
any securities or

                                       87
<PAGE>

property, which may at any time be issued or delivered upon the conversion of
any Debenture; and the Trustee and any other Conversion Agent make no
representations with respect thereto. Neither the Trustee nor any Conversion
Agent shall be responsible for any failure of the Company to issue, transfer or
deliver any shares of Common Stock or stock certificates or other securities or
property or cash upon the surrender of any Debenture for the purpose of
conversion or to comply with any of the duties, responsibilities or covenants of
the Company contained in this Article XV. Without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, neither the Trustee nor any Conversion Agent shall be under any
responsibility to determine the correctness of any provisions contained in any
supplemental indenture entered into pursuant to Section 15.06 relating either to
the kind or amount of shares of stock or securities or property (including cash)
receivable by Debentureholders upon the conversion of their Debentures after any
event referred to in such Section 15.06 or to any adjustment to be made with
respect thereto, but, subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, may accept as
conclusive evidence of the correctness of any such provisions, and shall be
protected in relying upon, the Officers' Certificate (which the Company shall be
obligated to file with the Trustee prior to the execution of any such
supplemental indenture) with respect thereto.

            Section 15.10. Notice to Holders Prior to Certain Actions. In case:

            (a) the Company shall declare a dividend (or any other distribution)
      on its Common Stock that would require an adjustment in the Conversion
      Rate pursuant to Section 15.05; or

            (b) the Company shall authorize the granting to the holders of all
      or substantially all of its Common Stock of rights or warrants to
      subscribe for or purchase any share of any class or any other rights or
      warrants; or

            (c) of any reclassification or reorganization of the Common Stock
      (other than a subdivision or combination of its outstanding Common Stock,
      or a change in par value, or from par value to no par value, or from no
      par value to par value), or of any consolidation or merger to which the
      Company is a party and for which approval of any stockholders of the
      Company is required, or of the sale or transfer of all or substantially
      all of the assets of the Company; or

            (d) of the voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or
      winding up of the Company;

the Company shall cause to be filed with the Trustee and to be mailed to each
holder of Debentures at his address appearing on the Debenture Register
provided for in Section 2.05 of this Indenture, as promptly as possible but
in any event at least 10 days prior to the applicable date hereinafter
specified, a notice stating (x) the date on which a record is to be taken for
the purpose of such dividend, distribution or rights or warrants, or, if a
record is not to be taken, the date as of which the holders of Common Stock
of record to be entitled to such dividend, distribution or rights are to be
determined, or (y) the date on which such reclassification, reorganization,
consolidation, merger, sale, transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up
is expected to become effective or occur, and the date as of which it is
expected that holders of Common Stock of record shall be entitled to exchange
their Common Stock for securities or other property deliverable upon such
reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale, transfer,


                                       88
<PAGE>

dissolution, liquidation or winding up.  Failure to give such notice, or any
defect therein, shall not affect the legality or validity of such dividend,
distribution, reclassification, reorganization, consolidation, merger, sale,
transfer, dissolution, liquidation or winding up.

            Section 15.11. Stockholder Rights Plan. Holders of Debentures will
receive, upon conversion of Debentures, in addition to cash and shares, if any,
of Common Stock, the rights under any rights plan the Company may put into
effect or, if the Company amends such rights plan or adopts a new rights plan
while Debentures remain outstanding, the rights under that rights plan as so
amended or adopted unless, prior to the conversion, the rights have expired,
terminated or been redeemed or unless the rights have separated from the Common
Stock, in which case the Conversion Rate will be adjusted at the time of
separation as if the Company had distributed to all holders of Common Stock
shares of its Capital Stock, evidences of indebtedness or assets as described in
Section 15.05(c), subject to readjustment upon the subsequent expiration,
termination or redemption of the rights.

            Section 15.12. Conversion After a Public Acquirer Change of Control.
(a) In the event of a Public Acquirer Change of Control, the Company may, in
lieu of issuing the Additional Common Stock pursuant to Section 15.01(d), elect
to adjust the Conversion Rate and the related conversion obligation such that
from and after the Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control,
holders will be entitled to convert their Debentures, in accordance with Section
15.02 hereof (subject to the satisfaction of the requirements of Section 15.01)
into a number of shares of Public Acquirer Common Stock by adjusting the
Conversion Rate in effect immediately before the Public Acquirer Change of
Control by multiplying it by a fraction:

            (i) the numerator of which will be (A) in the case of a share
      exchange, consolidation, merger or binding share exchange, pursuant to
      which the Common Stock is converted into cash, securities or other
      property, the average value of all cash and any other consideration (as
      determined by the Board of Directors) paid or payable per share of Common
      Stock or (B) in the case of any other Public Acquirer Change of Control,
      the average of the Last Reported Sale Prices of the Common Stock for the
      five consecutive Trading Days prior to but excluding the Effective Date of
      such Public Acquirer Change of Control, and

            (ii) the denominator of which will be the average of the Last
      Reported Sale Prices of the Public Acquirer Common Stock for the five
      consecutive Trading Days commencing on the Trading Day next succeeding the
      Effective Date of such Public Acquirer Change of Control.

            (b) The Company will notify holders of its election by providing
notice as set forth in Section 15.01(b)

                                  ARTICLE XVI

                                  Subordination
                                  -------------

            Section 16.01. Debentures Subordinated to Senior Debt. The Company
covenants and agrees, and the Trustee and each holder of the Debentures by its
acceptance thereof likewise covenant and agree, that all Debentures shall be
issued subject to the provisions of this Article XVI; and each Person holding
any Debenture, whether upon original issue or upon transfer, assignment or
exchange thereof, accepts and agrees that all payments of the principal of and
Interest on the Debentures by the Company, as well as payments of the cash
portion of any Settlement Amount upon conversion, shall, to the extent and in
the manner set forth in this Article XVI, be subordinated and junior in right of
payment to the prior payment in full in cash of all amounts payable under Senior
Debt, whether outstanding on the Original Issue Date or thereafter incurred.

            Section 16.02. No Payment on Debentures in Certain Circumstances.
(a) No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of the Company of principal of
or Interest on the Debentures, or payments of the cash portion of any Settlement
Amount upon conversion or any deposit to the trust described in Section
13.01(a), whether pursuant to the terms of the Debentures, upon acceleration,
pursuant to Article III or otherwise, shall be made to the holders of Debentures
(except that holders of Debentures may receive and retain payments from the
trust described in Section 13.01(a)) if (i) a default in the payment of the
principal of or premium, if any, or interest on Designated Senior Debt occurs
and is continuing beyond any applicable period of grace or (ii) any other
default occurs and is continuing with respect to Designated Senior Debt that
permits holders of the Designated Senior Debt as to which such default relates
to accelerate its maturity and the Trustee receives a written notice of such
other default (a "Payment Blockage Notice") from the Company or the holders of
any Designated Senior Debt (with a copy to the Company) until all Obligations
with respect to such Designated Senior Debt are paid in full in cash; provided,
that payments on the Debentures shall be resumed (x) in the case of a payment
default, upon the date on which such default is cured, waived or ceases to exist
and (y) in case of a nonpayment default, the earlier of the date on which such
nonpayment default is cured, waived or ceases to exist and 179 days after the
date on which the applicable Payment Blockage Notice is received by the Trustee
(such period being referred to herein as the "Payment Blockage Period"), unless
the maturity of any Designated Senior Debt has been accelerated (and written
notice of such acceleration has been received by the Trustee).

            Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Debentures to the
contrary, (x) in no event shall a Payment Blockage Period extend beyond 179
days from the date the Payment Blockage Notice in respect thereof was given
and (y) not more than one Payment Blockage Period may be commenced with
respect to the Debentures during any period of 360 consecutive days. No
nonpayment default that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of
any Payment Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis
for a subsequent Payment Blockage Notice (it being understood that any


                                       90
<PAGE>

subsequent action, or any breach of any covenant for a period commencing
after the date of receipt by the Trustee of such Payment Blockage Notice,
that, in either case, would give rise to such a default pursuant to any
provisions under which a default previously existed or was continuing shall
constitute a new default for this purpose).

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment
shall be received by the Trustee or any holder of Debentures when such payment
is prohibited by Section 16.02(a), such payment shall be held in trust for the
benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of Designated
Senior Debt or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees
under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Designated Senior Debt may
have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, but only to the
extent that, upon notice from the Trustee to the holders of Designated Senior
Debt that such prohibited payment has been made, the holders of such Designated
Senior Debt (or their representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the
Trustee in writing of the amounts then due and owing on the Designated Senior
Debt, if any, and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall
be paid to the holders of Designated Senior Debt.

            Section 16.03. Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc. (a)
Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of the Company of any
kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, upon any dissolution
or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of the Company, whether voluntary
or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other similar
proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any marshaling of the
Company's assets, the holders of Senior Debt of the Company shall be entitled to
receive payment in full in cash of all Obligations due in respect of such Senior
Debt before the holders of the Debentures or the Trustee on behalf of such
holders shall be entitled to receive any payment by the Company of the principal
of or Interest on the Debentures or the cash portion of any Settlement Amount
upon conversion, or any payment by the Company to acquire any of the Debentures
for cash, property or securities, or any distribution with respect to the
Debentures of any cash, property or securities (except that the holders may
receive and retain Permitted Junior Securities and payments from the trust
described under Section 13.01(a)). Before any payment (other than Permitted
Junior Securities or payments from such trust) may be made by, or on behalf of,
the Company of the principal of or Interest on the Debentures, or the cash
portion of any Settlement Amount upon conversion, upon any such dissolution or
winding-up or liquidation or reorganization, any payment or distribution of
assets or securities of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash,
property or securities, to which the holders of the Debentures or the Trustee on
their behalf would be entitled, but for the subordination provisions of this
Indenture, shall be made by the Company or by any receiver, trustee in
bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or
distribution, directly to the holders of the Senior Debt (pro rata to such
holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Senior Debt held by such
holders) or their representatives or to the trustee or trustees or agent or
agents under any agreement or indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior
Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, to the
extent necessary to pay all such Senior Debt in full in cash after giving effect
to any prior

                                       91
<PAGE>

or concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for the holders
of such Senior Debt.

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision
prohibiting such payment or distribution, any payment or distribution of assets
or securities of the Company of any kind or character, whether in cash, property
or securities, shall be received by the Trustee or any holder of Debentures at a
time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 16.03(a) and
before all Obligations in respect of Senior Debt are paid in full in cash, or
payment provided for, such payment or distribution shall be received and held in
trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of
Senior Debt of the Company (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the
respective amounts of Senior Debt held by such holders) or their respective
representatives, or to the trustee or trustees or agent or agents under any
indenture pursuant to which any of such Senior Debt may have been issued, as
their respective interests may appear, for application to the payment of Senior
Debt remaining unpaid until all such Senior Debt has been paid in full in cash
after giving effect to any prior or concurrent payment, distribution or
provision therefor to or for the holders of such Senior Debt; provided that the
Trustee shall be entitled to receive from the holders of such Senior Debt
written notice of the amounts owing on such Senior Debt.

            The consolidation of the Company with, or the merger of the
Company with or into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of the
Company following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an entirety,
or substantially as an entirety, to another Person upon the terms and
conditions provided in Article XII shall not be deemed a dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section
16.03 if such other Person shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger,
conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article XII.

            Section 16.04. Subrogation. Upon the payment in full in cash of all
Senior Debt of the Company, or provision for payment, the holders of the
Debentures shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Senior Debt to
receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities of the Company
made on such Senior Debt until the principal of and Interest on, and all
payments of the cash portion of all Settlement Amounts upon conversion of, the
Debentures shall be paid in full in cash; and, for the purposes of such
subrogation, no payments or distributions to the holders of the Senior Debt of
any cash, property or securities to which the holders of the Debentures or the
Trustee on their behalf would be entitled except for the provisions of this
Article XVI, and no payment over pursuant to the provisions of this Article XVI
to the holders of Senior Debt by holders of the Debentures or the Trustee on
their behalf shall, as between the Company, its creditors other than holders of
Senior Debt, and the holders of the Debentures, be deemed to be a payment by the
Company to or on account of the Senior Debt. It is understood that the
provisions of this Article XVI are and are intended solely for the purpose of
defining the relative rights of the holders of the Debentures, on the one hand,
and the holders of the Senior Debt, on the other hand.

                                       92
<PAGE>

            If any payment or distribution to which the holders of the
Debentures would otherwise have been entitled but for the provisions of this
Article XVI shall have been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this
Article XVI, to the payment of all amounts payable under Senior Debt, then
and in such case, the holders of the Debentures shall be entitled to receive
from the holders of such Senior Debt any payments or distributions received
by such holders of any Senior Debt in excess of the amount required to make
payment in full, or provision for payment, of such Senior Debt.

            Section 16.05. Obligations of Company Unconditional. Nothing
contained in this Article XVI or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the
Debentures is intended to or shall impair, as between the Company and the
holders of the Debentures, the obligation of the Company, which is absolute and
unconditional, to pay to the holders of the Debentures the principal of and
Interest on the Debentures as and when the same shall become due and payable,
and all Settlement Amounts as required upon conversion, in accordance with their
terms, or is intended to or shall affect the relative rights of the holders of
the Debentures and creditors of the Company other than the holders of Senior
Debt, nor shall anything herein or therein prevent the holder of any Debenture
or the Trustee on their behalf from exercising all remedies otherwise permitted
by applicable law upon default under this Indenture, subject to the rights, if
any, under this Article XVI of the holders of Senior Debt in respect of cash,
property or securities of the Company received upon the exercise of any such
remedy.

            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Article XVI shall restrict the right of the Trustee or the
holders of Debentures to take any action to declare the Debentures to be due
and payable prior to their Stated Maturity pursuant to Article VII or to
pursue any rights or remedies hereunder; provided that all Senior Debt then
due and payable shall first be paid in full before the holders of the
Debentures or the Trustee are entitled to receive any direct or indirect
payment from the Company of principal of or Interest on, or the cash portion
of any Settlement Amount upon conversion of, the Debentures.

            Section 16.06. Notice to Trustee. The Company shall give prompt
written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company which would
prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee in respect of the
Debentures pursuant to the provisions of this Article XVI. The Trustee shall not
be charged with knowledge of the existence of any event of default with respect
to any Senior Debt or of any other facts which would prohibit the making of any
payment to or by the Trustee unless and until the Trustee shall have received
notice in writing at its Corporate Trust Office to that effect signed by an
officer of the Company, or by a holder of Senior Debt or trustee or agent
therefor; and prior to the receipt of any such written notice, the Trustee
shall, subject to Article VIII, be entitled to assume that no such facts exist;
provided that if the Trustee shall not have received the notice provided for in
this Section 16.06 at least two Business Days prior to the date upon which by
the terms of this Indenture any moneys shall become payable for any purpose
(including, without limitation, the payment of the principal of or Interest on
any Debenture and any Settlement Amount), then, regardless of anything herein to
the contrary, the Trustee shall have full power and authority to receive

                                       93
<PAGE>

any moneys from the Company and to apply the same to the purpose for which they
were received, and shall not be affected by any notice to the contrary which may
be received by it on or after such prior date. Nothing contained in this Section
16.06 shall limit the right of the holders of Senior Debt to recover payments as
contemplated by Section 16.03. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the
delivery to it of a written notice by a Person representing himself or itself to
be a holder of any Senior Debt (or a trustee on behalf of, or other
representative of, such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by
a holder of such Senior Debt or a trustee or representative on behalf of any
such holder.

            In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that any
evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of
Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant to this
Article XVI, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish evidence to the
reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of Senior Debt held
by such Person, the extent to which such Person is entitled to participate in
such payment or distribution and any other facts pertinent to the rights of
such Person under this Article XVI, and if such evidence is not furnished,
the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person pending judicial
determination as to the right of such Person to receive such payment.

            Section 16.07. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities
referred to in this Article XVI, the Trustee and the holders of the Debentures
shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any court of
competent jurisdiction in which bankruptcy, dissolution, winding-up, liquidation
or reorganization proceedings are pending, or upon a certificate of the
receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the holders
of the Debentures for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to
participate in such distribution, the holders of the Senior Debt and other
Indebtedness of the Company, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the amount
or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent thereto or
to this Article XVI.

            Section 16.08. Trustee's Relation to Senior Debt. The Trustee and
any Paying Agent shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in this Article
XVI with respect to any Senior Debt which may at any time be held by it in its
individual or any other capacity to the same extent as any other holder of
Senior Debt, and nothing in this Indenture shall deprive the Trustee or any
Paying Agent of any of its rights as such holder.

            With respect to the holders of Senior Debt, the Trustee
undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and
obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article XVI, and no implied
covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Senior Debt shall be
read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The Trustee shall not be deemed
to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of Senior Debt. The Trustee shall
not be liable to any such holders if the Trustee shall in good faith
mistakenly pay over or distribute to holders of Debentures or to the Company
or to any other Person

                                       94
<PAGE>

cash, property or securities to which any holders of Senior Debt shall be
entitled by virtue of this Article XVI or otherwise.

            Section 16.09. Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or
Omissions of the Company or Holders of Senior Debt. No right of any present or
future holders of any Senior Debt to enforce subordination as provided herein
shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any act or failure to
act on the part of the Company or by any act or failure to act, in good faith,
by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by the Company with the terms of
this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any such holder may
have or otherwise be charged with. The provisions of this Article XVI are
intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable directly by, the
holders of Senior Debt.

            Section 16.10. Debentureholders Authorize Trustee to Effectuate
Subordination of Debentures. Each holder of Debentures by its acceptance of such
Debentures authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on its behalf to take
such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination
provided in this Article XVI, and appoints the Trustee its attorney-in-fact for
such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization of the Company (whether in bankruptcy, insolvency,
receivership, reorganization or similar proceedings or upon an assignment for
the benefit of creditors or otherwise) tending towards liquidation of the
business and assets of the Company, the filing of a claim for the unpaid balance
of its Debentures in the form required in those proceedings.

            Section 16.11. This Article Not to Prevent Events of Default. The
failure to make a payment on account of principal or Interest or any Settlement
Amount on the Debentures by reason of any provision of this Article XVI shall
not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default specified
in Section 7.01.

            Section 16.12. Trustee's Compensation Not Prejudiced. Nothing in
this Article XVI shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to other
sections in this Indenture.

            Section 16.13. No Waiver of Subordination Provisions. Without in any
way limiting the generality of Section 16.09, the holders of Senior Debt may, at
any time and from time to time, without the consent of or notice to the Trustee
or the holders of the Debentures, without incurring responsibility to the
holders of the Debentures and without impairing or releasing the subordination
provided in this Article XVI or the obligations hereunder of the holders of the
Debentures to the holders of Senior Debt, do any one or more of the following:
(a) change the manner, place or terms of payment or extend the time of payment
of, or renew or alter, Senior Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any
agreement under which Senior Debt is outstanding or secured; (b) sell, exchange,
release or otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise
securing Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the
collection of Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising any
rights against the Company and any other Person.

                                       95
<PAGE>

            Nothing contained in this Article XVI or elsewhere in this
Indenture shall prevent (i) the Company, except under the conditions
described in Section 16.02, from making payments of principal of and Interest
on, and the cash portion of all Settlement Amounts upon conversion of, the
Debentures, or from depositing with the Trustee any moneys for such payments
or (ii) the application by the Trustee of any moneys deposited with it for
the purpose of making such payments of principal of and Interest on, and the
cash portion of all Settlement Amounts upon conversion of, the Debentures, to
the holders entitled thereto unless at least two Business Days prior to the
date upon which such payment becomes due and payable or is otherwise
required, the Trustee shall have received the written notice provided for in
Section 16.02(b) or in Section 16.06. The Company shall give prompt written
notice to the Trustee of any dissolution, winding-up, liquidation or
reorganization of the Company.

            Section 16.14. Acceleration of Debentures. If payment of the
Debentures is accelerated because of an Event of Default, the Company (or the
Trustee at the direction of the Company) shall promptly notify the holders of
Designated Senior Debt of the Company (or the representative of such Designated
Senior Debt) of the acceleration.

                                  ARTICLE XVII

                                   Guarantees
                                   ----------

            Section 17.01. Unconditional Guarantee. Each of the Guarantors
hereby, jointly and severally and unconditionally guarantees, on a senior
subordinated basis (such guarantee to be referred to herein as a "Guarantee") to
each holder of a Debenture authenticated and delivered by the Trustee and to the
Trustee and its successors and assigns that: (a) the principal of and Interest
on the Debentures shall be promptly paid in full when due (subject to any
applicable grace periods) whether at maturity, upon redemption, upon repurchase
at the option of holders pursuant to the provisions of the Debentures relating
thereto, by acceleration or otherwise, and interest on the overdue principal and
(to the extent permitted by law) Interest, if any, on the Debentures and all
other Obligations of the Company to the holders or the Trustee hereunder or
thereunder (including amounts due the Trustee under Article VIII hereof) and all
other Obligations, including the payment of the cash portion of all Settlement
Amounts as required upon conversion, shall be promptly paid in full or
performed, all in accordance with the terms hereof and thereof; and (b) in case
of any extension of time of payment or renewal of any Debentures or any of such
other Obligations, the same shall be promptly paid in full when due or performed
in accordance with the terms of the extension or renewal, subject to any
applicable grace period, whether at maturity, by acceleration or otherwise,
subject, however, in the case of (a) and (b) to the limitations set forth in
Section 17.04. Failing payment when due of any amount so guaranteed, or failing
performance of any other obligation of the Company to the holders under this
Indenture or under the Debentures, for whatever reason, each Guarantor shall be
obligated to pay,

                                       96
<PAGE>

or to perform or cause the performance of, the same immediately. An Event of
Default under this Indenture or the Debentures shall constitute an event of
default under this Guarantee, and shall entitle the holders of Debentures to
accelerate the Obligations of the Guarantors hereunder in the same manner and to
the same extent as the Obligations of the Company.

            Each of the Guarantors hereby agrees that its Obligations
hereunder shall be unconditional, irrespective of the validity, regularity or
enforceability of the Debentures or this Indenture, the absence of any action
to enforce the same, any waiver or consent by any holder of the Debentures
with respect to any provisions hereof or thereof, any release of any other
Guarantor, the recovery of any judgment against the Company, any action to
enforce the same, whether or not a Guarantee is affixed to any particular
Debenture, or any other circumstance which might otherwise constitute a legal
or equitable discharge or defense of a Guarantor. Each of the Guarantors
hereby waives the benefit of diligence, presentment, demand of payment,
filing of claims with a court in the event of insolvency or bankruptcy of the
Company, any right to require a proceeding first against the Company,
protest, notice and all demands whatsoever and covenants that its Guarantee
shall not be discharged except by complete performance of the Obligations
contained in the Debentures, this Indenture and this Guarantee. This
Guarantee is a guarantee of payment and not of collection. If any holder or
the Trustee is required by any court or otherwise to return to the Company or
to any Guarantor, or any custodian, trustee, liquidator or other similar
official acting in relation to the Company or such Guarantor, any amount paid
by the Company or such Guarantor to the Trustee or such holder, this
Guarantee, to the extent theretofore discharged, shall be reinstated in full
force and effect. Each Guarantor further agrees that, as between it, on the
one hand, and the holders of Debentures and the Trustee, on the other hand,
(a) the maturity of the Obligations guaranteed hereby may be accelerated as
provided in Article VII for the purposes of this Guarantee, notwithstanding
any stay, injunction or other prohibition preventing such acceleration in
respect of the Obligations guaranteed hereby, and (b) in the event of any
acceleration of such Obligations as provided in Article VII hereof, such
Obligations (whether or not due and payable) shall forthwith become due and
payable by the Guarantors for the purpose of this Guarantee.

            No stockholder, officer, director, employee, agent or
incorporator, past, present or future, of any Guarantor, as such, shall have
any personal liability under this Guarantee by reason of his, her or its
status as such stockholder, officer, director, employee, agent or
incorporator.

            Each Guarantor that makes a payment or distribution under its
Guarantee shall be entitled to a contribution from each other Guarantor in an
amount pro rata, based on the net assets of each Guarantor, determined in
accordance with GAAP.

            Section 17.02. Limitations on Guarantees. The Obligations of each
Guarantor under its Guarantee are limited to the maximum amount which, after
giving effect to all other contingent and fixed liabilities of such Guarantor
and after giving effect to any collections from or payments made by or on behalf
of any other Guarantor in

                                       97
<PAGE>

respect of the Obligations of such other Guarantor under its Guarantee or
pursuant to its contribution Obligations under this Indenture, will result in
the Obligations of such Guarantor under the Guarantee not constituting a
fraudulent conveyance or fraudulent transfer under any laws of the United
States, any state or territory of the United States or the District of Columbia.

            Section 17.03. Execution and Delivery. Each of the Guarantors hereby
agrees that its Guarantee set forth in Section 17.01 shall remain in full force
and effect (unless released in accordance with Section 17.04) notwithstanding
any failure to endorse on any Debenture a notation of such Guarantee.

            If an officer of a Guarantor whose signature is on this Indenture
no longer holds that office at the time the Trustee authenticates any
Debenture, such Guarantor's Guarantee of such Debenture shall be valid
nevertheless.

            The delivery of any Debenture by the Trustee, after the
authentication thereof hereunder, shall constitute due delivery of any
Guarantee set forth in this Indenture on behalf of each Guarantor.

            Section 17.04. Release of a Guarantor. A Guarantor's Guarantee
pursuant to this Article XVII shall be released, and such Guarantor shall be
deemed released from all Obligations under this Indenture and the Debentures
without any further action required on the part of the Trustee or any holder of
a Debenture (i) at such time as such Guarantor does not have any Qualified
Indebtedness or Obligations in respect thereof outstanding that would have
required such Guarantor to enter into a Guarantee pursuant to Section 17.17,
(ii) upon consummation of any consolidation or merger of such Guarantor in
accordance with Article XII (other than with the Company or an Affiliate of the
Company), if after giving effect thereto such Guarantor does not have
outstanding any guarantee of any Qualified Indebtedness or Obligations in
respect thereof of the Company or any Subsidiary of the Company that would have
required such Guarantor to enter into a Guarantee pursuant to Section 17.17,
(iii) upon disposition of such Guarantor in its entirety to another Person
(other than the Company or an Affiliate of the Company), if after giving effect
thereto such Guarantor does not have outstanding any guarantee of any Qualified
Indebtedness or Obligations in respect thereof of the Company or any Subsidiary
of the Company that would have required such Guarantor to enter into a Guarantee
pursuant to Section 17.17 and (iv) upon the liquidation or dissolution of such
Guarantor, and, in the case of each of clauses (i) through (iii), the Company
provides an Officers' Certificate to the Trustee certifying that no such
Obligations are outstanding. Any Guarantor not so released shall remain or be
liable under its Guarantee as provided in this Article XVII. Concurrently with
the satisfaction and discharge of the Indenture under Article XIII hereof, the
Guarantors shall be released from all Obligations under this Indenture and the
Debentures.

            The Trustee shall deliver an appropriate instrument evidencing
the release of a Guarantor upon receipt of a request by the Company or such
Guarantor accompanied by an Officers' Certificate and, upon request, an
Opinion of Counsel certifying as to the

                                       98
<PAGE>

compliance with this Section 17.04; provided the legal counsel delivering such
Opinion of Counsel may rely as to matters of fact on one or more Officers'
Certificates of the Company.

            The Trustee shall execute any documents reasonably requested by
the Company or a Guarantor in order to evidence the release of such Guarantor
from its Obligations under its Guarantee pursuant to this Article XVII.

            Except as set forth in Article XII and this Section 17.04,
nothing contained in this Indenture or in any of the Debentures shall prevent
any consolidation or merger of a Guarantor with or into the Company or
another Guarantor or shall prevent any sale or conveyance of the property of
a Guarantor as an entirety or substantially as an entirety to the Company or
another Guarantor.

            Section 17.05. Waiver of Subrogation. Until this Indenture is
discharged and all of the Debentures are discharged and paid in full, each
Guarantor hereby irrevocably waives and agrees not to exercise any claim or
other rights which it may now or hereafter acquire against the Company that
arise from the existence, payment, performance or enforcement of the Company's
Obligations under the Debentures or this Indenture and such Guarantor's
Obligations under its Guarantee under this Indenture, in any such instance
including, without limitation, any right of subrogation, reimbursement,
exoneration, contribution, indemnification, and any right to participate in any
claim or remedy of the holders of Debentures against the Company, whether or not
such claim, remedy or right arises in equity, or under contract, statute or
common law, including, without limitation, the right to take or receive from the
Company, directly or indirectly, in cash or other property or by set-off or in
any other manner, payment or security on account of such claim or other rights.
If any amount shall be paid to any Guarantor in violation of the preceding
sentence and any amounts owing to the Trustee or the holders of Debentures under
the Debentures, this Indenture, or any other document or instrument delivered
under or in connection with such agreements or instruments, shall not have been
paid in full, such amount shall have been deemed to have been paid to such
Guarantor for the benefit of, and held in trust for the benefit of, the Trustee
or the holders of Debentures and shall forthwith be paid to the Trustee for the
benefit of itself or such holders to be credited and applied to the Obligations
in favor of the Trustee or the holders, as the case may be, whether matured or
unmatured, in accordance with the terms of this Indenture. Each Guarantor
acknowledges that it will receive direct and indirect benefits from the
financing arrangements contemplated by this Indenture and that the waiver set
forth in this Section 17.05 is knowingly made in contemplation of such benefits.

            Section 17.06. Obligations Continuing. Subject to Section 17.04, the
Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall be continuing and shall remain in
full force and effect until all the Obligations have been paid and satisfied in
full.

            Section 17.07. Obligations Reinstated. Subject to Section 17.04, the
Obligations of each Guarantor hereunder shall continue to be effective or shall
be

                                       99
<PAGE>

reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time any payment which would otherwise
have reduced the Obligations of any Guarantor hereunder (whether such payment
shall have been made by or on behalf of the Company or by or on behalf of a
Guarantor) is rescinded or reclaimed from any of the holders of Debentures upon
the insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company or any
Guarantor or otherwise, all as though such payment had not been made. If demand
for, or acceleration of the time for, payment by the Company is stayed upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, liquidation or reorganization of the Company, all such
Obligations otherwise subject to demand for payment or acceleration shall
nonetheless be payable by each Guarantor as provided herein.

            Section 17.08. Waiver. Without in any way limiting the provisions of
Section 17.01, each Guarantor hereby waives notice or proof of reliance by the
holders of Debentures upon the Obligations of any Guarantor hereunder, and
diligence, presentment, demand for payment on the Company, protest or notice of
dishonor of any of the Obligations.

            Section 17.09. No Obligation To Take Action Against the Company.
Neither the Trustee nor any other Person shall have any obligation to enforce or
exhaust any rights or remedies or to take any other steps under any security for
the Obligations or against the Company or any other Person or any property of
the Company or any other Person before the Trustee is entitled to demand payment
and performance by any or all Guarantors of their liabilities and Obligations
under this Indenture.

            Section 17.10. Default and Enforcement. If any Guarantor fails to
pay in accordance with Section 17.01, the Trustee may proceed in its name as
trustee hereunder in the enforcement of the Guarantee of any such Guarantor and
such Guarantor's Obligations hereunder by any remedy provided by law, whether by
legal proceedings or otherwise, and to recover from such Guarantor the
Obligations under this Indenture.

            Section 17.11. Amendment, Etc. No amendment, modification or waiver
of any provision of this Indenture relating to any Guarantor or consent to any
departure by any Guarantor or any other Person from any such provision will in
any event be effective unless it is signed by such Guarantor and the Trustee,
other than a release pursuant to Section 17.04.

            Section 17.12. Acknowledgment. Each Guarantor hereby acknowledges
communication of the terms of this Indenture and the Debentures and consents to
and approves of the same.

            Section 17.13. Costs and Expenses. Each Guarantor shall pay on
demand by the Trustee any and all reasonable costs, fees and expenses
(including, without limitation, reasonable legal fees and disbursements)
incurred by the Trustee, its agents, advisors and counsel or any of the holders
of Debentures in enforcing any of their rights under any Guarantee.


                                      100
<PAGE>

            Section 17.14. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies. No failure to
exercise and no delay in exercising, on the part of the Trustee or the holders
of Debentures, any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Indenture or the
Debentures, shall operate as a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial
exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege under this Indenture or the
Debentures preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights, remedies, powers and
privileges in the Guarantee under this Indenture, the Debentures and any other
document or instrument between a Guarantor and/or the Company and the Trustee
are cumulative and not exclusive of any rights, remedies, powers and privilege
provided by law.

            Section 17.15. Successors and Assigns. Each Guarantee shall be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of each Guarantor and the Trustee and the
other holders of Debentures and their respective successors and permitted
assigns, except that no Guarantor may assign any of its Obligations hereunder.

            Section 17.16. Contribution. In order to provide for just and
equitable contribution among the Guarantors, the Guarantors agree, inter se,
that in the event any payment or distribution is made by any Guarantor (a
"Funding Guarantor") under its Guarantee, such Funding Guarantor shall be
entitled to contribution from all other Guarantors in a pro rata amount based on
the net assets (determined in accordance with GAAP) of each Guarantor (including
the Funding Guarantor) for all payments, damages and expenses incurred by that
Funding Guarantor in discharging the Company's Obligations with respect to the
Debentures or any other Guarantor's Obligations with respect to its Guarantee
hereunder.

            Section 17.17. Future Guarantors. The Company shall cause each
Subsidiary of the Company (including any Subsidiary acquired or formed
subsequent to the Original Issue Date and any Subsidiary that was previously
released from a Guarantee) that guarantees or otherwise incurs any Obligations
in respect of Qualified Indebtedness (whether outstanding on the Original Issue
Date or subsequently incurred) to Guarantee the Obligations under this Indenture
and the Debentures on the terms set forth in this Article XVII and to execute
and deliver to the Trustee a supplemental indenture in form reasonably
satisfactory to the Trustee pursuant to which such Subsidiary will provide such
Guarantee and become party to this Indenture as a Guarantor. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, no Subsidiary of the Company organized outside of the United States
of America shall be required to become a Guarantor pursuant to this Section
17.17 unless such Subsidiary otherwise guarantees Qualified Indebtedness of the
Company or any Subsidiary of the Company organized in the United States of
America. Each such supplemental indenture shall be executed and delivered and
each such Guarantee shall become effective concurrently with the incurrence of
such Qualified Indebtedness.

                                 ARTICLE XVIII

                         Subordination of the Guarantees
                         -------------------------------

            Section 18.01. Guarantee Obligations Subordinated to Guarantor
Senior Debt. Each Guarantor covenants and agrees, and the Trustee and each
holder of the Debentures by its acceptance thereof likewise covenant and agree,
that all Guarantees shall be issued subject to the provisions of this Article
XVIII; and each Person holding any Guarantee, whether upon original issue or
upon transfer, assignment or exchange thereof, accepts and agrees that all
payments of the principal of and Interest on the Debentures pursuant to the
Guarantee, as well as payments of the cash portion of any Settlement Amount upon
conversion and including any deposit to the trust described in Section 13.01(a),
made by or on behalf of such Guarantor shall, to the extent and in the manner
set forth in this Article XVIII, be subordinated and junior in right of payment
to the prior payment in full in cash of all amounts payable under Guarantor
Senior Debt of such Guarantor, whether outstanding on the Original Issue Date or
thereafter incurred.

            Section 18.02. No Payment on Guarantee in Certain Circumstances. (a)
No direct or indirect payment by or on behalf of any Guarantor of principal of
or Interest on the Debentures, or payments of the cash portion of any Settlement
Amount upon conversion or any deposit to the trust described in Section
13.01(a), whether pursuant to the terms of the Debentures or the Guarantees,
upon acceleration, pursuant to Article III or otherwise, shall be made to the
holders of Debentures (except that holders of Debentures may receive and retain
payments from the trust described in Section 13.01(a)) if (i) a default in the
payment of the principal of or premium, if any, or interest on Designated
Guarantor Senior Debt occurs and is continuing beyond any applicable period of
grace or (ii) any other default occurs and is continuing with respect to
Designated Guarantor Senior Debt that permits holders of the Designated
Guarantor Senior Debt as to which such default relates to accelerate its
maturity and the Trustee receives a written notice of such other default (a
"Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice") from the Company or a Guarantor or the
holders of any Designated Guarantor Senior Debt (with a copy to the Company)
until all Obligations with respect to such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt are
paid in full in cash; provided, that payments on the Debentures shall be resumed
(x) in the case of a payment default, upon the date on which such default is
cured, waived or ceases to exist and (y) in case of a nonpayment default, the
earlier of the date on which such nonpayment default is cured, waived or ceases
to exist and 179 days after the date on which the applicable Guarantor Payment
Blockage Notice is received by the Trustee (such period being referred to herein
as the "Guarantor Payment Blockage Period"), unless the maturity of any
Designated Guarantor Senior Debt has been accelerated (and written notice of
such acceleration has been received by the Trustee).

            Notwithstanding anything herein or in the Debentures to the
contrary, (x) in no event shall a Guarantor Payment Blockage Period extend
beyond 179 days from the date the Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice in
respect thereof was given and (y) not more than one Guarantor Payment
Blockage Period may be commenced with respect to

                                      102
<PAGE>

the Debentures during any period of 360 consecutive days. No nonpayment default
that existed or was continuing on the date of delivery of any Guarantor Payment
Blockage Notice to the Trustee shall be, or be made, the basis for a subsequent
Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice (it being understood that any subsequent
action, or any breach of any covenant for a period commencing after the date of
receipt by the Trustee of such Guarantor Payment Blockage Notice, that, in
either case, would give rise to such a default pursuant to any provisions under
which a default previously existed or was continuing shall constitute a new
default for this purpose).

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing, any payment
shall be received by the Trustee or any holder of Debentures when such payment
is prohibited by Section 18.02(a), such payment shall be held in trust for the
benefit of, and shall be paid over or delivered to, the holders of such
Designated Guarantor Senior Debt or their respective representatives, or to the
trustee or trustees under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Designated
Guarantor Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may
appear, but only to the extent that, upon notice from the Trustee to the holders
of such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt that such prohibited payment has been
made, the holders of such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt (or their
representative or representatives or a trustee) notify the Trustee in writing of
the amounts then due and owing on such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt, if any,
and only the amounts specified in such notice to the Trustee shall be paid to
the holders of such Designated Guarantor Senior Debt.

            Section 18.03. Payment Over of Proceeds Upon Dissolution, Etc. (a)
Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of any Guarantor of any
kind or character, whether in cash, property or securities, upon any dissolution
or winding-up or liquidation or reorganization of such Guarantor, whether
voluntary or involuntary or in bankruptcy, insolvency, receivership or other
similar proceedings, an assignment for the benefit of creditors or any
marshaling of such Guarantor's assets, the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt of
such Guarantor shall be entitled to receive payment in full in cash of all
Obligations due in respect of such Guarantor Senior Debt before the holders of
the Debentures or the Trustee on behalf of such holders shall be entitled to
receive any payment by such Guarantor of the principal of or Interest on the
Debentures, or the cash portion of any Settlement Amount upon conversion,
pursuant to its Guarantee, or any payment to acquire any of the Debentures for
cash, property or securities, or any distribution with respect to the Debentures
of any cash, property or securities (except that the holders may receive and
retain Permitted Junior Securities and payments from the trust described under
Section 13.01(a)). Before any payment (other than Permitted Junior Securities or
payments from such trust) may be made by, or on behalf of, any Guarantor of the
principal of or Interest on the Debentures, or the cash portion of any
Settlement Amount upon conversion, upon any such dissolution or winding-up or
liquidation or reorganization, any payment or distribution of assets or
securities of such Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, property
or securities, to which the holders of the Debentures or the Trustee on their
behalf would be entitled, but for the subordination provisions of this
Indenture, shall be made by such Guarantor or by any receiver, trustee in
bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person making such payment or


                                      103

distribution, directly to the holders of the Guarantor Senior Debt of such
Guarantor (pro rata to such holders on the basis of the respective amounts of
such Guarantor Senior Debt held by such holders) or their representatives or to
the trustee or trustees or agent or agents under any agreement or indenture
pursuant to which any such Guarantor Senior Debt may have been issued, as their
respective interests may appear, to the extent necessary to pay all such
Guarantor Senior Debt in full in cash after giving effect to any prior or
concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for the holders of
such Guarantor Senior Debt.

            (b) In the event that, notwithstanding the foregoing provision
prohibiting such payment or distribution, any payment or distribution of assets
or securities of a Guarantor of any kind or character, whether in cash, property
or securities, shall be received by the Trustee or any holder of Debentures at a
time when such payment or distribution is prohibited by Section 18.03(a) and
before all Obligations in respect of the Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor
are paid in full in cash, or payment provided for, such payment or distribution
shall be received and held in trust for the benefit of, and shall be paid over
or delivered to, the holders of such Guarantor Senior Debt (pro rata to such
holders on the basis of the respective amounts of Guarantor Senior Debt held by
such holders) or their respective representatives, or to the trustee or trustees
or agent or agents under any indenture pursuant to which any of such Guarantor
Senior Debt may have been issued, as their respective interests may appear, for
application to the payment of the Guarantor Senior Debt remaining unpaid until
all such Guarantor Senior Debt has been paid in full in cash after giving effect
to any prior or concurrent payment, distribution or provision therefor to or for
the holders of such Guarantor Senior Debt; provided that the Trustee shall be
entitled to receive from the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt written notice of
the amounts owing on the Guarantor Senior Debt.

            The consolidation of a Guarantor with, or the merger of a
Guarantor with or into, another Person or the liquidation or dissolution of a
Guarantor following the conveyance or transfer of its property as an
entirety, or substantially as an entirety, to another Person upon the terms
and conditions provided in Article XII shall not be deemed a dissolution,
winding-up, liquidation or reorganization for the purposes of this Section
18.03 if such other Person shall, as a part of such consolidation, merger,
conveyance or transfer, comply with the conditions stated in Article XII.

            Section 18.04. Subrogation. Upon the payment in full in cash of all
Guarantor Senior Debt of a Guarantor, or provision for payment, the holders of
the Debentures shall be subrogated to the rights of the holders of Guarantor
Senior Debt to receive payments or distributions of cash, property or securities
of such Guarantor made on Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor until the
principal of and Interest on, and all payments of the cash portion of all
Settlement Amounts upon conversion of, the Debentures shall be paid in full in
cash; and, for the purposes of such subrogation, no payments or distributions to
the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt of any cash, property or securities to
which the holders of the Debentures or the Trustee on their behalf would be
entitled except for the provisions of this Article XVIII, and no payment over
pursuant to the provisions of this Article XVIII to the holders of the Guarantor
Senior Debt by

                                      104
<PAGE>

holders of the Debentures or the Trustee on their behalf shall, as between such
Guarantor, its creditors other than holders of such Guarantor Senior Debt of
such Guarantor, and the holders of the Debentures, be deemed to be a payment by
such Guarantor to or on account of the Guarantor Senior Debt of such Guarantor.
It is understood that the provisions of this Article XVIII are and are intended
solely for the purpose of defining the relative rights of the holders of the
Debentures, on the one hand, and the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt, on the
other hand.

            If any payment or distribution to which the holders of the
Debentures would otherwise have been entitled but for the provisions of this
Article XVIII shall have been applied, pursuant to the provisions of this
Article XVIII, to the payment of all amounts payable under Guarantor Senior
Debt, then and in such case, the holders of the Debentures shall be entitled to
receive from the holders of such Guarantor Senior Debt any payments or
distributions received by such holders of Guarantor Senior Debt in excess of the
amount required to make payment in full, or provision for payment, of such
Guarantor Senior Debt.

            Section 18.05. Obligations of Guarantor Unconditional. Nothing
contained in this Article XVIII or elsewhere in this Indenture or in the
Debentures is intended to or shall impair, as between any Guarantor and the
holders of the Debentures, the obligation of such Guarantor, which is absolute
and unconditional, to pay to the holders of the Debentures the principal of and
Interest on the Debentures as and when the same shall become due and payable,
and all cash Settlement Amounts as required upon conversion, in accordance with
the terms of its Guarantee, or is intended to or shall affect the relative
rights of the holders of the Debentures and creditors of the Guarantors other
than the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt, nor shall anything herein or therein
prevent the holder of any Debenture or the Trustee on their behalf from
exercising all remedies otherwise permitted by applicable law upon default under
this Indenture, subject to the rights, if any, under this Article XVIII of the
holders of Guarantor Senior Debt in respect of cash, property or securities of
the Guarantors received upon the exercise of any such remedy.

            Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, nothing
contained in this Article XVIII shall restrict the right of the Trustee or
the holders of Debentures to take any action to declare the Debentures to be
due and payable prior to their Stated Maturity pursuant to Section 7.01 or to
pursue any rights or remedies hereunder; provided that all Guarantor Senior
Debt of any Guarantor then due and payable shall first be paid in full before
the holders of the Debentures or the Trustee are entitled to receive any
direct or indirect payment from such Guarantor of principal of or Interest
on, or the cash portion of any Settlement Amount upon conversion of, the
Debentures pursuant to such Guarantor's Guarantee.

            Section 18.06. Notice to Trustee. The Company and the Guarantors
shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any fact known to the Company
or the Guarantors which would prohibit the making of any payment to or by the
Trustee in respect of the Guarantees pursuant to the provisions of this Article
XVIII. The Trustee

                                      105
<PAGE>

shall not be charged with knowledge of the existence of any event of default
with respect to any Guarantor Senior Debt or of any other facts which would
prohibit the making of any payment to or by the Trustee unless and until the
Trustee shall have received notice in writing at its Corporate Trust Office to
that effect signed by an officer of the Company or a Guarantor, or by a holder
of Guarantor Senior Debt or trustee or agent therefor; and prior to the receipt
of any such written notice, the Trustee shall, subject to Article VIII, be
entitled to assume that no such facts exist; provided that if the Trustee shall
not have received the notice provided for in this Section 18.06 at least two
Business Days prior to the date upon which by the terms of this Indenture any
moneys shall become payable for any purpose (including, without limitation, the
payment of the principal of or Interest on any Debenture and any Settlement
Amount), then, regardless of anything herein to the contrary, the Trustee shall
have full power and authority to receive any moneys from the Guarantors and to
apply the same to the purpose for which they were received, and shall not be
affected by any notice to the contrary which may be received by it on or after
such prior date. Nothing contained in this Section 18.06 shall limit the right
of the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt to recover payments as contemplated by
Section 18.03. The Trustee shall be entitled to rely on the delivery to it of a
written notice by a Person representing himself or itself to be a holder of any
Guarantor Senior Debt (or a trustee on behalf of, or other representative of,
such holder) to establish that such notice has been given by a holder of
Guarantor Senior Debt or a trustee or representative on behalf of any such
holder.

            In the event that the Trustee determines in good faith that any
evidence is required with respect to the right of any Person as a holder of
Guarantor Senior Debt to participate in any payment or distribution pursuant
to this Article XVIII, the Trustee may request such Person to furnish
evidence to the reasonable satisfaction of the Trustee as to the amount of
Guarantor Senior Debt held by such Person, the extent to which such Person is
entitled to participate in such payment or distribution and any other facts
pertinent to the rights of such Person under this Article XVIII, and if such
evidence is not furnished, the Trustee may defer any payment to such Person
pending judicial determination as to the right of such Person to receive such
payment.

            Section 18.07. Reliance on Judicial Order or Certificate of
Liquidating Agent. Upon any payment or distribution of assets or securities of
any Guarantor referred to in this Article XVIII, the Trustee and the holders of
the Debentures shall be entitled to rely upon any order or decree made by any
court of competent jurisdiction in which bankruptcy, dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization proceedings are pending, or upon a certificate of
the receiver, trustee in bankruptcy, liquidating trustee, agent or other Person
making such payment or distribution, delivered to the Trustee or to the holders
of the Debentures for the purpose of ascertaining the Persons entitled to
participate in such distribution, the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt and other
Indebtedness of such Guarantor, the amount thereof or payable thereon, the
amount or amounts paid or distributed thereon and all other facts pertinent
thereto or to this Article XVIII.

                                      106
<PAGE>

            Section 18.08. Trustee's Relation to Guarantor Senior Debt. The
Trustee and any Paying Agent shall be entitled to all the rights set forth in
this Article XVIII with respect to any Guarantor Senior Debt which may at any
time be held by it in its individual or any other capacity to the same extent as
any other holder of Guarantor Senior Debt, and nothing in this Indenture shall
deprive the Trustee or any Paying Agent of any of its rights as such holder.

            With respect to the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt, the Trustee
undertakes to perform or to observe only such of its covenants and
obligations as are specifically set forth in this Article XVIII, and no
implied covenants or obligations with respect to the holders of Guarantor
Senior Debt shall be read into this Indenture against the Trustee. The
Trustee shall not be deemed to owe any fiduciary duty to the holders of
Guarantor Senior Debt. The Trustee shall not be liable to any such holders if
the Trustee shall in good faith mistakenly pay over or distribute to holders
of Debentures or to the Company or to any other Person cash, property or
securities to which any holders of Guarantor Senior Debt shall be entitled by
virtue of this Article XVIII or otherwise.

            Section 18.09. Subordination Rights Not Impaired by Acts or
Omissions of the Guarantors or Holders of Guarantor Senior Debt. No right of any
present or future holders of any Guarantor Senior Debt to enforce subordination
as provided herein shall at any time in any way be prejudiced or impaired by any
act or failure to act on the part of any Guarantor or by any act or failure to
act, in good faith, by any such holder, or by any noncompliance by any Guarantor
with the terms of this Indenture, regardless of any knowledge thereof which any
such holder may have or otherwise be charged with. The provisions of this
Article XVIII are intended to be for the benefit of, and shall be enforceable
directly by, the holders of Guarantor Senior Debt.

            Section 18.10. Debentureholders Authorize Trustee to Effectuate
Subordination of Guarantees. Each holder of Debentures by its acceptance of such
Debentures authorizes and expressly directs the Trustee on its behalf to take
such action as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the subordination
provided in this Article XVIII, and appoints the Trustee its attorney-in-fact
for such purposes, including, in the event of any dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization of any Guarantor (whether in bankruptcy,
insolvency, receivership, reorganization or similar proceedings or upon an
assignment for the benefit of creditors or otherwise) tending towards
liquidation of the business and assets of such Guarantor, the filing of a claim
for the unpaid balance of its Debentures in the form required in those
proceedings.

            Section 18.11. This Article Not to Prevent Events of Default. The
failure to make a payment on account of principal of or Interest or any
Settlement Amount on the Debentures by reason of any provision of this Article
XVIII shall not be construed as preventing the occurrence of an Event of Default
specified in Section 7.01.

            Section 18.12. Trustee's Compensation Not Prejudiced. Nothing in
this Article XVIII shall apply to amounts due to the Trustee pursuant to other
sections in this Indenture.

<PAGE>

            Section 18.13. No Waiver of Guarantee Subordination Provisions.
Without in any way limiting the generality of Section 18.09, the holders of
Guarantor Senior Debt may, at any time and from time to time, without the
consent of or notice to the Trustee or the holders of the Debentures, without
incurring responsibility to the holders of the Debentures and without impairing
or releasing the subordination provided in this Article XVIII or the obligations
hereunder of the holders of the Debentures to the holders of Guarantor Senior
Debt, do any one or more of the following: (a) change the manner, place or terms
of payment or extend the time of payment of, or renew or alter, Guarantor Senior
Debt or any instrument evidencing the same or any agreement under which
Guarantor Senior Debt is outstanding or secured; (b) sell, exchange, release or
otherwise deal with any property pledged, mortgaged or otherwise securing
Guarantor Senior Debt; (c) release any Person liable in any manner for the
collection of Guarantor Senior Debt; and (d) exercise or refrain from exercising
any rights against the Guarantor and any other Person.

            Section 18.14. Payments May be Paid Prior to Dissolution. Nothing
contained in this Article XVIII or elsewhere in this Indenture shall prevent (i)
the Guarantors, except under the conditions described in Section 18.02, from
making payments of principal of and Interest on, and the cash portion of all
Settlement Amounts upon conversion of, the Debentures, or from depositing with
the Trustee any moneys for such payments or (ii) the application by the Trustee
of any moneys deposited with it for the purpose of making such payments of
principal of and Interest on, and the cash portion of all Settlement Amounts
upon conversion of, the Debentures, to the holders entitled thereto unless at
least two Business Days prior to the date upon which such payment becomes due
and payable or is otherwise required, the Trustee shall have received the
written notice provided for in Section 18.02(b) or in Section 18.06. The Company
shall give prompt written notice to the Trustee of any dissolution, winding-up,
liquidation or reorganization of any Guarantor.

appears on the Debenture Register and shall be sufficiently given to him if
so mailed within the time prescribed.

            Failure to mail a notice or communication to a Debentureholder or
any defect in it shall not affect its sufficiency with respect to other
Debentureholders.  If a notice or communication is mailed in the manner

            Section 19.04. Governing Law. THIS INDENTURE AND THE DEBENTURES WILL

maturity of Interest on or principal of the Debentures or the Redemption Date of
any Debenture or any Repurchase Date with respect to any Debenture or any other

Act, nor shall it constitute any admission or acknowledgment by any party to the
Indenture that any such qualification is required prior to the time such
qualification is in fact required under the terms of the Trust Indenture Act. If
any provision hereof limits, qualifies or conflicts with another provision
hereof which is required to be included in an indenture qualified under the
Trust Indenture Act, such required provision shall control. If any provision of
this Indenture modifies or excludes any provision of the Trust Indenture Act
that may be so modified or excluded, the latter provision shall be deemed to
apply to this Indenture as so modified or excluded, as the case may be.

            0.75% CONVERTIBLE SENIOR SUBORDINATED DEBENTURE DUE 2024

            This Debenture is one of a duly authorized issue of Debentures of
the Company, designated as its 0.75% Convertible Senior Subordinated
Debentures due 2024 (herein called the "Debentures"), limited in aggregate

of the Debentures exercise in full their option to purchase additional
Debentures), issued and to be issued under and pursuant to an Indenture dated
as of December 23, 2004 (herein called the "Indenture"), among the Company,
the Guarantors and Wells Fargo Bank, National Association, as trustee (herein
called the "Trustee"), to which Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a description of the rights, limitations
of rights, obligations, duties and immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the
Company, the Guarantors and the holders of the Debentures.

            The payment by the Company of the principal of and Interest on,
as well as the payment of cash due upon conversion of, the Debentures is
fully and unconditionally guaranteed on a joint and several senior
subordinated basis by each Guarantor that is a party to the Indenture and,
subject to certain exceptions, may become guaranteed by any Subsidiary of the
Company that guarantees or otherwise incurs Qualified Indebtedness (as
defined in, and to the extent set forth in, the Indenture). Upon discharge of
all such Qualified Indebtedness of a Guarantor, or the discharge of all
guarantees by such Guarantor of Qualified Indebtedness of the Company and its

            The Debentures are subordinated to Senior Debt of the Company and

conditions set forth in the Indenture.  To the extent provided in the
Indenture, Senior Debt and Guarantor Senior Debt must be paid before the
Debentures may be paid (including payments in respect of the cash required to

Trustee to give it effect and appoints the Trustee as attorney-in-fact for
such purpose.

            In case an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, the principal of and accrued Interest on all Debentures may be
declared to be by either the Trustee or the holders of not less than 25% in
aggregate principal amount of the Debentures then outstanding, and upon said
declaration shall become, due and payable immediately, in the manner, with
the effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

waiver by the holder of this Debenture (unless revoked as provided in the
Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder and upon all
future holders and owners of this Debenture and any Debentures which may be
issued in exchange or substitution hereof, irrespective of whether or not any
notation thereof is made upon this Debenture or such other Debentures.

            No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this
Debenture or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligations of the
Company or the Guarantors, which are absolute and unconditional, to pay the
principal of and Interest on this Debenture at the place, at the respective
times, at the rate and in the coin or currency herein prescribed.

            Interest on the Debentures shall be computed on the basis of a
360-day year of twelve 30-day months.

            The Debentures are issuable in fully registered form, without
interest coupons, in denominations of $1,000 principal amount and any
multiple of $1,000.  At the office or agency of the Company maintained for
such purpose, and in the manner and subject to the limitations provided in
the Indenture, without payment of any service charge but with payment of a
sum sufficient to cover any tax, assessment or other governmental charge that
may be imposed in connection with any registration or exchange of Debentures,
Debentures may be exchanged for a like aggregate principal amount of
Debentures of any other authorized denominations.

            At any time on or after June 1, 2010, the Debentures may be
redeemed at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, in cash upon
mailing a notice of such redemption not less than 30 days but not more than
60 days before the Redemption Date to the holders of Debentures at their last
registered addresses as set forth in the Debenture Register, all as provided
in the Indenture, at a Redemption Price equal to 100% of the principal amount
of Debentures being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid Interest to, but
excluding, the Redemption Date; provided that if the applicable Redemption
Date is after a Regular Record Date and on or prior to the corresponding
Interest Payment Date, the Interest payable on such Interest Payment Date
shall be paid on the Redemption Date to the holder of record on the
applicable Regular Record Date.

                                      A-7
<PAGE>

            The Debentures will not be redeemable at the option of the
Company before June 1, 2010, except that the Company may require holders to
dispose of Debentures or, if not so disposed, may redeem such holders'
Debentures in order to comply with applicable gaming laws as set forth in
Article IV of the Indenture.

            The Company may not give notice of any redemption of the
Debentures if a default in the payment of Interest on the Debentures has
occurred and is continuing.

            The Debentures are not subject to redemption through the
operation of any sinking fund.

            If a Fundamental Change occurs at any time prior to maturity of
the Debentures, the holders will have the right to require the Company to
repurchase all or any portion of the Debentures on a Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date specified by the Company, which shall be no later than
35 days after notice thereof, at a Fundamental Change Repurchase Price equal
to 100% of the principal amount thereof, together with accrued Interest to
(but excluding) the Fundamental Change Repurchase Date; provided that if the
applicable Fundamental Change Repurchase Date is after a Regular Record Date
and on or prior to the corresponding Interest Payment Date, the Interest
payable on such Interest Payment Date shall be paid on such Interest Payment
Date to the holders of record of such Debentures on the Regular Record Date
instead of the holders surrendering such Debentures for repurchase on such
date.  The Company shall mail to all holders of record of the Debentures a
notice of the occurrence of a Fundamental Change and of the repurchase right
arising as a result thereof on or before the 30th day after the occurrence of
such Fundamental Change.  For a Debenture to be so repurchased at the option
of the holder, the Company must receive at the office or agency of the
Company maintained for that purpose in accordance with the terms of the
Indenture, the form entitled "Form of Fundamental Change Repurchase Election"
on the reverse of the Debenture duly completed at any time prior to the close
of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Fundamental Change
Repurchase Date, and such Debenture, duly endorsed for transfer (or if such
Debenture is a Global Debenture, book-entry transfer of such Debenture), as
set forth in the Indenture.

            Subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture, the holders
will have the right to require the Company to repurchase all or any portion
of the Debentures on June 1, 2010, December 1, 2014 and December 1, 2019 at a
Company Repurchase Price of 100% of the principal amount, plus any accrued
and unpaid Interest on such Debentures to, but excluding, the Company
Repurchase Date; provided that the Interest payable on the applicable Company
Repurchase Date shall be paid on such Interest Payment Date to the holders of
record of such Debentures on the Regular Record Date instead of the holders
surrendering such Debentures for repurchase on such date.  To exercise such
right, a holder must deliver to the Company the form entitled "Form of
Company Repurchase Election" on the reverse of the Debenture duly completed
at any time from the opening of business on the date that is 22 Business Days
prior to such Company Repurchase Date until the close of business on the date
that is two Business Days prior to the Company Repurchase Date, and such
Debenture, duly endorsed for

                                      A-8
<PAGE>

transfer (or if such Debenture is a Global Debenture, book-entry transfer of
such Debenture), as set forth in the Indenture.

            The Company Repurchase Price to be paid on any of June 1, 2010,
December 1, 2014 and December 1, 2019 and the Fundamental Change Repurchase
Price to be paid on any Fundamental Change Repurchase Date shall be paid in
cash, subject to the terms and conditions of the Indenture.

            Holders have the right to withdraw any Repurchase Election by
delivering to the Paying Agent a written notice of withdrawal up to the close
of business on the Business Day immediately preceding the Repurchase Date,
all as provided in the Indenture.

            If money sufficient to pay the Repurchase Price with respect to
all Debentures or portions thereof to be repurchased as of any Repurchase
Date is deposited with the Paying Agent, then on and after such Repurchase
Date (provided that payment therefrom is not prohibited by Article XVI or
XVIII of the Indenture), Interest will cease to accrue on such Debentures (or
portions thereof), and the holder thereof shall have no other rights as such
other than the right to receive the Repurchase Price upon surrender of such
Debenture.

            Subject to the occurrence of certain events and in compliance
with the provisions of the Indenture, prior to the Stated Maturity of the
Debentures, the holder hereof has the right, at its option, to convert each
$1,000 principal amount of the Debentures into 34.3643 shares of the
Company's Common Stock (equivalent to a Conversion Price of approximately
$29.10 per share), as such shares shall be constituted at the date of
conversion, to be settled in cash or a combination of cash and shares of
Common Stock, as described in the Indenture, and subject to adjustment from
time to time as provided in the Indenture, upon surrender of this Debenture
(if certificated) with the form entitled "Form of Conversion Notice" on the
reverse hereof duly completed and manually signed, to the Company at the
office or agency of the Conversion Agent, together with any funds required
pursuant to the Indenture, and, unless the shares issuable on conversion are
to be issued in the same name as this Debenture, duly endorsed by, or
accompanied by instruments of transfer in form satisfactory to the Company
duly executed by, the holder or by his duly authorized attorney.  The Company
will notify the holder thereof of any event triggering the right to convert
the Debentures as specified above in accordance with the Indenture.  In order
to exercise the conversion right with respect to any interest in a Global
Debenture, the holder must complete the appropriate instruction form pursuant
to the Depositary's book-entry conversion program, deliver by book-entry
delivery an interest in such Global Debenture, furnish appropriate
endorsements and transfer documents if required pursuant to the terms of the
Indenture.  Upon conversion, the Company will deliver cash equal to the
lesser of the aggregate principal amount of Debentures being converted and
the Conversion Value, and shares of Common Stock in respect of the remainder,
if any, of the Conversion Value.

                                      A-9
<PAGE>

            If the Company (i) is a party to a consolidation, merger,
statutory share exchange or combination, (ii) reclassifies the Common Stock,
or (iii) sells or conveys its properties and assets substantially as an
entirety to any Person, the right to convert a Debenture into shares of
Common Stock may be changed into a right to convert it into the kind or
amount of cash, securities or other property receivable upon such event, in
each case in accordance with the Indenture.

      In addition, following certain transactions described in the Indenture
(subject to the requirements of Section 15.01(d) of the Indenture) that occur
prior to June 1, 2010 that constitute certain types of Fundamental Changes, a
holder who elects to convert its Debentures in connection with such
transaction will be entitled to receive Additional Common Stock upon
conversion. In certain circumstances involving the acquisition of the Company
by a public acquirer, the Company may elect, in lieu of issuing Additional
Common Stock, to provide for the conversion of the Debentures into shares of
the public acquirer as set forth in Section 15.12 of the Indenture.

            No adjustment in respect of Interest on any Debenture converted
or dividends on any shares issued upon conversion of such Debenture will be
made upon any conversion except as set forth in the next sentence.  If this
Debenture (or portion hereof) is surrendered for conversion during the period
from the close of business on any Regular Record Date for the payment of
Interest to the opening of business on the immediately following Interest
Payment Date, this Debenture (or portion hereof being converted) must be
accompanied by payment, in immediately available funds or other funds
acceptable to the Company, of an amount equal to the Interest otherwise
payable on such Interest Payment Date on the principal amount being
converted; provided that no such payment shall be required (1) if the Company
has specified a Redemption Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on or
prior to the next Interest Payment Date, (2) if the Company has specified a
Fundamental Change Repurchase Date that is after a Regular Record Date and on
or prior to the next Interest Payment Date or (3) to the extent of any
overdue Interest, if any overdue Interest exists at the time of conversion
with respect to such Debenture.

            No fractional shares will be issued upon any conversion, but an
adjustment and payment in cash will be made, as provided in the Indenture, in
respect of any fraction of a share which would otherwise be issuable upon the
surrender of any Debenture or Debentures for conversion.

            A Debenture in respect of which a holder is exercising its right
to require repurchase upon a Fundamental Change or repurchase on a Repurchase
Date may be converted only if such holder withdraws its election to exercise
such right in accordance with the terms of the Indenture.

            The Company, the Guarantors, the Trustee, any Paying Agent, any
Conversion Agent and any Debenture Registrar may deem and treat the
registered holder hereof as the absolute owner of this Debenture (whether or
not this Debenture shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of
ownership or other writing hereon made by

                                      A-10
<PAGE>

anyone other than the Company or any Debenture Registrar) for the purpose of
receiving payment hereof, or on account hereof, for the conversion hereof and
for all other purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Paying
Agent nor other Conversion Agent nor any Debenture Registrar shall be affected
by any notice to the contrary. All payments made to or upon the order of such
registered holder shall, to the extent of the sum or sums paid, satisfy and
discharge liability for monies payable on this Debenture.

            No recourse for the payment of the principal of or Interest on
this Debenture, or for any claim based hereon or otherwise in respect hereof,
and no recourse under or upon any obligation, covenant or agreement of the
Company or the Guarantors in the Indenture or any supplemental indenture or
in any Debenture, or because of the creation of any indebtedness represented
thereby, shall be had against any incorporator, stockholder, employee, agent,
officer or director or subsidiary, as such, past, present or future, of the
Company, any Guarantor or of any successor Person, either directly or through
the Company or any successor Person, whether by virtue of any constitution,
statute or rule of law or by the enforcement of any assessment or penalty or
otherwise, all such liability being, by acceptance hereof and as part of the
consideration for the issue hereof, expressly waived and released.

            Terms used in this Debenture and defined in the Indenture are
used herein as therein defined.

Re: Warrants


      The purpose of this letter agreement is to confirm the terms and
conditions of the Warrants issued by Scientific Games Corporation (the
"Company") to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch ("JPMorgan") on the Trade
Date specified below (the "Transaction"). This letter agreement constitutes a
"Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below. This
Confirmation shall replace any previous letter and serve as the final
documentation for this Transaction.

      The definitions and provisions contained in the 1996 ISDA Equity
Derivatives Definitions (the "Equity Definitions"), as published by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., are incorporated into
this Confirmation. In the event of any inconsistency between the Equity
Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation shall govern. This
Transaction shall be deemed to be a Share Option Transaction within the meaning
set forth in the Equity Definitions.

      Each party is hereby advised, and each such party acknowledges, that the
other party has engaged in, or refrained from engaging in, substantial financial
transactions and has taken other material actions in reliance upon the parties'
entry into the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates on the terms and
conditions set forth below.

1.    This Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between
      JPMorgan and the Company as to the terms of the Transaction to which this
      Confirmation relates. This Confirmation shall supplement, form a part of,
      and be subject to an agreement in the form of the 2002 ISDA Master
      Agreement (the "Agreement") as if JPMorgan and the Company had executed an
      agreement in such form (but without any Schedule except for the election
      of the laws of the State of New York as the governing law and United
      States dollars as the Termination Currency) on the Trade Date. In the
      event of any inconsistency between provisions of that Agreement and this
      Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the
      Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. The parties hereby agree
      that no Transaction other than the Transaction to which this Confirmation
      relates shall be governed by the Agreement.

                                  Settlement Date divided by the Settlement

                                  amount equal to the excess of such Settlement

                                  (b) If such Settlement Price is less than or
                                  equal to the Strike Price, zero.

                                  price per Share quoted by the Exchange (or, if

                                  subject to Section 9(o)(i) hereof.

                                  and 6.10 of the Equity Definitions will be
                                  applicable, except that all references in such

            (a "Material Adverse Effect").

(b)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that the

            Confirmation has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
            Company and constitutes its valid and binding obligation,
            enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
            subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,

            or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its

            the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject; or (iii) in
            violation of any applicable law or statute or any judgment, order,
            rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator or governmental or

            its subsidiaries or any of their properties, as applicable, except,
            in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any such default or
            violation that would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
            Material Adverse Effect.

(d)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that the
            execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
            Confirmation and compliance by the Company with the terms hereof and
            the consummation of the Transaction will not (i) conflict with or
            result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or provisions
            of, or constitute a default under, or result in the creation or
            imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any property or
            assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries pursuant to, any
            indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement (including but
            not limited to the Credit Agreement dated as of December 23, 2004
            among the Counterparty, as borrower, the several lenders from time
            to time thereto and JPMorgan, as administrative agent) or other
            agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its
            subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
            subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of
            the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, (ii) result in
            any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws or similar
            organizational documents of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
            or (iii) result in the violation of any applicable law or statute or
            any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator
            or governmental or regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the
            Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of their properties, as
            applicable, except, in the case of clauses (i) and (iii) above, for
            any such conflict, breach or violation that would not, individually
            or in the aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

(e)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that the
            Shares of the Company initially issuable upon exercise of the
            Warrant by the net share settlement method (the "Warrant Shares")
            have been reserved for issuance by all required corporate action of
            the Company. The Warrant Shares have been duly authorized and, when
            delivered against payment therefor (which may include Net Share
            Settlement in lieu of cash) and otherwise as contemplated by the
            terms of the Warrant following the exercise of the Warrant in
            accordance with the terms and conditions of

                                       6
<PAGE>

            the Warrant, will be validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable,
            and the issuance of the Warrant Shares will not be subject to any
            preemptive or similar rights.

(f)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that except
            as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Company's Annual
            Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003 (the
            "Company's 10-K"), as updated by any subsequent filings, there are
            no legal, governmental or regulatory investigations, actions, suits
            or proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its
            subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the
            Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be the subject that,
            individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to the
            Company or any of its subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to
            have a Material Adverse Effect; and no such investigations, actions,
            suits or proceedings are threatened or, to the knowledge of the
            Company, are contemplated by any governmental or regulatory
            authority or threatened in writing by others.

(g)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that the
            Company's 10-K, as updated by any subsequent filings, does not, as
            of the Trade Date, contain an untrue statement of a material fact or
            omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
            necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
            the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

(h)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that it is an
            "eligible contract participant" (as such term is defined in Section
            1(a)(12) of the Commodity Exchange Act, as amended (the "CEA")
            because one or more of the following is true:

            The Company is a corporation, partnership, proprietorship,
            organization, trust or other entity and:

            (A)   the Company has total assets in excess of USD 10,000,000;

            (B)   the obligations of Company hereunder are guaranteed, or
                  otherwise supported by a letter of credit or keepwell, support
                  or other agreement, by an entity of the type described in
                  Section 1a(12)(A)(i) through (iv), 1a(12)(A)(v)(I),
                  1a(12)(A)(vii) or 1a(12)(C) of the CEA; or

            (C)   the Company has a net worth in excess of USD 1,000,000 and has
                  entered into this Agreement in connection with the conduct of
                  Company's business or to manage the risk associated with an
                  asset or liability owned or incurred or reasonably likely to
                  be owned or incurred by Company in the conduct of Company's
                  business.

(i)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that neither
            the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is an "investment company"
            or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within the
            meaning of the Investment Company Act of 1940, as amended, and the
            rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.

(j)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that the
            Company and its subsidiaries possess all licenses, certificates,
            permits and other authorizations issued by, and have made all
            declarations and filings with, the appropriate federal, state, local
            or foreign governmental or regulatory authorities that are necessary
            for the ownership or lease of their respective properties or the
            conduct of their respective businesses as described in the Company's
            10-K, as updated by any subsequent filings, except where the failure
            to possess or make the same would not, individually or in the
            aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; and except as described
            in the Company's 10-K, as updated by any subsequent filings, neither
            the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has received written notice
            of any revocation or modification of any such license, certificate,
            permit or authorization or has any reason to believe that any such
            license, certificate, permit or authorization will not be renewed in
            the ordinary course.

(k)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to JPMorgan that no
            order, consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of,
            or filing, recording, qualification or registration with, or
            exemption or waiver by, any governmental authority or other person
            with responsibility for regulating gaming laws having jurisdiction
            over the Company or its subsidiaries, is required for the execution,
            delivery and performance by the Company of this Confirmation, other
            than the Order of the West Virginia State Lottery Commission dated
            and obtained December 7, 2004 and a waiver by the New Jersey Casino
            Control Commission (the "New Jersey Commission") of the requirement
            that JPMorgan satisfy the applicable qualification provisions of the
            New Jersey Casino Control Act and the regulations promulgated
            thereunder by the New Jersey Commission; further, subject to
            compliance with the requirements described above, the execution,
            delivery and performance of this Confirmation does not and will not
            result in a violation in any material respect of any gaming law or
            regulation.

(l)         The Company represents and warrants to JPMorgan that each of it and
            its affiliates is not, on the date hereof, in possession of any
            material non-public information with respect to Company.

(m)         The Company shall deliver an opinion of counsel, dated as of the
            Trade Date, to JPMorgan in the forms attached as Exhibit A, Exhibit
            B and Exhibit C.

(n)         If the Initial Purchasers party to the Purchase Agreement among the
            Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Bear, Stearns & Co., as
            representatives of the Initial Purchasers, dated as of December 1,
            2004, relating to the purchase of the Convertible Notes exercise
            their right to receive additional Convertible Notes pursuant to the
            Initial Purchasers' option to purchase additional Convertible Notes,
            then, at the discretion of the Company, JPMorgan and the Company
            will amend this Confirmation (substantially in the form attached as
            Exhibit D to this Confirmation) to provide for such increase in
            Convertible Notes (such amendment to this Confirmation to provide
            for the payment by the Company to JPMorgan of the additional premium
            related thereto).

9.          Other Provisions:

(a)         No Reliance, etc. Each party represents that (i) it is entering into
            the Transaction evidenced hereby as principal (and not as agent or
            in any other capacity); (ii) neither the other party or parties nor
            any of its or their agents are acting as a fiduciary for it; (iii)
            it is not relying upon any representations except those expressly
            set forth in the Agreement or this Confirmation; (iv) it has not
            relied on the other party or parties for any legal, regulatory, tax,
            business, investment, financial, and accounting advice, and it has
            made its own investment, hedging, and trading decisions based upon
            its own judgment and not upon any view expressed by the other party
            or parties or any of its or their agents; and (v) it is entering
            into this Transaction with a full understanding of the terms,
            conditions and risks thereof and it is capable of and willing to
            assume those risks.

(b)         Share De-listing Event. If at any time during the period from and
            including the Trade Date, to and including the final Valuation Date,
            the Shares cease to be listed or quoted on the Exchange for any
            reason (other than a Merger Event as a result of which all of the
            property underlying the Options consists of shares of common stock
            that are listed or quoted on The New York Stock Exchange, The
            American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System (or
            their respective successors) (the "Successor Exchange")) and are not
            immediately re-listed or quoted as of the date of such de-listing on
            the Successor Exchange, then Cancellation and Payment (as defined in
            Section 9.6 of the Equity Definitions treating the "Announcement
            Date" as the date of first public announcement that the Share
            De-Listing will occur and the "Merger Date" as the date of the Share
            De-Listing) shall apply, and the date of the de-listing shall be
            deemed the date of termination for purposes of calculating any
            payment due from one party to any of the others in connection with
            the cancellation of this Transaction. If the Shares are immediately
            re-listed on a Successor Exchange upon their de-listing from the
            Exchange, this Transaction shall continue in full force and effect,
            provided that the Successor Exchange shall be deemed to be the
            Exchange for

                                       8
<PAGE>

            all purposes hereunder. In addition, the Calculation Agent shall
            make any adjustments it deems necessary to the terms of the
            Transaction in accordance with Calculation Agent Adjustment method
            as defined under Section 9.1(c) of the Equity Definitions.

(c)         Repurchase Notices. Company shall, on any day on which Company
            effects any repurchase of Shares, promptly give JPMorgan a written
            notice of such repurchase (a "Repurchase Notice") on such day if
            following such repurchase, the Warrants Equity Percentage as
            determined on such day is (i) equal to or greater than 7.5% and (ii)
            greater by 0.5% than the Warrants Equity Percentage included in the
            immediately preceding Repurchase Notice (or, in the case of the
            first such Repurchase Notice, greater than the Warrants Equity
            Percentage as of the date hereof). The "Warrants Equity Percentage"
            as of any day is the fraction (A) the numerator of which is the
            product of the Number of Warrants and the Warrant Entitlement and
            (B) the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on
            such day. Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless JPMorgan and
            its affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees,
            affiliates, advisors, agents and controlling persons (each, an
            "Indemnified Person") from and against any and all losses (including
            losses relating to JPMorgan's hedging activities as a consequence of
            becoming, or of the risk of becoming, a Section 16 "insider",
            including without limitation, any forbearance from hedging
            activities or cessation of hedging activities and any losses in
            connection therewith with respect to this Transaction), claims,
            damages, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
            attorney's fees), joint or several, which an Indemnified Person
            actually may become subject to, a result of Company's failure to
            provide JPMorgan with a Repurchase Notice on the day and in the
            manner specified in this Section 9(c), and to reimburse, within 30
            days, upon written request, each of such Indemnified Persons for any
            reasonable legal or other expenses incurred in connection with
            investigating, preparing for, providing testimony or other evidence
            in connection with or defending any of the foregoing. If any suit,
            action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory
            investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against
            the Indemnified Person, such Indemnified Person shall promptly
            notify the Company in writing, and the Company, upon request of the
            Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
            the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any
            others the Company may designate in such proceeding and shall pay
            the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding.
            Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
            effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
            consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Company
            agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss
            or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Company shall
            not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person,
            effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in
            respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a
            party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
            Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
            release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that
            are the subject matter of such proceeding on terms reasonably
            satisfactory to such Indemnified Person. If the indemnification
            provided for in this paragraph (c) is unavailable to an Indemnified
            Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
            liabilities referred to therein, then Company under such paragraph,
            in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall
            contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person
            as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities. The
            remedies provided for in this paragraph (c) are not exclusive and
            shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
            available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. The
            indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this paragraph
            (c) shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
            of the termination of this Transaction.

(d)         Regulation M. The Company was not on the Trade Date and is not on
            the date hereof engaged in a distribution, as such term is used in
            Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
            ("Exchange Act"), of any securities of Company, other than a
            distribution of securities meeting the requirements of the exception
            set forth in sections 101(b)(10) and 102(b)(7) of Regulation M. The
            Company shall not, until the fifth Exchange Business Day immediately
            following the Trade Date, engage in any such distribution.


                                       9
<PAGE>

(e)         No Manipulation. The Company is not entering into this Transaction
            to create actual or apparent trading activity in the Shares (or any
            security convertible into or exchangeable for the Shares) or to
            raise or depress or otherwise manipulate the price of the Shares (or
            any security convertible into or exchangeable for the Shares).

(f)         Board Authorization. Company represents that it is entering into the
            Transaction, solely for the purposes stated in the board resolution
            authorizing this Transaction and in its public disclosure. Company
            further represents that there is no internal policy, whether written
            or oral, of Company that would prohibit Company from entering into
            any aspect of this Transaction, including, but not limited to, the
            purchases of Shares to be made pursuant hereto.

(g)         Transfer or Assignment. Company may not transfer any of its rights
            or obligations under this Transaction without the prior written
            consent of JPMorgan. JPMorgan may transfer or assign all or any
            portion of its rights or obligations under this Transaction without
            consent of the Company. If JPMorgan, in its sole discretion,
            determines that its "beneficial ownership" (within the meaning of
            Section 16 of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated thereunder)
            exceeds 8% or more of the Company's outstanding Shares and, in its
            sole discretion, JPMorgan is unable after its commercially
            reasonable efforts to effect a transfer or assignment on pricing
            terms and in a time period reasonably acceptable to JPMorgan that
            would reduce its "beneficial ownership" to 7.5%, JPMorgan may
            designate any Exchange Business Day as an Early Termination Date
            with respect to a portion (the "Terminated Portion") of this
            Transaction, such that the its "beneficial ownership" following such
            partial termination will be equal to or less than 8%. In the event
            that JPMorgan so designates an Early Termination Date with respect
            to a portion of this Transaction, a payment shall be made pursuant
            to Section 6 of the Agreement as if (i) an Early Termination Date
            had been designated in respect of a Transaction having terms
            identical to this Transaction and a Number of Warrants equal to the
            Terminated Portion, (ii) the Company and JPMorgan shall both be
            Affected Parties with respect to such partial termination and (iii)
            such Transaction shall be the only Terminated Transaction. For the
            avoidance of doubt, if JPMorgan assigns or terminates any Warrants
            hereunder, each Daily Number of Warrants not previously settled
            shall be reduced proportionally, as calculated by the Calculation
            Agent. Notwithstanding any other provision in this Confirmation to
            the contrary requiring or allowing JPMorgan to purchase, sell,
            receive or deliver any shares or other securities to or from
            Company, JPMorgan may designate any of its affiliates to purchase,
            sell, receive or deliver such shares or other securities and
            otherwise to perform JPMorgan's obligations in respect of this
            Transaction and any such designee may assume such obligations.
            JPMorgan shall be discharged of its obligations to Company to the
            extent of any such performance.

(h)         Amendment. Paragraph (i) of Section 9.7(b) of the Equity Definitions
            is hereby amended for purposes of this Transaction by replacing
            "two-year" with "90 calendar day".

(i)         Damages. Neither party shall be liable under Section 6.10 of the
            Equity Definitions for special, indirect or consequential damages,
            even if informed of the possibility thereof.

(j)         Dividends. If at any time during the period from and including the
            Trade Date, to but excluding the Expiration Date, an ex-dividend
            date for a cash dividend occurs with respect to the Shares (an
            "Ex-Dividend Date"), and that dividend is greater than the Regular
            Dividend on a per Share basis then the Calculation Agent will adjust
            the Strike Price to preserve the fair value of the Warrant to
            JPMorgan after taking into account such dividend. "Regular Dividend"
            shall mean USD 0.00 per Share per quarter.

(k)         Role of Agent. Each party agrees and acknowledges that (i) J.P.
            Morgan Securities Inc., an affiliate of JPMorgan ("JPMSI"), has
            acted solely as agent and not as principal with respect to this

                                           Date") when the Payment Obligation
                                           would otherwise be due, subject to
                                           paragraph (o)(i) below, in
                                           satisfaction, subject to paragraph

            Share Termination Delivery     A number of Share Termination
            Property:                      Delivery Units, as calculated by the
                                           Calculation Agent, equal to the
                                           Payment Obligation divided by the
                                           Share Termination Unit Price. The
                                           Calculation Agent shall adjust the
                                           Share Termination Delivery Property
                                           by replacing any fractional portion
                                           of a security therein with an amount
                                           of cash equal to the value of such
                                           fractional security based on the
                                           values used to calculate the Share
                                           Termination Unit Price.

            Share Termination Unit Price:  The value to JPMorgan of property

                                           Termination Delivery Units are to be
                                           delivered as Share Termination
                                           Delivery Property, as determined by

                                           Obligation. In the case of a Private
                                           Placement of Share Termination

                                           applicable to such Share Termination
                                           Delivery Units. In the case of a

                                           on the Merger Date, the date of the
                                           occurrence of the Nationalization or

                                           the number or amount of each type of
                                           property received by a holder of one
                                           Share (without consideration of any
                                           requirement to pay cash or other
                                           consideration in lieu of fractional
                                           amounts of any securities) in such
                                           Nationalization or Insolvency or such
                                           Merger Event. If a Share Termination
                                           Delivery Unit consists of property
                                           other than cash or New Shares, the
                                           Calculation Agent will replace such
                                           property with cash, New Shares or a
                                           combination thereof as components of
                                           a Share Termination Delivery Unit in
                                           such amounts, as determined by the
                                           Calculation Agent in its discretion
                                           by commercially reasonable means, as
                                           shall have a value equal to the value
                                           of the property so replaced. If such
                                           Merger Event involves a choice of
                                           consideration to be received by
                                           holders, such holder shall be deemed
                                           to have elected to receive the
                                           maximum possible amount of cash.

            Other applicable provisions:   If this Transaction is to be Share
                                           Termination Settled, the provisions
                                           of Sections 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9 and
                                           6.10 (as modified above) of the
                                           Equity Definitions will be
                                           applicable, except that all
                                           references in such provisions to
                                           "Physically-Settled" shall be read as
                                           references to "Share Termination
                                           Settled" and all references to
                                           "Shares" shall be read as references
                                           to "Share Termination Delivery
                                           Units". "Share Termination Settled"
                                           in relation to this Transaction means
                                           that Share Termination Settlement is
                                           applicable to this Transaction.

(o)         Registration/Private Placement Procedures. If, in the reasonable
            opinion of JPMorgan, following any delivery of Shares or Share
            Termination Delivery Property to JPMorgan hereunder, such Shares or
            Share Termination Delivery Property would be in the hands of
            JPMorgan subject to any applicable restrictions with respect to any
            registration or qualification requirement or prospectus delivery
            requirement for such Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property
            pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities law
            (including, without limitation, any such requirement arising under
            Section 5 of the Securities Act as a result of such Shares or Share
            Termination Delivery Property being "restricted securities", as such
            term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or as a result
            of the sale of such Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property
            being subject to paragraph (c) of Rule 145 under the Securities Act)
            (such Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property, "Restricted
            Shares"), then delivery of such Restricted Shares shall be effected
            pursuant to either clause (i) or (ii) below at the election of
            Company, unless waived by JPMorgan. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
            solely in respect of any Daily Number of Warrants exercised or
            deemed exercised on any Expiration Date, the Company shall elect,
            prior to the first Settlement Date for the first Expiration Date, a
            Private Placement Settlement or Registered Settlement for all
            deliveries of Restricted Shares for all such Expiration Dates which
            election shall be applicable to all Settlement Dates for such Daily
            Number of Warrants and the procedures in clause (i) or clause (ii)
            below shall apply for all such delivered Restricted Shares on an
            aggregate basis commencing after the final Settlement Date for such
            Daily Number of Warrants. The Calculation Agent shall make
            reasonable adjustments to settlement terms and provisions under this
            Confirmation to reflect a single Private Placement or Registered
            Settlement for such aggregate Restricted Shares delivered hereunder.

             (i)   If the Company elects to settle the Transaction pursuant to
                   this clause (i) (a "Private Placement Settlement"), then
                   delivery of Restricted Shares by the Company shall be
                   effected in customary private placement procedures with
                   respect to such Restricted Shares reasonably acceptable to
                   JPMorgan; provided that the Company may not elect a Private
                   Placement Settlement if, on the date of its election, it has
                   taken, or caused to be taken, any action that would make
                   unavailable either the exemption pursuant to Section 4(2) of
                   the Securities Act for the sale by the Company to JPMorgan
                   (or any affiliate designated by JPMorgan) of the Restricted
                   Shares or the exemption pursuant to Section 4(1) or Section
                   4(3) of the Securities Act for resales of the Restricted
                   Shares by JPMorgan (or any such affiliate of JPMorgan). The
                   Private Placement Settlement of such Restricted Shares shall
                   include customary representations, covenants, blue sky and
                   other governmental filings and/or registrations, indemnities
                   to JPMorgan, due diligence rights (for JPMorgan or any
                   designated buyer of the Restricted Shares by JPMorgan),
                   opinions and certificates, and such other documentation as is
                   customary for private placement agreements, all reasonably
                   acceptable to JPMorgan. In the case of a Private Placement
                   Settlement, JPMorgan shall determine the appropriate discount
                   to the Share Termination Unit Price (in the case of
                   settlement of Share Termination Delivery Units pursuant to
                   paragraph (n) above) or any Settlement Price (in the case of
                   settlement of Shares pursuant to Section 2 above) applicable
                   to such Restricted Shares in a commercially reasonable manner
                   and appropriately adjust the amount of such Restricted Shares
                   to be delivered to JPMorgan hereunder; provided that in no
                   event shall such number be greater than 49,619,010 (the
                   "Maximum Amount"). Notwithstanding the Agreement or this
                   Confirmation, the date of delivery of such Restricted Shares
                   shall be the Exchange Business Day following notice by
                   JPMorgan to the Company, of such applicable discount and the
                   number of Restricted Shares to be delivered pursuant to this
                   clause (i). For the avoidance of doubt, delivery of
                   Restricted Shares shall be due as set forth in the previous
                   sentence and not be due on the Share Termination Payment Date
                   (in the case of settlement of Share Termination Delivery
                   Units pursuant to paragraph (n) above) or on the Settlement
                   Date for such Restricted Shares (in the case of settlement of
                   Shares pursuant to Section 2 above).

                   In the event of a Private Placement, the Net Share Settlement
                   Amount or the Payment Obligation, respectively, shall be
                   deemed to be the Net Share Settlement Amount or the Payment
                   Obligation, respectively, plus an additional amount
                   (determined from time to time by the Calculation Agent in its
                   commercially reasonable judgment) attributable to interest
                   that would be earned on such Net Share Settlement Amount or
                   the Payment Obligation, respectively, (increased on a daily
                   basis to reflect the accrual of such interest and reduced
                   from time to time by the amount of net proceeds received by
                   JPMorgan as provided herein) at a rate equal to the open
                   Federal Funds Rate plus the Spread for the period from, and
                   including, such Settlement Date or the date on which the
                   Payment Obligation is due, respectively, to, but excluding,
                   the related date on which all the Restricted Shares have been
                   sold and calculated on an Actual/360 basis. The foregoing
                   provision shall be without prejudice to JPMorgan's rights
                   under the Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections
                   5 and 6 thereof).

                   As used in this Section 9(o)(i), "Spread" means, with respect
                   to any Net Share Settlement Amount or Payment Obligation,
                   respectively, the credit spread over the applicable overnight
                   rate that would be imposed if JPMorgan were to extend credit
                   to Company in an amount equal to such Net Share Settlement
                   Amount, all as determined by the Calculation Agent using its
                   commercially reasonable judgment as of the related Settlement
                   Date or the date on which the Payment Obligation is due,
                   respectively. Commercial reasonableness shall take into
                   consideration all factors deemed relevant by the Calculation
                   Agent, which are expected to include, among other things, the
                   credit quality of the Company (and any relevant affiliates)
                   in the then-prevailing market and the credit spread of
                   similar companies in the relevant industry and other
                   companies having a substantially similar credit quality.

            (ii)   If the Company elects to settle the Transaction pursuant to
                   this clause (ii) (a "Registration Settlement"), then the
                   Company shall promptly (but in any event no later than the
                   beginning of the Resale Period) file and use its reasonable
                   best efforts to make effective under the Securities Act a
                   registration statement or supplement or amend an outstanding
                   registration statement in form and substance reasonably
                   satisfactory to JPMorgan, to cover the resale of such
                   Restricted Shares in accordance with customary resale
                   registration procedures, including covenants, conditions,
                   representations, underwriting discounts (if applicable),
                   commissions (if applicable), indemnities due diligence
                   rights, opinions and certificates, and such other
                   documentation as is customary for equity resale underwriting
                   agreements, all reasonably acceptable to JPMorgan. If
                   JPMorgan, in its sole reasonable discretion, is not satisfied
                   with such procedures and documentation Private Placement
                   Settlement shall apply. If JPMorgan is satisfied with such
                   procedures and documentation, it shall sell the Restricted
                   Shares pursuant to such registration statement during a
                   period (the "Resale Period") commencing on the Exchange
                   Business Day following delivery of such Restricted Shares
                   (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall be (x) the Share
                   Termination Payment Date in case of settlement of Share
                   Termination Delivery Units pursuant to paragraph (n) above or
                   (y) the Settlement Date in respect of the final Expiration
                   Date for all Daily Number of Warrants) and ending on the
                   earliest of (i) the Exchange Business Day on which JPMorgan
                   completes the sale of all Restricted Shares or, in the case
                   of settlement of Share Termination Delivery Units, a
                   sufficient number of Restricted Shares so that the realized
                   net proceeds of such sales exceed the Payment Obligation (as
                   defined above), (ii) the date upon which all Restricted
                   Shares have been sold or transferred pursuant to Rule 144 (or
                   similar provisions then in force) or Rule 145(d)(1) or (2)
                   (or any similar provision then in force) under the Securities
                   Act and (iii) the date upon which all Restricted Shares may
                   be sold or transferred by a non-affiliate pursuant to Rule
                   144(k) (or any similar provision then in force) or Rule
                   145(d)(3) (or any similar provision then in force) under the
                   Securities Act. If the Payment Obligation exceeds the
                   realized net proceeds from such resale, Company shall
                   transfer to JPMorgan by the open of the regular trading
                   session on the Exchange on the Exchange Trading Day
                   immediately following the last day of the Resale Period the
                   amount of such excess (the "Additional Amount") in cash or in
                   a number of Shares ("Make-whole Shares") in an amount that,
                   based on the Settlement Price on the last day of the Resale
                   Period (as if such day was the "Valuation Date" for purposes
                   of computing such Settlement Price), has a dollar value equal
                   to the Additional Amount. The Resale Period shall continue to
                   enable the sale of the Make-whole Shares. If Company elects
                   to pay the Additional Amount in Shares, the requirements and
                   provisions for Registration Settlement shall apply. This
                   provision shall be applied successively until the Additional
                   Amount is equal to zero. In no event shall the Company
                   deliver a number of Restricted Shares greater than the
                   Maximum Amount.

            (iii)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company
                   agrees that any Restricted Shares delivered to JPMorgan, as
                   purchaser of such Restricted Shares, (i) may be transferred
                   by and among JPMorgan Chase Bank and its affiliates and
                   Company shall effect such transfer without any further action
                   by JPMorgan and (ii) after the minimum "holding period"
                   within the meaning of Rule 144(d) under the Securities Act
                   has elapsed after any Settlement Date for such Restricted
                   Shares, Company shall promptly remove, or cause the transfer
                   agent for such Restricted Shares to remove, any legends
                   referring to any such restrictions or requirements from such
                   Restricted Shares upon delivery by JPMorgan (or such
                   affiliate of JPMorgan) to Company or such transfer agent of
                   seller's and broker's representation letters customarily
                   delivered by JPMorgan in connection with resales of
                   restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 under the
                   Securities Act, without any further requirement for the
                   delivery of any certificate, consent, agreement, opinion of
                   counsel, notice or any other document, any transfer tax
                   stamps or payment of any other amount or any other action by
                   JPMorgan (or such affiliate of JPMorgan).

             If the Private Placement Settlement or the Registration Settlement
             shall not be effected as set forth in clauses (i) or (ii), as
             applicable, then failure to effect such Private Placement
             Settlement or such Registration Settlement shall constitute an
             Event of Default with respect to which Company shall be the
             Defaulting Party.

(p)          Limit on Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding any other provisions
             hereof, JPMorgan may not exercise any Warrant hereunder, and
             Automatic Exercise shall not apply with respect thereto, to the
             extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would result in
             JPMorgan directly or indirectly beneficially owning (as such term
             is defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act) at
             any time in excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares. Any purported
             delivery hereunder shall be void and have no effect to the extent
             (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result in
             JPMorgan directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of
             9.0% of the outstanding Shares. If any delivery owed to JPMorgan
             hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a result of this
             provision, the Company's obligation to make such delivery shall not
             be extinguished and the Company shall make such delivery as
             promptly as practicable after, but in no event later than one
             Business Day after, JPMorgan gives notice to the Company that such
             delivery would not result in JPMorgan directly or indirectly so
             beneficially owning in excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares.

(q)          Share Deliveries. The Company acknowledges and agrees that, to the
             extent the holder of this Warrant is not then an affiliate and has
             not been an affiliate for 90 days (it being understood that
             JPMorgan will not be considered an affiliate under this Section
             9(q) solely by reason of its receipt of Shares pursuant to this
             Transaction), and otherwise satisfies all holding period and other
             requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act applicable to it,
             any delivery of Shares or Share Termination Property hereunder at
             any time after 2 years from the Trade Date shall be eligible for
             resale under Rule 144(k) of the Securities Act and the Company
             agrees to promptly remove, or cause the transfer agent for such
             Shares or Share Termination Property, to remove, any legends
             referring to any restrictions on resale under the Securities Act
             from the Shares or Share Termination Property. The Company further
             agrees, for any delivery of Shares or Share Termination Property
             hereunder at any time after 1 year from the Trade Date but within 2
             years of the Trade Date, to the to the extent the holder of this
             Warrant then satisfies the holding period and other requirements of
             Rule 144 of the Securities Act, to promptly remove, or cause the
             transfer agent for such Restricted Share to remove, any legends
             referring to any such restrictions or requirements from such
             Restricted Shares. Such Restricted Shares will be de-legended upon
             delivery by JPMorgan (or such affiliate of JPMorgan) to the Company
             or such transfer agent of customary seller's and broker's
             representation letters in connection with resales of restricted
             securities pursuant to Rule 144 of the Securities Act, without any
             further requirement for the delivery of any certificate, consent,
             agreement, opinion of counsel, notice or any other document, any
             transfer tax stamps or payment of any other amount or any other
             action by JPMorgan (or such affiliate of JPMorgan). The Company
             further agrees that any delivery of Shares or Share Termination
             Delivery Property prior to the date that is 1 year from the Trade
             Date, may be transferred by and among JPMorgan and its affiliates
             and the Company shall effect such transfer without any further
             action by JPMorgan. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary
             herein, the Company agrees that any delivery of Shares or Share
             Termination Delivery Property shall be effected by book-entry
             transfer through the facilities of DTC, or any successor
             depositary, if at the time of delivery, such class of Shares or
             class of Share Termination Delivery Property is in book-entry form
             at DTC or such successor depositary. Notwithstanding anything to
             the contrary herein, to the extent the provisions of Rule 144 of
             the Securities Act or any successor rule are amended, or the
             applicable interpretation thereof by the Securities and Exchange
             Commission or any court change after the Trade Date, the agreements
             of the Company herein shall be deemed modified to the extent
             necessary, in the opinion of outside counsel of the Company, to
             comply with Rule 144 of the Securities Act, including Rule 144(k)
             as in effect at the time of delivery of the relevant Shares or
             Share Termination Property.

(r)          Hedging Disruption Event. The occurrence of a Hedging Disruption
             Event will constitute an Additional Termination Event under the
             Agreement permitting JPMorgan to terminate the

                                       16
<PAGE>

            Transaction, with Counterparty as the sole Affected Party and the
            Transaction as the sole Affected Transaction.

            "Hedging Disruption Event" means with respect to JPMorgan, as
            determined in its reasonable discretion, the inability or
            impracticality, due to market illiquidity, illegality, lack of
            hedging transactions, credit worthy market participants or other
            similar events, to establish, re-establish or maintain any
            transactions necessary or advisable to hedge, directly or
            indirectly, the equity price risk of entering into and performing
            under the Transaction on terms including costs reasonable to
            JPMorgan or an affiliate in its reasonable discretion, including the
            event that at any time JPMorgan reasonably concludes that it or any
            of its affiliates are unable to establish, re-establish or maintain
            a full hedge of its position in respect of the Transaction through
            share borrowing arrangements on terms including costs deemed
            reasonable to JPMorgan in its reasonable discretion. For the
            avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that if (i) JPMorgan
            reasonably determines that it is unable to borrow Shares to hedge
            its exposure with respect to the Transaction at a stock loan rebate
            rate equal to or in excess of zero; or (ii) the prevailing stock
            loan rebate rate for the Shares, as determined by the Calculation
            Agent, is less than zero, an Additional Termination Event under the
            Agreement shall occur with Counterparty as the sole Affected Party
            and the Transaction as the sole Affected Transaction.

      (s)    Gaming Laws. If, in connection with the Transaction or in
             connection with acquiring, establishing, re-establishing,
             substituting, maintaining, unwinding or disposing of any
             transactions or assets JPMorgan or any of its affiliates in its
             reasonable discretion deems necessary or desirable to hedge the
             equity price risk of entering into and performing its obligations
             with respect to the Transaction, or in performing such obligations
             themselves, or in connection with holding any interest that would
             be considered an ownership interest in the Company's securities for
             purposes of any gaming law, rule or regulation, JPMorgan or any of
             its affiliates determines in its sole good faith discretion that it
             is, or is reasonably likely to be, (A) in violation of any gaming
             law, rule or regulation, (B) obligated to register with or provide
             notification or information to any gaming authority, and that such
             registration or notification or the provision of such information,
             when viewed in the aggregate for all relevant gaming authorities,
             would be Unduly Burdensome, or (C) incurring additional risk,
             liability or cost as a result of gaming laws or rules or
             regulations (except to the extent such costs have been paid or
             reimbursed by the Company, and except for up to $250,000 of costs
             that have not yet been paid or reimbursed by the Company but are
             paid or reimbursed by the Company within 60 days following the
             Company's receipt of an invoice therefor); then, subject to the
             third following paragraph, such event shall constitute an
             Additional Termination Event applicable to this Transaction and,
             with respect to such event, (i) the Company shall be deemed to be
             the sole Affected Party and JPMorgan shall be deemed to be the
             party that is not the Affected Party and (ii) JPMorgan shall be the
             party entitled to designate an Early Termination Date pursuant to
             Section 6(b) of the Agreement solely with respect to this
             Transaction. The Company shall indemnify JPMorgan and its
             affiliates on an as-incurred basis for any costs, expenses, losses
             or liabilities or losses incurred by them in connection with any
             gaming law, rule or regulation (including, for the avoidance of
             doubt, any filing fees or costs, legal fees and regulatory
             investigation fees), in each case incurred in connection with this
             Transaction.

             Any determination made by JPMorgan in respect of clause (A) or (C),
             or (B) (as to the obligation to register or provide notification or
             information), above shall be made on the advice of counsel, and any
             determination made by JPMorgan in respect of clause (C) above shall
             also be made after consultation with the Company.

             "Unduly Burdensome" means (i) any registration or notification or
             provision of information which is more burdensome to JPMorgan or
             any of its affiliates or any of their employees, officers,
             directors and agents in any particular instance than any of the
             Known Filings, (ii) registrations, notifications or provision of
             information to in excess of 20 jurisdictions, (iii) any obligation
             to disclose information which JPMorgan and/or any of its affiliates
             is not otherwise required to disclose to the general public in
             generally available filings (other than information that is readily
             and generally publicly available) or to disclose any information
             earlier or more frequently than it otherwise does or would
             otherwise be obligated to do, or (iv) any registration of,
             or provision of

                                       17
<PAGE>

             information by or in respect of, any employee, officer or director
             or agents of JPMorgan or any of its affiliates, other than the
             provision of such information as JPMorgan and/or any of its
             affiliates is otherwise required to disclose to the general public
             in generally available filings and other readily and generally
             publicly available information, or (v) any requirement in respect
             of the gaming laws of any jurisdiction which, in the sole good
             faith discretion of JPMorgan, would cause undue hardship on, injury
             to the business or reputation of, or disclosure of confidential
             information of JPMorgan or any of its affiliates or any of their
             employees, officers, directors and agents. "Known Filings" means
             initial filings with the States of New Jersey and West Virginia in
             form and substance contemplated by JPMorgan as of December 1, 2004.

             Prior to declaring an Additional Termination Event with respect to
             the events described in clause (B) or (C) above, JPMorgan shall use
             commercially reasonable efforts to transfer or assign all or a
             portion of this Transaction to any third party or parties each with
             a rating for its long term, unsecured and unsubordinated
             indebtedness of A+ or better by Standard and Poor's Rating Group,
             Inc. or its successor ("S&P"), or A1 or better by Moody's Investor
             Service, Inc. or its successor ("Moody's") or, if either S&P or
             Moody's ceases to rate such debt, at least an equivalent rating or
             better by a substitute agency rating mutually agreed by the Company
             and JPMorgan. If, in the discretion of JPMorgan, JPMorgan is unable
             to effect such transfer or assignment after its commercially
             reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably acceptable to
             JPMorgan and within a time period reasonably acceptable to
             JPMorgan, JPMorgan may designate any Exchange Business Day as an
             Early Termination Date.

             Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement or any other
             agreement between the parties to the contrary, if, with respect to
             any Transaction relating to Shares under another 2002 ISDA Master
             Agreement between JPMorgan and the Company (any such other
             Transaction, an "Other Transaction"), JPMorgan or its successor or
             assign designates an Early Termination Date thereunder due to the
             occurrence of an Additional Termination Event substantially similar
             to the Additional Termination Event set forth in this Section 9(s),
             and JPMorgan does not deliver a notice designating an Early
             Termination Date in respect of this Transaction due to the
             occurrence of the Additional Termination Event set forth in this
             Section 9(s) within 5 Exchange Business Days of the date of
             delivery of the notice designating an Early Termination Date in
             respect of any Other Transaction, then the Company has the right to
             deliver a written notice to JPMorgan instructing JPMorgan to
             designate an Early Termination Date under the Agreement with
             respect to this Transaction. JPMorgan hereby agrees to comply with
             such instruction and, for the avoidance of doubt, such event shall
             constitute an Additional Termination Event applicable solely with
             respect to this Transaction and the Company shall be deemed to be
             the sole Affected Party and JPMorgan shall be deemed to be the
             party that is not the Affected Party. For the avoidance of doubt,
             the parties hereto agree that the occurrence of any event which
             constitutes an Additional Termination Event as set forth in this
             Section 9(s) will also constitute an Additional Termination Event
             with respect to any Other Transactions the confirmation for which
             contains an Additional Termination Event substantially similar to
             that set forth in this Section 9(s), such that JPMorgan has the
             right to declare an Additional Termination Event in respect of such
             Other Transaction and this Transaction.

      (t)    Governing Law. New York law (without reference to choice of law
             doctrine).

      (u)    Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party waives, to the fullest extent
             permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by
             jury in respect of any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
             Transaction. Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent
             or attorney of the other party has represented, expressly or
             otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of such a
             suit, action or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
             and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced
             to enter into this Transaction, as applicable, by, among other
             things, the mutual waivers and certifications provided herein.

      (v)    Tax Disclosure. Company acknowledges and understands that, in
             connection with certain disclosure and list maintenance regulations
             promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), JPMorgan
             will retain documents related to this Transaction and other
             information. The

                                       18
<PAGE>

             relevant regulations cover many transactions, including certain
             transactions that create book-tax differences. Upon request from
             the IRS, JPMorgan expects to provide such documents and information
             to the IRS. In addition, Company shall consult with its tax
             advisors with respect to any disclosure obligations that Company
             may have.

Re: Warrants

Reference: NY33267

      The purpose of this letter agreement is to confirm the terms and
conditions of the Warrants issued by Scientific Games Corporation (the
"Company") to Bear, Stearns International Limited ("Bear Stearns") on the Trade
Date specified below (the "Transaction"). This letter agreement constitutes a
"Confirmation" as referred to in the ISDA Master Agreement specified below. This
Confirmation shall replace any previous letter and serve as the final
documentation for this Transaction.

      The definitions and provisions contained in the 1996 ISDA Equity
Derivatives Definitions (the "Equity Definitions"), as published by the
International Swaps and Derivatives Association, Inc., are incorporated into
this Confirmation. In the event of any inconsistency between the Equity
Definitions and this Confirmation, this Confirmation shall govern. This
Transaction shall be deemed to be a Share Option Transaction within the meaning
set forth in the Equity Definitions.

      Each party is hereby advised, and each such party acknowledges, that the
other party has engaged in, or refrained from engaging in, substantial financial
transactions and has taken other material actions in reliance upon the parties'
entry into the Transaction to which this Confirmation relates on the terms and
conditions set forth below.

1.    This Confirmation evidences a complete and binding agreement between Bear
      Stearns and the Company as to the terms of the Transaction to which this
      Confirmation relates. This Confirmation shall supplement, form a part of,
      and be subject to an agreement in the form of the 2002 ISDA Master
      Agreement (the "Agreement") as if Bear Stearns and the Company had
      executed an agreement in such form (but without any Schedule except for
      the election of the laws of the State of New York as the governing law and
      United States dollars as the Termination Currency) on the Trade Date. In
      the event of any inconsistency between provisions of that Agreement and
      this Confirmation, this Confirmation will prevail for the purpose of the
      Transaction to which this Confirmation relates. The parties hereby agree
      that no Transaction other than the Transaction to which this Confirmation
      relates shall be governed by the Agreement.

                                  Transaction and if so Bear Stearns in its sole
                                  discretion may elect to make adjustments to

            respective jurisdictions of organization, are duly qualified to do
            business and are in good standing in each jurisdiction in which
            their respective ownership or lease of property or the conduct of
            their respective businesses requires such qualification, and have
            all power and authority necessary to own or hold their respective
            properties and to conduct the businesses in which they are engaged,
            except where the failure to be so qualified or have such power or
            authority would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a
            material adverse effect on the business, properties, management,
            financial position, results of operations or prospects of the
            Company and its subsidiaries taken as a whole or on the performance
            by the Company of its obligations under the Transaction (a "Material
            Adverse Effect").

(b)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that the
            Company has all necessary corporate power and authority to execute,
            deliver and perform its obligations in respect of this Transaction;
            such execution, delivery and performance have been duly authorized
            by all necessary corporate action on the Company's part; and this
            Confirmation has been duly and validly executed and delivered by the
            Company and constitutes its valid and binding obligation,
            enforceable against the Company in accordance with its terms,
            subject to applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, fraudulent conveyance,
            reorganization, moratorium and similar laws affecting creditors'
            rights and remedies generally, and subject, as to enforceability, to
            general principles of equity, including principles of commercial
            reasonableness, good faith and fair dealing (regardless of whether
            enforcement is sought in a proceeding at law or in equity) and
            except that rights to indemnification and contribution thereunder
            may be limited by federal or state securities laws or public policy
            relating thereto.

(c)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that

            of its charter or by-laws or similar organizational documents; (ii)
            in default, and no event has occurred that, with notice or lapse of
            time or both, would constitute such a default, in the due
            performance or observance of any term, covenant or condition
            contained in any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement
            or other agreement or instrument to which the Company or any of its
            subsidiaries is a party or by which the Company or any of its
            subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets of
            the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject; or (iii) in
            violation of any applicable law or statute or any judgment, order,
            rule or regulation of any court or arbitrator or governmental or
            regulatory authority having jurisdiction over the Company or any of
            its subsidiaries or any of their properties, as applicable,

<PAGE>

             except, in the case of clauses (ii) and (iii) above, for any such
             default or violation that would not, individually or in the
             aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect.

             execution, delivery and performance by the Company of this
             Confirmation and compliance by the Company with the terms hereof
             and the consummation of the Transaction will not (i) conflict with
             or result in a breach or violation of any of the terms or
             provisions of, or constitute a default under, or result in the
             creation or imposition of any lien, charge or encumbrance upon any
             property or assets of the Company or any of its subsidiaries
             pursuant to, any indenture, mortgage, deed of trust, loan agreement

             its subsidiaries is bound or to which any of the property or assets
             of the Company or any of its subsidiaries is subject, (ii) result
             in any violation of the provisions of the charter or by-laws or
             similar organizational documents of the Company or any of its
             subsidiaries or (iii) result in the violation of any applicable law
             or statute or any judgment, order, rule or regulation of any court
             or arbitrator or governmental or regulatory authority having
             jurisdiction over the Company or any of its subsidiaries or any of
             their properties, as applicable, except, in the case of clauses (i)
             and (iii) above, for any such conflict, breach or violation that
             would not, individually or in the aggregate, have a Material
             Adverse Effect.

(e)          The Company hereby represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that the
             Shares of the Company initially issuable upon exercise of the
             Warrant by the net share settlement method (the "Warrant Shares")
             have been reserved for issuance by all required corporate action of
             the Company. The Warrant Shares have been duly authorized and, when
             delivered against payment therefor (which may include Net Share
             Settlement in lieu of cash) and otherwise as contemplated by the
             terms of the Warrant following the exercise of the Warrant in
             accordance with the terms and conditions of the Warrant, will be
             validly issued, fully-paid and non-assessable, and the issuance of
             the Warrant Shares will not be subject to any preemptive or similar
             rights.

(f)          The Company hereby represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that
             except as set forth or incorporated by reference in the Company's
             Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003
             (the "Company's 10-K"), as updated by any subsequent filings, there
             are no legal, governmental or regulatory investigations, actions,
             suits or proceedings pending to which the Company or any of its
             subsidiaries is or may be a party or to which any property of the
             Company or any of its subsidiaries is or may be the subject that,
             individually or in the aggregate, if determined adversely to the
             Company or any of its subsidiaries, could reasonably be expected to
             have a Material Adverse Effect; and no such investigations,
             actions, suits or proceedings are threatened or, to the knowledge
             of the Company, are contemplated by any governmental or regulatory
             authority or threatened in writing by others.

(g)          The Company hereby represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that the
             Company's 10-K, as updated by any subsequent filings, does not, as
             of the Trade Date, contain an untrue statement of a material fact
             or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein or
             necessary in order to make the statements therein, in the light of
             the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading.

             is an "eligible contract participant" (as such term is defined in

                  Section 1a(12)(A)(i) through (iv), 1a(12)(A)(v)(I),
                  1a(12)(A)(vii) or 1a(12)(C) of the CEA; or

            (C)   the Company has a net worth in excess of USD 1,000,000 and has
                  entered into this Agreement in connection with the conduct of

                  asset or liability owned or incurred or reasonably likely to
                  be owned or incurred by Company in the conduct of Company's
                  business.

(i)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that
            neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries is an "investment
            company" or an entity "controlled" by an "investment company" within

            conduct of their respective businesses as described in the Company's
            10-K, as updated by any subsequent filings, except where the failure
            to possess or make the same would not, individually or in the
            aggregate, have a Material Adverse Effect; and except as described
            in the Company's 10-K, as updated by any subsequent filings, neither

            license, certificate, permit or authorization will not be renewed in
            the ordinary course.

(k)         The Company hereby represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that no
            order, consent, approval, license, authorization or validation of,
            or filing, recording, qualification or registration with, or
            exemption or waiver by, any governmental authority or other person
            with responsibility for regulating gaming laws having jurisdiction
            over the Company or its subsidiaries, is required for the execution,
            delivery and performance by the Company of this Confirmation, other
            than the Order of the West Virginia State Lottery Commission dated
            and obtained December 7, 2004 and a waiver by the New Jersey Casino
            Control Commission (the "New Jersey Commission") of the requirement
            that Bear Stearns satisfy the applicable qualification provisions of
            the New Jersey Casino Control Act and the regulations promulgated
            thereunder by the New Jersey Commission; further, subject to
            compliance with the requirements described above, the execution,
            delivery and performance of this Confirmation does not and will not
            result in a violation in any material respect of any gaming law or
            regulation.

(l)         The Company represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that each of it
            and its affiliates is not, on the date hereof, in possession of any
            material non-public information with respect to Company.

(m)         The Company shall deliver an opinion of counsel, dated as of the
            Trade Date, to Bear Stearns in the forms attached as Exhibit A,
            Exhibit B and Exhibit C.

(n)         If the Initial Purchasers party to the Purchase Agreement among the
            Company and J.P. Morgan Securities Inc. and Bear, Stearns & Co., as
            representatives of the Initial Purchasers, dated as of December 1,
            2004, relating to the purchase of the Convertible Notes exercise
            their right to receive additional Convertible Notes pursuant to the
            Initial Purchasers' option to purchase additional Convertible Notes,
            then, at the discretion of the Company, Bear Stearns and the Company
            will amend this Confirmation (substantially in the form attached as
            Exhibit D to this Confirmation) to provide for such increase in
            Convertible Notes (such amendment to this Confirmation to provide
            for the payment by the Company to Bear Stearns of the additional
            premium related thereto).

9. Other Provisions:

(a)         No Reliance, etc. Each party represents that (i) it is entering into
            the Transaction evidenced hereby as principal (and not as agent or
            in any other capacity); (ii) neither the other party or parties nor
            any of its or their agents are acting as a fiduciary for it; (iii)
            it is not relying upon any representations except those expressly
            set forth in the Agreement or this Confirmation; (iv) it has not
            relied on the other party or parties for any legal, regulatory, tax,
            business, investment, financial, and accounting advice, and it has
            made its own investment, hedging, and trading decisions based upon
            its own judgment and not upon any view expressed by the other party
            or parties or any of its or their agents; and (v) it is entering
            into this Transaction with a full understanding of the terms,
            conditions and risks thereof and it is capable of and willing to
            assume those risks.

(b)         Share De-listing Event. If at any time during the period from and
            including the Trade Date, to and including the final Valuation Date,
            the Shares cease to be listed or quoted on the Exchange for any
            reason (other than a Merger Event as a result of which all of the
            property underlying the Options consists of shares of common stock
            that are listed or quoted on The New York Stock Exchange, The
            American Stock Exchange or the NASDAQ National Market System (or
            their respective successors) (the "Successor Exchange")) and are not
            immediately re-listed or quoted as of the date of such de-listing on
            the Successor Exchange, then Cancellation and Payment (as defined in
            Section 9.6 of the Equity Definitions treating the "Announcement
            Date" as the date of first public announcement that the Share
            De-Listing will occur and the "Merger Date" as the date of the Share
            De-Listing) shall apply, and the date of the de-listing shall be
            deemed the date of termination for purposes of calculating any
            payment due from one party to any of the others in connection with
            the cancellation of this Transaction. If the Shares are immediately
            re-listed on a Successor Exchange upon their de-listing from the
            Exchange, this Transaction shall continue in full force and effect,
            provided that the Successor Exchange shall be deemed to be the
            Exchange for all purposes hereunder. In addition, the Calculation
            Agent shall make any adjustments it deems necessary to the terms of
            the Transaction in accordance with Calculation Agent Adjustment
            method as defined under Section 9.1(c) of the Equity Definitions.

(c)         Repurchase Notices. Company shall, on any day on which Company
            effects any repurchase of Shares, promptly give Bear Stearns a
            written notice of such repurchase (a "Repurchase Notice") on such
            day if following such repurchase, the Warrants Equity Percentage as
            determined on such day is (i) equal to or greater than 7.5% and (ii)
            greater by 0.5% than the Warrants Equity Percentage included in the
            immediately preceding Repurchase Notice (or, in the case of the
            first such Repurchase Notice, greater than the Warrants Equity
            Percentage as of the date hereof). The "Warrants Equity Percentage"
            as of any day is the fraction (A) the numerator of which is the
            product of the Number of Warrants and the Warrant Entitlement and
            (B) the denominator of which is the number of Shares outstanding on
            such day. Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless Bear Stearns
            and its affiliates and their respective officers, directors,
            employees,

                                       9
<PAGE>

            affiliates, advisors, agents and controlling persons (each, an
            "Indemnified Person") from and against any and all losses (including
            losses relating to Bear Stearns's hedging activities as a
            consequence of becoming, or of the risk of becoming, a Section 16
            "insider", including without limitation, any forbearance from
            hedging activities or cessation of hedging activities and any losses
            in connection therewith with respect to this Transaction), claims,
            damages, judgments, liabilities and expenses (including reasonable
            attorney's fees), joint or several, which an Indemnified Person
            actually may become subject to, a result of Company's failure to
            provide Bear Stearns with a Repurchase Notice on the day and in the
            manner specified in this Section 9(c), and to reimburse, within 30
            days, upon written request, each of such Indemnified Persons for any
            reasonable legal or other expenses incurred in connection with
            investigating, preparing for, providing testimony or other evidence
            in connection with or defending any of the foregoing. If any suit,
            action, proceeding (including any governmental or regulatory
            investigation), claim or demand shall be brought or asserted against
            the Indemnified Person, such Indemnified Person shall promptly
            notify the Company in writing, and the Company, upon request of the
            Indemnified Person, shall retain counsel reasonably satisfactory to
            the Indemnified Person to represent the Indemnified Person and any
            others the Company may designate in such proceeding and shall pay
            the fees and expenses of such counsel related to such proceeding.
            Company shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding
            effected without its written consent, but if settled with such
            consent or if there be a final judgment for the plaintiff, Company
            agrees to indemnify any Indemnified Person from and against any loss
            or liability by reason of such settlement or judgment. Company shall
            not, without the prior written consent of the Indemnified Person,
            effect any settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in
            respect of which any Indemnified Person is or could have been a
            party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder by such
            Indemnified Person, unless such settlement includes an unconditional
            release of such Indemnified Person from all liability on claims that
            are the subject matter of such proceeding on terms reasonably
            satisfactory to such Indemnified Person. If the indemnification
            provided for in this paragraph (c) is unavailable to an Indemnified
            Person or insufficient in respect of any losses, claims, damages or
            liabilities referred to therein, then Company under such paragraph,
            in lieu of indemnifying such Indemnified Person thereunder, shall
            contribute to the amount paid or payable by such Indemnified Person
            as a result of such losses, claims, damages or liabilities. The
            remedies provided for in this paragraph (c) are not exclusive and
            shall not limit any rights or remedies which may otherwise be
            available to any Indemnified Person at law or in equity. The
            indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this paragraph
            (c) shall remain operative and in full force and effect regardless
            of the termination of this Transaction.

(d)         Regulation M. The Company was not on the Trade Date and is not on
            the date hereof engaged in a distribution, as such term is used in
            Regulation M under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
            ("Exchange Act"), of any securities of Company, other than a
            distribution of securities meeting the requirements of the exception
            set forth in sections 101(b)(10) and 102(b)(7) of Regulation M. The
            Company shall not, until the fifth Exchange Business Day immediately
            following the Trade Date, engage in any such distribution.

(e)         No Manipulation. The Company is not entering into this Transaction
            to create actual or apparent trading activity in the Shares (or any
            security convertible into or exchangeable for the Shares) or to
            raise or depress or otherwise manipulate the price of the Shares (or
            any security convertible into or exchangeable for the Shares).

(f)         Board Authorization. Company represents that it is entering into the
            Transaction, solely for the purposes stated in the board resolution
            authorizing this Transaction and in its public disclosure. Company
            further represents that there is no internal policy, whether written
            or oral, of Company

                                       10
<PAGE>

            that would prohibit Company from entering into any aspect of this
            Transaction, including, but not limited to, the purchases of Shares
            to be made pursuant hereto.

(g)         Transfer or Assignment. Company may not transfer any of its rights
            or obligations under this Transaction without the prior written
            consent of Bear Stearns. Bear Stearns may transfer or assign all or
            any portion of its rights or obligations under this Transaction
            without consent of the Company. If Bear Stearns, in its sole
            discretion, determines that its "beneficial ownership" (within the
            meaning of Section 16 of the Exchange Act and rules promulgated
            thereunder) exceeds 8 % or more of the Company's outstanding Shares
            and, in its sole discretion, Bear Stearns is unable after its
            commercially reasonable efforts to effect a transfer or assignment
            on pricing terms and in a time period reasonably acceptable to Bear
            Stearns that would reduce its "beneficial ownership" to 7.5 %, Bear
            Stearns may designate any Exchange Business Day as an Early
            Termination Date with respect to a portion (the "Terminated
            Portion") of this Transaction, such that the its "beneficial
            ownership" following such partial termination will be equal to or
            less than 8%. In the event that Bear Stearns so designates an Early
            Termination Date with respect to a portion of this Transaction, a
            payment shall be made pursuant to Section 6 of the Agreement as if
            (i) an Early Termination Date had been designated in respect of a
            Transaction having terms identical to this Transaction and a Number
            of Warrants equal to the Terminated Portion, (ii) the Company and
            Bear Stearns shall both be Affected Parties with respect to such
            partial termination and (iii) such Transaction shall be the only
            Terminated Transaction. For the avoidance of doubt, if Bear Stearns
            assigns or terminates any Warrants hereunder, each Daily Number of
            Warrants not previously settled shall be reduced proportionally, as
            calculated by the Calculation Agent. Notwithstanding any other
            provision in this Confirmation to the contrary requiring or allowing
            Bear Stearns to purchase, sell, receive or deliver any shares or
            other securities to or from Company, Bear Stearns may designate any
            of its affiliates to purchase, sell, receive or deliver such shares
            or other securities and otherwise to perform Bear Stearns's
            obligations in respect of this Transaction and any such designee may
            assume such obligations. Bear Stearns shall be discharged of its
            obligations to Company to the extent of any such performance.

(h)         Amendment. Paragraph (i) of Section 9.7(b) of the Equity Definitions
            is hereby amended for purposes of this Transaction by replacing
            "two-year" with "90 calendar day".

(i)         Damages. Neither party shall be liable under Section 6.10 of the
            Equity Definitions for special, indirect or consequential damages,
            even if informed of the possibility thereof.

(j)         Dividends. If at any time during the period from and including the
            Trade Date, to but excluding the Expiration Date, an ex-dividend
            date for a cash dividend occurs with respect to the Shares (an
            "Ex-Dividend Date"), and that dividend is greater than the Regular
            Dividend on a per Share basis then the Calculation Agent will adjust
            the Strike Price to preserve the fair value of the Warrant to Bear
            Stearns after taking into account such dividend. "Regular Dividend"
            shall mean USD 0.00 per Share per quarter.

(k)         Role of Agent. Each party agrees and acknowledges that (i) Calyon
            ("Agent"), has acted solely as agent and not as principal with
            respect to this Transaction and (ii) Agent has no obligation or
            liability, by way of guaranty, endorsement or otherwise, in any
            manner in respect of this Transaction (including, if applicable, in
            respect of the settlement thereof). Each party agrees it will look
            solely to the other party (or any guarantor in respect thereof) for
            performance of such other party's obligations under this
            Transaction.

            declaration by the Issuer of the terms of any Potential Adjustment
            Event, the Calculation Agent will determine whether such Potential
            Adjustment Event has a material effect on the theoretical value of
            the relevant Shares or Warrants and, if so, will (i) make
            appropriate adjustment(s), if any, to any one or more of:' and, the
            sentence immediately preceding Section 9.1(c)(ii) is hereby amended
            by deleting the words "diluting or concentrative".

            (ii) Section 9.1(e)(vi) of the Equity Definitions is hereby amended
            by deleting the words "other similar" between "any" and "event";
            deleting the words "diluting or concentrative" and replacing them
            with "material"; and adding the following words at the end of the
            sentence "or Warrants".

            (iii) Section 9.6(a)(ii) of the Equity Definitions is hereby amended
            by (1) deleting from the third line thereof the word "or" after the
            word "official" and inserting a comma therefor, and (2) deleting the
            period at the end of subsection (ii) thereof and inserting the
            following words therefor " or (C) at Bear Stearns's option, the

            Issuer."

            (iv) Notwithstanding Section 9.7 of the Equity Definitions,
            everything in the first paragraph of Section 9.7(b) of the Equity
            Definitions after the words "Calculation Agent" in the third line
            through the remainder of such Section 9.7 shall be deleted and
            replaced with the following:

            "based on an amount representing the Calculation Agent's
            determination of the fair value to Buyer of an option with terms
            that would preserve for Buyer the economic equivalent of any payment
            or delivery (assuming satisfaction of each applicable condition
            precedent) by the parties in respect of the relevant Transaction
            that would have been required after that date but for the occurrence
            of the Merger Event, Nationalization, Insolvency or De-Listing
            Event, as the case may be."

(m)         No Collateral, Netting or Setoff. Notwithstanding any provision of
            the Agreement or any other agreement between the parties to the
            contrary, the obligations of the Company hereunder are not secured
            by any collateral. Obligations under this Transaction shall not be
            netted or set off against any other obligations of the parties,
            whether arising under the Agreement, this Confirmation, under any
            other agreement between the parties hereto, by operation of law or
            otherwise. Any provision in the Agreement with respect to the
            satisfaction of the Company's payment obligations to the extent of

            currency and in the same Transaction (including, without limitation
            Section 2(c) thereof) shall not apply to the Company and, for the
            avoidance of doubt, the Company shall fully satisfy such payment
            obligations notwithstanding any payment obligation to the Company by
            Bear Stearns in the same currency and in the same Transaction. In
            calculating any amounts under Section 6(e) of the Agreement,
            notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the Agreement, (i)
            separate amounts shall be calculated as set forth in such Section
            6(e) with respect to (a) this Transaction and (ii) all other
            Transactions, and (2) such separate amounts shall be payable

            amount is payable by the Company to Bear Stearns, (i) pursuant to
            Section 9.7 of the Equity Definitions (except in the event of a
            Nationalization or Insolvency or a Merger Event, in each case, in
            which the consideration to be paid to holders of

            which Company is the Affected Party, other than an Event of Default
            of the type described in Section 5(a)(iii), (v), (vi) or (vii) of
            the Agreement or a Termination Event of the type described in
            Section 5(b)(i), (ii), (iii), (iv),(v) or (vi) of the Agreement that
            resulted from an event or events outside Company's control) (a
            "Payment Obligation"), Company may, in its sole discretion, satisfy
            any such Payment Obligation by the Share Termination Alternative (as
            defined below) and shall give irrevocable telephonic notice to Bear
            Stearns, confirmed in writing within one Currency Business Day,

                                           on the date (the "Share Termination
                                           Payment Date") when the Payment
                                           Obligation would otherwise be due,
                                           subject to paragraph (o)(i) below, in
                                           satisfaction, subject to paragraph
                                           (o)(ii) below, of the Payment
                                           Obligation in the manner reasonably
                                           requested by Bear Stearns free of
                                           payment.

            Share Termination Delivery     A number of Share Termination
            Property:                      Delivery Units, as calculated by the
                                           Calculation Agent, equal to the
                                           Payment Obligation divided by the
                                           Share Termination Unit Price. The
                                           Calculation Agent shall adjust the
                                           Share Termination Delivery Property
                                           by replacing any fractional portion
                                           of a security therein with an amount
                                           of cash equal to the value of such
                                           fractional security based on the
                                           values used to calculate the Share
                                           Termination Unit Price.

            Share Termination Unit Price:  The value to Bear Stearns of property
                                           contained in one Share Termination
                                           Delivery Unit on the date such Share
                                           Termination Delivery Units are to be
                                           delivered as Share Termination
                                           Delivery Property, as determined by
                                           the Calculation Agent in its
                                           discretion by commercially reasonable
                                           means and notified by the Calculation
                                           Agent to Company at the time of
                                           notification of the Payment
                                           Obligation. In the case of a Private
                                           Placement of Share Termination
                                           Delivery Units that are Restricted

                                           the Share Termination Unit Price
                                           shall be determined by the discounted
                                           price applicable to such Share
                                           Termination Delivery Units. In the
                                           case of a Registered Settlement of
                                           Share Termination Delivery Units that
                                           are Restricted Shares (as defined
                                           below) as set forth in paragraph
                                           (o)(ii) below, the Share Termination
                                           Unit Price shall be the Settlement
                                           Price on the Merger Date, the date of
                                           the occurrence of the Nationalization
                                           or Insolvency, or Early Termination
                                           Date, as applicable.

            Share Termination Delivery     In the case of a Termination Event or
            Unit:                          Event of Default, one Share or, in
                                           the case of Nationalization or
                                           Insolvency or a Merger Event, a unit
                                           consisting of the number or amount of
                                           each type of property received by a
                                           holder of one Share (without
                                           consideration of any requirement to
                                           pay cash or other consideration in
                                           lieu of fractional amounts of any
                                           securities) in such Nationalization
                                           or Insolvency or such Merger Event.
                                           If a Share Termination Delivery Unit
                                           consists of property other than cash
                                           or New Shares, the Calculation Agent
                                           will replace such property with cash,
                                           New Shares or a combination thereof
                                           as components of a Share Termination
                                           Delivery Unit in such amounts, as
                                           determined by the Calculation Agent
                                           in its discretion by commercially
                                           reasonable means, as shall have a
                                           value equal to the value of the
                                           property so replaced. If such Merger
                                           Event involves a choice of
                                           consideration to be received by
                                           holders, such holder shall be deemed
                                           to have elected to receive the
                                           maximum possible amount of cash.

            Other applicable provisions:   If this Transaction is to be Share
                                           Termination Settled, the provisions
                                           of Sections 6.6, 6.7, 6.8, 6.9 and
                                           6.10 (as modified above) of the
                                           Equity Definitions will be
                                           applicable, except that all
                                           references in such provisions to
                                           "Physically-Settled" shall be read as
                                           references to "Share Termination
                                           Settled" and all references to
                                           "Shares" shall be read as references
                                           to "Share Termination Delivery
                                           Units". "Share Termination Settled"
                                           in relation to this Transaction means
                                           that Share Termination Settlement is
                                           applicable to this Transaction.

(o)          Registration/Private Placement Procedures. If, in the reasonable
             opinion of Bear Stearns, following any delivery of Shares or Share
             Termination Delivery Property to Bear Stearns hereunder, such
             Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property would be in the hands
             of Bear Stearns subject to any applicable restrictions with respect
             to any registration or qualification requirement or prospectus
             delivery requirement for such Shares or Share Termination Delivery
             Property pursuant to any applicable federal or state securities law
             (including, without limitation, any such requirement arising under
             Section 5 of the Securities Act as a result of such Shares or Share
             Termination Delivery Property being "restricted securities", as
             such term is defined in Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or as a
             result of the sale of such Shares or Share Termination Delivery
             Property being subject to paragraph (c) of Rule 145 under the
             Securities Act) (such

                                       14
<PAGE>

            Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property, "Restricted Shares"),
            then delivery of such Restricted Shares shall be effected pursuant
            to either clause (i) or (ii) below at the election of Company,
            unless waived by Bear Stearns. Notwithstanding the foregoing, solely
            in respect of any Daily Number of Warrants exercised or deemed
            exercised on any Expiration Date, the Company shall elect, prior to
            the first Settlement Date for the first Expiration Date, a Private
            Placement Settlement or Registered Settlement for all deliveries of
            Restricted Shares for all such Expiration Dates which election shall
            be applicable to all Settlement Dates for such Daily Number of
            Warrants and the procedures in clause (i) or clause (ii) below shall
            apply for all such delivered Restricted Shares on an aggregate basis
            commencing after the final Settlement Date for such Daily Number of
            Warrants. The Calculation Agent shall make reasonable adjustments to
            settlement terms and provisions under this Confirmation to reflect a
            single Private Placement or Registered Settlement for such aggregate
            Restricted Shares delivered hereunder.

             (i)   If the Company elects to settle the Transaction pursuant to
                   this clause (i) (a "Private Placement Settlement"), then
                   delivery of Restricted Shares by the Company shall be
                   effected in customary private placement procedures with
                   respect to such Restricted Shares reasonably acceptable to
                   Bear Stearns; provided that the Company may not elect a
                   Private Placement Settlement if, on the date of its election,
                   it has taken, or caused to be taken, any action that would
                   make unavailable either the exemption pursuant to Section
                   4(2) of the Securities Act for the sale by the Company to
                   Bear Stearns (or any affiliate designated by Bear Stearns) of
                   the Restricted Shares or the exemption pursuant to Section
                   4(1) or Section 4(3) of the Securities Act for resales of the
                   Restricted Shares by Bear Stearns (or any such affiliate of
                   Bear Stearns). The Private Placement Settlement of such
                   Restricted Shares shall include customary representations,
                   covenants, blue sky and other governmental filings and/or
                   registrations, indemnities to Bear Stearns, due diligence
                   rights (for Bear Stearns or any designated buyer of the
                   Restricted Shares by Bear Stearns), opinions and
                   certificates, and such other documentation as is customary
                   for private placement agreements, all reasonably acceptable
                   to Bear Stearns. In the case of a Private Placement
                   Settlement, Bear Stearns shall determine the appropriate
                   discount to the Share Termination Unit Price (in the case of
                   settlement of Share Termination Delivery Units pursuant to
                   paragraph (n) above) or any Settlement Price (in the case of
                   settlement of Shares pursuant to Section 2 above) applicable
                   to such Restricted Shares in a commercially reasonable manner
                   and appropriately adjust the amount of such Restricted Shares
                   to be delivered to Bear Stearns hereunder; provided that in
                   no event shall such number be greater than 49,619,010 (the
                   "Maximum Amount"). Notwithstanding the Agreement or this
                   Confirmation, the date of delivery of such Restricted Shares
                   shall be the Exchange Business Day following notice by Bear
                   Stearns to the Company, of such applicable discount and the
                   number of Restricted Shares to be delivered pursuant to this
                   clause (i). For the avoidance of doubt, delivery of
                   Restricted Shares shall be due as set forth in the previous
                   sentence and not be due on the Share Termination Payment Date
                   (in the case of settlement of Share Termination Delivery
                   Units pursuant to paragraph (n) above) or on the Settlement
                   Date for such Restricted Shares (in the case of settlement of
                   Shares pursuant to Section 2 above).

                   In the event of a Private Placement, the Net Share Settlement
                   Amount or the Payment Obligation, respectively, shall be
                   deemed to be the Net Share Settlement Amount or the Payment
                   Obligation, respectively, plus an additional amount
                   (determined from time to time by the Calculation Agent in its
                   commercially reasonable judgment) attributable to interest
                   that would be earned on such Net Share Settlement Amount or
                   the Payment Obligation, respectively, (increased on a daily
                   basis to reflect the accrual of such interest and reduced
                   from time to time by the amount of net proceeds received by
                   Bear Stearns as

                                       15

                   provided herein) at a rate equal to the open Federal Funds
                   Rate plus the Spread for the period from, and including, such
                   Settlement Date or the date on which the Payment Obligation
                   is due, respectively, to, but excluding, the related date on
                   which all the Restricted Shares have been sold and calculated
                   on an Actual/360 basis. The foregoing provision shall be
                   without prejudice to Bear Stearns's rights under the
                   Agreement (including, without limitation, Sections 5 and 6
                   thereof).

                   As used in this Section 9(o)(i), "Spread" means, with respect
                   to any Net Share Settlement Amount or Payment Obligation,
                   respectively, the credit spread over the applicable overnight
                   rate that would be imposed if Bear Stearns were to extend
                   credit to Company in an amount equal to such Net Share
                   Settlement Amount, all as determined by the Calculation Agent
                   using its commercially reasonable judgment as of the related
                   Settlement Date or the date on which the Payment Obligation
                   is due, respectively. Commercial reasonableness shall take
                   into consideration all factors deemed relevant by the
                   Calculation Agent, which are expected to include, among other
                   things, the credit quality of the Company (and any relevant
                   affiliates) in the then-prevailing market and the credit
                   spread of similar companies in the relevant industry and
                   other companies having a substantially similar credit
                   quality.

            (ii)   If the Company elects to settle the Transaction pursuant to
                   this clause (ii) (a "Registration Settlement"), then the
                   Company shall promptly (but in any event no later than the
                   beginning of the Resale Period) file and use its reasonable
                   best efforts to make effective under the Securities Act a
                   registration statement or supplement or amend an outstanding
                   registration statement in form and substance reasonably
                   satisfactory to Bear Stearns, to cover the resale of such
                   Restricted Shares in accordance with customary resale
                   registration procedures, including covenants, conditions,
                   representations, underwriting discounts (if applicable),
                   commissions (if applicable), indemnities due diligence
                   rights, opinions and certificates, and such other
                   documentation as is customary for equity resale underwriting
                   agreements, all reasonably acceptable to Bear Stearns. If
                   Bear Stearns, in its sole reasonable discretion, is not
                   satisfied with such procedures and documentation Private
                   Placement Settlement shall apply. If Bear Stearns is
                   satisfied with such procedures and documentation, it shall
                   sell the Restricted Shares pursuant to such registration
                   statement during a period (the "Resale Period") commencing on
                   the Exchange Business Day following delivery of such
                   Restricted Shares (which, for the avoidance of doubt, shall
                   be (x) the Share Termination Payment Date in case of
                   settlement of Share Termination Delivery Units pursuant to
                   paragraph (n) above or (y) the Settlement Date in respect of
                   the final Expiration Date for all Daily Number of Warrants)
                   and ending on the earliest of (i) the Exchange Business Day
                   on which Bear Stearns completes the sale of all Restricted
                   Shares or, in the case of settlement of Share Termination
                   Delivery Units, a sufficient number of Restricted Shares so
                   that the realized net proceeds of such sales exceed the
                   Payment Obligation (as defined above), (ii) the date upon
                   which all Restricted Shares have been sold or transferred
                   pursuant to Rule 144 (or similar provisions then in force) or
                   Rule 145(d)(1) or (2) (or any similar provision then in
                   force) under the Securities Act and (iii) the date upon which
                   all Restricted Shares may be sold or transferred by a
                   non-affiliate pursuant to Rule 144(k) (or any similar
                   provision then in force) or Rule 145(d)(3) (or any similar
                   provision then in force) under the Securities Act. If the
                   Payment Obligation exceeds the realized net proceeds from
                   such resale, Company shall transfer to Bear Stearns by the
                   open of the regular trading session on the Exchange on the
                   Exchange Trading Day immediately following the last day of
                   the Resale Period the amount of such excess (the "Additional
                   Amount") in cash or in a number of Shares ("Make-whole
                   Shares") in an amount that, based on the

                                       16
<PAGE>

                   Settlement Price on the last day of the Resale Period (as if
                   such day was the "Valuation Date" for purposes of computing
                   such Settlement Price), has a dollar value equal to the
                   Additional Amount. The Resale Period shall continue to enable
                   the sale of the Make-whole Shares. If Company elects to pay
                   the Additional Amount in Shares, the requirements and
                   provisions for Registration Settlement shall apply. This
                   provision shall be applied successively until the Additional
                   Amount is equal to zero. In no event shall the Company
                   deliver a number of Restricted Shares greater than the
                   Maximum Amount.

            (iii)  Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Company
                   agrees that any Restricted Shares delivered to Bear Stearns,
                   as purchaser of such Restricted Shares, (i) may be
                   transferred by and among Bear Stearns Chase Bank and its
                   affiliates and Company shall effect such transfer without any
                   further action by Bear Stearns and (ii) after the minimum
                   "holding period" within the meaning of Rule 144(d) under the
                   Securities Act has elapsed after any Settlement Date for such
                   Restricted Shares, Company shall promptly remove, or cause
                   the transfer agent for such Restricted Shares to remove, any
                   legends referring to any such restrictions or requirements
                   from such Restricted Shares upon delivery by Bear Stearns (or
                   such affiliate of Bear Stearns) to Company or such transfer
                   agent of seller's and broker's representation letters
                   customarily delivered by Bear Stearns in connection with
                   resales of restricted securities pursuant to Rule 144 under
                   the Securities Act, without any further requirement for the
                   delivery of any certificate, consent, agreement, opinion of
                   counsel, notice or any other document, any transfer tax
                   stamps or payment of any other amount or any other action by
                   Bear Stearns (or such affiliate of Bear Stearns).

             If the Private Placement Settlement or the Registration Settlement
             shall not be effected as set forth in clauses (i) or (ii), as
             applicable, then failure to effect such Private Placement
             Settlement or such Registration Settlement shall constitute an
             Event of Default with respect to which Company shall be the
             Defaulting Party.

(p)          Limit on Beneficial Ownership. Notwithstanding any other provisions
             hereof, Bear Stearns may not exercise any Warrant hereunder, and
             Automatic Exercise shall not apply with respect thereto, to the
             extent (but only to the extent) that such receipt would result in
             Bear Stearns directly or indirectly beneficially owning (as such
             term is defined for purposes of Section 13(d) of the Exchange Act)
             at any time in excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares. Any
             purported delivery hereunder shall be void and have no effect to
             the extent (but only to the extent) that such delivery would result
             in Bear Stearns directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in
             excess of 9.0% of the outstanding Shares. If any delivery owed to
             Bear Stearns hereunder is not made, in whole or in part, as a
             result of this provision, the Company's obligation to make such
             delivery shall not be extinguished and the Company shall make such
             delivery as promptly as practicable after, but in no event later
             than one Business Day after, Bear Stearns gives notice to the
             Company that such delivery would not result in Bear Stearns
             directly or indirectly so beneficially owning in excess of 9.0% of
             the outstanding Shares.

(q)          Share Deliveries. The Company acknowledges and agrees that, to the
             extent the holder of this Warrant is not then an affiliate and has
             not been an affiliate for 90 days (it being understood that Bear
             Stearns will not be considered an affiliate under this Section 9(q)
             solely by reason of its receipt of Shares pursuant to this
             Transaction), and otherwise satisfies all holding period and other
             requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act applicable to it,
             any delivery of Shares or Share

                                       17
<PAGE>

             Termination Property hereunder at any time after 2 years from the
             Trade Date shall be eligible for resale under Rule 144(k) of the
             Securities Act and the Company agrees to promptly remove, or cause
             the transfer agent for such Shares or Share Termination Property,
             to remove, any legends referring to any restrictions on resale
             under the Securities Act from the Shares or Share Termination
             Property. The Company further agrees, for any delivery of Shares or
             Share Termination Property hereunder at any time after 1 year from
             the Trade Date but within 2 years of the Trade Date, to the to the
             extent the holder of this Warrant then satisfies the holding period
             and other requirements of Rule 144 of the Securities Act, to
             promptly remove, or cause the transfer agent for such Restricted
             Share to remove, any legends referring to any such restrictions or
             requirements from such Restricted Shares. Such Restricted Shares
             will be de-legended upon delivery by Bear Stearns (or such
             affiliate of Bear Stearns) to the Company or such transfer agent of
             customary seller's and broker's representation letters in
             connection with resales of restricted securities pursuant to Rule
             144 of the Securities Act, without any further requirement for the
             delivery of any certificate, consent, agreement, opinion of
             counsel, notice or any other document, any transfer tax stamps or
             payment of any other amount or any other action by Bear Stearns (or
             such affiliate of Bear Stearns). The Company further agrees that
             any delivery of Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property prior
             to the date that is 1 year from the Trade Date, may be transferred
             by and among Bear Stearns and its affiliates and the Company shall
             effect such transfer without any further action by Bear Stearns.
             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the Company agrees
             that any delivery of Shares or Share Termination Delivery Property
             shall be effected by book-entry transfer through the facilities of
             DTC, or any successor depositary, if at the time of delivery, such
             class of Shares or class of Share Termination Delivery Property is
             in book-entry form at DTC or such successor depositary.
             Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, to the extent the
             provisions of Rule 144 of the Securities Act or any successor rule
             are amended, or the applicable interpretation thereof by the
             Securities and Exchange Commission or any court change after the
             Trade Date, the agreements of the Company herein shall be deemed
             modified to the extent necessary, in the opinion of outside counsel
             of the Company, to comply with Rule 144 of the Securities Act,
             including Rule 144(k) as in effect at the time of delivery of the
             relevant Shares or Share Termination Property.

(r)          Hedging Disruption Event. The occurrence of a Hedging Disruption
             Event will constitute an Additional Termination Event under the
             Agreement permitting Bear Stearns to terminate the Transaction,
             with Counterparty as the sole Affected Party and the Transaction as
             the sole Affected Transaction.

             "Hedging Disruption Event" means with respect to Bear Stearns, as
             determined in its reasonable discretion, the inability or
             impracticality, due to market illiquidity, illegality, lack of
             hedging transactions, credit worthy market participants or other
             similar events, to establish, re-establish or maintain any
             transactions necessary or advisable to hedge, directly or
             indirectly, the equity price risk of entering into and performing
             under the Transaction on terms including costs reasonable to Bear
             Stearns or an affiliate in its reasonable discretion, including the
             event that at any time Bear Stearns reasonably concludes that it or
             any of its affiliates are unable to establish, re-establish or
             maintain a full hedge of its position in respect of the Transaction
             through share borrowing arrangements on terms including costs
             deemed reasonable to Bear Stearns in its reasonable discretion. For
             the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto agree that if (i) Bear
             Stearns reasonably determines that it is unable to borrow Shares to
             hedge its exposure with respect to the Transaction at a stock loan
             rebate rate equal to or in excess of zero; or (ii) the prevailing
             stock loan rebate rate for the Shares, as determined by the
             Calculation Agent, is less than zero, an Additional Termination
             Event under the Agreement shall occur with Counterparty as the sole
             Affected Party and the Transaction as the sole Affected
             Transaction.

(s)          Gaming Laws. If, in connection with the Transaction or in
             connection with acquiring, establishing, re-establishing,
             substituting, maintaining, unwinding or disposing of any
             transactions or assets Bear Stearns or any of its affiliates in its
             reasonable discretion deems necessary or desirable to hedge the
             equity price risk of entering into and performing its obligations
             with respect to the Transaction, or in

                                       18
<PAGE>

             performing such obligations themselves, or in connection with
             holding any interest that would be considered an ownership interest
             in the Company's securities for purposes of any gaming law, rule or
             regulation, Bear Stearns or any of its affiliates determines in its
             sole good faith discretion that it is, or is reasonably likely to
             be, (A) in violation of any gaming law, rule or regulation, (B)
             obligated to register with or provide notification or information
             to any gaming authority, and that such registration or notification
             or the provision of such information, when viewed in the aggregate
             for all relevant gaming authorities, would be Unduly Burdensome, or
             (C) incurring additional risk, liability or cost as a result of
             gaming laws or rules or regulations (except to the extent such
             costs have been paid or reimbursed by the Company, and except for
             up to $250,000 of costs that have not yet been paid or reimbursed
             by the Company but are paid or reimbursed by the Company within 60
             days following the Company's receipt of an invoice therefor); then,
             subject to the third following paragraph, such event shall
             constitute an Additional Termination Event applicable to this
             Transaction and, with respect to such event, (i) the Company shall
             be deemed to be the sole Affected Party and Bear Stearns shall be
             deemed to be the party that is not the Affected Party and (ii) Bear
             Stearns shall be the party entitled to designate an Early
             Termination Date pursuant to Section 6(b) of the Agreement solely
             with respect to this Transaction. The Company shall indemnify Bear
             Stearns and its affiliates on an as-incurred basis for any costs,
             expenses, losses or liabilities or losses incurred by them in
             connection with any gaming law, rule or regulation (including, for
             the avoidance of doubt, any filing fees or costs, legal fees and
             regulatory investigation fees), in each case incurred in connection
             with this Transaction.

             Any determination made by Bear Stearns in respect of clause (A) or
             (C), or (B) (as to the obligation to register or provide
             notification or information), above shall be made on the advice of
             counsel, and any determination made by Bear Stearns in respect of
             clause (C) above shall also be made after consultation with the
             Company.

             "Unduly Burdensome" means (i) any registration or notification or
             provision of information which is more burdensome to Bear Stearns
             or any of its affiliates or any of their employees, officers,
             directors and agents in any particular instance than any of the
             Known Filings, (ii) registrations, notifications or provision of
             information to in excess of 20 jurisdictions, (iii) any obligation
             to disclose information which Bear Stearns and/or any of its
             affiliates is not otherwise required to disclose to the general
             public in generally available filings (other than information that
             is readily and generally publicly available) or to disclose any
             information earlier or more frequently than it otherwise does or
             would otherwise be obligated to do, or (iv) any registration of, or
             provision of information by or in respect of, any employee, officer
             or director or agents of Bear Stearns or any of its affiliates,
             other than the provision of such information as Bear Stearns and/or
             any of its affiliates is otherwise required to disclose to the
             general public in generally available filings and other readily and
             generally publicly available information, or (v) any requirement in
             respect of the gaming laws of any jurisdiction which, in the sole
             good faith discretion of Bear Stearns, would cause undue hardship
             on, injury to the business or reputation of, or disclosure of
             confidential information of Bear Stearns or any of its affiliates
             or any of their employees, officers, directors and agents. "Known
             Filings" means initial filings with the States of New Jersey and
             West Virginia in form and substance contemplated by Bear Stearns as
             of December 1, 2004.

             Prior to declaring an Additional Termination Event with respect to
             the events described in clause (B) or (C) above, Bear Stearns shall
             use commercially reasonable efforts to transfer or assign all or a
             portion of this Transaction to any third party or parties each with
             a rating for its long term, unsecured and unsubordinated
             indebtedness of A+ or better by Standard and Poor's Rating Group,
             Inc. or its successor ("S&P"), or A1 or better by Moody's Investor
             Service, Inc. or its successor ("Moody's") or, if either S&P or
             Moody's ceases to rate such debt, at least an equivalent rating or
             better by a substitute agency rating mutually agreed by the Company
             and Bear Stearns. If, in the discretion of Bear Stearns, Bear
             Stearns is unable to effect such transfer or assignment after its

                                       19
<PAGE>

             commercially reasonable efforts on pricing terms reasonably
             acceptable to Bear Stearns and within a time period reasonably
             acceptable to Bear Stearns, Bear Stearns may designate any Exchange
             Business Day as an Early Termination Date.

             Notwithstanding any provision of the Agreement or any other
             agreement between the parties to the contrary, if, with respect to
             any Transaction relating to Shares under another 2002 ISDA Master
             Agreement between Bear Stearns and the Company (any such other
             Transaction, an "Other Transaction"), Bear Stearns or its successor
             or assign designates an Early Termination Date thereunder due to
             the occurrence of an Additional Termination Event substantially
             similar to the Additional Termination Event set forth in this
             Section 9(s), and Bear Stearns does not deliver a notice
             designating an Early Termination Date in respect of this
             Transaction due to the occurrence of the Additional Termination
             Event set forth in this Section 9(s) within 5 Exchange Business
             Days of the date of delivery of the notice designating an Early
             Termination Date in respect of any Other Transaction, then the
             Company has the right to deliver a written notice to Bear Stearns
             instructing Bear Stearns to designate an Early Termination Date
             under the Agreement with respect to this Transaction. Bear Stearns
             hereby agrees to comply with such instruction and, for the
             avoidance of doubt, such event shall constitute an Additional
             Termination Event applicable solely with respect to this
             Transaction and the Company shall be deemed to be the sole Affected
             Party and Bear Stearns shall be deemed to be the party that is not
             the Affected Party. For the avoidance of doubt, the parties hereto
             agree that the occurrence of any event which constitutes an
             Additional Termination Event as set forth in this Section 9(s) will
             also constitute an Additional Termination Event with respect to any
             Other Transactions the confirmation for which contains an
             Additional Termination Event substantially similar to that set
             forth in this Section 9(s), such that Bear Stearns has the right to
             declare an Additional Termination Event in respect of such Other
             Transaction and this Transaction.

(t)          Governing Law. New York law (without reference to choice of law
             doctrine).

(u)          Waiver of Jury Trial. Each party waives, to the fullest extent
             permitted by applicable law, any right it may have to a trial by
             jury in respect of any suit, action or proceeding relating to this
             Transaction. Each party (i) certifies that no representative, agent
             or attorney of the other party has represented, expressly or
             otherwise, that such other party would not, in the event of such a
             suit, action or proceeding, seek to enforce the foregoing waiver
             and (ii) acknowledges that it and the other party have been induced
             to enter into this Transaction, as applicable, by, among other
             things, the mutual waivers and certifications provided herein.

(v)         Tax Disclosure. Company acknowledges and understands that, in
            connection with certain disclosure and list maintenance regulations
            promulgated by the Internal Revenue Service (the "IRS"), Bear
            Stearns will retain documents related to this Transaction and other
            information. The relevant regulations cover many transactions,
            including certain transactions that create book-tax differences.
            Upon request from the IRS, Bear Stearns expects to provide such
            documents and information to the IRS. In addition, Company shall
            consult with its tax advisors with respect to any disclosure
            obligations that Company may have.

Re: Warrants Amendment


      The purpose of this letter agreement amendment (the "Amendment") is to
amend the terms and conditions of the Transaction (the "Transaction") entered
into between JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., London Branch ("JPMorgan") and
Scientific Games Corporation ("Counterparty") pursuant to a letter agreement
(the "Confirmation") dated December 23, 2004 pursuant to which JPMorgan is
purchasing from Counterparty a Number of Warrants equal to 4,295,532. This
Amendment relates to, and sets forth the terms of, the purchase by JPMorgan from
Counterparty of an additional Number of Warrants (the "Additional Number of
Warrants"). Upon the effectiveness of this Amendment to the Confirmation, all
references to "Number of Warrants" and "Transaction" in the Confirmation, as
amended, will include the Additional Number of Warrants purchased by JPMorgan
pursuant to the terms set forth below, and all references to "Daily Number of
Warrants" in the Confirmation, as amended, will include the "Additional Daily
Number of Warrants" specified below. Capitalized terms used herein without
definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Confirmation.

The terms relating to the purchase of the Additional Number of Warrants are as
follows:

1. The "Trade Date" will be December 27, 2004.

2. The "Additional Number of Warrants" will equal a Number of Warrants
determined by JPMorgan not to exceed 429,553; provided that if the Additional
Number of Options under the amendment, dated December 23, 2004, to the letter
agreement dated December 23, 2004 between JPMorgan and Counterparty is less than
12,500, the Additional Number of Warrants shall bear the same proportion to
429,553 as the Additional Number of Options bears to 12,500.

3. The "Premium" for the Additional Number of Warrants will be determined by the
Calculation Agent on the Exchange Business Day following the last day of the
Initial Execution Period based on the pricing grid attached hereto as Annex A.
If the Execution Price is between two stock price amounts in the pricing grid,
the Premium will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the
stock prices. If the Execution Price is not set forth in the pricing grid
because it is greater than the highest stock price amount in the pricing grid or
less than the lowest stock price in the pricing grid, the Calculation Agent will
determine the Premium using the same methodology that was used to create the
pricing grid. The Calculation Agent will notify Counterparty on the date on
which the Premium is determined of the Premium, the Additional Number of
Warrants, the Additional Daily Number of Warrants and the Execution Price. For
the avoidance of doubt, the "Additional Daily Number of Warrants" will equal the
Additional Number of Warrants divided by 60.

4. The "Premium Payment Date" for the Additional Number of Warrants will be the
second Exchange Business Day following the last day of the Initial Execution
Period.

<PAGE>

5. The "Execution Price" for the Additional Number of Warrants will equal the
volume-weighted average price per Share, as determined by the Calculation Agent,
at which JPMorgan or its affiliates effects certain purchases of Shares for its
own account during the Initial Execution Period.

6. The "Initial Execution Period" means each of the days, beginning on and
including the Trade Date and ending no later than December 31, 2004, on which
JPMorgan or an affiliate of JPMorgan effects certain purchases of Shares for its
own account in connection with this Amendment.

7. Counterparty represents and warrants to JPMorgan that each of it and its
affiliates is not, on the date hereof, in possession of material non-public
information with respect to Counterparty. If at any time during the Initial
Execution Period Counterparty or any of its affiliates becomes aware of any
material non-public information with respect to Counterparty, Counterparty shall
notify JPMorgan of such occurrence (but not the nature of such information),
JPMorgan (or its affiliates) as promptly as practicable shall cease effecting
any further transactions in the Shares, and the Initial Execution Period will
end at the time of such cessation.

8. Early Unwind. In the event the sale by Counterparty to the initial purchasers
of an additional USD 25,000,000 principal amount of Convertible Senior
Subordinated Debentures due 2024 (the "Additional Convertible Notes") as a
result of the exercise of the right granted with respect to such Additional
Convertible Notes is not consummated with the initial purchasers for any reason
by the Premium Payment Date (the "Early Unwind Date"), this Amendment shall
automatically terminate (the "Early Unwind") on the Early Unwind Date and (i)
this Amendment and all of the respective rights and obligations of JPMorgan and
Counterparty under this Amendment shall be cancelled and terminated and (ii)
each party shall be released and discharged by the other party from and agrees
not to make any claim against the other party with respect to any obligations or
liabilities of the other party arising out of and to be performed in connection
with this Amendment either prior to or after the Early Unwind Date.

9. Counterparty hereby repeats the representations, warranties and agreements
contained in the Confirmation with respect to the Amendment or with respect to
the Confirmation, as amended by the Amendment, as the context requires.

10. Except as amended hereby, all the terms of the Transaction and provisions in
the Confirmation shall remain and continue in full force and effect and are
hereby confirmed in all respects.

11. This Amendment may be signed in any number of counterparts, each of which
shall be an original, with the same effect as if all of the signatures thereto
and hereto were upon the same instrument.

Re: Warrants Amendment

Reference: NY33267

      The purpose of this letter agreement amendment (the "Amendment") is to
amend the terms and conditions of the Transaction (the "Transaction") entered
into between Bear, Stearns International Limited ("Bear Stearns") and Scientific
Games Corporation ("Counterparty") pursuant to a letter agreement (the
"Confirmation") dated December 23, 2004 pursuant to which Bear Stearns is
purchasing from Counterparty a Number of Warrants equal to 4,295,533. This
Amendment relates to, and sets forth the terms of, the purchase by Bear Stearns
from Counterparty of an additional Number of Warrants (the "Additional Number of
Warrants"). Upon the effectiveness of this Amendment to the Confirmation, all
references to "Number of Warrants" and "Transaction" in the Confirmation, as
amended, will include the Additional Number of Warrants purchased by Bear
Stearns pursuant to the terms set forth below, and all references to "Daily
Number of Warrants" in the Confirmation, as amended, will include the
"Additional Daily Number of Warrants" specified below. Capitalized terms used
herein without definition shall have the meanings assigned to them in the
Confirmation.

The terms relating to the purchase of the Additional Number of Warrants are as
follows:

1. The "Trade Date" will be December 27, 2004.

2. The "Additional Number of Warrants" will equal a Number of Warrants
determined by Bear Stearns not to exceed 429,553; provided that if the
Additional Number of Options under the amendment, dated December 23, 2004, to
the letter agreement dated December 23, 2004 between Bear Stearns and
Counterparty is less than 12,500, the Additional Number of Warrants shall bear
the same proportion to 429,553 as the Additional Number of Options bears to
12,500.

3. The "Premium" for the Additional Number of Warrants will be determined by the
Calculation Agent on the Exchange Business Day following the last day of the
Initial Execution Period based on the pricing grid attached hereto as Annex A.
If the Execution Price is between two stock price amounts in the pricing grid,
the Premium will be determined by a straight-line interpolation between the

determine the Premium using the same methodology that was used to create the
pricing grid. The Calculation Agent will notify Counterparty on the date on
which the Premium is determined of the Premium, the Additional Number of
Warrants, the Additional Daily Number of Warrants and the Execution Price. For
the avoidance of doubt, the "Additional Daily Number of Warrants" will equal the
Additional Number of Warrants divided by 60.

4. The "Premium Payment Date" for the Additional Number of Warrants will be the
second Exchange Business Day following the last day of the Initial Execution
Period.

5. The "Execution Price" for the Additional Number of Warrants will equal the
volume-weighted average price per Share, as determined by the Calculation Agent,
at which Bear Stearns or its affiliates effects certain purchases of Shares for
its own account during the Initial Execution Period.

6. The "Initial Execution Period" means each of the days, beginning on and
including the Trade Date and ending no later than December 31, 2004, on which
Bear Stearns or an affiliate of Bear Stearns effects certain purchases of Shares
for its own account in connection with this Amendment.

7. Counterparty represents and warrants to Bear Stearns that each of it and its

prescribed for eurocurrency funding (currently referred to as "Eurocurrency
liabilities" in Regulation D of the Board) maintained by a member bank of the
Federal Reserve System.  Such reserve requirements shall include those
imposed pursuant to Regulation D. Eurocurrency Loans shall be deemed to
constitute eurocurrency funding and to be subject to such reserve
requirements without benefit of or credit for proration, exemptions or
offsets that may be available from time to time to any Lender under such

Administrative Agent in the market where its foreign currency exchange
operations in respect of such specified currency are then being conducted, at or
about 10:00 A.M., local time, on such date for the purchase of such exchange
currency with the relevant specified currency for delivery two Business Days
later; provided that if at the time of any such determination, for any reason,

whole and not to any particular provision of this Agreement, and Section,
Schedule and Exhibit references are to this Agreement unless otherwise
specified.

            (d) The meanings given to terms defined herein shall be equally
applicable to both the singular and plural forms of such terms. Whenever the
context may require, any pronoun shall include the corresponding masculine,
feminine and neutral forms.

            (e) Any reference to any Person shall be construed to include such
Person's successors and assigns.

            1.3. Currency Conversion. (a) If more than one currency or currency
unit are at the same time recognized by the central bank of any country as the

shall be amended (and each party hereto agrees to enter into any supplemental
agreement necessary to effect any such amendment) to the extent that the
Administrative Agent determines such amendment to be necessary to reflect the
change in currency and to put the Lenders in the same position, so far as
possible, that they would have been in if no change in currency had occurred.

            Section 2. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF TRANCHE B TERM COMMITMENTS

            2.1. Tranche B Term Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and
conditions hereof, each Tranche B Term Lender severally agrees to make a term
loan denominated in Dollars (a "Tranche B Term Loan") to the Borrower on the
Effective Date in an amount not to exceed the amount of the Tranche B Term
Commitment of such Lender. The Tranche B Term Loans may from time to time be
Eurocurrency Loans or Base Rate Loans, as determined by the Borrower and
notified to the Administrative Agent in accordance with Sections 2.2 and 4.3.

            (b) In connection with the making of the Tranche B Term Loans
pursuant to Section 2.1(a), by delivering written notice (a "Conversion Notice")
to the Administrative Agent at least one Business Day prior to the Effective
Date, any Tranche D Term Lender (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement)
holding Tranche D Term Loans (as defined in the Existing Credit Agreement)
outstanding under the Existing Credit Agreement (the "Existing Term Loans") may
elect to make all or any portion of such Lender's Tranche B Term Loans requested
by the Borrower to be made on the Effective Date by converting all or a portion
of the outstanding principal amount of the Existing Term Loans held by such
Tranche D Term Lender into Tranche B Term Loans in a principal amount equal to
the amount of Existing Term Loans so converted (each such Existing Term Loan to
the extent it is to be converted, a "Converted Term Loan"). On the Effective
Date, the Converted Term Loans shall be converted for all purposes of this
Agreement into Tranche B Term Loans, and the Administrative Agent shall record
in the Register the aggregate amounts of Converted Term Loans converted into
Tranche B Term Loans. Any Conversion Notice to the Administrative Agent
delivered by an applicable Lender pursuant to this Section shall specify the
amount of such Lender's Tranche B Term Loan Commitment

                                       29
<PAGE>

and the principal amount of Existing Term Loans held by such Lender that are to
be converted into Tranche B Term Loans.

            2.2. Procedure for Tranche B Term Loan Borrowing.The Borrower shall
give the Administrative Agent irrevocable notice (which notice must be received
by the Administrative Agent prior to 10:00 A.M., New York City time, one
Business Day prior to the anticipated Effective Date) requesting that the
Tranche B Term Lenders make the Tranche B Term Loans on the Effective Date and
specifying the amount to be borrowed. Upon receipt of such notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each Tranche B Term Lender thereof.
Not later than 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the Effective Date each
Tranche B Term Lender shall make available to the Administrative Agent at the
Funding Office an amount in immediately available funds equal to the Tranche B
Term Loan or Tranche B Term Loans to be made by such Lender, except to the
extent such Lender elects to convert Existing Term Loans into Tranche B Term
Loans pursuant to Section 2.1(b). The Administrative Agent shall credit the
account of the Borrower on the books of such office of the Administrative Agent
with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the Administrative Agent by
the Tranche B Term Lenders in immediately available funds.

            2.3. Repayment of Tranche B Term Loans.The Tranche B Term Loan of
each Lender shall be repaid by the Borrower in 20 consecutive quarterly
installments, commencing on March 31, 2005, each of which shall be in an amount
equal to the product of (i) such Lender's Tranche B Term Percentage multiplied
by (ii) an amount equal to the aggregate amount of Tranche B Term Loans
outstanding on the Effective Date multiplied by (iii) the percentage set forth
below opposite such installment:

                                            Percentage of

            2.4. Incremental Term Loans.The Borrower may at any time or from
time to time, by notice to the Administrative Agent (whereupon the
Administrative Agent shall promptly deliver a copy to each of the Lenders),
request one or more additional tranches of term loans (the "Incremental Term
Loans"); provided that (i) both at the time of any such request and upon the
effectiveness of any Incremental Term Loan Amendment referred to below, no
Default or Event of Default shall exist and, at the time that any such
Incremental Term Loan is made (and after giving effect thereto), no Default or
Event of Default shall exist and (ii) the Borrower shall be in compliance with
Section 8.1 and the Consolidated Senior Debt Ratio and the Consolidated Leverage
Ratio shall be at least 0.25 below the then current level required by Section
8.1, determined on a pro forma basis as if such Incremental Term Loans had been
outstanding on the last day of the most recent fiscal quarter for testing
compliance therewith (and, as applicable, as if such Incremental Term Loans had
been outstanding during the period of four consecutive fiscal quarters then
ended). Each tranche of Incremental Term Loans shall be in an aggregate
principal amount that is not less than $25,000,000 (or, if less, the remaining
unused amount of the total Incremental Term Loans permitted hereby). The
Incremental Term Loans (a) shall be in an aggregate principal amount not
exceeding $100,000,000, (b) shall rank pari passu in right of payment and of
security with the Revolving Loans and the Tranche B Term Loans, (c) shall not
mature earlier than the Term Loan Maturity Date (but may, subject to clause (d)
below, have amortization prior to such date), (d) shall not have a weighted
average life that is shorter than the remaining weighted average life of the
Tranche B Term Loans, and (e) except as set forth above, shall be treated
substantially the same as (and in any event no more favorably than) the Tranche
B Term Loans (in each case, including with respect to mandatory and voluntary
prepayments); provided that (i) the terms and conditions applicable to
Incremental Term Loans maturing after the Term Loan Maturity Date may provide
for material additional or different financial or other covenants or prepayment
requirements applicable only during periods after the Term Loan Maturity Date
and (ii) the Incremental Term Loans may be priced differently than the Tranche B
Term Loans. Each notice shall set forth the requested amount and proposed terms
of the relevant Incremental Term Loans. Each existing Lender shall be afforded
the opportunity, but shall not be required, to provide a ratable share
(including a share of any Incremental Term Loans not subscribed to by other
existing Lenders) of any Incremental Term Loans. In the event that existing
Lenders provide commitments in an aggregate amount less than the total amount of
the Incremental Term Loans requested by the Borrower, the Borrower may arrange
for one or more banks or other financial institutions (any such bank or other
financial institution being called an "Additional Lender") to extend commitments
to provide Incremental Term Loans in an aggregate amount equal to the
unsubscribed amount. Commitments in respect of Incremental Term Loans shall
become Commitments under this Agreement pursuant to an amendment (an
"Incremental Term Loan Amendment") to this Agreement and, as appropriate, the
other Loan Documents, executed by the Borrower, each Lender agreeing to provide
such Commitment, if any, each Additional Lender, if any, and the Administrative
Agent. The Incremental Term Loan Amendment may, without the consent of any other
Lenders, effect such amendments to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
as may be necessary or appropriate, in the reasonable

                                       31
<PAGE>

opinion of the Administrative Agent, to effect the provisions of this Section.
The effectiveness of any Incremental Term Loan Amendment shall be subject to the
satisfaction on the date thereof of each of the conditions set forth in Section
6.2 (it being understood that all references to the date of "any extension of
credit" in such Section 6.2 shall be deemed to refer to the effective date of
such Incremental Term Loan Amendment) and such other conditions as the parties
thereto shall agree. No Lender shall be obligated to provide any Incremental
Term Loans, unless it so agrees.

            Section 3. AMOUNT AND TERMS OF REVOLVING COMMITMENTS

            3.1. Revolving Commitments. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, each Dollar Revolving Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit
loans denominated in Dollars ("Dollar Revolving Loans") to the Borrower from
time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period in an aggregate principal
amount at any one time outstanding which, when added to such Lender's Dollar
Revolving Percentage of the sum of (i) the Dollar L/C Obligations then
outstanding and (ii) the aggregate principal amount of the Swingline Loans then
outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lender's Dollar Revolving
Commitment. Subject to the terms and conditions hereof, each Multicurrency
Revolving Lender severally agrees to make revolving credit loans denominated in
Dollars or a Foreign Currency ("Multicurrency Revolving Loans") to the Borrower
from time to time during the Revolving Commitment Period in an aggregate
principal amount at any one time outstanding which, when added to such Lender's
Multicurrency Revolving Percentage of the Multicurrency L/C Obligations then
outstanding, does not exceed the amount of such Lender's Multicurrency Revolving
Commitment. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Agreement, in no event may Revolving Loans be borrowed under a Revolving
Facility if, after giving effect thereto (and to any concurrent repayment or
prepayment of Revolving Loans), the Total Revolving Extensions of Credit under
such Revolving Facility would exceed the Total Revolving Commitments at such
time under such Revolving Facility. During the Revolving Commitment Period, the
Borrower may use the Revolving Commitments by borrowing, prepaying and
reborrowing the Revolving Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility, in whole
or in part, all in accordance with the terms and conditions hereof. The
Revolving Loans may from time to time be Eurocurrency Loans or Base Rate Loans,
as determined by the Borrower and notified to the Administrative Agent in
accordance with Sections 3.2 and 4.3; provided that Multicurrency Revolving
Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency may only be Eurocurrency Loans.

            (b) The Borrower shall repay all outstanding Revolving Loans on the
Revolving Termination Date.

            3.2. Procedure for Revolving Loan Borrowing.(a) The Borrower may
borrow under Section 3.1 during the Revolving Commitment Period on any Business
Day, provided that the Borrower shall give the Administrative Agent irrevocable
notice (a "Borrowing Request") by telephone (which notice must be received by
the Administrative Agent prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time (or, in the
case of a Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, 12:00
Noon, London time), (a) three Business Days prior to the requested Borrowing
Date, in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, or (b) one Business Day prior to the
requested Borrowing Date, in the case of Base Rate Loans), specifying (i)
whether the requested

                                       32
<PAGE>

borrowing is a borrowing under the Dollar Revolving Facility or the
Multicurrency Revolving Facility, provided that Revolving Loans denominated in a
Foreign Currency may only be borrowed under the Multicurrency Revolving
Facility, (ii) the amount and Type of Revolving Loans to be borrowed, (iii) the
requested Borrowing Date, (iv) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans, the respective
amounts of each such Type of Revolving Loan, the respective currency therefor
and the respective lengths of the initial Interest Period therefor, and (v) the
location and number of the Borrower's account to which funds are to be
distributed. Such telephonic request shall be confirmed promptly by hand
delivery or telecopy to the Administrative Agent of a written Borrowing Request
in a form approved by the Administrative Agent and signed by the Borrower.

            (b) Each borrowing under a Revolving Facility shall be in an amount
equal to (x) in the case of Base Rate Loans, $1,000,000 or a whole multiple of
$100,000 in excess thereof (or, if the then aggregate Available Revolving
Commitments under the relevant Revolving Facility are less than $100,000, such
lesser amount), (y) in the case of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars,
$3,000,000 or a whole multiple of $500,000 in excess thereof or (z) in the case
of Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, the Foreign
Currency Equivalent of $3,000,000 or a whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess
thereof; provided that the Swingline Lender may request, on behalf of the
Borrower, borrowings under the Dollar Revolving Commitments that are Base Rate
Loans in other amounts pursuant to Section 3.4.

            (c) Upon receipt of any such Borrowing Request from the Borrower,
the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each applicable Revolving Lender
of the requested currency and aggregate amount (in both the requested currency
and Dollars) of such borrowing. Each Revolving Lender will make the amount of
its pro rata share of each such borrowing, which shall be based on its Revolving
Percentage under the relevant Revolving Facility, as applicable, available to
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Borrower (i) in the case of
Dollars, at the Funding Office prior to 12:00 Noon, New York City time, on the
Borrowing Date requested by the Borrower in funds immediately available to the
Administrative Agent or (ii) in the case of a Foreign Currency, by wire transfer
prior to 11:00 A.M., London time, on the Borrowing Date requested by the
Borrower to the account of the Administrative Agent most recently designated by
it for such purposes by notice to the Multicurrency Revolving Lenders in
immediately available funds. Such borrowing will then be made available to the
Borrower by the Administrative Agent crediting the account of the Borrower, (i)
in the case of Dollars, on the books of such Funding Office, or (ii) in the case
of a Foreign Currency, in accordance with instructions provided by the Borrower,
in each case with the aggregate of the amounts made available to the
Administrative Agent by the Revolving Lenders and in like funds as received by
the Administrative Agent.

            3.3. Swingline Commitment.(a) Subject to the terms and conditions
hereof, the Swingline Lender agrees to make a portion of the credit otherwise
available to the Borrower under the Dollar Revolving Commitments from time to
time during the Revolving Commitment Period by making swing line loans
denominated in Dollars ("Swingline Loans") to the Borrower; provided that (i)
the aggregate principal amount of Swingline Loans

                                       33
<PAGE>

outstanding at any time shall not exceed the Swingline Commitment then in effect
(notwithstanding that the Swingline Loans outstanding at any time, when
aggregated with the Swingline Lender's other outstanding Dollar Revolving
Extensions of Credit hereunder, may exceed the Swingline Commitment then in
effect), (ii) the Borrower shall not request, and the Swingline Lender shall not
make, any Swingline Loan if, after giving effect to the making of such Swingline
Loan, the aggregate amount of the Available Revolving Commitments under the
Dollar Revolving Facility would be less than zero and (iii) the Swingline Lender
shall not be required to make a Swingline Loan to refinance an existing
Swingline Loan. During the Revolving Commitment Period, the Borrower may use the
Swingline Commitment by borrowing, repaying and reborrowing, all in accordance
with the terms and conditions hereof. Swingline Loans shall be Base Rate Loans
only.

            (b) The Borrower shall repay to the Swingline Lender the then unpaid
principal amount of each Swingline Loan on the earlier of the Revolving
Termination Date and the 30th day after such Swingline Loan is made; provided
that, during each calendar month, there shall be at least two consecutive
Business Days during which the outstanding balance of the Swingline Loans shall
be zero.

            3.4. Procedure for Swingline Borrowing; Refunding of Swingline
Loans. (a) Whenever the Borrower desires that the Swingline Lender make
Swingline Loans it shall give the Swingline Lender irrevocable telephonic notice
confirmed promptly in writing (which telephonic notice must be received by the
Swingline Lender not later than 1:00 P.M., New York City time, on the proposed
Borrowing Date), specifying (i) the amount to be borrowed and (ii) the requested
Borrowing Date (which shall be a Business Day during the Revolving Commitment
Period). Each borrowing under the Swingline Commitment shall be in an amount
equal to $250,000 or a whole multiple of $100,000 in excess thereof. Not later
than 3:00 P.M., New York City time, on the Borrowing Date specified in a notice
in respect of Swingline Loans, the Swingline Lender shall make available to the
Administrative Agent at the Funding Office an amount in immediately available
funds equal to the amount of the Swingline Loan to be made by the Swingline
Lender. The Administrative Agent shall make the proceeds of such Swingline Loan
available to the Borrower on such Borrowing Date by depositing such proceeds in
the account of the Borrower with the Administrative Agent on such Borrowing Date
in immediately available funds.

            (b) The Swingline Lender, at any time and from time to time in its
sole and absolute discretion may, on behalf of the Borrower (which hereby
irrevocably directs the Swingline Lender to act on its behalf), on one Business
Day's notice given by the Swingline Lender no later than 12:00 Noon, New York
City time, request each Dollar Revolving Lender to make, and each Dollar
Revolving Lender hereby agrees to make, a Dollar Revolving Loan, in an amount
equal to such Lender's Dollar Revolving Percentage of the aggregate amount of
the Swingline Loans (the "Refunded Swingline Loans") outstanding on the date of
such notice, to repay the Swingline Lender. Each Dollar Revolving Lender shall
make the amount of such Dollar Revolving Loan available to the Administrative
Agent at the Funding Office in immediately available funds, not later than 10:00
A.M., New York City time, one Business Day after the date of such notice. The
proceeds of such Dollar Revolving Loans shall be immediately made available by
the Administrative Agent to the Swingline Lender for application by the
Swingline Lender to the repayment of the Refunded Swingline Loans. The Borrower
irrevocably authorizes the Swingline Lender to charge the Borrower's accounts
with the Administrative

                                       34
<PAGE>

Agent (up to the amount available in each such account) in order to immediately
pay the amount of such Refunded Swingline Loans to the extent amounts received
from the Dollar Revolving Lenders are not sufficient to repay in full such
Refunded Swingline Loans.

            (c) If prior to the time a Dollar Revolving Loan would have
otherwise been made pursuant to Section 3.4(b), one of the events described in
Section 9(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower
or if for any other reason, as determined by the Swingline Lender in its sole
discretion, Dollar Revolving Loans may not be made as contemplated by Section
3.4(b), each Dollar Revolving Lender shall, on the date such Dollar Revolving
Loan was to have been made pursuant to the notice referred to in Section 3.4(b)
(the "Refunding Date"), purchase for cash an undivided participating interest in
the then outstanding Swingline Loans by paying to the Swingline Lender an amount
(the "Swingline Participation Amount") equal to (i) such Lender's Dollar
Revolving Percentage times (ii) the sum of the aggregate principal amount of
Swingline Loans then outstanding that were to have been repaid with such Dollar
Revolving Loans.

            (d) Whenever, at any time after the Swingline Lender has received
from any Dollar Revolving Lender such Lender's Swingline Participation Amount,
the Swingline Lender receives any payment on account of the Swingline Loans, the
Swingline Lender will distribute to such Lender its Swingline Participation
Amount (appropriately adjusted, in the case of interest payments, to reflect the
period of time during which such Lender's participating interest was outstanding
and funded and, in the case of principal and interest payments, to reflect such
Lender's pro rata portion of such payment if such payment is not sufficient to
pay the principal of and interest on all Swingline Loans then due); provided,
however, that in the event that such payment received by the Swingline Lender is
required to be returned, such Dollar Revolving Lender will return to the
Swingline Lender any portion thereof previously distributed to it by the
Swingline Lender.

            (e) Each Dollar Revolving Lender's obligation to make the Loans
referred to in Section 3.4(b) and to purchase participating interests pursuant
to Section 3.4(c) shall be absolute and unconditional and shall not be affected
by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff, counterclaim, recoupment, defense
or other right that such Dollar Revolving Lender or the Borrower may have
against the Swingline Lender, the Borrower or any other Person for any reason
whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a Default or an Event of
Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other conditions specified in
Section 6; (iii) any adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise) of
the Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement or any other Loan Document by
the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other Revolving Lender; or (v) any
other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever, whether or not similar to any
of the foregoing.

            3.5. Commitment Fees, etc. (a) The Borrower agrees to pay to the
Administrative Agent for the account of each Revolving Lender a commitment fee
for the period from and including the Effective Date to the last day of the
Revolving Commitment Period, computed at the Commitment Fee Rate on the average
daily amount of the Available Revolving Commitment of such Lender under each
Revolving Facility during the period for which payment

                                       35
<PAGE>

is made, payable quarterly in arrears on each Fee Payment Date, commencing on
the first of such dates to occur after the date hereof.

            (b) The Borrower agrees to pay to the Administrative Agent the fees
in the amounts and on the dates previously agreed to in writing by the Borrower
and the Administrative Agent.

            3.6. Termination or Reduction of Revolving Commitments.The Borrower
shall have the right, upon not less than three Business Days' notice to the
Administrative Agent, to terminate the Revolving Commitments under either
Revolving Facility or, from time to time, to reduce the amount of the Revolving
Commitments under either Revolving Facility; provided that no such termination
or reduction of Revolving Commitments under either Revolving Facility shall be
permitted if, after giving effect thereto and to any prepayments of the
Revolving Loans or Swingline Loans made on the effective date thereof, the Total
Revolving Extensions of Credit under such Revolving Facility would exceed the
Total Revolving Commitments under such Revolving Facility. Any such reduction
shall be in an amount equal to $1,000,000, or a whole multiple thereof, and
shall reduce permanently the Revolving Commitments under the relevant Revolving
Facility then in effect.

            3.7. L/C Commitment. (a) Subject to the terms and conditions hereof,
each Issuing Lender (in reliance on the agreements set forth in Section 3.10(a)
of the Revolving Lenders under the relevant Revolving Facility), agrees to issue
letters of credit under the Dollar Revolving Facility ("Dollar Letters of
Credit") and letters of credit under the Multicurrency Revolving Facility
("Multicurrency Letters of Credit"), in each case for the account of the
Borrower on any Business Day during the Revolving Commitment Period in such form
as may be approved from time to time by such Issuing Lender; provided that no
Issuing Lender shall have any obligation to issue any Letter of Credit under a
Revolving Facility if, after giving effect to such issuance, (i) the total L/C
Obligations would exceed the L/C Commitment or (ii) the aggregate amount of the
Available Revolving Commitments under such Revolving Facility would be less than
zero. Each Dollar Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars and each
Multicurrency Letter of Credit shall be denominated in Dollars or a Foreign
Currency. Each Letter of Credit shall expire no later than the earlier of (x)
the first anniversary of its date of issuance and (y) the date that is five
Business Days prior to the Revolving Termination Date (the "Required Expiry
Date"); provided that any Letter of Credit with a one-year term may provide for
the renewal thereof for additional one-year periods (which shall in no event
extend beyond the Required Expiry Date). An Issuing Lender may, in its sole
discretion, extend a Letter of Credit beyond the Required Expiry Date, provided
that (i) each L/C Participant's interest in the Issuing Lender's obligations and
rights under and in respect of such Letter of Credit shall terminate at the
close of business on the Required Expiry Date (except with respect to demands
for drawings thereunder submitted prior to that time) and (ii) such Issuing
Lender may, as condition to extending such Letter of Credit, require additional
fees or collateral.

            (b) No Issuing Lender shall at any time be obligated to issue any
Letter of Credit hereunder if such issuance would conflict with, or cause such
Issuing Lender or any L/C Participant to exceed any limits imposed by, any
applicable Requirement of Law.


                                       36
<PAGE>

            (c) The Existing Letters of Credit outstanding on the Effective Date
shall constitute Letters of Credit hereunder.

            3.8. Procedure for Issuance of Letters of Credit.The Borrower may
from time to time request that an Issuing Lender issue a Dollar Letter of Credit
or a Multicurrency Letter of Credit by delivering to such Issuing Lender at its
address for notices specified herein an Application therefor, completed to the
satisfaction of such Issuing Lender, and such other certificates, documents and
other papers and information as such Issuing Lender may request. Upon receipt of
any Application, an Issuing Lender will notify the Administrative Agent of (i)
whether the Application is with respect to a Dollar Letter of Credit or
Multicurrency Letter of Credit and (ii) the amount, currency, requested
expiration and beneficiary of the requested Letter of Credit. Upon receipt of
confirmation from the Administrative Agent that after giving effect to the
requested issuance, the Available Revolving Commitments under the relevant
Revolving Facility would not be less than zero, such Issuing Lender will process
such Application and the certificates, documents and other papers and
information delivered to it in connection therewith in accordance with its
customary procedures and shall promptly issue the Letter of Credit requested
thereby (but in no event shall such Issuing Lender be required to issue any
Letter of Credit earlier than three Business Days after its receipt of the
Application therefor and all such other certificates, documents and other papers
and information relating thereto) by issuing the original of such Letter of
Credit to the beneficiary thereof or as otherwise may be agreed to by such
Issuing Lender and the Borrower. Each Issuing Lender shall furnish a copy of
such Letter of Credit to the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent)
promptly following the issuance thereof. Each Issuing Lender shall promptly
furnish to the Administrative Agent, which shall in turn promptly furnish to the
Lenders, notice of the issuance of each Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing
Lender (including the amount and currency thereof).

            3.9. Fees and Other Charges. The Borrower will pay a fee on all
outstanding Letters of Credit under each Revolving Facility (determined based
upon Dollar Equivalents in the case of Multicurrency Letters of Credit issued in
Foreign Currencies) at a per annum rate equal to the Applicable Margin then in
effect with respect to Eurocurrency Loans under such Revolving Facility, shared
ratably among the Revolving Lenders under such Revolving Facility. Such fees
shall be payable quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the
issuance date. In addition, the Borrower shall pay to the relevant Issuing
Lender for its own account a fronting fee on the undrawn and unexpired amount of
each Letter of Credit as agreed by the Borrower and the Issuing Lender, payable
quarterly in arrears on each L/C Fee Payment Date after the issuance date.

            (b) In addition to the foregoing fees, the Borrower shall pay or
reimburse each Issuing Lender for such normal and customary costs and expenses
as are incurred or charged by such Issuing Lender in issuing, negotiating,
effecting payment under, amending or otherwise administering any Letter of
Credit to the extent that the fees and expenses associated with the issuance of
such Letter of Credit exceed the fronting fee therefor as specified in Section
3.9(a).

            3.10. L/C Participations.(a) Each Issuing Lender irrevocably agrees
to grant and hereby grants to each L/C Participant, and, to induce such Issuing
Lender to issue Letters of Credit hereunder, each L/C Participant irrevocably
agrees to accept and purchase and hereby

                                       37
<PAGE>

accepts and purchases from such Issuing Lender, on the terms and conditions set
forth below, for such L/C Participant's own account and risk an undivided
interest equal to (i) such L/C Participant's Dollar Revolving Percentage in each
Issuing Lender's obligations and rights under and in respect of each Dollar
Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender hereunder and the amount of each
draft paid by such Issuing Lender thereunder and (ii) such L/C Participant's
Multicurrency Revolving Percentage in each Issuing Lender's obligations and
rights under and in respect of each Multicurrency Letter of Credit issued by
such Issuing Lender hereunder and the amount of each draft paid by such Issuing
Lender thereunder. Each L/C Participant in respect of a Letter of Credit
unconditionally and irrevocably agrees with the Issuing Lender in respect of
such Letter of Credit that, if a draft is paid under such Letter of Credit for
which such Issuing Lender is not reimbursed in full by the Borrower in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement, such L/C Participant shall pay to
the Administrative Agent upon demand of such Issuing Lender an amount equal to
such L/C Participant's Revolving Percentage under the relevant Revolving
Facility of the amount of such draft, or any part thereof, that is not so
reimbursed; provided that the related Reimbursement Obligation with respect to a
Multicurrency Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency may be
converted to Dollars pursuant to Section 3.11. The Administrative Agent shall
promptly forward such amounts to the relevant Issuing Lender.

            (b) If any amount required to be paid by any L/C Participant to the
Administrative Agent for the account of an Issuing Lender pursuant to Section
3.10(a) in respect of any unreimbursed portion of any payment made by such
Issuing Lender under any Letter of Credit is paid to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Issuing Lender within three Business Days after the date
such payment is due, such L/C Participant shall pay to the Administrative Agent
for the account of such Issuing Lender on demand an amount equal to the product
of (i) such amount times (ii) the daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate
during the period from and including the date such payment is required to the
date on which such payment is immediately available to such Issuing Lender times
(iii) a fraction the numerator of which is the number of days that elapse during
such period and the denominator of which is 360. If any such amount required to
be paid by any L/C Participant pursuant to Section 3.10(a) is not made available
to the Administrative Agent for the account of the relevant Issuing Lender by
such L/C Participant within three Business Days after the date such payment is
due, such Issuing Lender shall be entitled to recover from such L/C Participant,
on demand, such amount with interest thereon calculated from such due date at
the rate per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving
Facility. A certificate of such Issuing Lender submitted to any L/C Participant
with respect to any amounts owing under this Section shall be conclusive in the
absence of manifest error.

            (c) Whenever, at any time after an Issuing Lender has made payment
under any Letter of Credit and has received from any L/C Participant its pro
rata share of such payment in accordance with Section 3.10(a), the
Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender receives any payment related to such
Letter of Credit (whether directly from the Borrower or otherwise, including
proceeds of Collateral applied thereto by such Issuing Lender), or any payment
of interest on account thereof, the Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender,
as the case may be, will distribute to such L/C Participant its pro rata share
thereof; provided, however, that in the event that any such payment received by
Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, shall be
required to be returned by the Administrative Agent or such Issuing

                                       38
<PAGE>

Lender, such L/C Participant shall return to the Administrative Agent for the
account of such Issuing Lender the portion thereof previously distributed by the
Administrative Agent or such Issuing Lender, as the case may be, to it.

            (d) Each L/C Participant's obligation to purchase participating
interests pursuant to Section 3.10(b) shall be absolute and unconditional and
shall not be affected by any circumstance, including (i) any setoff,
counterclaim, recoupment, defense or other right that such L/C Participant or
the Borrower may have against any Issuing Lender, the Borrower or any other
Person for any reason whatsoever; (ii) the occurrence or continuance of a
Default or an Event of Default or the failure to satisfy any of the other
conditions specified in Section 6; (iii) any adverse change in the condition
(financial or otherwise) of the Borrower; (iv) any breach of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document by the Borrower, any other Loan Party or any other L/C
Participant; or (v) any other circumstance, happening or event whatsoever,
whether or not similar to any of the foregoing.

            3.11. Reimbursement Obligation of the Borrower.The Borrower agrees
to reimburse each Issuing Lender on the Business Day next succeeding the
Business Day on which such Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of the date and
amount of a draft presented under any Letter of Credit and paid by such Issuing
Lender for the amount of such draft so paid and any taxes, fees, charges or
other reasonable costs or expenses incurred by such Issuing Lender in connection
with such payment. Each such payment shall be made to the relevant Issuing
Lender in Dollars and in immediately available funds, provided that (a) the
Borrower may, at its option, elect by notice to such Issuing Lender immediately
following receipt of notice of such draft, to reimburse a draft paid in a
Foreign Currency in the same Foreign Currency and (b) if the Borrower does not
make such election, or if (notwithstanding such election) the Borrower does not
in fact reimburse any such draft made in a Foreign Currency on or prior to the
date required pursuant to the first sentence of this Section 3.11, then such
Issuing Lender shall convert such Reimbursement Obligation into Dollars at the
rate of exchange then available to such Issuing Lender in the interbank market
where its foreign currency exchange operations in respect of such Foreign
Currency are then being conducted and the Borrower shall thereafter be required
to reimburse such Issuing Lender in Dollars for such Reimbursement Obligation
(in the amount so converted). Interest shall be payable on any such amounts
denominated in Dollars from the date on which the relevant draft is paid until
the relevant Issuing Lender receives payment in full at the rate set forth in
(i) until the Business Day next succeeding the date of the relevant notice,
Section 4.5(b) with respect to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving
Facility and (ii) thereafter, Section 4.5(c). Interest shall be payable on any
such amounts denominated in a Foreign Currency from the date on which the
relevant draft is paid until the relevant Issuing Lender receives payment in
full or conversion to Dollars as provided herein (i) until the Business Day next
succeeding the date of the relevant notice, at the rate determined by the
relevant Issuing Lender as its cost of funding such payment plus the Applicable
Margin with respect to Eurocurrency Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility
and (ii) thereafter, the rate set forth in Section 4.5(c). Each drawing under
any Dollar Letter of Credit shall (unless an event of the type described in
clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9(f) shall have occurred and be continuing with
respect to the Borrower, in which case the procedures specified in Section 3.10
for funding by L/C Participants shall apply) constitute a request by the
Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a borrowing pursuant to Section 3.2 of
Base Rate Loans under the Dollar Revolving Facility (or, at

                                       39
<PAGE>

the option of the Administrative Agent and the Swingline Lender in their sole
discretion, a borrowing pursuant to Section 3.4 of Swingline Loans) in the
amount of such drawing except that, in such event, Borrower is not deemed to
have given any representations and warranties pursuant to Section 6.2. Except in
the case of a drawing denominated in a Foreign Currency that the Borrower elects
to reimburse, and in fact reimburses, in such Foreign Currency as provided
above, each drawing under any Multicurrency Letter of Credit shall (unless an
event of the type described in clause (i) or (ii) of Section 9(f) shall have
occurred and be continuing with respect to the Borrower, in which case the
procedures specified in Section 3.10 for funding by L/C Participants shall
apply), constitute a request by the Borrower to the Administrative Agent for a
borrowing pursuant to Section 3.2 of Base Rate Loans under the Multicurrency
Revolving Facility denominated in Dollars in the amount of such drawing (or, in
the case of a drawing denominated in a Foreign Currency, the amount in Dollars
into which the Reimbursement Obligation was converted) except that, in either
such event, the Borrower is not deemed to have given any representations and
warranties pursuant to Section 6.2. The Borrowing Date with respect to such
borrowing shall be the first date on which a borrowing of Revolving Loans (or,
if applicable, Swingline Loans) could be made pursuant to Section 3.2 (or, if
applicable, Section 3.4), if the Administrative Agent had received a notice of
such borrowing at the time the Administrative Agent receives notice from such
Issuing Lender of such drawing under such Letter of Credit.

            3.12. Obligations Absolute.The Borrower's obligations under Section
3.11 shall be absolute and unconditional under any and all circumstances and
irrespective of any setoff, counterclaim or defense to payment that the Borrower
may have or have had against any Issuing Lender, any beneficiary of a Letter of
Credit or any other Person. The Borrower also agrees with each Issuing Lender
that such Issuing Lender not shall be responsible for, and the Borrower's
Reimbursement Obligations under Section 3.11 shall not be affected by, among
other things, the validity or genuineness of documents or of any endorsements
thereon, even though such documents shall in fact prove to be invalid,
fraudulent or forged, or any dispute between or among the Borrower and any
beneficiary of any Letter of Credit or any other party to which such Letter of
Credit may be transferred or any claims whatsoever of the Borrower against any
beneficiary of such Letter of Credit or any such transferee. No Issuing Lender
shall be liable for any error, omission, interruption or delay in transmission,
dispatch or delivery of any message or advice, however transmitted, in
connection with any Letter of Credit, except for errors or omissions found by a
final and nonappealable decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have
resulted from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of such Issuing Lender.
The Borrower agrees that any action taken or omitted by an Issuing Lender under
or in connection with any Letter of Credit or the related drafts or documents,
if done in the absence of gross negligence or willful misconduct and in
accordance with the standards of care specified in the Uniform Commercial Code
of the State of New York and UCP 500, shall be binding on the Borrower and shall
not result in any liability of such Issuing Lender to the Borrower.

            3.13. Letter of Credit Payments.If any draft shall be presented for
payment under any Letter of Credit, the relevant Issuing Lender shall promptly
notify the Borrower of the date and amount thereof. The responsibility of the
relevant Issuing Lender to the Borrower in connection with any draft presented
for payment under any Letter of Credit issued by such Issuing Lender shall, in
addition to any payment obligation expressly provided for in such Letter of
Credit, be limited to determining in compliance with UCP 500 that the documents
(including each draft) delivered under such Letter

                                       40
<PAGE>

of Credit in connection with such presentment are substantially in conformity
with the requirements of such Letter of Credit.

            3.14. Applications.To the extent that any provision of any
Application related to any Letter of Credit is inconsistent with the provisions
of this Section 3, the provisions of this Section 3 shall apply.

                    Section 4. GENERAL PROVISIONS APPLICABLE
                         TO LOANS AND LETTERS OF CREDIT

            4.1. Optional Prepayments.(a) The Borrower may at any time and from
time to time prepay the Loans (other than Multicurrency Revolving Loans
denominated in a Foreign Currency) under the relevant Facility, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty, upon irrevocable notice delivered to the
Administrative Agent at least three Business Days prior thereto in the case of
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars and at least one Business Day prior
thereto in the case of Base Rate Loans, which notice shall specify the date and
amount of prepayment and whether the prepayment is of Eurocurrency Loans
denominated in Dollars or Base Rate Loans; provided that if a Eurocurrency Loan
denominated in Dollars is prepaid on any day other than the last day of the
Interest Period applicable thereto, the Borrower shall also pay any amounts
owing pursuant to Section 4.11. Upon receipt of any such notice the
Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender thereof. If any
such notice is given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and
payable on the date specified therein, together with (except in the case of
Dollar Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans and are prepaid prior to the end
of the Revolving Commitment Period) accrued interest to such date on the amount
prepaid. Partial prepayments of Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Loans
denominated in Dollars shall be in an aggregate principal amount of $1,000,000
or a whole multiple thereof. Partial prepayments of Swingline Loans shall be in
an aggregate principal amount of $100,000 or a whole multiple thereof.

            (b) The Borrower may at any time and from time to time prepay
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, in whole or in
part, without premium or penalty except as specified in Section 4.11, upon
irrevocable notice (which notice must be received by the Administrative Agent
prior to 11:00 A.M., New York City time, three Business Days before the date of
prepayment) specifying the date and amount of prepayment. If any such notice is
given, the amount specified in such notice shall be due and payable on the date
specified therein, together with any amounts payable pursuant to Section 4.11
and accrued interest to such date on the amount prepaid. Partial prepayments of
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be in a
minimum principal amount equal to the Foreign Currency Equivalent of $1,000,000
in the relevant Foreign Currency or a multiple of the Foreign Currency
Equivalent of $100,000 in the relevant Foreign Currency in excess thereof.

            4.2. Mandatory Prepayments. If any Capital Stock shall be issued by
any Group Member (other than to any other Group Member) at a time when the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio exceeds 3.00 to 1.00, an amount equal to 50% of the
Net Cash Proceeds thereof (or such lesser amount if, after giving effect to a
prepayment in such lesser amount, the

                                       41
<PAGE>

Consolidated Leverage Ratio is equal to or less than 3.00 to 1.00) shall be
applied no later than one Business Day following the date of such issuance
toward the prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loans as set forth in Section
4.2(d).

            (b) If any Indebtedness shall be incurred by any Group Member (other
than Excluded Indebtedness), an amount equal to 100% of the Net Cash Proceeds
thereof shall be applied no later than one Business Day following the date of
such incurrence toward the prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loans as set forth
in Section 4.2(d).

            (c) If on any date any Group Member shall receive Net Cash Proceeds
from any Asset Sale or Recovery Event then, unless a Reinvestment Notice shall
be delivered in respect thereof, such Net Cash Proceeds shall be applied no
later than one Business Day following such date toward the prepayment of the
Tranche B Term Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d); provided, that,
notwithstanding the foregoing, (i) the aggregate Net Cash Proceeds of Asset
Sales and Recovery Events that may be excluded from the foregoing requirement
pursuant to a Reinvestment Notice shall not exceed $80,000,000 in any fiscal
year of the Borrower and (ii) on each Reinvestment Prepayment Date, an amount
equal to the Reinvestment Prepayment Amount with respect to the relevant
Reinvestment Event shall be applied toward the prepayment of the Tranche B Term
Loans as set forth in Section 4.2(d).

            (d) Amounts to be applied in connection with prepayments made
pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be applied to the prepayment of the Tranche B Term
Loans in accordance with Section 4.8(b). The application of any prepayment
pursuant to Section 4.2 shall be made, first, to Base Rate Loans under the
relevant Facility and, second, to Eurocurrency Loans under such Facility. Each
prepayment of the Loans under Section 4.2 shall be accompanied by accrued
interest to the date of such prepayment on the amount prepaid.

            (e) If, on any Calculation Date, the Total Multicurrency Revolving
Extensions of Credit exceed an amount equal to 105% of the Total Multicurrency
Revolving Commitments on such date, the Borrower shall, without notice or
demand, immediately repay such of the outstanding Multicurrency Revolving Loans
in an aggregate principal amount such that, after giving effect thereto, the
Total Multicurrency Revolving Extensions of Credit do not exceed the Total
Multicurrency Revolving Commitments, together with interest accrued to the date
of such payment or prepayment on the principal so prepaid if required hereby and
any amounts payable under Section 4.11 in connection therewith. After prepaying
any Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in Dollars, the Borrower may in
lieu of prepaying Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign
Currency in order to comply with this paragraph deposit amounts in the relevant
Foreign Currency or Foreign Currencies in a Cash Collateral Account in
accordance with the next succeeding sentence equal to the aggregate principal
amount of Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency
required to be prepaid. To the extent that after giving effect to any prepayment
of Multicurrency Revolving Loans required by this paragraph, the Total
Multicurrency Revolving Extensions of Credit at such time exceed the Total
Multicurrency Revolving Commitments at such time, the Borrower shall, without
notice or demand, immediately deposit in a Cash Collateral Account upon terms
reasonably satisfactory to the Administrative Agent an amount equal to the
amount by which Total Multicurrency Revolving Extensions of Credit exceed the
Total Multicurrency Revolving

                                       42
<PAGE>

Commitments. The Administrative Agent shall apply any cash deposited in the Cash
Collateral Account (to the extent thereof) to pay any Reimbursement Obligations
which are or become due thereafter and/or to repay Multicurrency Revolving Loans
denominated in a Foreign Currency at the end of the Interest Periods therefor;
provided that (x) the Administrative Agent shall release to the Borrower from
time to time such portion of the amount on deposit in the Cash Collateral
Account to the extent such amount is not required to be so deposited in order
for the Borrower to be in compliance with this paragraph and (y) the
Administrative Agent may so apply such cash at any time after the occurrence and
during the continuation of an Event of Default. "Cash Collateral Account" means
an account specifically established by the Borrower with the Administrative
Agent for purposes of this Section 4.2 and hereby pledged to the Administrative
Agent and over which the Administrative Agent shall have exclusive dominion and
control, including the right of withdrawal for application in accordance with
this Section 4.2.

            4.3. Conversion and Continuation Options.(a) The Borrower may elect
from time to time to convert Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars to Base
Rate Loans by giving the Administrative Agent at least two Business Days' prior
irrevocable notice of such election, provided that any such conversion of
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars may only be made on the last day of an
Interest Period with respect thereto. The Borrower may elect from time to time
to convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars by
giving the Administrative Agent at least three Business Days' prior irrevocable
notice of such election (which notice shall specify the length of the initial
Interest Period therefor), provided that no Base Rate Loan under a particular
Facility may be converted into a Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars when
any Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent
or the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in
its or their sole discretion not to permit such conversions. Upon receipt of any
such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender
thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Borrower may not elect to convert
the currency in which any Loan is denominated.

            (b) Any Eurocurrency Loan may be continued as such upon the
expiration of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto by the
Borrower giving irrevocable notice to the Administrative Agent, in accordance
with the applicable provisions of the term "Interest Period" set forth in
Section 1.1, of the length of the next Interest Period to be applicable to such
Loans, provided that no Eurocurrency Loan denominated in Dollars under a
particular Facility may be continued as such when any Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing and the Administrative Agent has or the Majority
Facility Lenders in respect of such Facility have determined in its or their
sole discretion not to permit such continuations, and provided, further, that if
the Borrower shall fail to give any required notice as described above in this
paragraph or if such continuation is not permitted pursuant to the preceding
proviso such Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars shall be automatically
converted to Base Rate Loans on the last day of such then expiring Interest
Period and, if the Borrower shall fail to give such notice of continuation of a
Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency, such
Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be
automatically continued for an Interest Period of one month. Upon receipt of any
such notice the Administrative Agent shall promptly notify each relevant Lender
thereof.


                                       43
<PAGE>

            4.4. Limitations on Eurocurrency Tranches.Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary in this Agreement, all borrowings, conversions and continuations
of Eurocurrency Loans hereunder and all selections of Interest Periods hereunder
shall be in such amounts and be made pursuant to such elections so that, (a)
after giving effect thereto, the aggregate principal amount of the Eurocurrency
Loans comprising each Eurocurrency Tranche shall be equal to $3,000,000 or a
whole multiple of $1,000,000 in excess thereof and (b) no more than ten
Eurocurrency Tranches shall be outstanding at any one time.

            4.5. Interest Rates and Payment Dates. Each Eurocurrency Loan shall
bear interest for each day during each Interest Period with respect thereto at a
rate per annum equal to the Eurocurrency Rate determined for such day plus the
Applicable Margin.

            (b) Each Base Rate Loan shall bear interest at a rate per annum
equal to the Base Rate plus the Applicable Margin.

            (c) (i) If all or a portion of the principal amount of any Loan or
Reimbursement Obligation shall not be paid when due (whether at the stated
maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue amount shall bear interest
at a rate per annum equal to (x) in the case of the Loans, the rate that would
otherwise be applicable thereto pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this
Section plus 2% or (y) in the case of Reimbursement Obligations, the rate
applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility plus 2%, and
(ii) if all or a portion of any interest payable on any Loan or Reimbursement
Obligation or any fee or other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when
due (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), such overdue
amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum equal to (A) the rate then
applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility plus 2% (or, in the
case of any such other amounts that do not relate to a particular Facility, the
rate then applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Revolving Facility
plus 2%), in the case of amounts that are owing in Dollars, or (B)(I) the
Eurocurrency Rate in respect of the relevant Foreign Currency plus (II) 2%, in
the case of amounts owing that are denominated in Foreign Currencies, in each
case, with respect to clauses (i) and (ii) above, from the date of such
non-payment until such amount is paid in full (after as well as before
judgment).

            (d) Interest shall be payable in arrears on each Interest Payment
Date, provided that interest accruing pursuant to paragraph (c) of this Section
shall be payable from time to time on demand.

            4.6. Computation of Interest and Fees.(a) Interest and fees payable
pursuant hereto shall be calculated on the basis of a 360-day year for the
actual days elapsed, except that, with respect to Base Rate Loans the rate of
interest on which is calculated on the basis of the Prime Rate, the interest
thereon shall be calculated on the basis of a 365- (or 366-, as the case may be)
day year for the actual days elapsed. The Administrative Agent shall as soon as
practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of each determination
of a Eurocurrency Rate. Any change in the interest rate on a Loan resulting from
a change in the Base Rate or the Eurocurrency Reserve Requirements shall become
effective as of the opening of business on the day on which such change becomes
effective. The Administrative Agent shall as

                                       44
<PAGE>

soon as practicable notify the Borrower and the relevant Lenders of the
effective date and the amount of each such change in interest rate.

            (b) Each determination of an interest rate by the Administrative
Agent pursuant to any provision of this Agreement shall be conclusive and
binding on the Borrower and the Lenders in the absence of manifest error. The
Administrative Agent shall, at the request of the Borrower, deliver to the
Borrower a statement showing the quotations used by the Administrative Agent in
determining any interest rate pursuant to Section 4.5(a).

            4.7. Inability to Determine Interest Rate.If prior to the first day
of any Interest Period:

                  (a) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
           determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower
           absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
           relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
           ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period in
           respect of Loans denominated in Dollars, or

                  (b) the Administrative Agent shall have received notice from
           the Majority Facility Lenders in respect of the relevant Facility
           that the Eurocurrency Rate determined or to be determined for such
           Interest Period will not adequately and fairly reflect the cost to
           such Lenders (as conclusively certified by such Lenders) of making or
           maintaining their affected Loans during such Interest Period, or

                  (c) the Administrative Agent shall have determined (which
           determination shall be conclusive and binding upon the Borrower,
           absent manifest error) that, by reason of circumstances affecting the
           relevant market, adequate and reasonable means do not exist for
           ascertaining the Eurocurrency Rate for such Interest Period in
           respect of any Foreign Currency (any such Foreign Currency is
           referred to as an "Affected Foreign Currency"),

the Administrative Agent shall give telecopy or telephonic notice thereof to
the Borrower and the relevant Lenders as soon as practicable thereafter.  If
such notice is given (x) pursuant to clause (a) or (b) of this Section 4.7 in
respect of Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars, then (i) any
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars under the relevant Facility
requested to be made on the first day of such Interest Period shall be made
as Base Rate Loans, (ii) any Loans under the relevant Facility that were to
have been converted on the first day of such Interest Period to Eurocurrency
Loans denominated in Dollars shall be continued as Base Rate Loans and
(iii) any outstanding Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars under the
relevant Facility shall be converted, on the last day of the then-current
Interest Period, to Base Rate Loans and (y) in respect of any Multicurrency
Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, then (i) any Multicurrency
Revolving Loans in an Affected Foreign Currency requested to be made on the
first day of such Interest Period shall not be made and (ii) any outstanding
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in an Affected Foreign Currency
shall be due and payable on the first day of such Interest Period.  Until
such notice has been withdrawn by the Administrative Agent, no further
Eurocurrency Loans denominated in Dollars under the relevant Facility or
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency in an
Affected Foreign

                                       45
<PAGE>

Currency shall be made or continued as such, nor shall the Borrower have the
right to convert Loans under the relevant Facility to Eurocurrency Loans.

            4.8. Pro Rata Treatment and Payments.(a) Each borrowing by the
Borrower from the Lenders hereunder, each payment by the Borrower on account of
any commitment fee and any reduction of the Commitments of the Lenders shall be
made pro rata according to the respective Term Percentages, Dollar Revolving
Percentages or Multicurrency Revolving Percentages, as the case may be, of the
relevant Lenders.

            (b) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on
account of principal of and interest on the Tranche B Term Loans shall be made
pro rata according to the respective outstanding principal amounts of the
Tranche B Term Loans then held by the Tranche B Lenders. The amount of each
principal prepayment of the Tranche B Term Loans shall be applied to reduce the
then remaining installments of the Tranche B Term Loans pro rata based upon the
then remaining principal amount thereof. Amounts repaid or prepaid on account of
the Tranche B Term Loans may not be reborrowed.

            (c) Each payment (including each prepayment) by the Borrower on
account of principal of and interest on the Revolving Loans under a Revolving
Facility shall be made pro rata according to the respective outstanding
principal amounts of the Revolving Loans under such Revolving Facility then held
by the Revolving Lenders under such Revolving Facility. Each payment in respect
of Reimbursement Obligations in respect of any Letter of Credit shall be made to
the Issuing Lender that issued such Letter of Credit.

            (d) All payments (including prepayments) to be made by the Borrower
hereunder, whether on account of principal, interest, fees or otherwise, shall
be made without setoff or counterclaim and shall be made prior to 12:00 Noon,
New York City time, on the due date thereof to the Administrative Agent, for the
account of the Lenders, at the Funding Office, in Dollars and in immediately
available funds, except payments to be made directly to an Issuing Lender or
Swingline Lender as expressly provided herein and except that payments pursuant
to Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and 11.5 shall be made directly to the Persons
entitled thereto; provided that payments made in a Foreign Currency shall be
made prior to 12:00 Noon, local time in the place of payment, on the due date
thereof to the Administrative Agent at the office of the Administrative Agent
designated by the Administrative Agent from time to time for payments made in
such Foreign Currency. All payments to be made by the Borrower hereunder shall
be made in Dollars; provided that (i) payments in respect of the principal of or
interest on any Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency
shall be made in such Foreign Currency, (ii) any amounts payable under Section
4.9 or 4.11 in respect of any Multicurrency Revolving Loan or Multicurrency
Letter of Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency shall be payable in such
Foreign Currency if the certificate submitted by the applicable Lender or
Issuing Lender in respect of such amount specifies such amount in such Foreign
Currency and (iii) payments in respect of Multicurrency Letters of Credit and
Multicurrency L/C Obligations denominated in a Foreign Currency may be made in
such Foreign Currency to the extent permitted by, and shall be made to the
extent required by, the applicable provisions of this Agreement. The
Administrative Agent shall distribute such payments received by it for the
account of any other Person to the appropriate recipient promptly upon receipt
in like funds as

                                       46
<PAGE>

received. If any payment hereunder (other than payments on the Eurocurrency
Loans) becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day, such payment
shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day. If any payment on a
Eurocurrency Loan becomes due and payable on a day other than a Business Day,
the maturity thereof shall be extended to the next succeeding Business Day
unless the result of such extension would be to extend such payment into another
calendar month, in which event such payment shall be made on the immediately
preceding Business Day. In the case of any extension of any payment of principal
pursuant to the preceding two sentences, interest thereon shall be payable at
the then applicable rate during such extension.

            (e) The failure of any Lender to make any Loan required to be made
by it shall not relieve any other Lender of its obligations hereunder; provided
that the Commitments of the Lenders are several and no Lender shall be
responsible for any other Lender's failure to make Loans as required. Unless the
Administrative Agent shall have been notified in writing by any Lender prior to
a borrowing that such Lender will not make the amount that would constitute its
share of such borrowing available to the Administrative Agent, the
Administrative Agent may assume that such Lender is making such amount available
to the Administrative Agent, and the Administrative Agent may, in reliance upon
such assumption, make available to the Borrower a corresponding amount. If such
amount is not made available to the Administrative Agent by the required time on
the Borrowing Date therefor, such Lender shall pay to the Administrative Agent,
on demand, such amount with interest thereon (i) in the case of Loans
denominated in Dollars, at the greater of (A) a rate equal to the daily average
Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the Administrative
Agent in accordance with banking industry rates on interbank compensation for
the period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the
Administrative Agent and (ii) in the case of Multicurrency Revolving Loans
denominated in a Foreign Currency, at a rate per annum reasonably determined by
the Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount for the
period until such Lender makes such amount immediately available to the
Administrative Agent. A certificate of the Administrative Agent submitted to any
Lender with respect to any amounts owing under this paragraph shall be
conclusive in the absence of manifest error. If such Lender's share of such
borrowing is not made available to the Administrative Agent by such Lender
within three Business Days of such Borrowing Date, the Administrative Agent
shall also be entitled to recover such amount with interest thereon at the rate
per annum applicable to Base Rate Loans under the relevant Facility (or with
respect to Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, at a
rate per annum reasonably determined by the Administrative Agent to be the cost
to it of funding such amount), on demand, from the Borrower.

            (f) Unless the Administrative Agent shall have been notified in
writing by the Borrower prior to the date of any payment due to be made by the
Borrower hereunder that the Borrower will not make such payment to the
Administrative Agent, the Administrative Agent may assume that the Borrower is
making such payment, and the Administrative Agent may, but shall not be required
to, in reliance upon such assumption, make available to the Lenders under the
relevant Facility or the Issuing Lender their respective pro rata shares of a
corresponding amount. If such payment is not made to the Administrative Agent by
the Borrower within three Business Days after such due date, the Administrative
Agent shall be entitled to recover, on demand, from each Lender to which any
amount which was made available pursuant to the

                                       47
<PAGE>

preceding sentence, such amount with interest thereon (i) in the case of Loans
denominated in Dollars, at the greater of (A) the rate per annum equal to the
daily average Federal Funds Effective Rate and (B) a rate determined by the
Administrative Agent in accordance with banking industry rates on interbank
compensation and (ii) in the case of Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated
in a Foreign Currency, at a rate per annum reasonably determined by the
Administrative Agent to be the cost to it of funding such amount. Nothing herein
shall be deemed to limit the rights of the Administrative Agent or any Lender
against the Borrower.

            4.9. Requirements of Law.(a) If the adoption of or any change in any
Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance
by any Lender or any Issuing Lender with any request or directive (whether or
not having the force of law) from any central bank or other Governmental
Authority made subsequent to the date hereof:

                (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
           deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held
           by, deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of, advances,
           loans or other extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of
           funds by, any office of such Lender or Issuing Lender that is not
           otherwise included in the determination of the Eurocurrency Rate
           hereunder; or

                (ii) shall impose on such Lender or Issuing Lender any other
           condition;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Lender
or Issuing Lender, by an amount that such Lender or Issuing Lender deems to
be material, of making, converting into, continuing or maintaining
Eurocurrency Loans or issuing, maintaining or participating in Letters of
Credit, or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof,
then, in any such case, the Borrower shall promptly pay such Lender or
Issuing Lender, upon its demand, any additional amounts necessary to
compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender for such increased cost or reduced
amount received or receivable.  If any Lender or Issuing Lender becomes
entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this paragraph, it shall
promptly notify the Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of the
event by reason of which it has become so entitled.

            (b) If any Lender or Issuing Lender shall have determined that the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law regarding capital adequacy
or in the interpretation or application thereof or compliance by such Lender or
Issuing Lender or any corporation controlling such Lender or Issuing Lender with
any request or directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the
force of law) from any Governmental Authority made subsequent to the date hereof
shall have the effect of reducing the rate of return on such Lender's or Issuing
Lender's or such corporation's capital as a consequence of its obligations
hereunder or under or in respect of any Letter of Credit to a level below that
which such Lender or Issuing Lender or such corporation could have achieved but
for such adoption, change or compliance (taking into consideration such Lender's
or Issuing Lender's or such corporation's policies with respect to capital
adequacy) by an amount deemed by such Lender or Issuing Lender to be material,
then from time to time, after submission by such Lender or Issuing Lender to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent) of a written request
therefor, the Borrower shall pay to such Lender or Issuing Lender such
additional amount or amounts as will

                                       48
<PAGE>

compensate such Lender or Issuing Lender or such corporation for such reduction.
Failure or delay on the part of any Lender or Issuing Lender to demand
compensation pursuant to this Section shall not constitute a waiver of such
Lender's or Issuing Lender's right to demand such compensation; provided that
the Borrower shall not be required to compensate a Lender or Issuing Lender
pursuant to this paragraph for any amounts incurred more than six months prior
to the date that such Lender or Issuing Lender notifies the Borrower of such
Lender's or Issuing Lender's intention to claim compensation therefor; and
provided, further, that, if the circumstances giving rise to such claim have a
retroactive effect, then such six-month period shall be extended to include the
period of such retroactive effect.

            (c) If any Governmental Authority of the jurisdiction of any Foreign
Currency (or any other jurisdiction in which the funding operations of any
Multicurrency Revolving Lender shall be conducted with respect to such Foreign
Currency) shall have in effect any reserve, liquid asset or similar requirement
with respect to any category of deposits or liabilities customarily used to fund
loans in such Foreign Currency, or by reference to which interest rates
applicable to loans in such Foreign Currency are determined, and the result of
such requirement shall be to increase the cost to any Multicurrency Revolving
Lender of making or maintaining any Multicurrency Revolving Loan in such Foreign
Currency, and such Multicurrency Revolving Lender shall deliver to the Borrower
a notice requesting compensation under this paragraph, then the Borrower will
pay to such Multicurrency Revolving Lender on each Interest Payment Date with
respect to each Multicurrency Revolving Loan in such affected Foreign Currency
an amount that will compensate such Multicurrency Revolving Lender for such
additional cost.

            (d) A certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to
this Section submitted by any Lender or Issuing Lender to the Borrower (with a
copy to the Administrative Agent) setting forth the basis of calculation of such
additional amounts shall be conclusive in the absence of manifest error. The
obligations of the Borrower pursuant to this Section shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

            (e) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, if,
(i)(A) the adoption of any law, rule or regulation after the date of this
Agreement, (B) any change in any law, rule or regulation or in the
interpretation or application thereof by any Governmental Authority after the
date of this Agreement or (C) compliance by any Multicurrency Revolving Lender
with any request, guideline or directive (whether or not having the force of
law) of any Governmental Authority made or issued after the date of this
Agreement, shall make it unlawful for any such Multicurrency Revolving Lender to
make or maintain any Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign
Currency or to give effect to its obligations as contemplated hereby with
respect to any Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency,
or (ii) there shall have occurred any change in national or international
financial, political or economic conditions (including the imposition of or any
change in exchange controls, but excluding conditions otherwise covered by this
Section 4.9) which would make it impracticable for any Multicurrency Revolving
Lenders to make or maintain Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in the
relevant Foreign Currency after the date hereof to, or for the account of, the
Borrower, then:


                                       49
<PAGE>

                (i) by written notice to the Borrower and to the Administrative
           Agent, such Multicurrency Revolving Lender or Multicurrency Revolving
           Lenders may declare that Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in
           the affected Foreign Currency will not thereafter (for the duration
           of such unlawfulness) be made by such Multicurrency Revolving Lender
           or Multicurrency Revolving Lenders hereunder (or be continued for
           additional Interest Periods), whereupon any request for a
           Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in such Foreign Currency or
           to continue a Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in such
           Foreign Currency, as the case may be, for an additional Interest
           Period shall, as to such Multicurrency Revolving Lender or
           Multicurrency Revolving Lenders only, be of no force and effect,
           unless such declaration shall be subsequently withdrawn; and

                (ii) all outstanding Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated
           in the affected Foreign Currency made by such Multicurrency Revolving
           Lender or Multicurrency Revolving Lenders shall be repaid on the last
           day of the then current Interest Period with respect thereto or, if
           earlier, the date on which the applicable notice becomes effective.

            (f) For purposes of Section 4.9(e), a notice to the Borrower by any
Multicurrency Revolving Lender shall be effective as to each Multicurrency
Revolving Loan denominated in the affected Foreign Currency made by such
Multicurrency Revolving Lender, if lawful, on the last day of the Interest
Period currently applicable to such Multicurrency Revolving Loan denominated in
a Foreign Currency; in all other cases such notice shall be effective on the
date of receipt thereof by the Borrower.

            4.10. Taxes. Any and all payments made by or on behalf of the
Borrower under this Agreement shall be made free and clear of, and without
deduction or withholding for or on account of, any present or future income,
stamp or other taxes, levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or
withholdings, now or hereafter imposed, levied, collected, withheld or assessed
by any Governmental Authority, excluding net income taxes and franchise taxes
(imposed in lieu of net income taxes) imposed on any Agent or any Lender as a
result of a present or former connection between such Agent or such Lender and
the jurisdiction of the Governmental Authority imposing such tax or any
political subdivision or taxing authority thereof or therein (other than any
such connection arising solely from such Agent or such Lender having executed,
delivered or performed its obligations or received a payment under, or enforced,
this Agreement or any other Loan Document). If any such non-excluded taxes,
levies, imposts, duties, charges, fees, deductions or withholdings
("Non-Excluded Taxes") or Other Taxes are required to be withheld from any
amounts payable to any Agent or any Lender hereunder, the amounts so payable to
such Agent or such Lender shall be increased to the extent necessary to yield to
such Agent or such Lender (after payment of all Non-Excluded Taxes and Other
Taxes) interest or any such other amounts payable hereunder at the rates or in
the amounts specified in this Agreement, provided, however, that the Borrower
shall not be required to increase any such amounts payable to any Lender with
respect to any Non-Excluded Taxes (i) that are attributable to such Lender's
failure to comply with the requirements of paragraph (d) or (e) of this Section
or (ii) that are United States withholding taxes imposed on amounts payable to
such Lender at the time such Lender becomes a party to this Agreement or
designates a new lending office, except to the extent that such Lender's
assignor (if any) was entitled, at the time

                                       50
<PAGE>

of assignment, to receive additional amounts from the Borrower with respect to
such Non-Excluded Taxes pursuant to this paragraph.

            (b) In addition, the Borrower shall pay any Other Taxes to the
relevant Governmental Authority in accordance with applicable law.

            (c) Whenever any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes are payable by
the Borrower, as promptly as possible thereafter the Borrower shall send to the
Administrative Agent for its own account or for the account of the relevant
Agent or Lender, as the case may be, a certified copy of an original official
receipt received by the Borrower showing payment thereof. If the Borrower fails
to pay any Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes when due to the appropriate taxing
authority or fails to remit to the Administrative Agent the required receipts or
other required documentary evidence, the Borrower shall indemnify the Agents and
the Lenders for any incremental taxes, interest or penalties that may become
payable by any Agent or any Lender as a result of any such failure.

            (d) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is not a "U.S. Person" as
defined in Section 7701(a)(30) of the Code (a "Non-U.S. Lender") shall deliver
to the Borrower and the Administrative Agent (or, in the case of a Participant,
to the Lender from which the related participation shall have been purchased)
two copies of either U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form W-8BEN or Form W-8ECI,
or, in the case of a Non-U.S. Lender claiming exemption from U.S. federal
withholding tax under Section 871(h) or 881(c) of the Code with respect to
payments of "portfolio interest", a statement substantially in the form of
Exhibit G and a Form W-8BEN, or any subsequent versions thereof or successors
thereto, properly completed and duly executed by such Non-U.S. Lender claiming
complete exemption from, or a reduced rate of, U.S. federal withholding tax on
all payments by the Borrower under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents.
Such forms shall be delivered by each Non-U.S. Lender on or before the date it
becomes a party to this Agreement (or, in the case of any Participant, on or
before the date such Participant purchases the related participation). In
addition, each Non-U.S. Lender shall deliver such forms promptly upon the
obsolescence or invalidity of any form previously delivered by such Non-U.S.
Lender. Each Non-U.S. Lender shall promptly notify the Borrower at any time it
determines that it is no longer in a position to provide any previously
delivered certificate to the Borrower (or any other form of certification
adopted by the U.S. taxing authorities for such purpose). Notwithstanding any
other provision of this paragraph, a Non-U.S. Lender shall not be required to
deliver any form pursuant to this paragraph that such Non-U.S. Lender is not
legally able to deliver.

            (e) Each Lender (or Transferee) that is entitled to an exemption
from or reduction of non-U.S. withholding tax under the law of the jurisdiction
in which the Borrower is located, or any treaty to which such jurisdiction is a
party, with respect to payments under this Agreement shall deliver to the
Borrower (with a copy to the Administrative Agent), at the time or times
prescribed by applicable law or reasonably requested by the Borrower, such
properly completed and executed documentation prescribed by applicable law as
will permit such payments to be made without withholding or at a reduced rate,
provided that such Lender is legally entitled to complete, execute and deliver
such documentation and in such Lender's

                                       51
<PAGE>

judgment such completion, execution or submission would not materially prejudice
the legal position of such Lender.

            (f) The agreements in this Section 4.10 shall survive the
termination of this Agreement and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts
payable hereunder.

            (g) If any Lender or the Administrative Agent determines, in its
sole discretion, that it has received a refund attributable to any Non-Excluded
Taxes or Other Taxes paid by the Borrower or for which the Lender or the
Administrative Agent has received payment from the Borrower hereunder, such
Lender or the Administrative Agent, within 30 days of such receipt, shall
deliver to the Borrower the amount of such refund without interest (other than
any interest paid by the relevant Governmental Authority with respect to such
refund); provided, however, that the Borrower agrees to repay the amount paid
over to the Borrower (plus any penalties, interest or other charges imposed by
the relevant Governmental Authority) to such Lender or the Administrative Agent
in the event that such Lender or the Administrative Agent is required to repay
such refund to such Governmental Authority. In addition, upon a written request
by the Borrower, any Lender and the Administrative Agent shall timely execute
and deliver to the Borrower such certificates, forms or other documents which
can be reasonably furnished consistent with the facts to assist the Borrower in
applying for refunds of Non-Excluded Taxes or Other Taxes remitted hereunder,
unless to do so will unduly prejudice or cause undue hardship to such Lender or
the Administrative Agent (as determined in the sole discretion of such Lender or
the Administrative Agent). This paragraph shall not be construed to require any
Lender or the Administrative Agent to make available its tax returns (or any
other information relating to its Taxes that it deems confidential) to the
Borrower or any other Person.

            4.11. Indemnity.The Borrower agrees to indemnify each Lender and to
hold each Lender harmless from any loss or expense that such Lender may sustain
or incur as a consequence of (a) default by the Borrower in making a borrowing
of, conversion into or continuation of Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has
given a notice requesting the same in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement, (b) default by the Borrower in making any prepayment of or conversion
from Eurocurrency Loans after the Borrower has given a notice thereof in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement or (c) the making of a
prepayment of Eurocurrency Loans or the conversion of Eurocurrency Loans, in
each case, on a day that is not the last day of an Interest Period with respect
thereto. Such indemnification may include an amount equal to the excess, if any,
of (i) the amount of interest that would have accrued on the amount so prepaid,
or not so borrowed, converted or continued, for the period from the date of such
prepayment or of such failure to borrow, convert or continue to the last day of
such Interest Period (or, in the case of a failure to borrow, convert or
continue, the Interest Period that would have commenced on the date of such
failure) in each case at the applicable rate of interest for such Loans provided
for herein (excluding, however, the Applicable Margin included therein, if any)
over (ii) the amount of interest (as reasonably determined by such Lender) that
would have accrued to such Lender on such amount by placing such amount on
deposit for a comparable period with leading banks in the interbank Eurocurrency
market. A certificate as to any amounts payable pursuant to this Section
submitted to the Borrower by any Lender shall be conclusive in the absence of
manifest error. This covenant shall survive the termination of this Agreement
and the payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            4.12. Change of Lending Office.Each Lender agrees that, upon the
occurrence of any event giving rise to the operation of Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or
4.10(b) with respect to such Lender, it will, if requested by the Borrower, use
reasonable efforts (subject to overall policy considerations of such Lender) to
designate another lending office for any Loans affected by such event with the
object of avoiding the consequences of such event; provided that such
designation is made on terms that, in the sole judgment of such Lender, cause
such Lender and its lending office(s) to suffer no economic, legal or regulatory
disadvantage, and provided, further, that nothing in this Section shall affect
or postpone any of the obligations of the Borrower or the rights of any Lender
pursuant to Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or 4.10(b).

            4.13. Replacement of Lenders.The Borrower shall be permitted to
replace any Lender that (a) requests reimbursement for amounts owing pursuant to
Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or 4.10(b) or (b) defaults in its obligation to make Loans
hereunder, with a replacement financial institution; provided that (i) such
replacement does not conflict with any Requirement of Law, (ii) no Event of
Default shall have occurred and be continuing at the time of such replacement,
(iii) prior to any such replacement, such Lender shall have taken no action
under Section 4.12 so as to eliminate the continued need for payment of amounts
owing pursuant to Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or 4.10(b), (iv) the replacement
financial institution shall purchase, at par, all Loans and other amounts owing
to such replaced Lender on or prior to the date of replacement, (v) the Borrower
shall be liable to such replaced Lender under Section 4.11 if any Eurocurrency
Loan owing to such replaced Lender shall be purchased other than on the last day
of the Interest Period relating thereto, (vi) the replacement financial
institution, if not already a Lender, shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Administrative Agent and (if the replaced Lender was a Revolving Lender) each
Issuing Lender and (if the replaced Lender was a Dollar Revolving Lender) the
Swingline Lender, (vii) the replaced Lender shall be obligated to make such
replacement in accordance with the provisions of Section 11.6, (viii) until such
time as such replacement shall be consummated, the Borrower shall pay all
additional amounts (if any) required pursuant to Section 4.9, 4.10(a) or
4.10(b), as the case may be, and (ix) any such replacement shall not be deemed
to be a waiver of any rights that the Borrower, the Administrative Agent or any
other Lender shall have against the replaced Lender.

            4.14. Evidence of Debt. Each Lender shall maintain in accordance
with its usual practice an account or accounts evidencing indebtedness of the
Borrower to such Lender resulting from each Loan of such Lender from time to
time, including the amounts of principal and interest payable and paid to such
Lender from time to time under this Agreement.

            (b) The Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Borrower, shall
maintain the Register pursuant to Section 11.6, and a subaccount therein for
each Lender, in which shall be recorded (i) the amount of each Loan made
hereunder and any Note evidencing such Loan, the Type of such Loan and each
Interest Period applicable thereto, (ii) the amount of any principal or interest
due and payable or to become due and payable from the Borrower to each Lender
hereunder and (iii) both the amount of any sum received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder from the Borrower and each Lender's share thereof.

            (c) The entries made in the Register and the accounts of each Lender
maintained pursuant to Section 4.14(a) shall, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, be prima facie

                                       53
<PAGE>

evidence of the existence and amounts of the obligations of the Borrower therein
recorded; provided, however, that the failure of any Lender or the
Administrative Agent to maintain the Register or any such account, or any error
therein, shall not in any manner affect the obligation of the Borrower to repay
(with applicable interest) the Loans made to the Borrower by such Lender in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

            (d) The Borrower agrees that, upon the request by any Lender
(through the Administrative Agent), the Borrower will prepare, execute and
deliver to such Lender a promissory note of the Borrower payable to the order of
such Lender (or if requested by such Lender, to such Lender and its registered
assigns) and in a form approved by the Administrative Agent, evidencing Loans
made by such Lender.

            4.15. Illegality.Notwithstanding any other provision herein, if the
adoption of or any change in any Requirement of Law or in the interpretation or
application thereof shall make it unlawful for any Lender to make or maintain
Eurocurrency Loans as contemplated by this Agreement, (a) the commitment of such
Lender hereunder to make Eurocurrency Loans, continue Eurocurrency Loans as such
and convert Base Rate Loans to Eurocurrency Loans shall forthwith be canceled
and (b) such Lender's Loans then outstanding as Eurocurrency Loans, if any,
shall be converted automatically to Base Rate Loans (or, in the case of
Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency, be repaid) on
the respective last days of the then current Interest Periods with respect to
such Loans or within such earlier period as required by law. If any such
conversion of a Eurocurrency Loan occurs on a day which is not the last day of
the then current Interest Period with respect thereto, the Borrower shall pay to
such Lender such amounts, if any, as may be required pursuant to Section 4.11.

            4.16. Foreign Currency Exchange Rate. (a) No later than 1:00 P.M.,
London time, on each Calculation Date with respect to a Foreign Currency, the
Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate as of such Calculation
Date with respect to such Foreign Currency, provided that, upon receipt of a
Borrowing Request pursuant to Section 3.2 for a borrowing of a Multicurrency
Revolving Loan denominated in a Foreign Currency or a request for a Letter of
Credit denominated in a Foreign Currency pursuant to Section 3.8, the
Administrative Agent shall determine the Exchange Rate with respect to the
relevant Foreign Currency in accordance with the foregoing (it being
acknowledged and agreed that the Administrative Agent shall use such Exchange
Rate for the purposes of determining compliance with Section 3.1(a) or 3.7(a),
as applicable, with respect to such Borrowing Request or Application). The
Exchange Rates so determined shall become effective on the first Business Day
immediately following the relevant Calculation Date (a "Reset Date"), shall
remain effective until the next succeeding Reset Date and shall for all purposes
of this Agreement (other than Section 4.7, 11.19 or any other provision
expressly requiring the use of a current Exchange Rate) be the Exchange Rates
employed in converting any amounts between Dollars and Foreign Currencies.

            (b) No later than 5:00 P.M., London time, on each Reset Date and
each Borrowing Date with respect to Multicurrency Revolving Loans denominated in
a Foreign Currency, the Administrative Agent shall determine the aggregate
amount of the Dollar Equivalents of the principal amounts of the Multicurrency
Revolving Loans denominated in a

                                       54
<PAGE>

Foreign Currency then outstanding (after giving effect to any Multicurrency
Revolving Loans denominated in a Foreign Currency to be made or repaid on such
date and the aggregate amount of the L/C Obligations then outstanding).

            (c) The Administrative Agent shall promptly notify the Borrower of
each determination of an Exchange Rate hereunder.

                   Section 5. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into this Agreement
and to make the Loans and issue or participate in the Letters of Credit, the
Borrower hereby represents and warrants to each Agent and each Lender that:

            5.1. Financial Condition.The audited consolidated balance sheet of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at December 31, 2003, and the
related consolidated statements of income and of cash flows for the fiscal year
ended on such date, reported on by and accompanied by an unqualified report from
Deloitte & Touche LLP, present fairly the consolidated financial condition of
the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the
fiscal year then ended. The unaudited consolidated balance sheet of the Borrower
and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at September 30, 2004, and the related
unaudited consolidated statements of income and cash flows for the nine-month
period ended on such date, present fairly the consolidated financial condition
of the Borrower and its consolidated Subsidiaries as at such date, and the
consolidated results of its operations and its consolidated cash flows for the
nine-month period then ended (subject to normal year-end audit adjustments). All
such financial statements, including the related schedules and notes thereto,
have been prepared in accordance with GAAP applied consistently throughout the
periods involved (except as approved by the aforementioned firm of accountants
and disclosed therein). No Group Member has any material Guarantee Obligations,
contingent liabilities and liabilities for taxes, or any long-term leases or
unusual forward or long-term commitments, including any interest rate or foreign
currency swap or exchange transaction or other obligation in respect of
derivatives, that are not reflected in the most recent financial statements
referred to in this paragraph or disclosed in this Section 5.

            5.2. No Change.Since December 31, 2003, there has been no
development or event that has had or could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            5.3. Corporate Existence; Compliance with Law.Each Group Member (a)
is duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization, (b) has the power and authority, and the legal
right, to own and operate its property, to lease the property it operates as
lessee and to conduct the business in which it is currently engaged, (c) is duly
qualified as a foreign corporation and in good standing under the laws of each
jurisdiction where its ownership, lease or operation of property or the conduct
of its business requires such qualification, except to the extent that the
failure to so qualify could not, individually or in the aggregate, reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect and (d) is in compliance with all
Requirements of Law except to the extent that the failure to comply therewith
could not, in the aggregate, reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse
Effect.


                                       55
<PAGE>

            5.4. Power; Authorization; Enforceable Obligations.Each Loan Party
has the power and authority, and the legal right, to make, deliver and perform
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to
obtain extensions of credit hereunder. Each Loan Party has taken all necessary
organizational action to authorize the execution, delivery and performance of
the Loan Documents to which it is a party and, in the case of the Borrower, to
authorize the extensions of credit on the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. No consent or authorization of, filing with, notice to or other act
by or in respect of, any Governmental Authority or any other Person is required
in connection with the extensions of credit hereunder or with the execution,
delivery, performance, validity or enforceability of this Agreement or any of
the other Loan Documents, except (i) consents, authorizations, filings and
notices described in Schedule 5.4, which consents, authorizations, filings and
notices have been obtained or made and are in full force and effect and (ii) the
filings referred to in Section 5.19. Each Loan Document has been duly executed
and delivered on behalf of each Loan Party party thereto. This Agreement
constitutes, and each other Loan Document upon execution will constitute, a
legal, valid and binding obligation of each Loan Party party thereto,
enforceable against each such Loan Party in accordance with its terms, except as
enforceability may be limited by applicable bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws affecting the enforcement of
creditors' rights generally and by general equitable principles (whether
enforcement is sought by proceedings in equity or at law).

            5.5. No Legal Bar.The execution, delivery and performance of this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the issuance of Letters of Credit, the
borrowings hereunder and the use of the proceeds thereof will not violate any
Requirement of Law or any Contractual Obligation of any Group Member and will
not result in, or require, the creation or imposition of any Lien on any of
their respective properties or revenues pursuant to any Requirement of Law or
any such Contractual Obligation (other than the Liens created by the Security
Documents). No Requirement of Law or Contractual Obligation applicable to the
Borrower or any of its Subsidiaries could reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            5.6. Litigation.Except as described on Schedule 5.6, no litigation,
investigation or proceeding of or before any arbitrator or Governmental
Authority is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened by or
against any Group Member or against any of their respective properties or
revenues (a) with respect to any of the Loan Documents or any of the
transactions contemplated hereby or thereby, or (b) that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            5.7. No Default.No Group Member is in default under or with respect
to any of its Contractual Obligations in any respect that could reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect. No Default or Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing.

            5.8. Ownership of Property; Liens.Each Group Member has title in fee
simple to, or a valid leasehold interest in, all its real property material to
its business, and, to its knowledge, good title to, or a valid leasehold
interest in, all its other property, and none of such property is subject to any
Lien except as permitted by Section 8.3, and as set forth on Schedule B to each
Title Policy.


                                       56
<PAGE>

            5.9. Intellectual Property.Each Group Member owns, or is licensed to
use, all material Intellectual Property necessary for the conduct of its
business as currently conducted. No claim has been asserted and is pending by
any Person challenging or questioning the use of any Intellectual Property or
the validity or effectiveness of any Intellectual Property, nor does the
Borrower know of any valid basis for any such claim, except such claims that,
individually or in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect. To the knowledge of the Borrower, the use of
Intellectual Property by each Group Member does not infringe on the rights of
any Person in any material respect.

            5.10. Taxes.Each Group Member has filed or caused to be filed all
Federal, state and other material tax returns that are required to be filed and
has paid all taxes shown to be due and payable on said returns or on any
assessments made against it or any of its property and all other taxes, fees or
other charges imposed on it or any of its property by any Governmental Authority
which have become due and payable (other than any taxes the amount or validity
of which are currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings
and with respect to which reserves in conformity with GAAP have been provided on
the books of the relevant Group Member); no tax Lien has been filed, and, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, no claim is being asserted, with respect to any such
tax, fee or other charge.

            5.11. Federal Regulations.No part of the proceeds of any Loans, and
no other extensions of credit hereunder, will be used for "buying" or "carrying"
any "margin stock" within the respective meanings of each of the quoted terms
under Regulation U as now and from time to time hereafter in effect or for any
purpose that violates the provisions of the Regulations of the Board. If
requested by any Lender or the Administrative Agent, the Borrower will furnish
to the Administrative Agent and each Lender a statement to the foregoing effect
in conformity with the requirements of FR Form G-3 or FR Form U-1, as
applicable, referred to in Regulation U.

            5.12. Labor Matters.Except as, in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) there are no
strikes or other labor disputes against any Group Member pending or, to the
knowledge of the Borrower, threatened; (b) hours worked by and payment made to
employees each Group Member have not been in violation of the Fair Labor
Standards Act or any other applicable Requirement of Law dealing with such
matters; and (c) all payments due from any Group Member on account of employee
health and welfare insurance have been paid or accrued as a liability on the
books of the relevant Group Member.

            5.13. ERISA.Except as, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be
expected to have a Material Adverse Effect: (a) neither a Reportable Event nor
an "accumulated funding deficiency" (within the meaning of Section 412 of the
Code or Section 302 of ERISA) has occurred during the five-year period prior to
the date on which this representation is made or deemed made with respect to any
Plan, and each Plan has complied in all material respects with the applicable
provisions of ERISA and the Code; (b) no termination of a Single Employer Plan
has occurred, and no Lien in favor of the PBGC or a Plan has arisen, during such
five-year period that would result in a material liability; (c) the present
value of all accrued benefits under each Single Employer Plan (based on those
assumptions used to fund such Plans) did not, as of

                                       57
<PAGE>

the last annual valuation date prior to the date on which this representation is
made or deemed made, exceed the value of the assets of such Plan allocable to
such accrued benefits by a material amount in relation to the business of the
Borrower; (d) neither the Borrower nor any Commonly Controlled Entity has had a
complete or partial withdrawal from any Multiemployer Plan that has resulted or
could reasonably be expected to result in a material liability under ERISA; and
(e) no such Multiemployer Plan is in Reorganization or Insolvent.

            5.14. Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act;
Other Regulations.No Loan Party is (a) an "investment company", or a company
"controlled" by an "investment company", within the meaning of the Investment
Company Act of 1940, as amended or (b) a "holding company" as defined in, or
subject to regulation under, the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935. No
Loan Party is subject to regulation under any Requirement of Law (other than
Regulation X of the Board) that limits its ability to incur Indebtedness.

            5.15. Subsidiaries.Except as disclosed to the Administrative Agent
by the Borrower in writing from time to time after the Effective Date, (a)
Schedule 5.15(a) sets forth the name and jurisdiction of incorporation of each
Subsidiary and, as to each such Subsidiary, the percentage of each class of
Capital Stock owned by any Loan Party and (b) there are no outstanding
subscriptions, options, warrants, calls, rights or other agreements or
commitments (other than stock options or other equity granted to employees,
directors or other persons and directors' qualifying shares) of any nature
relating to any Capital Stock of the Borrower or any Subsidiary, except as
created by the Loan Documents or, as of the Effective Date, except as disclosed
on Schedule 5.15(b).

            5.16. [Reserved]

            5.17. Environmental Matters.Except as, in the aggregate, could not
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect:

            (a) the facilities and properties currently owned, leased or
      operated by any Group Member (the "Subject Properties") and, to the
      knowledge of the Borrower, the facilities and properties formerly owned,
      leased or operated by any Group Member do not contain, and have not
      previously contained, any Materials of Environmental Concern in amounts or
      concentrations or under circumstances that constitute or constituted a
      violation of, or could reasonably be expected to give rise to liability
      under, any applicable Environmental Law;

            (b) no Group Member has received any written notice of, or is aware
      of, any violation, alleged violation or non-compliance, request for
      information, claim or demand liability or potential liability arising
      under or relating to any Environmental Laws involving any Group Member
      (the "Business"), nor does the Borrower have knowledge or reason to
      believe that any such notice will be received or is being threatened;

            (c) Materials of Environmental Concern have not been transported or
      disposed of from the Subject Properties in violation of, or in a manner or
      to a location that could

                                       58
<PAGE>

      reasonably be expected to give rise to liability under, any applicable
      Environmental Law, nor have any Materials of Environmental Concern been
      generated, treated, stored or disposed of at, on or under any of the
      Subject Properties in violation of, or in a manner that could reasonably
      be expected to give rise to liability under, any applicable Environmental
      Law;

            (d) no judicial proceeding or governmental or administrative action
      is pending or, to the knowledge of the Borrower, threatened, under any
      Environmental Law nor are there any consent decrees or other decrees,
      consent orders, administrative orders or other orders, or other
      administrative or judicial requirements outstanding under any
      Environmental Law in either case, as to which any Group Member is or, to
      the knowledge of the Borrower, will be named as a party;

            (e) there has been no release or threat of release of Materials of
      Environmental Concern at or from the Subject Properties, or arising from

      expected to give rise to liability under any applicable Environmental
      Laws;

            (f) the Subject Properties and all operations at the Subject
      Properties are in compliance, and have in the last five years been in
      compliance, with all applicable Environmental Laws, and there is no

            5.18. Accuracy of Information, etc. No statement or information
contained in this Agreement, any other Loan Document, the Confidential
Information Memorandum or any other document, certificate or statement furnished
by or on behalf of any Loan Party to the Administrative Agent or the Lenders, or
any of them, for use in connection with the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents, contained as of the date such statement,
information, document or certificate was so furnished (or, in the case of the
Confidential Information Memorandum, as of the date of this Agreement), any
untrue statement of a material fact or omitted to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained herein or therein not misleading. The
projections contained in the materials referenced above are based upon good
faith estimates and assumptions believed by management of the Borrower to be
reasonable at the time made, it being recognized by the Lenders that such
financial information as it relates to future events is not to be viewed as fact
and that actual results during the period or periods covered by such financial
information may differ from the projected results set forth therein by a
material amount. There is no fact known to any Loan Party that could reasonably
be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect that has not been expressly
disclosed herein, in the other Loan Documents, in the Confidential Information
Memorandum or in any other documents, certificates and statements furnished to
the Administrative Agent and the Lenders for use in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby and by the other Loan Documents.

            5.19. Security Documents. (a) The Guarantee and Collateral Agreement
is effective to create in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the benefit of
the Lenders, a legal, valid and enforceable security interest in the Collateral
described therein and proceeds thereof. In the case of the Pledged Stock
described in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, when stock certificates
representing such Pledged Stock have been delivered to the Administrative Agent,
together with proper endorsements executed in blank and such other action has
been taken with respect to Pledged Stock of Foreign Subsidiaries as specified in
the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, and in the case of the other Collateral
described in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement, when financing statements
specified on Schedule 5.19(a) have been filed in the offices specified on
Schedule 5.19(a), the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement constitutes a fully
perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right, title and interest of
the Loan Parties in such Collateral and the proceeds thereof, as security for
the Obligations (as defined in the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement), in each
case prior and superior in right to any other Person (except, in the case of
Collateral other than Pledged Stock, Liens permitted by Section 8.3).

            (b) Each Mortgage is effective to create in favor of the
Administrative Agent, for the benefit of the Lenders (as defined in the
Guarantee and Collateral Agreement), a legal, valid and enforceable Lien on the
Mortgaged Properties described therein and proceeds thereof, and when the
Mortgages are filed in the offices specified on Schedule 5.19(b), such Mortgages
shall constitute a fully perfected Lien on, and security interest in, all right,
title and interest of the Loan Parties in such Mortgaged Properties and the
proceeds thereof, as security for the Obligations (as defined in the relevant
Mortgage), in each case prior and superior in right to any other Person, subject
to the exceptions set forth on Schedule B to the applicable Title Policy and the
Liens permitted under Section 8.3. Schedule 1.1(a) lists each parcel of real
property in the United States owned in fee simple by the Borrower or any of its
Subsidiaries as of the Effective Date.

            5.20. Solvency.Each Loan Party is, and after giving effect to the
Transactions and the incurrence of all Indebtedness and obligations being
incurred in connection herewith and therewith will be and will continue to be,
Solvent.

            5.21. Senior Indebtedness.The Obligations (x) constitute "Senior
Debt" and "Designated Senior Debt" of the Borrower under and as defined in each
Senior Subordinated Securities Indenture and (y) are the only existing
"Designated Senior Debt" under each Senior Subordinated Securities Indenture.
The obligations of each Subsidiary Guarantor under the Guarantee and Collateral
Agreement constitute "Guarantor Senior Debt" of such Subsidiary Guarantor under
and as defined in each Senior Subordinated Securities Indenture.

            5.22. Regulation H.As of the Effective Date, except as specified on
Schedule 5.22, no Mortgage encumbers improved real property that is located in
an area that has been identified by the Secretary of Housing and Urban
Development as an area having special flood hazards and in which flood insurance
has been made available under the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968.

            5.23. Material Contracts.(a) As of the Effective Date, (i) each
Material Contract is in full force and effect and is a legal, valid and binding
obligation of each party thereto

                                       60
<PAGE>

enforceable in accordance with its terms and (ii) no Group Member is in default
of any material provision of any Material Contract.

            (b) To the best knowledge of the Borrower, (i) there has been no
default, breach or other violation of any Material Contract and (ii) no
Governmental Authority has any basis for terminating any Material Contract other
than customary termination provisions relating to convenience and other similar
provisions, except, in each case, as could not reasonably be expected to have a
Material Adverse Effect.

            (c) To the best knowledge of the Borrower, no Governmental Authority
has delivered notice of or otherwise demonstrated its intention to exercise its
option to terminate a Material Contract on the basis of clause (b)(ii) above
between itself and any of the Group Members, except for any such terminations
that, in the aggregate, could not reasonably be expected to have a Material
Adverse Effect.

            (d) Schedule 5.23 sets forth each material contract between any
Group Member and any Governmental Authority in effect on the Effective Date.

            5.24. Insurance.Schedule 5.24 sets forth a description of all
material insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and the Subsidiary
Guarantors as of the Effective Date. As of the Effective Date, all premiums due
and payable in respect of such insurance have been paid. The Borrower reasonably
believes that the insurance maintained by or on behalf of the Borrower and its
Subsidiaries is adequate.

      the transactions contemplated hereby shall have been obtained and be in
      full force and effect, and all applicable waiting periods shall have

with, this Agreement or any other Loan Document or for the value, validity,
effectiveness, genuineness, enforceability or sufficiency of this Agreement or
any other Loan Document or for any failure of any Loan Party a party thereto to
perform its obligations hereunder or thereunder. The Agents shall not be under
any obligation to any Lender to ascertain or to inquire as to the observance or
performance of any of the agreements contained in, or conditions of, this
Agreement or any other Loan Document, or to inspect the properties, books or
records of any Loan Party.

            10.4. Reliance by Agents.Each Agent shall be entitled to rely, and
shall be fully protected in relying, upon any instrument, writing, resolution,
notice, consent, certificate, affidavit, letter, telecopy, telex or teletype
message, statement, order or other document or conversation believed by it to be
genuine and correct and to have been signed, sent or made by the proper Person
or Persons and upon advice and statements of legal counsel (including counsel to
the Borrower), independent accountants and other experts selected by such Agent.
The Administrative Agent may deem and treat the payee of any Note as the owner
thereof for all

                                       87
<PAGE>

purposes unless a written notice of assignment, negotiation or transfer thereof
shall have been filed with the Administrative Agent. Each Agent shall be fully
justified in failing or refusing to take any action under this Agreement or any
other Loan Document unless it shall first receive such advice or concurrence of
the Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders) as it
deems appropriate or it shall first be indemnified to its satisfaction by the
Lenders against any and all liability and expense that may be incurred by it by
reason of taking or continuing to take any such action. The Agents shall in all
cases be fully protected in acting, or in refraining from acting, under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents in accordance with a request of the
Required Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders), and such
request and any action taken or failure to act pursuant thereto shall be binding
upon all the Lenders and all future holders of the Loans.

            10.5. Notice of Default.No Agent shall be deemed to have knowledge
or notice of the occurrence of any Default or Event of Default hereunder unless
such Agent has received notice from a Lender or the Borrower referring to this
Agreement, describing such Default or Event of Default and stating that such
notice is a "notice of default." In the event that the Administrative Agent
receives such a notice, the Administrative Agent shall give notice thereof to
the Lenders. The Administrative Agent shall take such action with respect to
such Default or Event of Default as shall be reasonably directed by the Required
Lenders (or, if so specified by this Agreement, all Lenders or any other
instructing group of Lenders specified by this Agreement); provided that unless
and until the Administrative Agent shall have received such directions, the
Administrative Agent may (but shall not be obligated to) take such action, or
refrain from taking such action, with respect to such Default or Event of
Default as it shall deem advisable in the best interests of the Lenders.

            10.6. Non-Reliance on Agents and Other Lenders.Each Lender expressly
acknowledges that neither the Agents nor any of their respective Related Parties
have made any representations or warranties to it and that no act by any Agent
hereafter taken, including any review of the affairs of a Loan Party or any
affiliate of a Loan Party, shall be deemed to constitute any representation or
warranty by any Agent to any Lender. Each Lender represents to the Agents that
it has, independently and without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender,
and based on such documents and information as it has deemed appropriate, made
its own appraisal of and investigation into the business, operations, property,
financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the Loan Parties and their
affiliates and made its own decision to make its Loans hereunder and enter into
this Agreement. Each Lender also represents that it will, independently and
without reliance upon any Agent or any other Lender, and based on such documents
and information as it shall deem appropriate at the time, continue to make its
own credit analysis, appraisals and decisions in taking or not taking action
under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents, and to make such
investigation as it deems necessary to inform itself as to the business,
operations, property, financial and other condition and creditworthiness of the
Loan Parties and their affiliates. Except for notices, reports and other
documents expressly required to be furnished to the Lenders by the
Administrative Agent hereunder, the Administrative Agent shall not have any duty
or responsibility to provide any Lender with any credit or other information
concerning the business, operations, property, condition (financial or
otherwise), prospects or creditworthiness of any Loan Party or any affiliate of
a Loan Party that may come into the possession of the Administrative Agent or
any of its Related Parties.

<PAGE>

            10.7. Indemnification.The Lenders agree to indemnify each Agent in
its capacity as such (to the extent not reimbursed by the Borrower and without
limiting the obligation of the Borrower to do so), ratably according to their
respective Aggregate Exposure Percentages in effect on the date on which
indemnification is sought under this Section (or, if indemnification is sought
after the date upon which the Commitments shall have terminated and the Loans
shall have been paid in full, ratably in accordance with such Aggregate Exposure
Percentages immediately prior to such date), from and against any and all
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind whatsoever that may at any time
(whether before or after the payment of the Loans) be imposed on, incurred by or
asserted against such Agent in any way relating to or arising out of, the
Commitments, this Agreement, any of the other Loan Documents or any documents
contemplated by or referred to herein or therein or the transactions
contemplated hereby or thereby or any action taken or omitted by such Agent
under or in connection with any of the foregoing; provided that no Lender shall
be liable for the payment of any portion of such liabilities, obligations,
losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or
disbursements that are found by a final and nonappealable decision of a court of
competent jurisdiction to have resulted from such Agent's gross negligence, bad
faith or willful misconduct. The agreements in this Section shall survive the
payment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            10.8. Agent in Its Individual Capacity.Each Agent and its affiliates
may make loans to, accept deposits from and generally engage in any kind of
business with any Loan Party as though such Agent were not an Agent. With
respect to its Loans made or renewed by it and with respect to any Letter of
Credit issued or participated in by it, each Agent shall have the same rights
and powers under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents as any Lender and
may exercise the same as though it were not an Agent, and the terms "Lender" and
"Lenders" shall include each Agent in its individual capacity.

            10.9. Successor Administrative Agent.The Administrative Agent may
resign as Administrative Agent at any time upon notice to the Lenders, the
Issuing Lenders and the Borrower and may be removed at any time by the Required
Lenders. Upon the resignation or removal of the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement and the other Loan Documents, the Required Lenders shall appoint a
successor agent for the Lenders, which successor agent shall (unless an Event of
Default under Section 9(a) or Section 9(f) with respect to the Borrower shall
have occurred and be continuing) be subject to approval by the Borrower (which
approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), whereupon such
successor agent shall succeed to the rights, powers and duties of the
Administrative Agent, and the term "Administrative Agent" shall mean such
successor agent effective upon such appointment and approval, and the former
Administrative Agent's rights, powers and duties as Administrative Agent shall
be terminated, without any other or further act or deed on the part of such
former Administrative Agent or any of the parties to this Agreement or any
holders of the Loans. If no successor agent has accepted appointment as
Administrative Agent by the date that is 30 days following a retiring
Administrative Agent's notice of resignation, the retiring Administrative Agent
may, on behalf of the Lenders and the Issuing Lenders, appoint a successor
agent, which agent shall be a bank organized and doing business under the laws
of the United States or any state thereof, subject to supervision or examination
by any federal or state authority and having a total shareholder equity


                                       89
<PAGE>

aggregating at least $1,000,000,000 or an Affiliate of any such bank. Upon the
acceptance of its appointment as Administrative Agent hereunder by a successor,
such successor shall succeed to and become vested with all the rights, powers,
privileges and duties of the retiring Administrative Agent, and the retiring
Administrative Agent shall be discharged from its duties and obligations
hereunder. The fees payable by the Borrower to a successor Administrative Agent
shall be the same as those payable to its predecessor unless otherwise agreed
between the Borrower and such successor. After any retiring Administrative
Agent's resignation or removal as Administrative Agent, the provisions of this
Section 10 and Section 11.5 shall inure to its benefit and the benefit of its
agents and their respective Related Parties as to any actions taken or omitted
to be taken by any of them while it was acting under this Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

            10.10. Agents Generally.Except as expressly set forth herein, no
Agent shall have any duties or responsibilities hereunder in its capacity as
such.

            10.11. Lead Arrangers and Syndication Agent.Each of the Lead
Arrangers and the Syndication Agent, in its capacity as such, shall have no
duties or responsibilities, and shall incur no liability, under this Agreement
and other Loan Documents.

                           Section 11. MISCELLANEOUS

            11.1. Amendments and Waivers.Neither this Agreement, any other Loan
Document, nor any terms hereof or thereof may be amended, supplemented or
modified except in accordance with the provisions of Section 2.4 or this Section
11.1; provided that Incremental Term Loan Amendments pursuant to and in
compliance with Section 2.4 shall not be subject to this Section 11.1. The
Required Lenders and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may,
or, with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the Administrative Agent
and each Loan Party party to the relevant Loan Document may, from time to time,
(a) enter into written amendments, consents, supplements or modifications hereto
and to the other Loan Documents for the purpose of adding any provisions to this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or changing in any manner the rights of
the Lenders or of the Loan Parties hereunder or thereunder or (b) waive, on such
terms and conditions as the Required Lenders or the Administrative Agent, as the
case may be, may specify in such instrument, any of the requirements of this
Agreement or the other Loan Documents or any Default or Event of Default and its
consequences; provided, however, that no such waiver and no such amendment,
supplement or modification shall (i) forgive the principal amount of any Loan or
L/C Disbursement or extend the final scheduled date of maturity of any Loan,
extend the scheduled date of any amortization payment in respect of any Tranche
B Term Loan, extend the required date of reimbursement of any L/C Disbursement,
reduce the stated rate of any interest or fee payable hereunder (except (x) in
connection with the waiver of applicability of any post-default increase in
interest rates, which waiver shall be effective with the consent of the Majority
Facility Lenders of each adversely affected Facility and (y) that any amendment
or modification of defined terms used in the financial covenants in this
Agreement shall not constitute a reduction in the rate of interest or fees for
purposes of this clause (i)) or extend the scheduled date of any payment
thereof, or increase the amount or extend the expiration date of any Lender's
Revolving Commitment under either Revolving Facility, in each case without the
written consent of each Lender directly affected thereby; (ii) eliminate or
reduce the voting rights of any Lender under this Section 11.1 without the
written consent of such Lender; (iii) reduce any percentage specified in the
definition of Required Lenders or any other provision of any Loan Document
specifying the number or percentage of Lenders required to waive, modify or
amend any rights thereunder or make any determination or grant any consent
thereunder, consent to the assignment or transfer by the Borrower of any of its
rights and obligations under this Agreement and the other Loan Documents,
release all or substantially all of the Collateral or release any material
guarantee under the Guarantee and Collateral Agreement or limit the applicable
Loan Party's liability in respect of such guarantee, in each case without the


                                       90
<PAGE>

written consent of all Lenders; (iv) amend, modify or waive any condition
precedent to any extension of credit under a Revolving Facility set forth in
Section 6.2 (including in connection with any waiver of an existing Default or
Event of Default) without the written consent of the Majority Facility Lenders
with respect to such Revolving Facility; (v) amend, modify or waive any
provision of Section 4.8 without the written consent of the Majority Facility
Lenders in respect of each Facility adversely affected thereby; (vi) reduce the
amount of Net Cash Proceeds required to be applied to prepay Tranche B Term
Loans under this Agreement without the written consent of the Majority Facility
Lenders with respect to the Tranche B Term Loan Facility; (vii) reduce the
percentage specified in the definition of Majority Facility Lenders with respect
to any Facility without the written consent of all Lenders under such Facility;
(viii) amend, modify or waive any provision of Section 10 without the written
consent of each Agent adversely affected thereby; (ix) amend, modify or waive
any provision of Section 3.3 or 3.4 without the written consent of the Swingline
Lender; (x) change any provisions of any Loan Document in a manner that by its
terms adversely affects the rights in respect of payments due to Lenders holding
Loans of any Class differently than those holding Loans of any other Class,
without the written consent of Lenders holding a majority in interest of the
outstanding Loans and unused Commitments of each affected Class; provided,
further, that any waiver, amendment or modification of this Agreement that by
its terms affects the rights or duties under this Agreement of one Class of
Lenders (but not other Classes) may be effected by an agreement or agreements in
writing entered into by the Borrower and requisite percentage in interest of the
affected Class of Lenders that would be required to consent thereto under this
Section if such Class of Lenders were the only Class of Lenders hereunder at the
time; or (xi) amend, modify or waive any provision of Sections 3.7 to 3.14
without the written consent of each Issuing Lender. Any such waiver and any such
amendment, supplement or modification shall apply equally to each of the Lenders
and shall be binding upon the Loan Parties, the Lenders, the Agents and all
future holders of the Loans; provided that no such agreement shall amend, modify
or otherwise affect the rights or duties of the Administrative Agent, the
Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender without the prior written consent of the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lender or the Swingline Lender, as the case
may be. In the case of any waiver, the Loan Parties, the Lenders and the Agents
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder and under the
other Loan Documents, and any Default or Event of Default waived shall be deemed
to be cured and not continuing; but no such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other Default or Event of Default, or impair any right consequent
thereon. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any provision of this Agreement may be
amended by an agreement in writing entered into by the Borrower, the Required
Lenders and the Administrative Agent (and, if their rights or obligations are
affected thereby, each Issuing Lender and the Swingline Lender) if (i) by the
terms of such

                                       91
<PAGE>

agreement the Commitment of each Lender not consenting to the amendment provided
for therein shall terminate upon the effectiveness of such amendment and (ii) at
the time such amendment becomes effective, each Lender not consenting thereto
receives payment in full of the principal of and interest accrued on each Loan
made by it and all other amounts owing to it or accrued for its account under
this Agreement.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be amended (or
amended and restated) with the written consent of the Required Lenders, the
Administrative Agent and the Borrower (a) to add one or more additional credit
facilities to this Agreement and to permit the extensions of credit from time to
time outstanding thereunder and the accrued interest and fees in respect thereof
to share ratably in the benefits of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents
with the Tranche B Term Loans and Revolving Extensions of Credit and the accrued
interest and fees in respect thereof and (b) to include appropriately the
Lenders holding such credit facilities in any determination of the Required
Lenders and Majority Facility Lenders.

            In addition, notwithstanding the foregoing, this Agreement may be
amended with the written consent of the Administrative Agent, the Borrower and
the Lenders providing the relevant Replacement Term Loans (as defined below) to
permit the refinancing of all outstanding Tranche B Term Loans ("Refinanced Term
Loans") with a replacement term loan tranche hereunder ("Replacement Term
Loans"), provided that (a) the aggregate principal amount of such Replacement
Term Loans shall not exceed the aggregate principal amount of such Refinanced
Term Loans, (b) the Applicable Margin for such Replacement Term Loans shall not
be higher than the Applicable Margin for such Refinanced Term Loans, (c) the
weighted average life to maturity of such Replacement Term Loans shall not be
shorter than the weighted average life to maturity of such Refinanced Term Loans
at the time of such refinancing and (d) all other terms applicable to such
Replacement Term Loans shall be substantially identical to, or less favorable to
the Lenders providing such Replacement Term Loans than, those applicable to such
Refinanced Term Loans, except to the extent necessary to provide for covenants
and other terms applicable to any period after the latest final maturity of the
Tranche B Term Loans in effect immediately prior to such refinancing.

            11.2. Notices.(a) Except in the case of notices and other
communications expressly permitted to be given by telephone (and subject to
paragraph (b) below), all notices, requests and demands to or upon the

      Attention of Donald Shokrian (Telecopy No. (646) 534-0574); and; and

            (v) if to any other Lender or Issuing Lender, to it at its address

provided that any notice, request or demand to or upon any Agent, the Issuing
Lender or the Lenders shall not be effective until received.

            (b) Notices and other communications to the Lenders hereunder may be
delivered or furnished by electronic communications pursuant to procedures
approved by the Administrative Agent; provided that the foregoing shall not
apply to notices pursuant to Sections 2, 3 and 4 unless otherwise agreed by the
Administrative Agent and the applicable Lender. The Administrative Agent or the
Borrower may, in their discretion, agree to accept notices and other
communications to it hereunder by electronic communications pursuant to
procedures approved by it; provided that approval of such procedures may be
limited to particular notices or communications.

            11.3. No Waiver; Cumulative Remedies.No failure to exercise and no
delay in exercising, on the part of any Agent or any Lender, any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder or under the other Loan Documents shall operate as
a waiver thereof; nor shall any single or partial exercise of any right, remedy,
power or privilege hereunder preclude any other or further exercise thereof or
the exercise of any other right, remedy, power or privilege. The rights,
remedies, powers and privileges herein provided are cumulative and not exclusive
of any rights, remedies, powers and privileges that would otherwise be provided
by law. No waiver of any provision of any Loan Document or consent to any
departure by any Loan Party therefrom shall in any event be effective unless the
same shall be permitted by Section 11.1, and then such waiver or consent shall
be effective only in the specific instance and for the purpose for which given.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the making of a Loan or
issuance of a Letter of Credit shall not be construed as a waiver of any
Default, regardless of whether the Administrative Agent, any Lender or any
Issuing Lender may have had notice or knowledge of such Default at the time.

                                       93
<PAGE>

            11.4. Survival.All representations and warranties made by the Loan
Parties in the Loan Documents and in the certificates or other instruments
delivered in connection with or pursuant to this Agreement or any other Loan
Document shall be considered to have been relied upon by the other parties
hereto and shall survive the execution and delivery of the Loan Documents and
the making of any Loans and issuance of any Letters of Credit, regardless of any
investigation made by any such other party or on its behalf and notwithstanding
that the Administrative Agent, any Issuing Lender or any Lender may have had
notice or knowledge of any Default or incorrect representation or warranty at
the time any credit is extended hereunder, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as the principal of or any accrued interest on any Loan or any
fee or any other amount payable under this Agreement is outstanding and unpaid
or any Letter of Credit is outstanding and so long as the Commitments have not
expired or terminated. The provisions of Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11 and 11.5 and
11.13(e) and Section 10 shall survive and remain in full force and effect
regardless of the consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby, the
repayment of the Loans, the expiration or termination of the Letters of Credit
and the Commitments or the termination of this Agreement or any provision
hereof.

            11.5. Payment of Expenses and Taxes.The Borrower agrees (a) to pay
or reimburse the Syndication Agent, the Administrative Agent and the Lead
Arrangers for all their respective reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses
incurred in connection with the development, preparation and execution of, and
any amendment, supplement or modification to, this Agreement and the other Loan
Documents and any other documents prepared in connection herewith or therewith,
and the consummation and administration of the transactions contemplated hereby
and thereby, including the reasonable fees and disbursements of counsel to such
Agent and filing and recording fees and expenses, with statements with respect
to the foregoing to be submitted to the Borrower prior to the Effective Date (in
the case of amounts to be paid on the Effective Date) and from time to time
thereafter (not less frequently than quarterly, if accrued and unbilled fees
exceed $15,000) as such Agent shall deem appropriate, (b) to pay or reimburse
each Lender, Issuing Lender and Agent for all its costs and reasonable expenses
incurred in connection with the enforcement or preservation of any rights under
this Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including
the fees and disbursements of counsel (including the allocated fees and expenses
of in-house counsel) to each Lender and Issuing Lender and of counsel to such
Agent, provided that, the fees and disbursements of counsel to any such Lender
shall only be paid or reimbursed to the extent incurred in connection with a
Default or an Event of Default, (c) to pay, indemnify, and hold each Lender,
Issuing Lender and Agent harmless from, any and all recording and filing fees
and any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting from any delay in
paying, stamp, excise and other taxes, if any, that may be payable or determined
to be payable in connection with the execution and delivery of, or consummation

<PAGE>

directors, employees, affiliates, agents, trustees, advisors and controlling
persons (each, an "Indemnitee") harmless from and against any and all other
liabilities, obligations, losses, damages, penalties, actions, judgments, suits,
costs, expenses or disbursements of any kind or nature whatsoever with respect
to the execution, delivery, enforcement, performance and administration of this
Agreement, the other Loan Documents and any such other documents, including any
of the foregoing relating to the use of proceeds of the Loans or the violation
of, noncompliance with or liability under, any Environmental Law applicable to
the operations or current or former properties of any Group Member or any of the
Properties and the reasonable fees and expenses of legal counsel in connection
with claims, actions or proceedings by any Indemnitee against any Loan Party
under any Loan Document (all the foregoing in this clause (e), collectively, the
"Indemnified Liabilities"), provided that the Borrower shall have no obligation
hereunder to any Indemnitee with respect to Indemnified Liabilities to the
extent such Indemnified Liabilities are found by a final and nonappealable
decision of a court of competent jurisdiction to have resulted from the gross
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of such Indemnitee. Without limiting
the foregoing, and to the extent permitted by applicable law, the Borrower
agrees not to assert and to cause its Subsidiaries not to assert, and hereby
waives and agrees to cause its Subsidiaries to waive, all rights for
contribution or any other rights of recovery with respect to all claims,
demands, penalties, fines, liabilities, settlements, damages, costs and expenses
of whatever kind or nature, arising under or related to Environmental Laws, that
any of them may have by statute or otherwise against any Indemnitee, except to
the extent resulting from the gross negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct
of such Indemnitee. All amounts due under this Section 11.5 shall be payable not
later than ten days after written demand therefor. Statements payable by the
Borrower pursuant to this Section 11.5 shall be submitted to Robert C. Becker
(Telephone No.: (212) 754-2233 and Telecopy No: (212) 754-2372), at the address
of the Borrower set forth in Section 11.2, or to such other Person or address as
may be hereafter designated by the Borrower in a written notice to the
Administrative Agent. The agreements in this Section 11.5 shall survive
repayment of the Loans and all other amounts payable hereunder.

            11.6. Successors and Assigns.(a) The provisions of this Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and assigns permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of
any Issuing Lender that issues any Letter of Credit), except that (i) the
Borrower may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations
hereunder without the prior written consent of each Lender (and any attempted
assignment or transfer by the Borrower without such consent shall be null and
void) and (ii) no Lender may assign or otherwise transfer its rights or
obligations hereunder except in accordance with this Section. Nothing in this
Agreement, expressed or implied, shall be construed to confer upon any Person
(other than the parties hereto, their respective successors and assigns
permitted hereby (including any Affiliate of any Issuing Lender that issues any
Letter of Credit), Participants (to the extent provided in paragraph (c) of this
Section) and, to the extent expressly contemplated hereby, the Related Parties
of each of the Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the Lenders) any
legal or equitable right, remedy or claim under or by reason of this Agreement.

            (b) (i) Subject to the conditions set forth in paragraph (b)(ii)
below, any Lender may assign to one or more assignees all or a portion of its
rights and obligations under this

                                       95
<PAGE>

Agreement (including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans at the
time owing to it) with the prior written consent (such consent not to be
unreasonably withheld or delayed) of:

            (A) the Borrower; provided that no consent of the Borrower shall be
      required for an assignment to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender, an
      Approved Fund or, if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing,
      any other assignee;

            (B) the Administrative Agent; provided that no consent of the
      Administrative Agent shall be required for an assignment of all or any
      portion of a Tranche B Term Loan to a Lender, an Affiliate of a Lender or
      an Approved Fund; and

            (C) each Issuing Lender and Swingline Lender; provided that no
      consent of any Issuing Lender or Swingline Lender shall be required for an
      assignment of all or any portion of a Tranche B Term Loan.

            (ii) Assignments shall be subject to the following additional
conditions:

            (A) no assignment may be made to an Ineligible Assignee;

            (B) except in the case of an assignment to a Lender or an Affiliate
      of a Lender or an Approved Fund or an assignment of the entire remaining
      amount of the assigning Lender's Commitment or Loans of any Class, the
      amount of the Commitment or Loans of the assigning Lender subject to each
      such assignment (determined as of the date the Assignment and Assumption
      with respect to such assignment is delivered to the Administrative Agent)
      shall not be less than $5,000,000 or, in the case of Tranche B Term Loans,
      $1,000,000, unless the Borrower and the Administrative Agent otherwise
      consent; provided that no such consent of the Borrower shall be required
      if an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing;

            (C) each partial assignment shall be made as an assignment of a
      proportionate part of all the assigning Lender's rights and obligations
      under this Agreement, except that this clause (C) shall not be construed
      to prohibit the assignment of a proportionate part of all the assigning
      Lender's rights and obligations in respect of one Facility;

            (D) the parties to each assignment shall execute and deliver to the
      Administrative Agent an Assignment and Assumption, together with a
      processing and recordation fee of $3,500 to be paid by the assignor or
      assignee; provided that only one such fee shall be payable in connection
      with simultaneous assignments to or by two or more related Approved Funds;
      and

            (E) the assignee, if it shall not be a Lender, shall deliver to the
      Administrative Agent an Administrative Questionnaire.

            (F) in the case of an assignment by a Lender to a CLO (as defined
      below) managed or administered by such Lender or an Affiliate of such
      Lender, the assigning Lender shall retain the sole right to approve any
      amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement and
      the other Loan Documents, provided that the

                                       96
<PAGE>

      Assignment and Assumption between such Lender and such CLO may provide
      that such Lender will not, without the consent of such CLO, agree to any
      amendment, modification or waiver that (1) requires the consent of each
      Lender directly affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second
      sentence of Section 11.1 and (2) directly affects such CLO.

            For purposes of this Section 11.6, the terms "Approved Fund" and
"CLO" have the following meanings:

            "Approved Fund" means any Person (other than a natural person) that
is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or investing in bank loans and similar
extensions of credit in the ordinary course and that is administered or managed
by, or has as its principal investment advisor, a Lender, an Affiliate of a
Lender or an entity or an Affiliate of an entity that administers or manages a
Lender or is the principal investment advisor of a Lender.

            "CLO" means any entity (whether a corporation, partnership, trust or
otherwise) that is engaged in making, purchasing, holding or otherwise investing
in bank loans and similar extensions of credit in the ordinary course of its
business and is administered or managed by a Lender or an affiliate of such
Lender.

            (iii) Subject to acceptance and recording thereof pursuant to
paragraph (b)(iv) of this Section, from and after the effective date specified
in each Assignment and Assumption the assignee thereunder shall be a party
hereto and, to the extent of the interest assigned by such Assignment and
Assumption, have the rights and obligations of a Lender under this Agreement,
and the assigning Lender thereunder shall, to the extent of the interest
assigned by such Assignment and Assumption, be released from its obligations
under this Agreement (and, in the case of an Assignment and Assumption covering
all of the assigning Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement, such
Lender shall cease to be a party hereto but shall continue to be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10, 4.11, 11.5 and 11.13(e)). Any assignment or
transfer by a Lender of rights or obligations under this Agreement that does not
comply with this Section 11.6 shall be treated for purposes of this Agreement as
a sale by such Lender of a participation in such rights and obligations in
accordance with paragraph (c) of this Section.

            (iv) The Administrative Agent, acting for this purpose as an agent
of the Borrower, shall maintain at one of its offices in The City of New York a
copy of each Assignment and Assumption delivered to it and a register for the
recordation of the names and addresses of the Lenders, and the Commitment of,
and principal amount of the Loans and L/C Obligations owing to, each Lender
pursuant to the terms hereof from time to time (the "Register"). The entries in
the Register shall be conclusive, and each of the Borrower, the Administrative
Agent, the Issuing Lender and the Lenders may treat each Person whose name is
recorded in the Register pursuant to the terms hereof as a Lender hereunder for
all purposes of this Agreement, notwithstanding notice to the contrary. The
Register shall be available for inspection by the Borrower, any Issuing Lender
and any Lender, at any reasonable time and from time to time upon reasonable
prior notice.

            (v) Upon its receipt of a duly completed Assignment and Assumption
executed by an assigning Lender and an assignee, the assignee's completed
Administrative Questionnaire

                                       97
<PAGE>

(unless the assignee shall already be a Lender hereunder), the processing and
recordation fee referred to in paragraph (b) of this Section and any written
consent to such assignment required by paragraph (b) of this Section, the
Administrative Agent shall accept such Assignment and Assumption and record the
information contained therein in the Register. No assignment shall be effective
for purposes of this Agreement unless it has been recorded in the Register as
provided in this paragraph.

            (c) (i) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders or the Swingline Lender, sell
participations to one or more banks or other entities (a "Participant") in all
or a portion of such Lender's rights and obligations under this Agreement
(including all or a portion of its Commitment and the Loans owing to it);
provided that (A) such Lender's obligations under this Agreement shall remain
unchanged, (B) such Lender shall remain solely responsible to the other parties
hereto for the performance of such obligations and (C) the Borrower, the
Administrative Agent, the Issuing Lenders and the other Lenders shall continue
to deal solely and directly with such Lender in connection with such Lender's
rights and obligations under this Agreement. Any agreement or instrument
pursuant to which a Lender sells such a participation shall provide that such
Lender shall retain the sole right to enforce the Loan Documents and to approve
any amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of the Loan Documents;
provided that such agreement or instrument may provide that such Lender will
not, without the consent of the Participant, agree to any amendment,
modification or waiver (1) that requires the consent of each Lender directly
affected thereby pursuant to the proviso to the second sentence of Section 11.1
and (2) directly affects such Participant. Subject to paragraph (c)(ii) of this
Section, the Borrower agrees that each Participant shall be entitled to the
benefits of Sections 4.9, 4.10 and 4.11 to the same extent as if it were a
Lender and had acquired its interest by assignment pursuant to paragraph (c)(ii)
of this Section. To the extent permitted by law, each Participant also shall be
entitled to the benefits of Section 11.7 as though it were a Lender, provided
such Participant agrees to be subject to Section 11.7(a) as though it were a
Lender.

            (ii) A Participant shall not be entitled to receive any greater
payment under Section 4.9 or 4.11 than the applicable Lender would have been
entitled to receive with respect to the participation sold to such Participant,
unless the sale of the participation to such Participant is made with the
applicable Borrower's prior written consent. A Participant that would be a
Non-U.S. Lender if it were a Lender shall not be entitled to the benefits of
Section 4.11 unless the applicable Borrower is notified of the participation
sold to such Participant and such Participant agrees, for the benefit of such
Borrower, to comply with Section 4.10(a) as though it were a Lender.

            (d) Any Lender may, without the consent of the Borrower or the
Administrative Agent, at any time pledge or assign a security interest in all or
any portion of its rights under this Agreement to secure obligations of such
Lender, including any pledge or assignment to secure obligations to a Federal
Reserve Bank, and this Section shall not apply to any such pledge or assignment
of a security interest; provided that no such pledge or assignment of a security
interest shall release a Lender from any of its obligations hereunder or
substitute any such pledgee or assignee for such Lender as a party hereto.


                                       98
<PAGE>

            (e) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Conduit Lender may assign any
or all of the Loans it may have funded hereunder to its designating Lender
without the consent of the Borrower or the Administrative Agent and without
regard to the limitations set forth in Section 11.6(b). The Borrower, each
Lender and each Agent hereby confirms that it will not institute against a
Conduit Lender or join any other Person in instituting against a Conduit Lender
any bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, insolvency or liquidation
proceeding under any state bankruptcy or similar law, for one year and one day
after the payment in full of the latest maturing commercial paper note issued by
such Conduit Lender; provided, however, that each Lender designating any Conduit
Lender hereby agrees to indemnify, save and hold harmless each other party
hereto for any loss, cost, damage or expense arising out of its inability to
institute such a proceeding against such Conduit Lender during such period of
forbearance.

            11.7. Adjustments; Set-off. Except to the extent that this Agreement
expressly provides for payments to be allocated to a particular Lender or to the
Lenders under a particular Facility, if any Lender (a "Benefitted Lender")
shall, at any time after the Loans and other amounts payable hereunder shall
immediately become due and payable pursuant to Section 9, receive any payment of
all or part of the Obligations owing to it, or receive any collateral in respect
thereof (whether voluntarily or involuntarily, by set-off, pursuant to events or
proceedings of the nature referred to in Section 9(f), or otherwise), in a
greater proportion than any such payment to or collateral received by any other
Lender, if any, in respect of the Obligations owing to such other Lender, such
Benefitted Lender shall purchase for cash from the other Lenders a participating
interest in such portion of the Obligations owing to each such other Lender, or
shall provide such other Lenders with the benefits of any such collateral, as
shall be necessary to cause such Benefitted Lender to share the excess payment
or benefits of such collateral ratably with each of the Lenders; provided,
however, that if all or any portion of such excess payment or benefits is
thereafter recovered from such Benefitted Lender, such purchase shall be
rescinded, and the purchase price and benefits returned, to the extent of such
recovery, but without interest.

            (b) In addition to any rights and remedies of the Lenders provided
by law, each Lender shall have the right, without prior notice to the Borrower,
any such notice being expressly waived by the Borrower to the extent permitted
by applicable law, upon any amount becoming due and payable by the Borrower
hereunder (whether at the stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise), to set
off and appropriate and apply against such amount any and all deposits (general
or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any currency, and any
other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in each case whether
direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or unmatured, at any time
held or owing by such Lender or any branch or agency thereof to or for the
credit or the account of the Borrower. Each Lender agrees promptly to notify the
Borrower and the Administrative Agent after any such setoff and application made
by such Lender, provided that the failure to give such notice shall not affect
the validity of such setoff and application.

            11.8. Counterparts.This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts, and all of
said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to constitute one and the same
instrument. Delivery of an executed signature page of this Agreement by
facsimile transmission shall be effective as

                                       99
<PAGE>

delivery of a manually executed counterpart hereof. A set of the copies of this
Agreement signed by all the parties shall be lodged with the Borrower and the
Administrative Agent.

            11.9. Severability.Any provision of this Agreement that is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

            11.10. Integration.This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
represent the entire agreement of the Borrower, the Agents and the Lenders with
respect to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent or any Lender relative
to subject matter hereof not expressly set forth or referred to herein or in the
other Loan Documents.

            11.11. GOVERNING LAW.THIS AGREEMENT AND THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS
OF THE PARTIES UNDER THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND CONSTRUED AND
INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

            11.12. Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers

            The Borrower hereby irrevocably and unconditionally:

            (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
      proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
      which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
      respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the courts
      of the State of New York, the courts of the United States for the Southern
      District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof;

            (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in
      such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
      the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such
      action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not
      to plead or claim the same;

            (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding
      may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
      (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to the
      Borrower at its address set forth in Section 11.2 or at such other address
      of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant
      thereto;

            (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
      service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the
      right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and


                                      100
<PAGE>

            (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right
      it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred
      to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential
      damages.

            11.13. Acknowledgments.The Borrower hereby acknowledges that:

            (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
      delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents;

            (b) no Agent, Issuing Lender or Lender has any fiduciary
      relationship with or duty to the Borrower arising out of or in connection
      with this Agreement or any of the other Loan Documents, and the
      relationship between the Agents, the Issuing Lender and Lenders, on one
      hand, and the Borrower, on the other hand, in connection herewith or
      therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

            (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan
      Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated
      hereby among the Lenders or among the Borrower and the Lenders.

            11.14. Releases of Guarantees and Liens.(a) Notwithstanding anything
to the contrary contained herein or in any other Loan Document, the
Administrative Agent is hereby irrevocably authorized by each Lender (without
requirement of notice to or consent of any Lender except as expressly required
by Section 11.1) to take any action requested by the Borrower having the effect
of releasing any Collateral or guarantee obligations (i) to the extent necessary
to permit consummation of any transaction not prohibited by any Loan Document or
that has been consented to in accordance with Section 11.1 or (ii) under the
circumstances described in paragraph (b) below.

            (b) At such time as the Loans, the Reimbursement Obligations and the
other obligations under the Loan Documents (other than obligations under or in
respect of Hedge Agreements) shall have been paid in full, the Commitments have
been terminated and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, the Collateral
shall be released from the Liens created by the Security Documents, and the
Security Documents and all obligations (other than those expressly stated to
survive such termination) of the Administrative Agent and each Loan Party under
the Security Documents shall terminate, all without delivery of any instrument
or performance of any act by any Person.

to keep confidential all non-public information provided to it by any Loan Party

confidential; provided that nothing herein shall prevent any Agent, Issuing
Lender or any Lender from disclosing any such information (a) to any Agent, any
other Lender or any Lender Affiliate, (b) subject to an agreement to comply with
the provisions of this Section, to any actual or prospective Transferee or any
direct or indirect counterparty to any Hedge Agreement (or any professional
advisor to such counterparty), (c) to its employees, directors, agents,
attorneys, accountants and other professional advisors or those of any of its
affiliates, (d) upon the request or demand of any

                                      101
<PAGE>

hereunder or under any other Loan Document. Any Person required to maintain the
confidentiality of information as provided in this Section shall be considered
to have complied with its obligation to do so if such Person has exercised the
same degree of care to maintain the confidentiality of such information as such
Person would accord to its own confidential information.

            11.16. WAIVERS OF JURY TRIAL.THE BORROWER, THE AGENTS AND THE
LENDERS HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVE TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL
ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND
FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.

            11.17. [Reserved]

            11.18. Conversion of Currencies.(a) If, for the purpose of obtaining
judgment in any court, it is necessary to convert a sum owing hereunder in one
currency into another currency, each party hereto agrees, to the fullest extent
that it may effectively do so, that the rate of exchange used shall be that at
which, in accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant
jurisdiction, the first currency could be purchased with such other currency on
the Business Day immediately preceding the day on which final judgment is given.

            (b) The obligations of the Borrower in respect of any sum due to any
party hereto or any holder of the obligations owing hereunder (the "Applicable
Creditor") shall, notwithstanding any judgment in a currency (the "Judgment
Currency") other than the currency in which such sum is stated to be due
hereunder (the "Agreement Currency"), be discharged only to the extent that, on
the Business Day following receipt by the Applicable Creditor of any sum
adjudged to be so due in the Judgment Currency, the Applicable Creditor may in
accordance with normal banking procedures in the relevant jurisdiction purchase
the Agreement Currency with the Judgment Currency; if the amount of the
Agreement Currency so purchased is less than the sum originally due to the
Applicable Creditor in the Agreement Currency, the Borrower agrees, as a
separate obligation and notwithstanding any such judgment, to indemnify the
Applicable Creditor against such loss. The obligations of the Borrower contained
in this Section 11.19 shall survive the termination of this Agreement and the
payment of all other amounts owing hereunder.

            11.19. Interest Rate Limitation.Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, if at any time the interest rate applicable to any Loan, together
with all fees, charges and other amounts which are treated as interest on such
Loan under applicable law (collectively the "Charges"), shall exceed the maximum
lawful rate (the "Maximum Rate") which may be contracted for, charged, taken,
received or reserved by the Lender holding such Loan in



                                      102

<PAGE>

accordance with applicable law, the rate of interest payable in respect of such
Loan hereunder, together with all Charges payable in respect thereof, shall be
limited to the Maximum Rate and, to the extent lawful, the interest and Charges
that would have been payable in respect of such Loan but were not payable as a
result of the operation of this Section shall be cumulated and the interest and
Charges payable to such Lender in respect of other Loans or periods shall be
increased (but not above the Maximum Rate therefor) until such cumulated amount,
together with interest thereon at the Federal Funds Effective Rate to the date
of repayment, shall have been received by such Lender.





                                      103

            IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties hereto have caused this Agreement to
be duly executed and delivered by their proper and duly authorized officers as

The Applicable Margin shall be adjusted, on and after the first Adjustment Date
(as defined below) occurring after the date which is six months after the
Effective Date, based on changes in the Consolidated Leverage Ratio, with such
adjustments to become effective on the date (the "Adjustment Date") that is
three Business Days after the date on which the relevant financial statements
are delivered to the Lenders pursuant to Section 7.1 and to remain in effect
until the next adjustment to be effected pursuant to this paragraph. If any
financial statements referred to above are not delivered within the time periods
specified in Section 7.1, then, until the date that is three Business Days after
the date on which such financial statements are delivered, the highest rate set
forth in each column of the Pricing Grid shall apply. On each Adjustment Date,
the Applicable Margin shall be adjusted to be equal to the Applicable Margins
opposite the Pricing Level determined to exist on such Adjustment Date from the
financial statements relating to such Adjustment Date. Prior to the date on
which the financial statements specified in Section 7.1 for the fiscal quarter
ended June 30, 2005 are required to be delivered, the Applicable Margin shall be
determined by reference to Pricing Level II.

            As used herein, the following rules shall govern the determination
of Pricing Levels on each Adjustment Date:

            "Pricing Level I"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is greater than or equal
to 3.25 to 1.00.

            "Pricing Level II"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is less than 3.25 to 1.00
but greater than or equal to 2.50 to 1.00.

            "Pricing Level III"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is less than 2.50 to 1.00
but greater than or equal to 2.00 to 1.00.

            "Pricing Level IV"  shall exist on an Adjustment Date if the
Consolidated Leverage Ratio for the relevant period is less than 2.00 to 1.00.

severally, unconditionally and irrevocably, guarantees to the Administrative
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Agents and the Lenders and their
respective permitted successors, indorsees, transferees and assigns, the prompt
and complete payment and performance by the Borrower when due (whether at the
stated maturity, by acceleration or otherwise) of the Borrower Obligations.

            (b) [Reserved.]

            (c) [Reserved.]

            (d) The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall remain in full
force and effect until all the Borrower Obligations and the obligations of each
Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall have been
satisfied by payment in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the
Commitments shall be terminated, notwithstanding that from time to time during
the term of the Credit Agreement the Borrower may be free from any Borrower
Obligations.

            (e) No payment made by the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any
other guarantor or any other Person or received or collected by any Agent or any
Lender from the Borrower, any of the Guarantors, any other guarantor or any
other Person by virtue of any action or proceeding or any set-off or
appropriation or application at any time or from time to time in reduction of or
in payment of the Borrower Obligations shall be deemed to modify, reduce,
release or otherwise affect the liability of any Guarantor hereunder which
shall, notwithstanding any such payment (other than any payment made by such
Guarantor in respect of the Borrower Obligations or any payment received or
collected from such Guarantor in respect of the Borrower Obligations), remain
liable for the Borrower Obligations until the Borrower Obligations are paid in
full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments are
terminated.

            2.2. Indemnity and Subrogation. In addition to all such rights of
indemnity and subrogation as the Guarantors may have under applicable law (but
subject to Section 2.4), the Borrower agrees that (a) in the event a payment of
an obligation shall be made by any Guarantor under this Agreement, the Borrower
shall indemnify such Guarantor for the full amount of such payment and such
Guarantor shall be subrogated to the rights of the Person to

                                       5
<PAGE>

whom such payment shall have been made to the extent of such payment and (b) in
the event any assets of any Grantor shall be sold pursuant to this Agreement or
any other Security Document to satisfy in whole or in part an obligation owed to
any Lender, the Borrower shall indemnify such Grantor in an amount equal to the
greater of the book value or the fair market value of the assets so sold.

            2.3. Contribution and Subrogation. Each Guarantor and Grantor (a
"Contributing Party") agrees (subject to Section 2.4) that, in the event a
payment shall be made by any other Guarantor hereunder in respect of any
Borrower Obligation or assets of any other Grantor shall be sold pursuant to any
Security Document to satisfy any Borrower Obligation owed to any Lender and such
other Guarantor or Grantor (the "Claiming Party") shall not have been fully
indemnified by the Borrower as provided in Section 2.2, the Contributing Party
shall indemnify the Claiming Party in an amount equal to the amount of such
payment or the greater of the book value or the fair market value of such
assets, as the case may be, in each case multiplied by a fraction of which the
numerator shall be the net worth of the Contributing Party on the date hereof
and the denominator shall be the aggregate net worth of all the Guarantors and
Grantors on the date hereof (or, in the case of any Guarantor or Grantor
becoming a party hereto pursuant to Section 8.14, the date of the Assumption
Agreement executed and delivered by such Guarantor or Grantor). Any Contributing
Party making any payment to a Claiming Party pursuant to this Section 2.3 shall
be subrogated to the rights of such Claiming Party under Section 2.2 to the
extent of such payment.

            2.4. Subordination. (a) Notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement to the contrary, all rights of the Guarantors and Grantors under
Sections 2.2 and 2.3 and all other rights of indemnity, contribution or
subrogation under applicable law or otherwise shall be fully subordinated to the
indefeasible payment in full in cash of the Borrower Obligations. No failure on
the part of the Borrower or any Guarantor or Grantor to make the payments
required by Sections 2.2 and 2.3 (or any other payments required under
applicable law or otherwise) shall in any respect limit the obligations and
liabilities of any Guarantor or Grantor with respect to its obligations
hereunder, and each Guarantor and Grantor shall remain liable for the full
amount of the obligations of such Guarantor or Grantor hereunder.

            (b) Each Guarantor and Grantor hereby agrees that all Indebtedness
and other monetary obligations owed by it to any other Guarantor, Grantor or any
other Subsidiary shall be fully subordinated to the indefeasible payment in full
in cash of the Borrower Obligations.

            2.5. Amendments, etc. with respect to the Borrower Obligations. Each
Guarantor shall remain obligated hereunder notwithstanding that, without any
reservation of rights against any Guarantor and without notice to or further
assent by any Guarantor, any demand for payment of any of the Borrower
Obligations made by any Agent or any Lender may be rescinded by such Agent or
such Lender and any of the Borrower Obligations continued, and the Borrower
Obligations, or the liability of any other Person upon or for any part thereof,
or any collateral security or guarantee therefor or right of offset with respect
thereto, may, from time to time, in whole or in part, be renewed, extended,
amended, modified, accelerated, compromised, waived, surrendered or released by
any Agent or any Lender, and the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents
and any other documents executed and delivered in connection therewith may be
amended, modified, supplemented or terminated, in whole or in part, and any
collateral

                                       6
<PAGE>

security, guarantee or right of offset at any time held by any Agent or any
Lender for the payment of the Borrower Obligations may be sold, exchanged,
waived, surrendered or released. No Agent or Lender shall have any obligation to
protect, secure, perfect or insure any Lien at any time held by it as security
for the Borrower Obligations or for the guarantee contained in this Section 2 or
any property subject thereto.

            2.6. Guarantee Absolute and Unconditional. Each Guarantor to the
extent permitted by applicable law, waives any and all notice of the creation,
renewal, extension or accrual of any of the Borrower Obligations and notice of
or proof of reliance by any Agent or any Lender upon the guarantee contained in
this Section 2 or acceptance of the guarantee contained in this Section 2; the
Borrower Obligations, and any of them, shall conclusively be deemed to have been
created, contracted or incurred, or renewed, extended, amended or waived, in
reliance upon the guarantee contained in this Section 2; and all dealings
between the Borrower and any of the Guarantors, on the one hand, and the Agents
and the Lenders, on the other hand, likewise shall be conclusively presumed to
have been had or consummated in reliance upon the guarantee contained in this
Section 2. Each Guarantor, to the extent permitted by applicable law, waives
diligence, presentment, protest, demand for payment and notice of default or
nonpayment to or upon the Borrower or any of the Guarantors with respect to the
Borrower Obligations. Each Guarantor understands and agrees that the guarantee
contained in this Section 2 shall be construed as a continuing, absolute and
unconditional guarantee of payment without regard to (a) the validity or
enforceability of the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document, any of the
Borrower Obligations or any other collateral security therefor or guarantee or
right of offset with respect thereto at any time or from time to time held by
any Agent or any Lender, (b) any defense, set-off or counterclaim (other than a
defense of payment or performance) which may at any time be available to or be
asserted by the Borrower or any other Person against any Agent or any Lender, or
(c) any other circumstance whatsoever (with or without notice to or knowledge of
the Borrower or such Guarantor) which constitutes, or might be construed to
constitute, an equitable or legal discharge of the Borrower for the Borrower
Obligations, or of such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in this Section
2, in bankruptcy or in any other instance. When making any demand hereunder or
otherwise pursuing its rights and remedies hereunder against any Guarantor, any
Agent or any Lender may, but shall be under no obligation to, make a similar
demand on or otherwise pursue such rights and remedies as it may have against
the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or against any collateral
security or guarantee for the Borrower Obligations or any right of offset with
respect thereto, and any failure by any Agent or any Lender to make any such
demand, to pursue such other rights or remedies or to collect any payments from
the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or to realize upon any
such collateral security or guarantee or to exercise any such right of offset,
or any release of the Borrower, any other Guarantor or any other Person or any
such collateral security, guarantee or right of offset, shall not relieve any
Guarantor of any obligation or liability hereunder, and shall not impair or
affect the rights and remedies, whether express, implied or available as a
matter of law, of any Agent or any Lender against any Guarantor. For the
purposes hereof "demand" shall include the commencement and continuance of any
legal proceedings.

            2.7. Reinstatement. The guarantee contained in this Section 2 shall
continue to be effective, or be reinstated, as the case may be, if at any time
payment, or any part thereof, of any of the Borrower Obligations is rescinded or
must otherwise be restored or returned by any Agent or any Lender upon the
insolvency, bankruptcy, dissolution, liquidation or reorganization

                                       7
<PAGE>

of the Borrower or any Guarantor, or upon or as a result of the appointment of a
receiver, intervenor or conservator of, or trustee or similar officer for, the
Borrower or any Guarantor or any substantial part of its property, or otherwise,
all as though such payments had not been made.

            2.8. Payments. Each Guarantor hereby guarantees that payments
hereunder will be paid to the Administrative Agent without set-off or
counterclaim in Dollars at the Funding Office.

                     SECTION 3. GRANT OF SECURITY INTEREST

             Each Grantor hereby assigns and transfers to the Administrative
Agent, and hereby grants to the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of
the Agents and the Lenders (and any affiliates of any Lender to which Borrower
Hedge Agreement Obligations are owing), a security interest in, all of the
following property now owned or at any time hereafter acquired by such Grantor
or in which such Grantor now has or at any time in the future may acquire any
right, title or interest (collectively, the "Collateral"), as collateral
security for the prompt and complete payment and performance when due (whether

            (d) all Documents;

            (e) all Equipment, other than Vehicles;

            (f) all General Intangibles;

            (g) all Instruments (except with regard to licenses of Intellectual
      Property by a third party to a Grantor, if the assignment, transfer or
      grant of the security interest would breach, limit the rights of the
      Grantor under or give rise to a right to terminate such license);

            (h) all Intellectual Property;

            (i) all Inventory;

            (j) all Investment Property;

            (k) all Letter-of-Credit Rights;

            (l) all Goods and other property not otherwise described above;

            (m) all books and records pertaining to the Collateral; and

<PAGE>

            (n) to the extent not otherwise included, all Proceeds, Supporting
Obligations and products of any and all of the foregoing and all collateral
security and guarantees given by any Person with respect to any of the
foregoing;

provided, however, that notwithstanding any of the other provisions set forth in
this Section 3, this Agreement shall not constitute a grant of a security
interest in any property to the extent that such grant of a security interest is
prohibited by any Requirements of Law of a Governmental Authority, requires a
consent not obtained of any Governmental Authority pursuant to such Requirement
of Law or is prohibited by, or constitutes a breach or default under or results
in the termination of or requires any consent not obtained under, any contract,
license, agreement, instrument or other document evidencing or giving rise to
such property or, in the case of any Investment Property, Pledged Stock or
Pledged Note, any applicable shareholder or similar agreement, except to the
extent that such Requirement of Law or the term in such contract, license,
agreement, instrument or other document or shareholder or similar agreement
providing for such prohibition, breach, default or termination or requiring such
consent is ineffective under applicable law; and provided, further, that the
parties hereto acknowledge that the security interest is granted as security
only and shall not subject the Administrative Agent or any Lender to, or in any
way alter or modify, any obligation or liability of any Grantor with respect to
or arising out of the Collateral.

                   SECTION 4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES

            To induce the Agents and the Lenders to enter into the Credit
Agreement and to induce the Lenders to make their respective extensions of
credit to the Borrower thereunder, each Grantor hereby represents and warrants
to each Agent and each Lender that:

            4.1. Representations in Credit Agreement. In the case of each
Guarantor, the representations and warranties set forth in Section 5 of the
Credit Agreement as they relate to such Guarantor or to the Loan Documents to
which such Guarantor is a party, each of which is hereby incorporated herein by
reference, are true and correct, and each Agent and each Lender shall be
entitled to rely on each of them as if they were fully set forth herein,
provided that each reference in each such representation and warranty to the
Borrower's knowledge shall, for the purposes of this Section 4.1, be deemed to
be a reference to such Guarantor's knowledge.

            4.2. Title; No Other Liens. Except for the security interest granted
to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Agents and the
Lenders pursuant to this Agreement and the other Liens permitted to exist on the

statement or other public notice with respect to all or any part of the

been filed in favor of the Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the
Agents and the Lenders, pursuant to this Agreement or as are permitted by the
Credit Agreement.

            4.3. Perfected Liens. The security interests granted pursuant to
this Agreement (a) upon completion of the filings and other actions specified on
Schedule 3 (which, in the case of all filings and other documents referred to on
said Schedule, have been delivered to the Administrative Agent in completed and
duly executed form) will constitute valid perfected

                                       9
<PAGE>

security interests in all of the Collateral in favor of the Administrative
Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Agents and the Lenders, as collateral
security for such Grantor's Obligations, enforceable in accordance with the
terms hereof against all creditors of such Grantor and any Persons purporting to

charter, certificate of incorporation or other organization document and
long-form good standing certificate as of a date which is recent to the date

            4.5. Inventory and Equipment. On the date hereof, the Inventory and

Schedule 5.

            4.6. Farm Products. None of the Collateral constitutes, or is the

            4.7. Investment Property. (a) The shares of Pledged Stock pledged by
such Grantor hereunder constitute all the issued and outstanding shares of all
classes of the Capital Stock of each relevant Issuer owned by such Grantor or,
in the case of Foreign Subsidiary Voting Stock, if less, 65% of the outstanding
Foreign Subsidiary Voting Stock of each relevant Issuer owned by such Grantor.

            (b) All the shares of the Pledged Stock have been duly and validly
issued and are fully paid and nonassessable.

            (c) Each of the Pledged Notes constitutes the legal, valid and
binding obligation of the obligor with respect thereto, enforceable in
accordance with its terms, subject to the effects of bankruptcy, insolvency,
fraudulent conveyance, reorganization, moratorium and other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights generally, general equitable
principles (whether considered in a proceeding in equity or at law) and an
implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

            (d) Such Grantor is the record and beneficial owner of, and has good
and marketable title to, the Investment Property pledged by it hereunder, free
of any and all Liens or options in favor of, or claims of any other Person,

            4.9. Intellectual Property. (a) Schedule 6 lists all registered

pursuant to which such Grantor is the licensor or franchisor.

            (d) No holding, decision or judgment has been rendered by any
Governmental Authority which would limit, cancel or question the validity of, or
such Grantor's rights in, any Intellectual Property in any respect that could
reasonably be expected to have a Material Adverse Effect.

            (e) Except as set forth on Schedule 6, no action or proceeding is
pending, or, to the knowledge of such Grantor, threatened, on the date hereof
(i) seeking to limit, cancel or question the validity of any Intellectual

adversely determined, would have a material adverse effect on the value of any
Intellectual Property.

                              SECTION 5. COVENANTS

            Each Grantor covenants and agrees with the Agents and the Lenders
that, from and after the date of this Agreement until the Obligations shall have
been paid in full, no Letter of Credit shall be outstanding and the Commitments
shall have terminated:

            5.1. Covenants in Credit Agreement. In the case of each Guarantor,
such Guarantor shall take, or shall refrain from taking, as the case may be,
each action that is necessary to be taken or not taken under Sections 6, 7 and 8
of the Credit Agreement, as the case may be, so that no Default or Event of
Default is caused by the failure to take such action or to refrain from taking
such action by such Guarantor or any of its Subsidiaries.

            5.2. Delivery of Instruments and Chattel Paper. If any amount in
excess of $100,000 payable under or in connection with any of the Collateral
shall be or become evidenced by any Instrument, Certificated Security or Chattel
Paper, such Instrument, Certificated Security or Chattel Paper shall be promptly

<PAGE>

            (b) All such insurance shall (i) provide that no cancellation,
material reduction in amount or material change in coverage thereof shall be

respect thereto as the Administrative Agent may from time to time reasonably
request.

            5.4. Payment of Obligations. Such Grantor will pay and discharge or
otherwise satisfy at or before maturity or before they become delinquent, as the
case may be, all material taxes, assessments and governmental charges or levies
imposed upon the Collateral or in respect of income or profits therefrom, as
well as all material claims of any kind (including, without limitation, claims
for labor, materials and supplies) against or with respect to the Collateral,
except that no such charge need be paid if the amount or validity thereof is
currently being contested in good faith by appropriate proceedings and reserves
in conformity with GAAP with respect thereto have been provided on the books of
such Grantor.

            5.5. Maintenance of Perfected Security Interest; Further
Documentation. (a) Such Grantor shall maintain the security interest created by
this Agreement as a perfected security interest having at least the priority

            (b) Such Grantor will furnish to the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders from time to time statements and schedules further identifying and

the Administrative Agent, and at the sole expense of such Grantor, such Grantor
will promptly and duly execute and deliver, and have recorded, such further
instruments and documents and take such further actions as the Administrative
Agent may reasonably request for the purpose of obtaining or preserving the full
benefits of this Agreement and of the rights and powers herein granted,
including, without limitation, (i) the filing of any financing or continuation
statements under the Uniform Commercial Code (or other similar laws) in effect
in any jurisdiction with respect to the security interests created hereby and

            5.7. Notices. Such Grantor will advise the Administrative Agent and
the Lenders promptly, in reasonable detail, of:

            (a) any Lien (other than security interests created hereby or Liens
      permitted under the Credit Agreement) on any of the Collateral which would
      materially adversely affect the ability of the Administrative Agent to
      exercise any of its remedies hereunder; and

            (b) of the occurrence of any other event which could reasonably be
      expected to have a material adverse effect on the aggregate value of the
      Collateral or on the security interests created hereby.

            5.8. Investment Property. (a) If such Grantor shall become entitled
to receive or shall receive any stock certificate (including, without
limitation, any certificate representing a stock dividend or a distribution in
connection with any reclassification, increase or reduction of capital or any
certificate issued in connection with any reorganization), option or rights in
respect of the Capital Stock of any Issuer, whether in addition to, in
substitution of, as a conversion of, or in exchange for, any shares of the
Pledged Stock, or otherwise in respect thereof, such Grantor shall accept the
same as the agent of the Agents and the Lenders, hold the same for the benefit
of the Agents and the Lenders and deliver the same forthwith to the
Administrative Agent in the exact form received, duly indorsed by such Grantor
to the Administrative Agent, if required, together with an undated stock power
covering such certificate duly executed in blank by such Grantor to be held by
the Administrative Agent, subject to the terms hereof, as additional collateral
security for the Obligations. Any sums paid upon or in respect of the Investment
Property upon the liquidation or dissolution of any Issuer shall be paid over to
the Administrative Agent to be held by it hereunder as additional collateral
security for the Obligations, and in case any distribution of capital shall be
made on or in respect of the Investment Property or any property shall be
distributed upon or with respect to the Investment Property pursuant to the
recapitalization or reclassification of the capital of any Issuer or pursuant to
the reorganization thereof, the property so distributed shall, unless otherwise
subject to a perfected security interest in favor of the Administrative Agent,
be delivered to the Administrative Agent to be held by it hereunder as
additional collateral security for the Obligations. If any sums of money or
property so paid or distributed in respect of the Investment Property shall be
received by such Grantor, such Grantor shall, until such money or property is
paid or delivered to the Administrative

                                       13
<PAGE>

Agent, hold such money or property for the benefit of the Agents and the
Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, as additional collateral
security for the Obligations. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Grantors shall
not be required to pay over to the Administrative Agent or deliver to the
Administrative Agent as Collateral any proceeds of any liquidation or
dissolution of any Issuer, or any distribution of capital or property in respect
of any Investment Property, to the extent that (i) such liquidation, dissolution
or distribution, if treated as a Disposition of the relevant Issuer, would be
permitted by the Credit Agreement and (ii) the proceeds thereof are applied
toward prepayment of Loans and reduction of Commitments to the extent required
by the Credit Agreement.

            (b) Without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent,
such Grantor will not (i) vote to enable, or take any other action to permit,
any Issuer to issue any stock or other equity securities of any nature or to
issue any other securities convertible into or granting the right to purchase or
exchange for any stock or other equity securities of any nature of any Issuer,
(ii) sell, assign, transfer, exchange, or otherwise dispose of, or grant any
option with respect to, the Investment Property or Proceeds thereof (except
pursuant to a transaction expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement), (iii)
create, incur or permit to exist any Lien or option in favor of, or any claim of
any Person with respect to, any of the Investment Property or Proceeds thereof,
or any interest therein, except for the security interests created by this
Agreement or (iv) enter into any agreement or undertaking restricting the right
or ability of such Grantor or the Administrative Agent to sell, assign or
transfer any of the Investment Property or Proceeds thereof (except pursuant to
a transaction expressly permitted by the Credit Agreement).

            (c) In the case of each Grantor which is an Issuer, such Issuer
agrees that (i) it will be bound by the terms of this Agreement relating to the
Investment Property issued by it and will comply with such terms insofar as such
terms are applicable to it, (ii) it will notify the Administrative Agent
promptly in writing of the occurrence of any of the events described in Section
5.8(a) with respect to the Investment Property issued by it and (iii) the terms
of Sections 6.3(c) and 6.7 shall apply to it, mutatis mutandis, with respect to
all actions that may be required of it pursuant to Section 6.3(c) or 6.7 with
respect to the Investment Property issued by it.

            5.9. Receivables. (a) Other than in the ordinary course of business
consistent with its past practice, such Grantor will not (i) grant any extension
of the time of payment of any Receivable, (ii) compromise or settle any
Receivable for less than the full amount thereof, (iii) release, wholly or
partially, any Person liable for the payment of any Receivable, (iv) allow any
credit or discount whatsoever on any Receivable or (v) amend, supplement or
modify in any material respect any Receivable in any manner that could adversely
affect the value thereof.

            (b) Such Grantor will deliver to the Administrative Agent a copy of
each material written demand, notice or document received by it that questions
the validity or enforceability of more than 5% of the aggregate amount of the
then outstanding Receivables.

            5.10. Intellectual Property. (a) Such Grantor (either itself or
through licensees) will (i) continue to use each material Trademark on and with
respect to each and every product and service applicable to its then current
line in order to maintain such Trademark in full force free from any claim of
abandonment for non-use, provided that if a product or service line is


                                       14
<PAGE>

discontinued, use of a Trademark with respect to such product or service line
may be discontinued, (ii) maintain at least the current quality of products and
services offered under such Trademark, (iii) use such Trademark with the
appropriate notice of registration and all other notices and legends required by
applicable Requirements of Law, (iv) not adopt or use any mark which is
confusingly similar or a colorable imitation of such Trademark unless the
Administrative Agent, for the ratable benefit of the Agents and the Lenders,
shall obtain a perfected security interest in such mark pursuant to this
Agreement, and (v) not knowingly (and not knowingly permit any licensee or
sublicensee thereof to) do any act or knowingly omit to do any act whereby such
Trademark may become invalidated or impaired in any way, except as provided in
Section 5.10(a)(i) above.

            (b) Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will not
knowingly do any act, or knowingly omit to do any act, whereby any material
Patent may become forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public.

            (c) Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will not
knowingly (and will not knowingly permit any licensee or sublicensee thereof to)
do any act or knowingly omit to do any act whereby any material portion of the
Copyrights may become invalidated or otherwise impaired. Such Grantor will not
knowingly (either itself or through licensees) do any act whereby any material
portion of the Copyrights may fall into the public domain.

            (d) Such Grantor (either itself or through licensees) will not do
any act that knowingly uses any material Intellectual Property to infringe the
intellectual property rights of any other Person.

            (e) Such Grantor will notify the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders promptly if it knows, or has reason to know, that any application or
registration relating to any material Intellectual Property may become
forfeited, abandoned or dedicated to the public, or of any adverse determination
or development (including, without limitation, the institution of, or any such
determination or development in, any proceeding in the United States Patent and
Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any court or tribunal in
any country) regarding such Grantor's ownership of, or the validity of, any
material Intellectual Property or such Grantor's right to register the same or
to own and maintain the same.

            (f) Whenever such Grantor, either by itself or through any agent,
employee, licensee or designee, shall file an application for the registration
of any Intellectual Property with the United States Patent and Trademark Office,
the United States Copyright Office or any similar office or agency in any other
country or any political subdivision thereof, such Grantor shall report such
filing to the Administrative Agent within thirty Business Days after the last
day of the fiscal quarter in which such filing occurs. Upon request of the
Administrative Agent, such Grantor shall execute and deliver, for recordation by
the Administrative Agent (at such Grantor's cost and expense), any and all
agreements, instruments, documents, and papers as the Administrative Agent may
request to evidence the Agents' and the Lenders' security interest in any
Copyright, Patent or Trademark and the goodwill and general intangibles of such
Grantor relating thereto or represented thereby.


                                       15

            (g) Such Grantor will take all reasonable and necessary steps,
including, without limitation, in any proceeding before the United States Patent
and Trademark Office, the United States Copyright Office or any similar office
or agency in any other country or any political subdivision thereof, to maintain
and pursue each application (and to obtain the relevant registration) and to
maintain each registration of the material Intellectual Property, including,
without limitation, filing of applications for renewal, affidavits of use and
affidavits of incontestability.

            (h) In the event that any material Intellectual Property is
infringed, misappropriated or diluted by a third party, such Grantor shall (i)
take such actions as such Grantor shall reasonably deem appropriate under the
circumstances to protect such Intellectual Property and (ii) if such
Intellectual Property is of material economic value, promptly notify the
Administrative Agent after it learns thereof and take all commercially
reasonable actions necessary to protect such Intellectual Property and to
recover any and all damages for such infringement, misappropriation or dilution.

                         SECTION 6. REMEDIAL PROVISIONS

            6.1. Certain Matters Relating to Receivables. (a) The Administrative
Agent shall have the right to make test verifications of the Receivables in any
manner and through any medium that the Administrative Agent (in consultation
with the Borrower) reasonably considers advisable, and each Grantor shall
furnish all such assistance and information as the Administrative Agent may
reasonably require in connection with such test verifications. At any time upon
the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default, upon the
Administrative Agent's reasonable request and at the expense of the relevant
Grantor, such Grantor shall cause independent public accountants reasonably
satisfactory to the Administrative Agent to furnish to the Administrative Agent
reports showing reconciliations, aging and test verifications of, and trial
balances for, the Receivables.

            (b) The Administrative Agent hereby authorizes each Grantor to
collect such Grantor's Receivables and the Administrative Agent may curtail or
terminate said authority at any time after the occurrence and during the
continuance of an Event of Default. If required by the Administrative Agent at
any time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
any payments of Receivables, when collected by any Grantor, (i) shall be
forthwith (and, in any event, within two Business Days) deposited by such
Grantor in the exact form received, duly indorsed by such Grantor to the
Administrative Agent if required, in a Collateral Account maintained under the
sole dominion and control of the Administrative Agent, subject to withdrawal by
the Administrative Agent for the account of the Lenders only as provided in
Section 6.5, and (ii) until so turned over, shall be held by such Grantor on
behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders, segregated from other funds
of such Grantor. Each such deposit of Proceeds of Receivables shall be
accompanied by a report identifying in reasonable detail the nature and source
of the payments included in the deposit.

            (c) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of
Default, at the Administrative Agent's request, each Grantor shall deliver to
the Administrative Agent all original (where practicable, otherwise copies will
be delivered) and other documents evidencing,

                                       16
<PAGE>

and relating to, the agreements and transactions which gave rise to the
Receivables, including, without limitation, all original orders, invoices and
shipping receipts.

            6.2. Communications with Obligors; Grantors Remain Liable. (a) The
Administrative Agent in its own name or in the name of others may at any time
after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
communicate with obligors under the Receivables to verify with them to the
Administrative Agent's reasonable satisfaction the existence, amount and terms
of any Receivables.

            (b) Upon the reasonable request of the Administrative Agent at any
time after the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default,
each Grantor shall notify obligors on the Receivables that the Receivables have
been assigned to the Administrative Agent for the ratable benefit of the Agents
and the Lenders and that payments in respect thereof shall be made directly to
the Administrative Agent.

            (c) Anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, each Grantor
shall remain liable under each Receivables to observe and perform in all
material respects all the conditions and obligations to be observed and
performed by it thereunder, all in accordance with the terms of any agreement
giving rise thereto. No Agent or Lender shall have any obligation or liability
under any Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto) by reason of or
arising out of this Agreement or the receipt by any Agent or any Lender of any
payment relating thereto, nor shall any Agent or any Lender be obligated in any
manner to perform any of the obligations of any Grantor under or pursuant to any
Receivable (or any agreement giving rise thereto), to make any payment, to make
any inquiry as to the nature or the sufficiency of any payment received by it or
as to the sufficiency of any performance by any party thereunder, to present or
file any claim, to take any action to enforce any performance or to collect the
payment of any amounts which may have been assigned to it or to which it may be
entitled at any time or times.

            6.3. Pledged Stock. (a) Unless an Event of Default shall have
occurred and be continuing and the Administrative Agent shall have given notice
to the relevant Grantor of the Administrative Agent's intent to exercise its
corresponding rights pursuant to Section 6.3(b), each Grantor shall be permitted
to receive all cash dividends paid in respect of the Pledged Stock and all
payments made in respect of the Pledged Notes and to exercise all voting and
corporate or other organizational rights with respect to the Investment
Property; provided, however, that no vote shall be cast or corporate or other
organizational right exercised or other action taken which, in the
Administrative Agent's reasonable judgment, would impair the Collateral or which
would be inconsistent with or result in any violation of any provision of the
Credit Agreement, this Agreement or any other Loan Document.

            (b) If an Event of Default shall occur and be continuing and the
Administrative Agent shall give notice of its intent to exercise such rights to
the relevant Grantor or Grantors, (i) the Administrative Agent shall have the
right to receive any and all cash dividends, payments or other Proceeds paid in
respect of the Investment Property and make application thereof to the
Obligations in the order set forth in Section 6.5, and (ii) any or all of the
Investment Property shall be registered in the name of the Administrative Agent
or its nominee, and the Administrative Agent or its nominee may thereafter
exercise (x) all voting, corporate and other rights pertaining to such
Investment Property at any meeting of shareholders

                                       17
<PAGE>

of the relevant Issuer or Issuers or otherwise and (y) any and all rights of
conversion, exchange and subscription and any other rights, privileges or
options pertaining to such Investment Property as if it were the absolute owner
thereof (including, without limitation, the right to exchange at its discretion
any and all of the Investment Property upon the merger, consolidation,
reorganization, recapitalization or other fundamental change in the corporate or
other organizational structure of any Issuer, or upon the exercise by any
Grantor or the Administrative Agent of any right, privilege or option pertaining
to such Investment Property, and in connection therewith, the right to deposit
and deliver any and all of the Investment Property with any committee,
depositary, transfer agent, registrar or other designated agency upon such terms
and conditions as the Administrative Agent may determine), all without liability
except to account for property actually received by it, but the Administrative
Agent shall have no duty to any Grantor to exercise any such right, privilege or
option and shall not be responsible for any failure to do so or delay in so
doing.

            (c) Each Grantor hereby authorizes and instructs each Issuer of any
Investment Property pledged by such Grantor hereunder to (i) comply with any
instruction received by it from the Administrative Agent in writing that (x)
states that an Event of Default has occurred and is continuing and (y) is
otherwise in accordance with the terms of this Agreement, without any other or
further instructions from such Grantor, and each Grantor agrees that each Issuer
shall be fully protected in so complying, and (ii) unless otherwise expressly
permitted hereby, pay any dividends or other payments with respect to the
Investment Property directly to the Administrative Agent.

            6.4. Proceeds to be Turned Over to Administrative Agent. In addition
to the rights of the Agents and the Lenders specified in Section 6.1 with
respect to payments of Receivables, if an Event of Default shall occur and be
continuing, all Proceeds received by any Grantor consisting of cash, checks and
other near-cash items shall be held by such Grantor on behalf of the Agents and
the Lenders, segregated from other funds of such Grantor, and shall, forthwith
upon receipt by such Grantor, be turned over to the Administrative Agent in the
exact form received by such Grantor (duly indorsed by such Grantor to the
Administrative Agent, if required). All Proceeds received by the Administrative
Agent hereunder shall be held by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral
Account maintained under its sole dominion and control. All Proceeds while held
by the Administrative Agent in a Collateral Account (or by such Grantor on
behalf of the Administrative Agent and the Lenders) shall continue to be held as
collateral security for all the Obligations and shall not constitute payment
thereof until applied as provided in Section 6.5.

            6.5. Application of Proceeds. At such intervals as may be agreed
upon by the Borrower and the Administrative Agent, or, if an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, at any time at the Administrative Agent's
election, the Administrative Agent may apply all or any part of Proceeds
constituting Collateral, whether or not held in any Collateral Account, and any
proceeds of the guarantee set forth in Section 2, in payment of the Obligations
in the following order:

            First, to pay incurred and unpaid fees, costs and expenses of the
      Administrative Agent under the Loan Documents, including, without
      limitation, the reasonable fees and expenses of counsel to the
      Administrative Agent;


                                       18
<PAGE>

            Second, to the Administrative Agent, for application by it towards
      payment of amounts remaining unpaid in respect of the Obligations, pro
      rata among the Agents and the Lenders according to the amounts of the
      Obligations remaining unpaid to the Agents and the Lenders (including
      depositing in a cash collateral account opened by the Administrative
      Agent, an amount equal to the aggregate amount of L/C Obligations at the
      time of application of Proceeds pursuant to this Section 6.5 and with
      respect to which the Borrower has not previously made a deposit into a
      cash collateral account pursuant to Section 9 of the Credit Agreement);
      and

            Third, any balance of such Proceeds remaining after the then
      outstanding Obligations shall have been paid in full, no Letters of Credit
      shall be outstanding and the Commitments shall have been terminated shall
      be paid over to the Borrower or to whomsoever may be lawfully entitled to
      receive the same.

            6.6. Code and Other Remedies. If an Event of Default shall occur and
be continuing, the Administrative Agent, on behalf of the Lenders, may exercise,
in addition to all other rights and remedies granted to them in this Agreement
and in any other instrument or agreement securing, evidencing or relating to the
Obligations, all rights and remedies of a secured party under the New York UCC
or any other applicable law. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
the Administrative Agent, without demand of performance or other demand,
presentment, protest, advertisement or notice of any kind (except any notice
required by law referred to below) to or upon any Grantor or any other Person
(all and each of which demands, defenses, advertisements and notices are hereby
waived to the extent permitted by applicable law), may in such circumstances
forthwith collect, receive, appropriate and realize upon the Collateral, or any
part thereof, and/or may forthwith sell, lease, assign, give option or options
to purchase, or otherwise dispose of and deliver the Collateral or any part
thereof (or contract to do any of the foregoing), in one or more parcels at
public or private sale or sales, at any exchange, broker's board or office of
any Agent or any Lender or elsewhere upon such terms and conditions as it may
deem advisable and at such prices as it may reasonably deem best, for cash or on
credit or for future delivery without assumption of any credit risk. Any Agent
or any Lender shall have the right upon any such public sale or sales, and, to
the extent permitted by law, upon any such private sale or sales, to purchase
the whole or any part of the Collateral so sold, free of any right or equity of
redemption in any Grantor, which right or equity is hereby waived and released.
Each Grantor further agrees, at the Administrative Agent's request, to assemble
the Collateral and make it available to the Administrative Agent at places which
the Administrative Agent shall reasonably select, whether at such Grantor's
premises or elsewhere. The Administrative Agent shall apply the net proceeds of
any action taken by it pursuant to this Section 6.6, after deducting all
reasonable costs and expenses of every kind incurred in connection therewith or
incidental to the care or safekeeping of any of the Collateral or in any way
relating to the Collateral or the rights of the Administrative Agent and the
Lenders hereunder, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and
disbursements, to the payment in whole or in part of the Obligations, in such
order as the Administrative Agent may elect, and only after such application and
after the payment by the Administrative Agent of any other amount required by
any provision of law, including, without limitation, Section 9-615(a)(3) of the
New York UCC, need the Administrative Agent account for the surplus, if any, to
any Grantor. To the extent permitted by applicable law, each Grantor waives all
claims, damages and demands it may acquire against any Agent or any Lender
arising out of the exercise by them

                                       19
<PAGE>

of any rights hereunder. If any notice of a proposed sale or other disposition
of Collateral shall be required by law, such notice shall be deemed reasonable
and proper if given at least 10 days before such sale or other disposition.

            6.7. Registration Rights. (a) If the Administrative Agent shall
determine to exercise its right to sell any or all of the Pledged Stock pursuant
to Section 6.6, and if in the opinion of the Administrative Agent it is
necessary or advisable to have the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be
sold, registered under the provisions of the Securities Act, the relevant
Grantor will cause the Issuer thereof to (i) execute and deliver, and cause the
directors and officers of such Issuer to execute and deliver, all such
instruments and documents, and do or cause to be done all such other acts as may
be, in the opinion of the Administrative Agent, necessary or advisable to
register the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, under the
provisions of the Securities Act, (ii) use its best efforts to cause the
registration statement relating thereto to become effective and to remain
effective for a period of one year from the date of the first public offering of
the Pledged Stock, or that portion thereof to be sold, and (iii) make all
amendments thereto and/or to the related prospectus which, in the opinion of the
Administrative Agent, are necessary or advisable, all in conformity with the
requirements of the Securities Act and the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission applicable thereto. Each Grantor agrees to
cause such Issuer to comply with the provisions of the securities or "Blue Sky"
laws of any and all jurisdictions which the Administrative Agent shall designate
and to make available to its security holders, as soon as practicable, an
earnings statement (which need not be audited) which will satisfy the provisions
of Section 11(a) of the Securities Act.

            (b) Each Grantor recognizes that the Administrative Agent may be
unable to effect a public sale of any or all the Pledged Stock, by reason of
certain prohibitions contained in the Securities Act and applicable state
securities laws or otherwise, and may be compelled to resort to one or more
private sales thereof to a restricted group of purchasers which will be obliged
to agree, among other things, to acquire such securities for their own account
for investment and not with a view to the distribution or resale thereof. Each
Grantor acknowledges and agrees that any such private sale may result in prices
and other terms less favorable than if such sale were a public sale and,
notwithstanding such circumstances, agrees that any such private sale shall be
deemed to have been made in a commercially reasonable manner. The Administrative
Agent shall be under no obligation to delay a sale of any of the Pledged Stock
for the period of time necessary to permit the Issuer thereof to register such
securities for public sale under the Securities Act, or under applicable state
securities laws, even if such Issuer would agree to do so.

            (c) Each Grantor agrees to use its best efforts to do or cause to be
done all such other acts as may be necessary to make such sale or sales of all
or any portion of the Pledged Stock pursuant to this Section 6.7 valid and
binding and in compliance with any and all other applicable Requirements of Law.
Each Grantor further agrees that a breach of any of the covenants contained in
this Section 6.7 will cause irreparable injury to the Agents and the Lenders,
that the Agents and the Lenders have no adequate remedy at law in respect of
such breach and, as a consequence, that each and every covenant contained in
this Section 6.7 shall be specifically enforceable against such Grantor, and
such Grantor hereby waives and agrees not to assert any defenses against an
action for specific performance of such covenants except for a defense that no
Event of Default has occurred under the Credit Agreement.


                                       20
<PAGE>

            6.8. Deficiency. Each Grantor shall remain liable for any deficiency
if the proceeds of any sale or other disposition of the Collateral are
insufficient to pay its Obligations.

                       SECTION 7. THE ADMINISTRATIVE AGENT

            7.1. Administrative Agent's Appointment as Attorney-in-Fact, etc.
(a) Each Grantor hereby irrevocably constitutes and appoints the Administrative
Agent and any officer or agent thereof, with full power of substitution, as its
true and lawful attorney-in-fact with full irrevocable power and authority in
the place and stead of such Grantor and in the name of such Grantor or in its
own name, for the purpose of carrying out the terms of this Agreement, to take
any and all appropriate action and to execute any and all documents and
instruments which may be necessary or desirable to accomplish the purposes of
this Agreement, and, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, each
Grantor hereby gives the Administrative Agent the power and right, on behalf of
such Grantor, without notice to or assent by such Grantor, to do any or all of
the following:

            (i) in the name of such Grantor or its own name, or otherwise, take
      possession of and indorse and collect any checks, drafts, notes,
      acceptances or other instruments for the payment of moneys due under any
      Receivable or with respect to any other Collateral and file any claim or
      take any other action or proceeding in any court of law or equity or
      otherwise deemed appropriate by the Administrative Agent for the purpose
      of collecting any and all such moneys due under any Receivable or with
      respect to any other Collateral whenever payable;

            (ii) in the case of any Intellectual Property, execute and deliver,
      and have recorded, any and all agreements, instruments, documents and
      papers as the Administrative Agent may reasonably request to evidence the
      Agents' and the Lenders' security interest in such Intellectual Property
      and the goodwill and general intangibles of such Grantor relating thereto
      or represented thereby;

            (iii) pay or discharge taxes and Liens levied or placed on or
      threatened against the Collateral, effect any repairs or any insurance
      called for by the terms of this Agreement and pay all or any part of the
      premiums therefor and the costs thereof;

            (iv) execute, in connection with any sale provided for in Section
      6.6 or 6.7, any indorsements, assignments or other instruments of
      conveyance or transfer with respect to the Collateral; and

            (v) (1) direct any party liable for any payment under any of the
      Collateral to make payment of any and all moneys due or to become due
      thereunder directly to the Administrative Agent or as the Administrative
      Agent shall direct; (2) ask or demand for, collect, and receive payment of
      and receipt for, any and all moneys, claims and other amounts due or to
      become due at any time in respect of or arising out of any Collateral; (3)
      sign and indorse any invoices, freight or express bills, bills of lading,
      storage or warehouse receipts, drafts against debtors, assignments,
      verifications, notices and other documents in connection with any of the
      Collateral; (4) commence and prosecute any suits, actions or proceedings
      at law or in equity in any court of competent jurisdiction to

                                       21
<PAGE>

      collect the Collateral or any portion thereof and to enforce any other
      right in respect of any Collateral; (5) defend any suit, action or
      proceeding brought against such Grantor with respect to any Collateral;
      (6) settle, compromise or adjust any such suit, action or proceeding and,
      in connection therewith, give such discharges or releases as the
      Administrative Agent may deem appropriate; (7) assign any Copyright,
      Patent or Trademark (along with the goodwill of the business to which any
      such Copyright, Patent or Trademark pertains), throughout the world for
      such term or terms, on such conditions, and in such manner, as the
      Administrative Agent shall in its sole discretion determine; and (8)
      generally, sell, transfer, pledge and make any agreement with respect to
      or otherwise deal with any of the Collateral as fully and completely as
      though the Administrative Agent were the absolute owner thereof for all
      purposes, and do, at the Administrative Agent's option and such Grantor's
      expense, at any time, or from time to time, all acts and things which the
      Administrative Agent deems necessary to protect, preserve or realize upon
      the Collateral and the Administrative Agent's and the Lenders' security
      interests therein and to effect the intent of this Agreement, all as fully
      and effectively as such Grantor might do.

             Anything in this Section 7.1 (a) to the contrary notwithstanding,
the Administrative Agent agrees that it will not exercise any rights under the
power of attorney provided for in this Section 7.1(a) unless an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing.

            (b) If any Grantor fails to perform or comply with any of its
agreements contained herein, the Administrative Agent, at its option, but
without any obligation so to do, may perform or comply, or otherwise cause
performance or compliance, with such agreement.

            (c) The expenses of the Administrative Agent incurred in connection
with actions undertaken as provided in this Section 7.1, together with interest
thereon at a rate per annum equal to the rate per annum at which interest would
then be payable on past due Revolving Loans that are Base Rate Loans under the
Credit Agreement, from the date of payment by the Administrative Agent to the
date reimbursed by the relevant Grantor, shall be payable by such Grantor to the
Administrative Agent on demand.

            (d) Each Grantor hereby ratifies all that said attorneys shall
lawfully do or cause to be done by virtue hereof. All powers, authorizations and
agencies contained in this Agreement are coupled with an interest and are
irrevocable until this Agreement is terminated and the security interests
created hereby are released.

            7.2. Duty of Administrative Agent. The Administrative Agent's sole
duty with respect to the custody, safekeeping and physical preservation of the
Collateral in its possession, under Section 9-207 of the New York UCC or
otherwise, shall be to deal with it in the same manner as the Administrative
Agent deals with similar property for its own account. Neither the
Administrative Agent, any Lender nor any of their respective officers,
directors, employees or agents shall be liable for failure to demand, collect or
realize upon any of the Collateral or for any delay in doing so or shall be
under any obligation to sell or otherwise dispose of any Collateral upon the
request of any Grantor or any other Person or to take any other action
whatsoever with regard to the Collateral or any part thereof, except if such
failure or delay

                                       22
<PAGE>

results from their own gross negligence or willful misconduct. The powers
conferred on the Agents and the Lenders hereunder are solely to protect the
Agents' and the Lenders' interests in the Collateral and shall not impose any
duty upon any Agent or any Lender to exercise any such powers. The Agents and
the Lenders shall be accountable only for amounts that they actually receive as
a result of the exercise of such powers, and neither they nor any of their
officers, directors, employees or agents shall be responsible to any Grantor for
any act or failure to act hereunder, except for their own gross negligence or
willful misconduct.

            7.3. Execution of Financing Statements. Pursuant to any applicable
law, each Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to file or record
financing statements and other filing or recording documents or instruments with
respect to the Collateral without the signature of such Grantor in such form and
in such offices as the Administrative Agent determines appropriate to perfect
the security interests of the Administrative Agent under this Agreement. Each
Grantor authorizes the Administrative Agent to use the collateral description
"all assets" in any such financing statements. Each Grantor hereby ratifies and
authorizes the filing by the Administrative Agent of any financing statement
with respect to the Collateral made prior to the date hereof.

            7.4. Authority of Administrative Agent. Each Grantor acknowledges
that the rights and responsibilities of the Administrative Agent under this
Agreement with respect to any action taken by the Administrative Agent or the
exercise or non-exercise by the Administrative Agent of any option, voting
right, request, judgment or other right or remedy provided for herein or
resulting or arising out of this Agreement shall, as between the Agents and the
Lenders, be governed by the Credit Agreement and by such other agreements with
respect thereto as may exist from time to time among them, but, as between the
Administrative Agent and the Grantors, the Administrative Agent shall be
conclusively presumed to be acting as agent for the Agents and the Lenders with
full and valid authority so to act or refrain from acting, and no Grantor shall
be under any obligation, or entitlement, to make any inquiry respecting such
authority.

                            SECTION 8. MISCELLANEOUS

            8.1. Amendments in Writing. None of the terms or provisions of this
Agreement may be waived, amended, supplemented or otherwise modified except in
accordance with Section 11.1 of the Credit Agreement.

            8.2. Notices. All notices, requests and demands to or upon the
Administrative Agent or any Grantor hereunder shall be effected in the manner
provided for in Section 11.2 of the Credit Agreement; provided that any such
notice, request or demand to or upon any Guarantor shall be addressed to such
Guarantor at its notice address set forth on Schedule 1.

            8.3. No Waiver by Course of Conduct; Cumulative Remedies. No Agent
or Lender shall by any act (except by a written instrument pursuant to Section
8.1), delay, indulgence, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any
right or remedy hereunder or to have acquiesced in any Default or Event of
Default. No failure to exercise, nor any delay in exercising, on the part of any
Agent or any Lender, any right, power or privilege hereunder shall operate as a
waiver thereof. No single or partial exercise of any right, power or privilege
hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise
of any other right,

                                       23
<PAGE>

power or privilege. A waiver by any Agent or any Lender of any right or remedy
hereunder on any one occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or
remedy which the Administrative Agent or such Lender would otherwise have on any
future occasion. The rights and remedies herein provided are cumulative, may be
exercised singly or concurrently and are not exclusive of any other rights or
remedies provided by law.

            8.4. Enforcement Expenses; Indemnification. (a) Each Guarantor
agrees to pay, or reimburse each Lender and Agent for all its costs and expenses
incurred in collecting against such Guarantor under the guarantee contained in
Section 2 or otherwise enforcing or preserving any rights under this Agreement
and the other Loan Documents to which such Guarantor is a party, including,
without limitation, the fees and disbursements of counsel (including the
allocated fees and expenses of in-house counsel) to each Lender and of counsel
to the Administrative Agent.

            (b) Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the Agents and the
Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities with respect to, or resulting
from any delay in paying, any and all stamp, excise, sales or other taxes which
may be payable or determined to be payable with respect to any of the Collateral
or in connection with any of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.

            (c) Each Guarantor agrees to pay, and to save the Agents and the
Lenders harmless from, any and all liabilities, obligations, losses, damages,
penalties, actions, judgments, suits, costs, expenses or disbursements of any
kind or nature whatsoever with respect to the execution, delivery, enforcement,
performance and administration of this Agreement to the extent the Borrower
would be required to do so pursuant to Section 11.5 of the Credit Agreement.

            (d) The agreements in this Section shall survive repayment of the
Obligations and all other amounts payable under the Credit Agreement and the
other Loan Documents.

            8.5. Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon
the successors and assigns of each Grantor and shall inure to the benefit of the
Agents and the Lenders and their successors and assigns; provided that no
Grantor may assign, transfer or delegate any of its rights or obligations under
this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Administrative Agent
unless permitted by the Credit Agreement.

            8.6. Set-Off. Each Grantor hereby irrevocably authorizes each Agent
and each Lender at any time and from time to time while an Event of Default
shall have occurred and be continuing, without notice to such Grantor or any
other Grantor, any such notice being expressly waived by each Grantor to the
extent permitted by applicable law, to set-off and appropriate and apply any and
all deposits (general or special, time or demand, provisional or final), in any
currency, and any other credits, indebtedness or claims, in any currency, in
each case whether direct or indirect, absolute or contingent, matured or
unmatured, at any time held or owing by such Agent or such Lender to or for the
credit or the account of such Grantor, or any part thereof in such amounts as
such Agent or such Lender may elect, against and on account of the obligations
and liabilities of such Grantor to such Agent or such Lender hereunder and
claims of every nature and description of such Agent or such Lender against such
Grantor, in any currency,

                                       24
<PAGE>

arising hereunder, under the Credit Agreement or any other Loan Document to
which it is a party, as such Agent or such Lender may elect, whether or not any
Agent or any Lender has made any demand for payment and although such
obligations, liabilities and claims may be contingent or unmatured. Each Agent
and each Lender shall notify such Grantor promptly of any such set-off and the
application made by such Agent or such Lender of the proceeds thereof, provided
that the failure to give such notice shall not affect the validity of such
set-off and application. The rights of each Agent and each Lender under this
Section are in addition to other rights and remedies (including, without
limitation, other rights of set-off) which such Agent or such Lender may have.

            8.7. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed by one or more of
the parties to this Agreement on any number of separate counterparts (including
by telecopy), and all of said counterparts taken together shall be deemed to
constitute one and the same instrument.

            8.8. Severability. Any provision of this Agreement which is
prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such jurisdiction,
be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without
invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or
unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

            8.9. Section Headings. The Section headings used in this Agreement
are for convenience of reference only and are not to affect the construction
hereof or be taken into consideration in the interpretation hereof.

            8.10. Integration. This Agreement and the other Loan Documents
represent the agreement of the Grantors, the Agents and the Lenders with respect
to the subject matter hereof and thereof, and there are no promises,
undertakings, representations or warranties by any Agent or any Lender relative
to subject matter hereof and thereof not expressly set forth or referred to
herein or in the other Loan Documents.

            8.11. GOVERNING LAW. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE GOVERNED BY, AND
CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAW OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK.

            8.12. Submission To Jurisdiction; Waivers. Each Grantor hereby
irrevocably and unconditionally:

            (a) submits for itself and its property in any legal action or
      proceeding relating to this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to
      which it is a party, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in
      respect thereof, to the non-exclusive general jurisdiction of the Courts
      of the State of New York, the courts of the United States of America for
      the Southern District of New York, and appellate courts from any thereof;

            (b) consents that any such action or proceeding may be brought in
      such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter have to
      the venue of any such action or proceeding in any such court or that such
      action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient court and agrees not
      to plead or claim the same;


                                       25
<PAGE>

            (c) agrees that service of process in any such action or proceeding
      may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified mail
      (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such
      Grantor at its address referred to on Schedule 1 or at such other address
      of which the Administrative Agent shall have been notified pursuant
      hereto;

            (d) agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to effect
      service of process in any other manner permitted by law or shall limit the
      right to sue in any other jurisdiction; and

            (e) waives, to the maximum extent not prohibited by law, any right
      it may have to claim or recover in any legal action or proceeding referred
      to in this Section any special, exemplary, punitive or consequential
      damages.

            8.13. Acknowledgements. Each Grantor hereby acknowledges that:

            (a) it has been advised by counsel in the negotiation, execution and
      delivery of this Agreement and the other Loan Documents to which it is a
      party;

            (b) no Agent or Lender has any fiduciary relationship with or duty
      to any Grantor arising out of or in connection with this Agreement or any
      of the other Loan Documents, and the relationship between the Grantors, on
      the one hand, and the Agents and Lenders, on the other hand, in connection
      herewith or therewith is solely that of debtor and creditor; and

            (c) no joint venture is created hereby or by the other Loan
      Documents or otherwise exists by virtue of the transactions contemplated
      hereby among the Lenders or among the Grantors and the Lenders.

            8.14. Additional Grantors. Each Subsidiary of the Borrower that is
required to become a party to this Agreement pursuant to Section 7.9 of the
Credit Agreement shall become a Grantor for all purposes of this Agreement upon
execution and delivery by such Subsidiary of an Assumption Agreement in the form
of Annex I hereto.

            8.15. Releases. (a) At such time as the Loans, the Reimbursement
Obligations and the other Obligations (other than Borrower Hedge Agreement
Obligations) shall have been paid in full, the Commitments have been terminated
and no Letters of Credit shall be outstanding, the Collateral shall be released
from the Liens created hereby, and this Agreement and all obligations (other
than those expressly stated to survive such termination) of the Administrative
Agent and each Grantor hereunder shall terminate, all without delivery of any
instrument or performance of any act by any party, and all rights to the
Collateral shall revert to the Grantors. At the request and sole expense of any
Grantor following any such termination, the Administrative Agent shall promptly
deliver to such Grantor any Collateral held by the Administrative Agent
hereunder, and execute and deliver to such Grantor such documents as such
Grantor shall reasonably request to evidence such termination, without recourse
or warranty.


                                       26
<PAGE>

            (b) If any of the Collateral shall be sold, transferred or otherwise
Disposed of by any Grantor in a transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement,
then the Administrative Agent, at the request and sole expense of such Grantor,
shall execute and deliver to such Grantor all releases or other documents
reasonably necessary or desirable for the release of the Liens created hereby on
such Collateral, it being understood that any such execution and delivery of
releases or other documents shall be without recourse to or warranty by the
Administrative Agent. At the request and sole expense of the Borrower, a
Guarantor shall be released from its obligations hereunder upon the consummation
of any transaction permitted by the Credit Agreement as a result of which such
Guarantor ceases to be a Subsidiary of the Borrower; provided that the Borrower
shall have delivered to the Administrative Agent at least five Business Days
prior to the date of the proposed release, a written request for release
identifying the relevant Guarantor and the terms of the sale or other
disposition in reasonable detail, including the price thereof, together with a
certification by the Borrower stating that such transaction is in compliance
with the Credit Agreement and the other Loan Documents.

            8.16. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH GRANTOR AND, BY ACCEPTANCE OF THE
BENEFITS HEREOF, EACH AGENT AND EACH LENDER, HEREBY IRREVOCABLY AND
UNCONDITIONALLY WAIVES TRIAL BY JURY IN ANY LEGAL ACTION OR PROCEEDING RELATING
TO THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LOAN DOCUMENT AND FOR ANY COUNTERCLAIM THEREIN.
