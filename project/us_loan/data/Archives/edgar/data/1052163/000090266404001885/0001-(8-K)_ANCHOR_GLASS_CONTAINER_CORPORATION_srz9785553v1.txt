ITEM 8.01   OTHER EVENTS

     On December 21, 2004, a complaint was filed in the United States District
Court for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division entitled "Robert Conte
individually and on behalf of all others similarly situated v. Anchor Glass
Container Corporation, Darrin Campbell, Richard M. Deneau, Joel A. Asen, James
N. Chapman, Jonathan Gallen, George Hamilton, Timothy F. Price, Alan H.
Schumacher, Lenard B. Tessler, Credit Suisse First Boston, Merrill Lynch & Co.
and Lehman Brothers, Case Number 8:04-cv-02741-T-26TGW." Anchor Glass Container
Corporation (the "Registrant") has not yet been served with a copy of this
complaint. Darrin J. Campbell ("Campbell") is the Registrant's Chief Executive
Officer and a member of the Registrant's Board of Directors. Richard M. Deneau
("Deneau") was the Registrant's former Chief Executive Officer and a former
member of the Registrant's Board of Directors. Alan H. Schumacher, James N.
Chapman, Jonathan Gallen, Timothy F. Price and Lenard B. Tessler are members of
the Registrant's Board of Directors. Joel A. Asen and George Hamilton were
members of the Registrant's Board of Directors. Credit Suisse First Boston,
Merrill Lynch & Co. and Lehman Brothers were underwriters of the Registrant's
initial public offering of common stock.

      The lawsuit seeks to have the court determine recognition of a class
action brought on behalf of all persons who purchased the Registrant's
securities between September 25, 2003 and November 4, 2004 (the "Period") and
alleges violations of Sections 11 and 15 of the Securities Act of 1933 (the
"Securities Act") and Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of
1934 (the "Exchange Act") and Rule 10b-5 thereunder. The lawsuit alleges that
the Registrant and the other defendants, as applicable, violated Sections 11 and
15 of the Securities Act due to alleged misrepresentations of material facts and
omissions from the registration statement and prospectus relating to the
Registrant's initial public offering by failing to disclose that previous
"capital improvements would result in the closer[sic] of the Collinsville[sic]
facility and excess inventory that would later have to be accounted for by a
material writedown." The lawsuit also alleges that the Registrant, Messrs.
Campbell and Deneau violated Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the Exchange Act and
Rule 10b-5 thereunder by making materially false and/or misleading statements
concerning the Registrant's business and operations and failed to disclose,
among other things, (a) that the Registrant's "production far exceeded demand
and [that the Registrant] had an excess of built-up inventory during the
[Period], resulting in the forced closure of the [Registrant's] Connellsville
facility; (b) [that the Registrant] had flooded the market with inventory during
the [Period] which caused the [Registrant] to 'curtail production selectively
during the fourth quarter' to lower these inventory levels and align production
with customer requirements; and (c) [that] the [Registrant's] Connellsville
facility was materially impaired during the [Period] resulting in a belated
charge of at least $45 million." The lawsuit also alleges that [Messrs. Campbell
and Deneau] were engaged in a scheme to inflate the price of the Registrant's
common stock in order to "(i) protect and enhance their executive positions and
the substantial compensation and prestige they obtained thereby; [and] (ii)
enhance the value of their personal holdings of [the Registrant's] common stock
including restricted stock." The complaint seeks an unspecified amount of
damages.

      Although the ultimate outcome of this matter cannot be determined with
certainty, the Registrant believes that the complaint is without merit and it
and the individual defendants intend to vigorously defend the lawsuit.
