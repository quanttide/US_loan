ITEM 8.01. OTHER EVENTS.

         On Monday, December 20, 2004, a special meeting of the limited partners
of ChrisKen Partners Cash Income Fund, L.P. was called to order to consider a
sale of Gold Coast Storage, the last of the Partnership's two properties, to
Warburg-StorageMart Partners, L.P., a Delaware Limited Partnership (the
"Purchaser"), pursuant to the Real Estate Purchase Agreement, dated as of
September 14, 2004, as amended on October 29, November 1 and November 2, 2004,
by and between the Purchaser and the Partnership (collectively, the "Purchase
Agreement") and thereafter terminate, dissolve and liquidate the Partnership.
Total votes FOR the proposal were approximately 57% of the outstanding Limited
Partner units, which exceeded the required simple majority of the Limited
Partners. Accordingly, the Partnership will proceed with the sale of Gold Coast
Storage pursuant to the terms of the Purchase and Sale Agreement and Joint
Escrow Instructions.
