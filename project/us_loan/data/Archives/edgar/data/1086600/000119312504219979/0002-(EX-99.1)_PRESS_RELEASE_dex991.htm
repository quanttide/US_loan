Underway </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Tulsa, Oklahoma, December 27, 2004 &#150; Alliance Resource Partners,
L.P. (NASDAQ: ARLP) today announced that its wholly-owned MC Mining, LLC subsidiary has temporarily idled the Excel No. 3 mine located near the city of Pikeville in Pike County, Kentucky, following the occurrence of a mine fire during the annual
Christmas holiday break. The mine fire was discovered by mine personnel near the bottom of the Excel No. 3 mine slope late the night of December 25, 2004. After detecting the fire, MC Mining immediately undertook actions to suppress the fire and
notified federal and state safety officials. Mine emergency response teams from the Mine Safety and Health Administration (&#147;MSHA&#148;) and the Kentucky Department of Mines and Minerals (&#147;KDMM&#148;) joined with MC Mining firefighting
personnel in initial efforts to extinguish the fire. Firefighting efforts continued until late morning on December 26, 2004, at which point the mine was evacuated for safety reasons. All employees are accounted for and no injuries were incurred
during the firefighting efforts or the evacuation. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Following the evacuation,
MC Mining began efforts to cut off oxygen to the fire from the surface of the Excel No. 3 mine. These efforts initially focused on the temporary capping of the two mine portals which was completed early Sunday afternoon. MC Mining and other Alliance
personnel, in conjunction with on-site representatives from MSHA and KDMM, are implementing a plan to isolate and extinguish the fire. As part of this plan, crews have begun drilling multiple boreholes into the Excel No. 3 mine. These boreholes will
be used to monitor atmospheric conditions and pump inert gases into the mine to extinguish the fire. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Normal operations at MC Mining will remain suspended until the fire is extinguished, the atmosphere is rendered inert and the Excel No. 3 mine is recovered. The Partnership&#146;s results will be adversely impacted
until production resumes at MC Mining. It is premature, however, to determine the specific impact on the financial performance of the Partnership as a result of the Excel No. 3 mine fire incident. The Partnership is analyzing various alternatives to
mitigate potential losses arising from the fire. This analysis will include a review of its commercial property (including business interruption) insurance policies, which provide for one or more deductibles and ten percent coinsurance. </FONT></P>

Excel No. 3 mine produces low-sulfur coal from the Pond Creek coal seam utilizing continuous mining units and room-and-pillar techniques. Production from the mine during 2004 has averaged approximately 160,000 tons per month. </FONT></P> <P
