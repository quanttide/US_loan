Item 2.05  Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities.

              On December 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of Chemed Corporation
         ("Company") authorized the discontinuance of the operations of the
         Company's Service America segment through an asset sale to employees of
         Service America. The disposal is subject to certain regulatory and
         other approvals and is expected to be completed during the first half
         of 2005.

              Our decision to dispose of Service America, which provides
         major-appliance and heating/air conditioning repair, maintenance and
         replacement services, is based on declining operating results and
         projected operating losses:

              -    Net service revenues declined from $74.2 million for the
                   year ended December 31, 2000 to $48.1 million for the year
                   ended December 31, 2003. Service revenues for the year ended
                   December 31, 2004 are projected to decline to $38.8 million.

               -   Service America recorded net losses in each of the last
                   three years and is projected to record net losses for 2004
                   and beyond.

              The acquiring corporation will purchase a substantial majority of
         Service America's assets in exchange for assuming substantially all of
         Service America's liabilities. Included in the assets to be acquired is
         a receivable from the Company for approximately $4.9 million. The
         Company will pay $1 million of this receivable upon closing and the
         remainder over the following year in 11 equal monthly installments. The
         amount of this receivable is subject to adjustment for changes in
         Service America's balance sheet through the date of closing.

              In connection with the disposal, we estimate that we will record
         the following pretax costs and expenses during the fourth quarter of
         2004 (in millions):
