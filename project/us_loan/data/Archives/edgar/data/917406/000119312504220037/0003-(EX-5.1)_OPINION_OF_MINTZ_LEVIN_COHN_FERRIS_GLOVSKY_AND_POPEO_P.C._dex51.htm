John Hancock Life Insurance Company, a Massachusetts corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), in connection with the preparation of a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;) filed by the Company with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) on April 3, 2002, as amended and supplemented through the date hereof. The Registration Statement relates to the issuance and sale from time to time, pursuant to Rule 415 of the General Rules and
Regulations promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), of up to an aggregate of $3,000,000,000 in initial offering price of the Company&#146;s SignatureNotes, which are medium term notes with
maturities of twelve months or more from date of issue (the &#147;Notes&#148;). The Notes are to be (i) issued under an Indenture, dated as of June 15, 2002, as amended and supplemented through the date hereof, between the Company and JPMorgan Chase
Bank as trustee (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), and (ii) sold pursuant to the terms of a Selling Agent Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2002, among the Company and the agents named therein (the &#147;Selling Agent Agreement&#148;). The Indenture and
the Selling Agent Agreement were filed as exhibits to the Registration Statement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT

Company, certificates of officers or other representatives of the Company, certificates of public officials and others, and such other agreements, documents, certificates and records as we have deemed necessary or appropriate as a basis for the
opinion set forth herein. </FONT></P>
