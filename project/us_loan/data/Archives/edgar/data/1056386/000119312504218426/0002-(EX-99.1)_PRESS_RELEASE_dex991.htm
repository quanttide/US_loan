IIP), the leading provider of performance-based routing technology over the Internet, said today that Patricia L. Higgins, former president and chief executive officer of Tampa, FL-based Switch and Data, has joined the Board of Directors for
Internap. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;Patricia Higgins embodies a wealth of industry knowledge and
experience, having served in senior executive roles at major U.S. companies,&#148; said Gregory A. Peters, president and chief executive officer for Internap. &#147;The timing of today&#146;s announcement is also important, as Patricia joins our
Board at a period when Internap is seeing significant growth in excess of 30 percent year over year in data center and collocation services, a business she knows extremely well. We&#146;re excited to have Patricia on the Internap team, and look
forward to the vigor and energy that she brings.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During Higgins&#146;
four-year tenure at Switch and Data (2000-2004), the company experienced significant revenue success, growing from $12 million in annualized revenue to $95 million. The company also successfully acquired and integrated two key businesses during the
period, positioning itself as an industry leader in the Internet peering space. Switch and Data exceeded its 2003 growth plan, with 100 percent increase in revenues over 2002 and 1,800 percent increase in EBITDA for 2003. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;The great thing about joining Internap at this time is that the company has already
completed much of the heavy lifting needed to transform itself into a sustainable, long-term Internet business,&#148; noted Higgins. &#147;Internap has weathered a very difficult market, is today a very strong company and one that I feel is now
poised to capitalize on the dramatic shift toward &#145;always-on, always-available&#146; Internet-based ebusinesses throughout the world. I believe there is tremendous opportunity ahead for Internap, and I&#146;m pleased to be a part of it.&#148;
