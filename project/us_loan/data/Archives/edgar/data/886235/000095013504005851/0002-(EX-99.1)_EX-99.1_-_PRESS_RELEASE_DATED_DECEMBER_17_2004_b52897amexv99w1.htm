<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">NEWTON, Mass.&#151;(BUSINESS WIRE)&#151;Dec. 17, 2004&#151;Aspect Medical Systems, Inc.
(NASDAQ: ASPM) today announced the appointment of David W. Feigal Jr., M.D.,
M.P.H., to its board of directors. Dr.&nbsp;Feigal brings to the board more than 20
years of experience in health policy, medical education, and healthcare
regulation. Dr.&nbsp;Feigal spent 12&nbsp;years at the U.S. Food and Drug Administration
(FDA)&nbsp;where he served in director level positions for the Center for Devices
and Radiological Health, the Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research, and
the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. In 2004, Dr.&nbsp;Feigal stepped down
from the FDA and joined NDA Partners, LLP where he advises mid-stage device and
biopharmaceutical companies about clinical and regulatory strategies, product
development and design, and the introduction of innovative technologies. Dr.
Feigal was a member of the World Health Organization&#146;s Global Program on AIDS
and has held faculty appointments at the University of California, San
Francisco and the University of California, San Diego schools of medicine. He
holds an M.D. degree from Stanford University and an M.P.H. from the University
of California Berkeley.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are delighted to welcome Dr.&nbsp;Feigal to Aspect&#146;s board of directors,&#148; said
J. Breckenridge Eagle, chairman of the board of directors for Aspect. &#147;Dr.
Feigal&#146;s background and experience will be invaluable to Aspect, particularly
as we seek to introduce new applications for our brain monitoring technology to
aid the diagnosis and treatment of neurological diseases in an increasingly
complex international regulatory environment.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Commenting on the appointment to Aspect&#146;s board, Dr.&nbsp;Feigal stated, &#147;Aspect has
an impressive track record of developing practical brain monitoring products
and efficiently conducting clinical outcome research.&#148; He continued, &#147;The
company is making a significant impact on improving the quality and safety of
patient care during anesthesia, and I look forward to helping the Aspect team
achieve its goal of making brain monitoring a routine part of anesthesia and
sedation, as well as a tool to aid the diagnosis and management of neurological
diseases such as Alzheimer&#146;s and depression.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Certain statements in this release are forward-looking and may involve risks
and uncertainties. There are a number of important factors that could cause
actual results to differ materially from those indicated by these
forward-looking statements. These factors include a number of risks facing the
Company&#146;s business. For example, the Company may not be able to achieve
widespread market acceptance of its BIS monitoring technology or to compete
with new products or alternative techniques that may be developed by others,
including third-party anesthesia monitoring products approved by the FDA, and
also faces competitive and regulatory risks relating to its ability to
successfully develop and introduce enhancements and new products. In addition,
the Company may not successfully monitor the risk of awareness with BIS
monitoring in all cases. Cases of awareness with recall during monitoring with
the BIS system and significant product liability claims are among the factors
that could limit market acceptance. There are additional factors that could
cause Aspect&#146;s actual results to vary from its forward-lookin
g statements, including without limitation those set forth under the heading &#147;Factors
Affecting Future Operating Results&#148; in Aspect&#146;s Quarterly Report on Form&nbsp;10-Q
for the fiscal quarter ended October&nbsp;2, 2004, as filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission. In addition, any forward-looking statements represent
Aspect&#146;s views only as of the date of this press release and should not be
relied upon as representing Aspect&#146;s views as of any subsequent date. While
Aspect may elect to update forward-looking statements in the future, it
specifically disclaims any obligation to do so, even if its expectations
change. Therefore, you should not rely on these forward-looking statements as
representing Aspect&#146;s views as of any date subsequent to the date of this press
release.
