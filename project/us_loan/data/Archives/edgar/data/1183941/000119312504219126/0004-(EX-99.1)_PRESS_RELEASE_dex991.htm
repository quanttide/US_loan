<P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">FREMONT, Calif., Dec. 21 &#151; ActivCard Corp. (Nasdaq: ACTI), which currently owns 49 percent of ASPACE Solutions Limited, today announced that it has acquired the
remaining 51 percent equity interest in the UK-based company. ASPACE provides a multi-channel authentication and authorization solution to the banking industry. Under the terms of the agreement, ActivCard made an initial payment of $9.7 million
(pounds Sterling 5.0 million), payable 50 percent in ActivCard common stock and 50 percent in cash. Additional payments of up to $9.7 million (pounds Sterling 5.0 million) will be payable in the same proportion of stock and cash, on the achievement
of certain milestones. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;We are executing on our long term strategy with
this acquisition,&#148; said Ben C. Barnes, ActivCard Chief Executive Officer. &#147;This positions us as a leading provider of authentication and authorization solutions for banks. This fast growing segment is part of the over $2 billion identity
and access management market that is estimated to grow about 10 percent annually.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">Banks face a complex problem today: Millions of customers are interacting with banks, through the web, phones, automated teller machines (ATMs), branches, and are using different identification and authentication methods for each. It has
become increasingly difficult and costly for banks to manage the multiple systems needed to positively identify customers and approve transactions. Customers are required to authenticate themselves to prevent fraudulent activity and identity theft;
however, they have become frustrated as they are forced to navigate through different security systems to access their accounts and services. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The new set of ActivCard products, incorporating ASPACE&#146;s advanced technology, will enable banks to authenticate customers and provide authorization for banking
services, delivering a combination of better customer service and enhanced fraud protection. With ActivCard solutions, banks can start with identification and authentication services and migrate to a comprehensive authorization system that supports
multiple channels. This functionality is embedded in the 4TRESS solution, ASPACE&#146;s flagship product. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">From a bank&#146;s perspective, the new ActivCard solution will positively identify customers to the bank, whether they are accessing their accounts through the Internet, via phone or ATMs. Once the customer is
authenticated, the system will manage authorizations and secure access to various services such as checking accounts, credit cards, and home loans. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;This makes transactions simple to conduct for the customer, and less costly for the banks to manage and protect. Additionally, the solution enables banks to monitor
and audit financial activity in compliance with national and international government regulations, such as the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act and Basel II,&#148; continued Mr. Barnes. &#147;Customers will ultimately have an easier and more secure experience
while giving them the same level of confidence as a face-to-face interaction with their banker.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
