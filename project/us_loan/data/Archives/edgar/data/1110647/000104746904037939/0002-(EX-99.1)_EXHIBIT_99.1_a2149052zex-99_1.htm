June&nbsp;26, 2001, a putative securities class action captioned Lanter v. New Focus,&nbsp;Inc. et al., Civil Action No.&nbsp;01-CV-5822, was filed
against New Focus and several of its officers and directors, or the Individual Defendants, in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. Also named as defendants were
Credit Suisse First Boston Corporation, Chase Securities,&nbsp;Inc., U.S. Bancorp Piper Jaffray,&nbsp;Inc. and CIBC World Markets Corp., or the Underwriter Defendants, the underwriters in New
Focus's initial public offering. Three subsequent lawsuits were filed containing substantially similar allegations. These complaints have been consolidated. On April&nbsp;19, 2002, plaintiffs filed
an Amended Class Action Complaint, described below, naming as defendants the Individual Defendants and the Underwriter Defendants. </FONT></P>

November&nbsp;7, 2001, a Class Action Complaint was filed against Bookham Technology plc and others in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York. On
April&nbsp;19, 2002, the plaintiffs filed an Amended Class Action Complaint. The Amended Complaint names as defendants Bookham Technology plc, Goldman, Sachs&nbsp;&amp; Co. and FleetBoston Robertson
Stephens,&nbsp;Inc., two of the underwriters of Bookham Technology plc's initial public offering in April&nbsp;2000, and Andrew G. Rickman, Stephen J. Cockrell and David Simpson, each of whom was

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
Amended Complaints assert claims under certain provisions of the securities laws of the United States. They allege, among other things, that the prospectuses for Bookham Technology
plc's and New Focus's initial public offerings were materially false and misleading in describing the compensation to be earned by the underwriters in connection with the offerings, and in not
disclosing certain alleged arrangements among the underwriters and initial purchasers of ordinary shares, in the case of Bookham Technology plc, or common stock, in the case of New Focus, from the
underwriters. The Amended Complaints seek unspecified damages (or in the alternative rescission for those class members who no
longer hold ordinary shares, in the case of Bookham Technology plc or common stock, in the case of New Focus), costs, attorneys' fees, experts' fees, interest and other expenses. In
October&nbsp;2002, the individual defendants were dismissed, without prejudice, from the action. In July&nbsp;2002, all defendants filed Motions to Dismiss the Amended Complaint. The motion was
denied as to Bookham Technology plc and New Focus in February&nbsp;2003. Special committees of the board of directors authorized the companies to negotiate a settlement of the pending claims
substantially consistent with a memorandum of understanding negotiated among class plaintiffs, all issuer defendants and their insurers. A stipulation of settlement for the claims against the issuer
defendants has been submitted to the court for preliminary approval. Under the stipulation of settlement, the plaintiffs will dismiss and release all claims against participating defendants in
exchange for a contingent payment guaranty by the insurance companies collectively responsible for insuring the issuers in all the related cases, and the assignment or surrender to the plaintiffs of
certain claims the issuer defendants may have against the underwriters. Under the guaranty, the insurers will be required to pay the amount, if any, by which $1.0&nbsp;billion exceeds the aggregate
amount ultimately collected by the plaintiffs from the underwriter defendants in all the cases. There is no guarantee that the settlement will become effective, as it is subject to a number of
conditions, including court approval. </FONT></P>

February&nbsp;13, 2002, Howard Yue, the former sole shareholder of Globe Y Technology,&nbsp;Inc., a company acquired by New Focus in February&nbsp;2001, filed a lawsuit against
New Focus and several of its officers and directors in Santa Clara County Superior Court. The lawsuit is captioned Howard Yue v. New Focus,&nbsp;Inc. et al, Case No. CV808031, and asserts claims
stemming from New Focus's acquisition of Globe Y. The plaintiff has amended his complaint several times following the Court's dismissal of his earlier complaints. Currently, the plaintiff's fifth
amended complaint alleges the following causes of action against New Focus: violation of &sect;25400 and &sect;25500 of the California Corporations Code; violation of &sect; 25402
of the California Corporations Code; violation of &sect;&sect;1709-1710 of the California Civil Code; violation of &sect;17200 and &sect;17500 of the California
Business&nbsp;&amp; Professions Code; fraud and deceit by concealment; fraud and deceit by active concealment; fraud and deceit based upon non-disclosure of material facts; negligent
misrepresentation; and breach of contract and the duty of good faith and fair dealing. The complaint seeks unspecified economic, punitive, and exemplary damages, prejudgment interest, costs, and
equitable and general relief. New Focus recently filed an answer to plaintiff's fifth amended complaint denying plaintiff's allegations and asserting various defenses. </FONT></P>


<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
addition, in October&nbsp;2003, New Focus filed a cross-complaint against Mr.&nbsp;Yue seeking damages in connection with Mr.&nbsp;Yue's conduct during the acquisition of Globe
Y by New Focus. In February&nbsp;2004, New Focus filed a corrected amended cross-complain against Mr.&nbsp;Yue. In May&nbsp;2004, Mr.&nbsp;Yue filed an answer to New Focus's corrected amended
cross-complaint denying New Focus's allegations and asserting various defenses. A trial date has been set for March&nbsp;21, 2005. </FONT></P>
