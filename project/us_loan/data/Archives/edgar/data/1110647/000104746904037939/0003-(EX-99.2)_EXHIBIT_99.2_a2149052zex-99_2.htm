expenses as reasonably incurred by the Company and any such officer, director, employee, agent, representative, or controlling person, in connection with investigating or defending any such Loss; </FONT> <FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,

paragraph&nbsp;5(b) exceed the net proceeds resulting from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold by such Holder under such Registration Statement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Promptly
after receipt by an indemnified party under this Section&nbsp;5 of notice of the commencement of any action (including any governmental action), such
indemnified party will, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying party under this Section&nbsp;5, promptly deliver to the indemnifying party a written notice of the
commencement thereof and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in and to assume the defense thereof with counsel selected by the indemnifying party and reasonably acceptable to
the indemnified party; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided, however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that an indemnified party shall have the right to retain its own counsel, with the reasonably incurred fees
and expenses of one such counsel for all indemnified parties to be paid by the indemnifying party, if representation of such indemnified party by the counsel retained by the indemnifying party would
be inappropriate under applicable standards of professional conduct due to actual or potential conflicting interests between such indemnified party and any other party represented by such counsel in
such proceeding. The failure to deliver written notice to the indemnifying party within a reasonable time of the delivery of notice of any such action, to the extent prejudicial to its ability to
defend such action, shall relieve such indemnifying party of any liability to the indemnified party under this Section&nbsp;5 with respect to such action, but the omission so to deliver written
notice to the indemnifying party will not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party otherwise than under this Section&nbsp;5
or with respect to any other action unless the indemnifying party is materially prejudiced as a result of not receiving such notice. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
the event that the indemnity provided in paragraph&nbsp;(a) or (b)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;5 is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified
party for any reason, the Company and each Holder agree, severally and not jointly, to contribute to the aggregate Losses to which the Company or such Holder may be subject in such proportion as is
appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Company and such Holder in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such Losses; </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>provided,
however</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>, that in no case shall such Holder be responsible for any amount in excess of the net proceeds resulting from the sale of the Registrable Securities sold by it under
the Registration Statement. Relative fault shall be determined by reference to whether any alleged untrue statement or omission relates to information provided by the Company or by such Holder. The
Company and each Holder agree that it would not be just and equitable if contribution were determined by </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><I>pro rata</I></FONT><FONT SIZE=2> allocation or any other method of
allocation which does not take account of the equitable considerations referred to above. Notwithstanding the provisions of this paragraph&nbsp;(d), no person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation
(within the meaning of Section&nbsp;11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who is not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. For purposes of this
Section&nbsp;5, each person who controls a Holder within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer, director, employee, agent or representative of such Holder
shall have the same rights to contribution as such Holder, and each person who controls the Company within the meaning of either the Securities Act or the Exchange Act and each officer, director,
employee, agent or representative of the Company shall have the same rights to contribution as the Company, subject in each case to the applicable terms and conditions of this paragraph&nbsp;(d). </FONT></P>
