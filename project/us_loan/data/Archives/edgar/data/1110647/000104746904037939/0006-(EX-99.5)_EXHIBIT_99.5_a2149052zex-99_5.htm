<P><FONT SIZE=2><B>SAN JOSE, CA, December&nbsp;21, 2004</B></FONT><FONT SIZE=2>&#151;Bookham,&nbsp;Inc. ("Bookham") (NASDAQ: BKHM), a leading provider of optical components, modules
and subsystems, announced today that it has closed a private placement of $25.5&nbsp;million of the Company's 7.0% senior unsecured convertible debentures and warrants to purchase common stock. The
Company intends to use the net proceeds from the private placement for general corporate purposes, including, among other things, payment of outstanding indebtedness, working capital to support new
growth and to fund the company through its current restructuring. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=2>The
debentures may be converted into the Company's common stock at the option of the holder prior to the maturity of the debentures on December&nbsp;20, 2007. The initial conversion price of the
debentures is $5.50, which represents a premium of approximately 16% over the closing price of the Company's common stock on December&nbsp;20, 2004. The debentures also may be converted to common
stock by the Company under certain circumstances. The warrants provide holders thereof the right to purchase up to 2,001,963 shares of common stock and are exercisable during the next five years at an
initial exercise price of $6.00 per share which represents a premium of approximately 26% over the closing price of the Company's common stock on December&nbsp;20, 2004. The Company has agreed to
file, prior to January&nbsp;19, 2005, a registration statement relating to the resale of the shares of common stock issuable upon conversion of the debentures and the exercise of the warrants. </FONT></P>
