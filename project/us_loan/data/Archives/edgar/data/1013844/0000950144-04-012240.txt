<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Colonial Realty Limited Partnership (&#147;CRLP&#148; or &#147;Colonial Partnership&#148;), the
operating partnership of Colonial Properties Trust (Colonial Properties), an
Alabama real estate investment trust, acquired eight multifamily communities,
one office property and five retail properties during the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004. In addition, Colonial Partnership also acquired a
partnership interest in five multifamily communities, one office investment
company and one retail property during the nine months ended September&nbsp;30,
2004. Since September&nbsp;30, 2004, Colonial Partnership has acquired three
multifamily properties, one office property and an interest in a joint venture
containing sixteen multifamily properties. We expect to acquire one additional
retail property in the first quarter of 2005. We are filing this Current
Report on Form 8-K to satisfy the requirement of Rule&nbsp;3-14 of Regulation&nbsp;S-X of
the Securities and Exchange Commission that relates to the acquisition of one
or more properties which in the aggregate are significant to the registrant.
None of the properties acquired are individually significant according to Rule
3-14. This Current Report on Form 8-K is being filed to provide certain
historical and pro forma financial information related to these acquisitions
because we expect to file a proxy statement/prospectus in connection with our
previously-announced merger with Cornerstone Realty Income Trust, Inc.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On February&nbsp;12, 2004, Colonial Partnership acquired the DRS Building, a 215,485
square foot office building, located in Huntsville, Alabama, adjacent to our
existing development Colonial Center at Research Park. The total purchase
price was $13.1&nbsp;million and was funded through borrowings on our unsecured line
of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On April&nbsp;2, 2004, Colonial Partnership acquired Colonial Grand at Arringdon, a
320-unit multifamily asset located in Raleigh/Durham, North Carolina. Colonial
Grand at Arringdon was a development that was completed in the second quarter
of 2003 and was acquired with a 90.0% physical occupancy. The total purchase
price was $26.8&nbsp;million and was funded through borrowings on our unsecured line
of credit. Colonial Partnership served as development consultant and leasing
and management agent for the third-party developer in connection with this
property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On April&nbsp;8, 2004, Colonial Partnership acquired Kingwood Commons, a 164,385
square-foot retail lifestyle center located in the northeastern submarket of
Houston, Texas. The first development phase of Kingwood Commons was completed
in 2001, which positioned the property as a neighborhood grocery center,
anchored by Randall&#146;s grocery store, a division of Safeway, Inc. The property
expanded and broadened its tenants, creating a lifestyle center, through the
next two phases of development, which completed construction in 2004. Upon
acquisition, Kingwood Commons included high-end retailers such as Talbot&#146;s,
Chico&#146;s, Ann Taylor Loft, Jos. A. Banks, Bombay/Bombay Kids, James Avery, and
Carrabba&#146;s Italian Grill. The total purchase price was $34.5&nbsp;million and was
funded through borrowings on Colonial Partnership&#146;s unsecured line of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;2, 2004, Colonial Partnership acquired five multifamily assets
(&#147;Roberts Realty Properties&#148;) located in and around Atlanta, Georgia from

Colonial Grand at Berkley Lake (formerly Bradford Creek), Colonial Grand at
River Plantation (formerly Plantation Trace), Colonial Grand at River Oaks
(formerly River Oaks), and Colonial Grand at Sugarloaf (formerly Veranda
Chase) located in the Gwinnett submarket, and Colonial Grand at Mt. Vernon
(formerly Preston Oaks) located in the Dunwoody submarket. All five properties
are class-A multifamily assets. The assets were acquired for a total purchase
price of $109.2&nbsp;million, which consisted of approximately $50.4&nbsp;million of cash
and the assumption of approximately $58.8&nbsp;million of existing mortgage debt
that bears interest at a stated rate ranging from 5.54% to 7.38%. Colonial
Partnership recorded a debt premium of $4.4&nbsp;million, computed using estimated
market interest rates from 3.45% to 5.39%, since the debt assumed was at
above-market interest rates compared to similar debt instruments at the date of
acquisition. The cash portion of the acquisition was funded through borrowings
under Colonial Partnership&#146;s unsecured line of credit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On June&nbsp;15, 2004, Colonial Partnership and Dreyfuss Real Estate Advisors

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt">INDEX TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The following historical financial statements and pro forma financial
information are presented in accordance with Rule&nbsp;3-14 and Article&nbsp;11,
respectively, of Regulation&nbsp;S-X of the Securities and Exchange Commission. The
historical financial statements have been audited only for certain properties
acquired. With respect to Colonial Grand at Arringdon, the Roberts Realty
Properties, the South Florida Retail Properties, Colonial Village at Patterson
Place, Colonial Village at Beverly Crest and Village on the Parkway, the
Historical Summaries of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses have been
audited only for the most recent fiscal year as these transactions did not
involve a related party and the registrant, after reasonable inquiry, is not
aware of any material factors related to the acquired properties not otherwise
disclosed that would cause the reported financial information to not be
necessarily indicative of future operating results. Certain unaudited
financial information for the properties acquired during the nine months ended
September&nbsp;30, 2004, the properties acquired since September&nbsp;30, 2004 and the
one probable acquisition during the first quarter of 2005 that are not
individually significant have also been presented in the pro forma financial
information set forth herein. In addition, as the properties will be directly
or indirectly owned by entities that elect or have elected to be treated as a
REIT for Federal Income Tax purposes, a presentation of estimated taxable
operating results is not applicable.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To the Board of Trustees<BR>
Colonial Properties Trust

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating
Expenses (Historical Summary) of the Acquired Properties (as defined in Note 1)
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This Historical Summary is the
responsibility of the Acquired Property&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Historical Summary based on our audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
Historical Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the Historical Summary. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses
was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K of Colonial
Partnership) as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the revenues and expenses of the Acquired Property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the revenues and direct operating expenses of the
Acquired Property for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">To the Board of Trustees<BR>
Colonial Properties Trust

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating
Expenses (Historical Summary) of the Acquired Properties (as defined in Note 1)
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This Historical Summary is the
responsibility of the Acquired Properties&#146; management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Historical Summary based on our audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
Historical Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the Historical Summary. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses
was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K of Colonial
Partnership) as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the revenues and expenses of the Acquired Properties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the revenues and direct operating expenses of the
Acquired Properties for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

Colonial Properties Trust

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating
Expenses (Historical Summary) of the Acquired Properties (as defined in Note 1)
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This Historical Summary is the
responsibility of the Acquired Properties&#146; management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Historical Summary based on our audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
Historical Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the Historical Summary. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses
was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K of Colonial
Partnership) as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the revenues and expenses of the Acquired Properties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the revenues and direct operating expenses of the
Acquired Properties for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 in conformity with
generally accepted accounting principles.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating
Expenses (Historical Summary) of the Acquired Properties (as defined in Note 1)
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This Historical Summary is the
responsibility of the Acquired Properties&#146; management. Our responsibility is
to express an opinion on the Historical Summary based on our audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
Historical Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the Historical Summary. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses
was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K of Colonial
Partnership) as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the revenues and expenses of the Acquired Properties.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the revenues and direct operating expenses of the
Acquired Properties for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We have audited the Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating
Expenses (Historical Summary) of the Acquired Property (as defined in Note 1)
for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003. This Historical Summary is the
responsibility of the Acquired Property&#146;s management. Our responsibility is to
express an opinion on the Historical Summary based on our audit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">We conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we
plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the
Historical Summary is free of material misstatement. An audit includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the Historical Summary. An audit also includes assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as
evaluating the overall presentation of the Historical Summary. We believe our
audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The accompanying Historical Summary of Revenues and Direct Operating Expenses
was prepared for the purpose of complying with the rules and regulations of the
Securities and Exchange Commission (for inclusion in Form 8-K of Colonial
Partnership) as described in Note 1, and is not intended to be a complete
presentation of the revenues and expenses of the Acquired Property.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In our opinion, the Historical Summary referred to above presents fairly, in
all material respects, the revenues and direct operating expenses of the
Acquired Property for the year ended December&nbsp;31, 2003 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

March&nbsp;31, 2004 is unaudited; however it has been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America for interim financial information and in conjunction with the
rules and regulations of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
Accordingly, it does not include all of the disclosures required by
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of America
for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting solely of normal recurring matters) necessary for
a fair presentation for the interim period have been included. The results
for the interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results that
may be expected for the full year.</TD>
