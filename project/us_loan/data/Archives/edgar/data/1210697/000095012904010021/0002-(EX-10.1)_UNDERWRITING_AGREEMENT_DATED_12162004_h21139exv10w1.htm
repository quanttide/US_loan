paragraph, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party thereunder, shall

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">indemnifying party or parties on the one hand and of the indemnified party
or parties on the other hand in connection with the statements or omissions
that resulted in such losses, claims, damages or liabilities, as well as any
other relevant equitable considerations. The relative benefits received by the
Company or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other hand in connection with the offering of the Shares shall be deemed to be
in the same respective proportions as the net proceeds from the offering of the
Shares (before deducting expenses) received by the Selling Stockholder and the
total underwriting discounts and commissions received by the Underwriters, in
each case as set forth in the table on the cover of the Prospectus, bear to the
aggregate Public Offering Price of the Shares. The relative fault of the
Company or the Selling Stockholder on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
other hand shall be determined by reference to, among other things, whether the
untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or the omission or
alleged omission to state a material fact relates to information supplied by
the Company or the Selling Stockholder or by the Underwriters and the parties&#146;
relative intent, knowledge, access to information and opportunity to correct or
prevent such statement or omission. The Underwriters&#146; respective obligations
to contribute pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9 are several in proportion to the
respective number of Shares they have purchased hereunder, and not joint.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;The Company, the Selling Stockholder and the Underwriters agree that
it would not be just or equitable if contribution pursuant to this Section&nbsp;9
were determined by <I>pro rata </I>allocation (even if the Underwriters were treated
as one entity for such purpose) or by any other method of allocation that does
not take account of the equitable considerations referred to in Section 9(d)
hereof. The amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the
losses, claims, damages and liabilities referred to in the immediately
preceding paragraph shall be deemed to include, subject to the limitations set
forth above, any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with investigating or defending any such action
or claim. Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section&nbsp;9, no Underwriter
shall be required to contribute any amount in excess of the amount by which the
total price at which the Shares underwritten by it and distributed to the
public were offered to the public exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Underwriter has otherwise been required to pay by reason of such untrue or
alleged untrue statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not
guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The remedies provided for in this
Section&nbsp;9 are not exclusive and shall not limit any rights or remedies which
may otherwise be available to any indemnified party at law or in equity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f)&nbsp;The indemnity and contribution provisions contained in this Section&nbsp;9
and the representations, warranties and other statements of the Company and the
Selling Stockholder contained in this Agreement shall remain operative and in
full force and effect regardless of (i)&nbsp;any termination of this Agreement, (ii)

Selling Stockholder shall have the right to postpone the Closing Date, but in
no event for longer than seven days, in order that the required changes, if
any, in the Registration Statement and in the Prospectus or in any other

Underwriter or Underwriters shall fail or refuse to purchase Additional Shares
and the aggregate number of Additional Shares with respect to which such
default occurs is more than one-tenth of the aggregate number of Additional
Shares to be purchased on such Option Closing Date, the non-defaulting
Underwriters shall have the option to (i)&nbsp;terminate their obligation hereunder
to purchase the Additional Shares to be sold on such Option Closing Date or
(ii)&nbsp;purchase not less than the number of Additional Shares that such
non-defaulting Underwriters would have been obligated to purchase in the
absence of such default. Any action taken under this paragraph shall not
relieve any defaulting Underwriter from liability in respect of any default of
such Underwriter under this Agreement.
