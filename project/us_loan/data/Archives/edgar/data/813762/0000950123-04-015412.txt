SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 27, 2004, AREP Sands Holding LLC ("AREP Sands"), a Delaware
limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of American Real Estate
Partners, L.P. ("AREP"), pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated as of that
date, by and among AREP Sands, as purchaser, Barberry Corp. ("Barberry") and
Cyprus, LLC ("Cyprus"), as seller, purchased $37,009,500 principal amount of 3%
Notes due 2008 (the "Notes") issued by Atlantic Coast Entertainment Holdings,
Inc. ("Atlantic Holdings"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GB Holdings, Inc. ("GB
Holdings"), for cash consideration of $36 million. Interest on the Notes is
payable in kind, accreting annually at a rate of 3%. The Notes are convertible,
under certain circumstances, into 65.909 shares of common stock of Atlantic
Holdings for each $1,000 of principal amount of such Notes and are secured by
all existing and future assets of Atlantic Holdings and ACE Gaming, LLC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlantic Holdings. ACE Gaming LLC is the owner and
operator of The Sands Hotel and Casino located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

         Each of Cyprus and Barberry is controlled by Carl C. Icahn. AREP
indirectly owns approximately 36.3% of the outstanding common stock of GB
Holdings and Cyprus owns approximately 41.2% of the outstanding common stock of
GB Holdings. After giving effect to this transaction, AREP indirectly owns
approximately 96.5% of the outstanding Notes. The remaining Notes are owned by
unaffiliated holders.

         Mr. Icahn indirectly owns approximately 86.5% of AREP's limited
partnership depositary and preferred units and indirectly owns 100% of AREP's
general partner, American Property Investors, Inc. The purchase described above
was approved by the Audit Committee of AREP's general partner. The Audit
Committee received advice from its independent financial advisors and legal
counsel. The Audit Committee received a fairness opinion from its financial
advisors to the effect that, as of the date of the transaction, the
consideration to be paid by AREP Sands for the Notes was fair, from a financial
point of view, to AREP.



EXHIBIT INDEX

         99.1 Note Purchase Agreement, dated December 27, 2004, by and among
AREP Sands Holding LLC, as purchaser, Barberry Corp. and Cyprus, LLC, as seller.

                                 INDEMNIFICATION

      6.1   Indemnification by Seller. Seller agrees to indemnify Purchaser, its
Affiliates and their respective officers, directors, employees, independent
contractors, stockholders, principals, partners, agents, or representatives
(each an "Indemnified Person" and collectively, the "Indemnified Persons")
against, and to hold each Indemnified Person harmless from, any and all Losses
incurred or suffered by any Indemnified Person relating to or arising out of or
in connection with (a) any breach of or any inaccuracy in any representation or
warranty made by Seller in this Agreement, (b) any breach of or failure by any
Seller to perform any of its covenants or obligations set out or contemplated in

liabilities, (ii) the inability of the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to pay
its debts as they become due, or (iii) the maintenance by the Company or any of

any claim by or on behalf of holders of the 11% Notes due 2005 issued by GB
Property Funding Corp. challenging the validity or priority of the liens
securing the Notes.

      6.2   Claims. As promptly as is reasonably practicable after becoming
aware of a claim for indemnification under this Agreement, the Indemnified
Person shall promptly give notice to the Seller ("Indemnifying Person") of such
claim and the amount the Indemnified Person will be entitled to receive
hereunder from the Indemnifying Person; provided that the failure of the
Indemnified Person to promptly give notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying
Person of its obligations except to the extent (if any) that the Indemnifying
Person shall have been prejudiced thereby. If the Indemnifying Person does not
object in writing to such indemnification claim within 30 days of receiving
notice thereof, the Indemnified Person shall be entitled to recover, on the
thirty-

                                       14
<PAGE>

fifth day after such notice was given, from the Indemnifying Person the amount
of such claim, and no later objection by the Indemnifying Person shall be
permitted; if the Indemnifying Person agrees that it has an indemnification
obligation but objects that it is obligated to pay only a lesser amount, the
Indemnified Person shall nevertheless be entitled to recover, on the
thirty-fifth day after such notice was given, from the Indemnifying Person the
lesser amount, without prejudice to the Indemnified Person's claim for the
difference. In addition to the amounts recoverable by the Indemnified Person
from the Indemnifying Person pursuant to the foregoing provisions, the
Indemnified Person shall also be entitled to recover from the Indemnifying
Person interest on such amounts at the rate of Two Times Prime from, and
including, the thirty-fifth day after such notice of an indemnification claim is
given to, but not including, the date such recovery is actually made by the
Indemnified Person.

      6.3   Notice of Third Party Claims; Assumption of Defense. The Indemnified
Person shall give notice as promptly as is reasonably practicable to the
Indemnifying Person of the assertion of any claim, or the commencement of any
suit, action or proceeding, by any Person not a party hereto (a "Third Party
Claim") in respect of which indemnity may be sought under this Agreement;
provided that the failure of the Indemnified Person to promptly give notice
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of its obligations except to the
extent (if any) that the Indemnifying Person shall have been prejudiced thereby.
The Indemnifying Person may, at its own expense, participate in the defense of
any Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding (a) upon notice to the
Indemnified Person and (b) upon delivery by the Indemnifying Person to the
Indemnified Person a written agreement that the Indemnified Person is entitled
to indemnification for all Losses arising out of such Third Party Claim, suit,
action or proceeding and that the Indemnifying Person shall be liable for the
entire amount of any Loss, at any time during the course of any such Third Party
Claim, suit, action or proceeding, assume the defense thereof; provided,
however, that (i) the Indemnifying Person's counsel is reasonably satisfactory
to the Indemnified Person, and (ii) the Indemnifying Person shall thereafter
consult with the Indemnified Person upon the Indemnified Person's reasonable
request for such consultation from time to time with respect to such Third Party
Claim, suit, action or proceeding. If the Indemnifying Person assumes such
defense, the Indemnified Person shall have the right (but not the duty) to
participate in the defense thereof and to employ counsel, at its own expense,
separate from the counsel employed by the Indemnifying Person. If, however, the
Indemnified Person reasonably determines in its judgment that representation by
the Indemnifying Person's counsel of both the Indemnifying Person and the
Indemnified Person would present such counsel with a conflict of interest, then
such Indemnified Person may employ separate counsel to represent or defend it in
any such Third Party Claim, action, suit or proceeding and the Indemnifying
Person shall pay all of the fees and disbursements in connection with the
retention of such separate counsel. If the Indemnifying Person fails to promptly
notify the Indemnified Party that the Indemnifying Party desires to defend the
Third Party Claim pursuant, or if the Indemnifying Person gives such notice but
fails to prosecute vigorously and diligently or settle the Third Party Claim,
then the Indemnified Party will have the right to defend, at the sole cost and
expense of the Indemnifying Person, the Third Party Claim by all appropriate
proceedings, which proceedings will be prosecuted by the Indemnifying Person in
good faith or will be settled at the discretion of the Indemnifying Person (with
the consent of the Indemnifying Person, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld). The Indemnifying Person will have full control of such defense and
proceedings, including any compromise or settlement thereof. Whether or not the
Indemnifying Person chooses to defend or prosecute any such Third Party Claim,
suit, action or proceeding, all of the parties hereto shall cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof.

                                       15
<PAGE>

      6.4   Settlement or Compromise. Any settlement or compromise made or
caused to be made by the Indemnified Person or the Indemnifying Person, of any
claim, suit, action or proceeding shall also be binding upon the Indemnifying
Person or the Indemnified Person, as the case may be, in the same manner as if a
final judgment or decree had been entered by a court of competent jurisdiction
in the amount of such settlement or compromise thereof; provided, however, that
no obligation, restriction or Loss shall be imposed on the Indemnified Person as
a result of such settlement without its prior written consent. The Indemnified
Person will give the Indemnifying Person at least 30 days' notice of any
proposed settlement or compromise of any Third Party Claim, suit, action or
proceeding it is defending, during which time the Indemnifying Person may reject
such proposed settlement or compromise; provided, however, that from and after
such rejection, the Indemnifying Person shall be obligated to assume the defense
of and full and complete liability and responsibility for such Third Party
Claim, suit, action or proceeding and any and all Losses in connection therewith
in excess of the amount of unindemnifiable Losses which the Indemnified Person
would have been obligated to pay under the proposed settlement or compromise.

      6.5   Failure of Indemnifying Person to Act. In the event that the
Indemnifying Person does not assume the defense of any Third Party Claim, suit,
action or proceeding brought against an Indemnified Person, then any failure of
the Indemnified Person to defend or to participate in the defense of any such
Third Party Claim, suit, action or proceeding or to cause the same to be done,
shall not relieve the Indemnifying Person of any of its obligations under this
Agreement.

      6.6   Tax Character. Seller and Purchaser agree that any payments pursuant
to this Article VI will be treated for federal and state income tax purposes as
adjustments to the purchase price of the Notes, and that they will report such
payments on all Tax Returns consistently with such characterization.

irrevocably waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, any objection which
it may now or hereafter have to the laying of the venue of any such suit, action

brought in any such court, any claim that any such suit, action or proceeding
brought in such a court has been brought in an inconvenient forum and the right
to object, with respect to any such suit, action or proceeding brought in any
such court, that such court does not have jurisdiction over such party or the
other party. In any such suit, action or proceeding, each party waives, to the
fullest extent it may effectively do so, personal service of any summons,
complaint or other process and agrees that the service thereof may be made by
any means permitted by Section 8.15 (other than facsimile transmission). Each

proceeding brought in such a court shall be conclusive and binding.

transactions contemplated hereby (including fees and disbursements of counsel,
consultants and accountants) incurred by (a) Seller shall be paid and borne
exclusively by Seller, and (b) Purchaser shall be paid and borne exclusively by
Purchaser. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if this Agreement is terminated prior
to the Closing and such termination results from any breach by Seller or
Purchaser, as the case may be, of any representation, warranty or covenant by
such party, then such breaching party shall reimburse the non-breaching party
for all such expenses, fees and cash, including for all expenses, fees and cash
incurred in connection with obtaining high yield or other financing.
