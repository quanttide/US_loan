SECTION 1 - REGISTRANT'S BUSINESS AND OPERATIONS

ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

         On December 27, 2004, AREP Sands Holding LLC ("AREP Sands"), a Delaware
limited liability company and an indirect subsidiary of American Real Estate
Partners, L.P. ("AREP"), pursuant to a note purchase agreement, dated as of that
date, by and among AREP Sands, as purchaser, Barberry Corp. ("Barberry") and
Cyprus, LLC ("Cyprus"), as seller, purchased $37,009,500 principal amount of 3%
Notes due 2008 (the "Notes") issued by Atlantic Coast Entertainment Holdings,
Inc. ("Atlantic Holdings"), a wholly-owned subsidiary of GB Holdings, Inc. ("GB
Holdings"), for cash consideration of $36 million. Interest on the Notes is
payable in kind, accreting annually at a rate of 3%. The Notes are convertible,
under certain circumstances, into 65.909 shares of common stock of Atlantic
Holdings for each $1,000 of principal amount of such Notes and are secured by
all existing and future assets of Atlantic Holdings and ACE Gaming, LLC, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Atlantic Holdings. ACE Gaming LLC is the owner and
operator of The Sands Hotel and Casino located in Atlantic City, New Jersey.

         Each of Cyprus and Barberry is controlled by Carl C. Icahn. AREP
indirectly owns approximately 36.3% of the outstanding common stock of GB
Holdings and Cyprus owns approximately 41.2% of the outstanding common stock of
GB Holdings. After giving effect to this transaction, AREP indirectly owns
approximately 96.5% of the outstanding Notes. The remaining Notes are owned by
unaffiliated holders.

         Mr. Icahn indirectly owns approximately 86.5% of AREP's limited
partnership depositary and preferred units and indirectly owns 100% of AREP's
general partner, American Property Investors, Inc. The purchase described above
was approved by the Audit Committee of AREP's general partner. The Audit
Committee received advice from its independent financial advisors and legal
counsel. The Audit Committee received a fairness opinion from its financial
advisors to the effect that, as of the date of the transaction, the
consideration to be paid by AREP Sands for the Notes was fair, from a financial
point of view, to AREP.



EXHIBIT INDEX

         99.1 Note Purchase Agreement, dated December 27, 2004, by and among
AREP Sands Holding LLC, as purchaser, Barberry Corp. and Cyprus, LLC, as seller.
