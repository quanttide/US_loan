          PARK ELECTROCHEMICAL REPORTS THIRD QUARTER RESULTS

MELVILLE, New York, December 22, 2004......Park Electrochemical Corp.
(NYSE-PKE) reported sales of $50,359,000 for the third quarter  ended
November  28,  2004 compared to sales from continuing  operations  of
$51,058,000 for the third quarter of last year.  Park's sales for the
first nine months were $159,975,000 compared to sales from continuing
operations of $138,947,000 for last year's first nine months.

Park  reported  net profit from continuing operations  before  special
items  of  $4,189,000 for the third quarter ended  November  28,  2004
compared to net profit from continuing operations before special items
of  $2,394,000 for last fiscal year's third quarter.  During the third
quarter  ended November 28, 2004, the Company recognized a  $4,745,000
gain related to insurance proceeds from the November 2002 accident  at
its  Singapore  facility  and  $625,000  of  realignment  charges  for
workforce  reductions  at its North American and European  operations.
During  the prior year's third quarter, the Company realized a pre-tax
gain  of  $429,000 on the sale of real estate previously used  by  its
Nelco  UK  subsidiary and had a loss from discontinued  operations  of
$1,838,000.  Accordingly, net earnings were $7,692,000 for  the  third
quarter  ended November 28, 2004 compared to net earnings of  $985,000
for last fiscal year's third quarter.

For  the nine-month period ended November 28, 2004, Park reported  net
profit  from continuing operations before special items of $13,157,000
compared to net profit from continuing operations before special items
of $2,906,000 for last year's nine-month period.  Net earnings for the
nine months ended November 28, 2004 included the gain on the insurance
settlement  and  realignment charge described above.   For  the  prior
year's first nine-month period, the Company reported a pre-tax gain of
$33,088,000  related to the Delco lawsuit, a pre-tax gain of  $429,000
on  the sale of real estate previously used by its Nelco UK subsidiary
and  pre-tax charges of $8,438,000 related to realignment  costs.  Net
earnings  for the nine months ended November 28, 2004 were $16,660,000
compared  to  net earnings of $11,572,000 for last year's first  nine-
month period.

Park  reported  diluted earnings per share from continuing  operations
before  special items of $.21 and $.66, respectively,  for  the  third
quarter  and nine months ended November 28, 2004 compared to $.12  and
$.15, respectively, for last year's third quarter and first nine-month
period.  Diluted earnings per share were $.38 and $.83,  respectively,
for the third quarter and nine months ended November 28, 2004 compared
to  $.05  and  $.58, respectively, for last year's third  quarter  and
first nine-month period.

Brian  Shore,  Park's  President and CEO, said: "Although  the  global
markets for our electronics materials products improved to some degree
in  the  month  of  September, those markets were  anemic  during  the
remainder  of  the  third quarter. It is currently too  early  in  the
fourth  quarter  to have any intelligent opinion as to  whether  those
markets will improve during the fourth quarter. However, the military,
aerospace,  wireless  communication and  industrial  markets  for  our
FiberCote  advanced  composites business were all healthy  during  the
third  quarter, with particular strength coming from the rocket motor,
airframe  and  radome  components of those  markets.  We  believe  the
markets for our FiberCote business will continue to be healthy  during
the  fourth  quarter.  We continue to invest our company's  human  and
financial   resources  in  the  higher  technology  aspects   of   our
electronics materials business and in our FiberCote advanced composite
business. Our Singapore and China expansions are progressing on track.
In  addition, we are in the process of installing an additional  large
treater  at  our  FiberCote  advanced composite  facility  located  in
Waterbury,   Connecticut.   This  treater  will   effectively   double
FiberCote's current manufacturing capacity."

The  Company  will conduct a conference call to discuss its  financial
results  at  11:00 a.m. EST today. Forward-looking and other  material
information  may be discussed in this conference call. The  conference
call dial-in number is (800) 946-0712.

For  those unable to listen to the call live, a conference call replay
will be available from approximately 2:00 p.m. EST today through 11:59
p.m. EST on Sunday, December 26, 2004. The conference call replay  can
be  accessed by dialing (888) 203-1112 and entering passcode 154649 or
on  the  Company's  website at www.parkelectro.com under  the  caption
"Investor Conference Calls".

Any additional material financial or statistical data disclosed in the
conference  call will also be available at the time of the  conference
call  on  the  Company's  web  site at www.parkelectro.com  under  the
caption "Investor Conference Calls".

Park  believes that an evaluation of its ongoing operations would  be
difficult if the disclosure of its financial results were limited  to
generally accepted accounting principles ("GAAP") financial measures,
which  include  special  items,  such as  realignment  and  severance
charges  and the gain on the Delco lawsuit. Accordingly, in  addition
to  disclosing  its financial results determined in  accordance  with
GAAP,  Park discloses non-GAAP operating results that exclude special
items  in  order  to  assist its shareholders and  other  readers  in
assessing the company's operating performance, since the Company's on-
going,  normal business operations do not include such special items.
Such  non-GAAP  financial  measures are provided  to  supplement  the
results provided in accordance with GAAP.

Certain  portions of this press release may be deemed  to  constitute
forward looking statements that are subject to various factors  which
could   cause  actual  results  to  differ  materially  from   Park's
expectations.  Such factors include, but are not limited to,  general
conditions in the electronics industry, Park's competitive  position,
the  status  of  Park's  relationships with its  customers,  economic
conditions  in  international markets, the cost and  availability  of
utilities,  and  the  various factors set  forth  under  the  caption
"Factors  That  May Affect Future Results" after  Item  7  of  Park's
Annual  Report  on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended  February  29,
2004.
