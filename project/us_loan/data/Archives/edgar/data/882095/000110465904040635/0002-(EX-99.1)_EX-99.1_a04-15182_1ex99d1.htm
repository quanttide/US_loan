York, NY and Foster City, CA, December 20, 2004</font></b><font size="2" style="font-size:10.0pt;"> &#151; Bristol-Myers Squibb
Company (NYSE: BMY) and Gilead Sciences, Inc. (Nasdaq: GILD) today announced
details of a joint venture to develop and commercialize the fixed-dose
combination of Bristol-Myers Squibb&#146;s Sustiva</font><sup><font size="2" face="Symbol" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#210;</font></sup><font size="2" style="font-size:10.0pt;"> (efavirenz) and Gilead&#146;s
Truvada<sup>&#153;</sup> (emtricitabine and tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in the
United States.&#160; If approved, the new
product would be the first complete Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy
(HAART) treatment regimen for HIV available in a fixed-dose combination taken
once daily.&#160; Fixed-dose combinations
contain multiple medicines formulated together and may help simplify HIV
therapy for patients and providers. The joint venture established by the two
companies is the first of its kind in the field of HIV therapy.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The work necessary to co-formulate Sustiva and Truvada into a
once-daily combination product has been ongoing throughout most of 2004 and
will continue into 2005.&#160; Through the
joint venture &#151; Bristol-Myers Squibb &amp; Gilead Sciences, LLC &#151; the companies
will work in partnership to complete development and U.S. regulatory filings
for this fixed-dose regimen.&#160; Subject to
receiving marketing approval of the fixed-dose regimen, the companies would
share responsibility for commercializing the product in the United States.&#160; Both companies will provide funding and
field-based sales representatives in support of promotional efforts for the
combination product.&#160;&#160; Bristol-Myers
Squibb and Gilead will receive revenues from future net sales at percentages
relative to the contribution represented by their individual products that
comprise the fixed-dose combination.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Guidelines issued by the
U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) list the combination of
emtricitabine, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and efavirenz as one of the
preferred non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor (NNRTI)-based
treatments for use in appropriate patients that have never taken anti-HIV
medicines before. It is important that patients be aware that individual HIV
medications must be taken as part of combination regimens, and that they do not
cure HIV infection or prevent passing HIV to others.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Earlier in 2004,
U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tommy Thompson addressed the need
for new products to help advance and simplify treatment for people with HIV/AIDS,
encouraging members of industry to work together to create fixed-dose
combinations that would help achieve these goals.&#160; Additionally, earlier this year the U.S. Food
and Drug Administration issued new guidelines to expedite the approval of new
combination products for HIV.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;The availability
of simplified treatment regimens for HIV/AIDS is important to our ability to
make progress in the fight against the disease,&#148; Secretary Thompson said. &#147;I am
pleased to see the collaboration and efforts of Bristol-Myers Squibb and
Gilead. This partnership to create a fixed-dose combination of three HIV
medications represents an important advance in our collective effort to deliver
simplified therapy for people living with HIV.&#148;</font></p>

Safety Information About Sustiva</font></u></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Sustiva is a
prescription medicine used in combination with other medicines to treat people
who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1).&#160; Sustiva does not cure HIV or help prevent
passing HIV to others.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Sustiva should not
be taken with Hismanal<sup>&#174;</sup> (astemizole), Propulsid<sup>&#174;</sup>
(cisapride), Versed<sup>&#174;</sup> (midazolam), Halcion<sup>&#174;</sup> (triazolam),
ergot medicines (for example, Wigraine<sup>&#174;</sup> and Cafergot<sup>&#174;</sup>),
or Vfend<sup>&#174;</sup> (voriconazole).&#160;
This list of medicines is not complete.&#160;
Patients should discuss all prescription and non-prescription medicines,
vitamin and herbal supplements, or other health preparations (particularly St.
John&#146;s wort) they are taking or plan to take with their healthcare
provider.&#160; Patients taking Sustiva should
tell their doctor right away if they have any side effects or conditions
including: severe depression, strange thoughts, or angry behavior, which have
been reported in a small number of patients. A few reports of suicide have been
made, but it is not known if Sustiva was the cause.&#160; Patients should tell their doctor if they
have a history of mental illness or are using drugs or alcohol. Dizziness,
trouble sleeping, drowsiness, trouble concentrating, and/or unusual dreams are
common.&#160; These feelings tend to go away
after taking Sustiva for a few weeks.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Women should not
become pregnant or breastfeed while taking Sustiva.&#160; Rash is a common side effect that usually
goes away without any change in treatment.&#160;
Rash may be a serious problem in some children.&#160; If a child develops a rash, their doctor
should be contacted right away.&#160; Patients
should tell their</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">doctor if they
have liver disease, have ever had seizures, or are taking medicine for seizures
as tests to check the liver or drug levels in the blood may be needed.&#160; Changes in body fat have been seen in some
patients taking HIV medicines, however, the cause and long-term effects of
these changes are not known at this time. Other common side effects include:
tiredness, upset stomach, vomiting and diarrhea.&#160; Taking Sustiva with food increases the amount
of medicine in the body, which may increase the frequency of side effects.&#160; Sustiva should be taken on an empty stomach,
preferably at bedtime, which may make some side effects less bothersome.&#160; United States Full Prescribing Information is
available at www.sustiva.com.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Truvada combines Emtriva<sup>&#174;</sup>
(emtricitabine) and Viread<sup>&#174;</sup> (tenofovir disoproxil fumarate) in one
tablet taken once a day in combination with other antiretroviral agents.&#160; In the United States, Truvada is indicated in
combination with other antiretroviral agents (such as non-nucleoside reverse
transcriptase inhibitors or protease inhibitors) for the treatment of HIV-1
infection in adults.&#160; Safety and efficacy
studies using Truvada tablets or using Emtriva and Viread in combination are
ongoing.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Both components of Truvada have been studied
individually, as part of multi-drug regimens and have been found to be safe and
effective.&#160; Since Emtriva and lamivudine
(3TC) are comparable in their structure, resistance profiles, and efficacy and
safety as part of multi-drug regimens, existing data from the use of lamivudine
and Viread in combination have been extrapolated to support use of Truvada
tablets for the treatment of HIV-1 infection in adults.&#160; Therefore, in treatment-na&#239;ve patients,
Truvada should be considered as an alternative to the combination of Viread and
lamivudine for those patients who might benefit from a once-daily regimen.&#160;&#160; In treatment-experienced patients, the use
of Truvada should be guided by laboratory testing and treatment history.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">There are no study results
demonstrating the effect of Truvada on clinical progression of HIV-1, and it is
not recommended that Truvada be used as a component of a triple nucleoside
regimen.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Truvada should not be used
with Emtriva or Viread, or other drugs containing lamivudine, including
Combivir<sup>&#174;</sup>, Epivir<sup>&#174;</sup>, Epivir-HBV<sup>&#174;</sup>, Epzicom<sup>&#153;</sup>
or Trizivir<sup>&#174;</sup>.&#160; Two-hundred
eighty-three patients have received combination therapy with Emtriva and Viread
with either a non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or protease
inhibitor for 24 to 48 weeks in ongoing clinical studies.&#160; Based on these limited data, no new patterns
of adverse events were identified and there was no increased frequency of
established toxicities.&#160; For additional
safety information about Emtriva or Viread in combination with other antiretroviral
agents, please see &#147;About Emtriva&#148; and &#147;About Viread,&#148; below.</font></p>

steatosis, including fatal cases, have been reported with the use of nucleoside
analogues alone or in combination with other antiretrovirals. Viread, Emtriva
and Truvada are not indicated for the treatment of chronic hepatitis B virus
(HBV) infection and the safety and efficacy of these drugs has not been
established in patients co-infected with HBV and HIV.&#160; Severe acute exacerbations of hepatitis B
have been reported in patients who have discontinued Viread or Emtriva. Hepatic
function should be monitored closely with both clinical and laboratory
follow-up for at least several months in patients who discontinue Viread,
Emtriva or Truvada and are co-infected with HIV and HBV.&#160; If appropriate, initiation of anti-hepatitis
B therapy may be warranted.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">In the United States, Viread
is indicated in combination with other antiretroviral agents for the treatment
of HIV-1 infection.&#160; This indication is
based on analyses of plasma HIV-1 RNA levels and CD4 cell counts in controlled
studies of Viread in treatment-na&#239;ve adults and in treatment-experienced
adults.&#160; There are no study results
demonstrating the effect of Viread on clinical progression of HIV-1.&#160; The use of Viread should be considered for
treating adult patients with HIV-1 strains that are expected to be susceptible
to tenofovir as assessed by laboratory testing or treatment history.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Drug interactions have been observed when
didanosine, atazanavir or lopinavir/ritonavir is co-administered with Viread
and dose adjustments may be necessary.&#160;
Data are not available to recommend a dose adjustment of didanosine for
patients weighing less than 60 kg.&#160;
Patients on atazanavir or lopinavir/ritonavir plus Viread should be
monitored for Viread-associated adverse events which may require discontinuation.&#160; When co-administered with Viread, it is
recommended that atazanavir 300 mg be given with ritonavir 100 mg.&#160; Atazanavir without ritonavir should not be
co-administered with Viread.</font></p>
