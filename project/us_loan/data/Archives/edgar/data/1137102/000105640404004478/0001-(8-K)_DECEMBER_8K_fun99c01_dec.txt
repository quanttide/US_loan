 (1) Debt Service Coverage Ratios are updated periodically as new NOI figures
 become available from borrowers on an asset level. In all cases the most current
 DSCR provided by the Servicer is used. To the extent that no DSCR is provided by
 the Servicer, information from the offering document is used. The Trustee makes
 no representations as to the accuracy of the data provided by the borrower for
 this calculation.

 (2) Anticipated Remaining Term and WAM are each calculated based upon the term
 from the current month to the earlier of the Anticipated Repayment Date, if
 applicable, and the maturity date.

 (3) Data in this table was calculated by allocating pro-rata the current loan
 information to the properties based upon the Cut-off Date Balance of each
 property as disclosed in the offering document.

     255999739     Loan is due for the September payment date. Foreclosure has been filed. Borrower has been
                   unwilling to fund debt service shortfalls.

     255999619     Approved payoff by Borrower to payoff the loan with a waiver of the prepayment premium and
                   a discount of up to $500,000 off the principal. Regular interest will be paid through the
                   date of payoff. This discount is available through 12/31/04, at which time  the full
                   amounts under the loan will be reinstated. The basis for the reduction is that the loan is
                   chronically late; it will be difficult to refinance or sell this hotel separately from the
                   3 other hotels owned by the same group in Rocky Mount.

     255999583     Awarded listing assignment.  Marketing package being prepared.  Awaiting reply from C&H
                   Steakhouse on our counteroffer.  Awaiting offer from tenant, Chucke-Chesse on its parcel.

     255999894     Property is not generating sufficient funds to continue to make full P&I payments.  The
                   borrower is starting to generate some interest in the vacant anchor space, but will need
                   an interest only or a pay & accrue structure to meet debt payments and fund tenant
                   improvements.

     255999877

     430000002     On June 1, 2004 the partnership removed the General Partner from management of the
                   property, alleging mis-management and accounting inconsistencies, and appointed a new
                   General Manager.  This new general manager has requested a reduction in the interest rate
                   to allow additional funds to go to reserve.  Based on current financial information no
                   debt relief is necessary.

     255999617     File returned.

     895096258     OA consent was approved to accept a payoff with a partial payment of $10,000.  Legal
                   counsel was assigned to document the transaction and a legal retainer was remitted by the
                   Borrower.
