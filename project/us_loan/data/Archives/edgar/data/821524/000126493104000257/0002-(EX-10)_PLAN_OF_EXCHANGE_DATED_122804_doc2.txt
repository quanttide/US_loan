                                  I. RECITALS

1.   THE  PARTIES  TO  THIS  AGREEMENT:11. THE PARTIES TO THIS LETTER OF INTENT:

     (1.1)  HAIRMAX  INTERNATIONAL,  INC. ("HRMX"),  a  Nevada  corporation.

     (1.2)  ARCOTECT  DIGITAL  TECHNOLOGY  LTD  ("ADT"), a corporation organized
under  the  laws  of  Hong  Kong.

     (1.3)  EDWARD  A  ROTH,  President of HRMX,  and, together  with his  wife,
Alisha Roth, being the majority shareholders of HRMX (the "Majority Shareholders
of  HRMX").

     (1.4)  THE  INDIVIDUAL SHAREHOLDERS OF ADT whose names are set forth on the
signature  page  hereof  (the  "ADT  Shareholders").

2.   THE  CAPITAL  OF  THE  PARTIES:

     (2.1)  THE  CAPITAL OF HRMX consists of 500,000,000 shares of common voting
stock of $0.001 par value authorized, of which 206,921,001 shares are issued and
outstanding.  HRMX  intends  to  undertake a 100 for 1 reverse stock split which
would  result  in  the  total  number  of  outstanding  shares  being reduced to
2,069,210.  HRMX  also  has  40,000,000 shares of Series A convertible preferred
stock  of  $.001  par value authorized, of which 2,850,000 shares are issued and
outstanding,  and 1,000 shares of Series B convertible preferred stock, of which
none  are  issued  and  outstanding.

     After  consummation  of  the  transactions contemplated herein, the parties
intend  that  ADT  Shareholders  will  own  90.62% of the issued and outstanding
shares  of  common  stock  of  HRMX.

     (2.2)  THE  CAPITAL  OF  ADT  consists  of HK$10,000 in registered capital,
which  for  the  purposes of this Agreement, is referred to as "common stock" or
"capital  stock".

3.   TRANSACTION  DESCRIPTIVE  SUMMARY: HRMX  desires to acquire ADT and the ADT
Shareholders  wish  ADT to be acquired by a public company. The ADT Shareholders
will  exchange  100%  of  the capital stock of ADT for (i) 2,850,000 outstanding
shares  of HRMX Series A convertible preferred stock such transfer to be made on
the  date of execution of this Agreement and (ii) 20,000,000 (post-reverse stock
split) new shares of HRMX common stock to be transferred to the ADT Shareholders
on  the  Closing  Date which shall in no event be later than January 7, 2005. In
addition,  the  ADT  Shareholders  will  make  the second of two payments to the
Majority  Shareholders  of  HRMX of $400,000 in the aggregate, the first payment
having already been paid in escrow pursuant to the Escrow Agreement. The parties
intend  that  the  transactions  qualify  and  meet the Hong Kong Inland Revenue
Department  and  US  Internal  Revenue  Code  requirements  for  a  tax  free
reorganization,  in  which there is no corporate gain or loss recognized for the
parties,  with  reference  to  Internal Revenue Code (IRC) sections 354 and 368.

4.   SEC  COMPLIANCE.  HRMX shall  cause  the  filing  and  the  mailing  to its
stockholders  of  an  Information  Statement  pursuant  to  Section 14(f) of the
Securities  Exchange  Act  of  1934,  before  Closing.

5.   NEVADA  COMPLIANCE. Articles of Exchange are required to be filed by Nevada
law  as  the  last  act to make the acquisition final and effective under Nevada
law.

6.   AUDITED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. Certain filings under the Securities Exchange
Act  of  1934,  such  as a Current Report on Form 8-K, require audited financial
statements  of  ADT  to  be  filed  with  the  SEC within 71 calendar days after
Closing.  In  connection with HRMX's (or as its name may be changed by agreement
of  the  parties)  filing  of  a Current Report on Form 8-K after Closing, as it
relates  to  this  transaction,  audited  financial  statements  of  ADT will be
prepared  and  filed  with  the  SEC.

Nevada.
