order that the corporation may determine the shareholders entitled to demand
               a Special Meeting, the Board of Directors may fix a record date to
determine the                shareholders entitled to make such a demand (the &#147;Demand
Record                Date&#148;). The Demand Record Date shall not precede the date upon
which the                resolution fixing the Demand Record Date is adopted by the Board
of Directors                and shall not be more than 10 days after the date upon which
the resolution                fixing the Demand Record Date is adopted by the Board of
Directors. Any                shareholder of record seeking to have shareholders demand a
Special Meeting                shall, by sending written notice to the Secretary of the
corporation by hand or                by certified or registered mail, return receipt

Board of Directors shall promptly,                but in all events within 10 days after
the date on which a valid request to fix                a Demand Record Date is received,
adopt a resolution fixing the Demand Record                Date and shall make a public
announcement of such Demand Record Date. If no                Demand Record Date has been
fixed by the Board of Directors within 10 days after                the date on which
such request is received by the Secretary, the Demand Record                Date shall be
the 10th day after the first day on which a valid written request                to set a
Demand Record Date is received by the Secretary. To be valid, such                written
request shall set forth the purpose or purposes for which the Special

          case of any Special Meeting, (a) the notice of meeting shall describe any

          <U>Fixing of Record Date</U>. The Board of Directors may fix in advance a date
          not less than 10 days and not more than 70 days prior to the date of any Annual
          Meeting or Special Meeting as the record date for the determination of
          shareholders entitled to notice of, or to vote at, such meeting (the
          &#147;Meeting Record Date&#148;). In the case of any Demand Special Meeting, (i)
          the Meeting Record Date shall be not later than the 30th day after the Delivery
          Date and (ii) if the Board of Directors fails to fix the Meeting Record Date
          within 30 days after the Delivery Date, then the close of business on such 30th
          day shall be the Meeting Record Date. The shareholders of record on the Meeting
          Record Date shall be the shareholders entitled to notice of and to vote at the
          meeting. Except as provided by the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law for a
          court-ordered adjournment, a determination of shareholders entitled to notice of
          and to vote at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting is effective for any
          adjournment of such meeting unless the Board of Directors fixes a new Meeting
          Record Date, which it shall do if the meeting is adjourned to a date more than
          120 days after the date fixed for the original meeting. The Board of Directors
          may also fix in advance a date as the record date for the purpose of determining
          shareholders entitled to take any other action or determining shareholders for
          any other purpose. Such record date shall be not more than 70 days prior to the
          date on which the particular action, requiring such determination of
          shareholders, is to be taken. The record date for determining shareholders
          entitled to a distribution (other than a distribution involving a purchase,
          redemption or other acquisition of the corporation&#146;s shares) or a share
          dividend is the date on which the Board of Directors authorizes the distribution
          or share dividend, as the case may be, unless the Board of Directors fixes a
          different record date. </FONT></P>

          <U>Shareholder Lists</U>. After a Meeting Record Date has been fixed, the
          corporation shall prepare a list of the names of all of the shareholders
          entitled to notice of the meeting. The list shall be arranged by class or series
          of shares, if any, and show the address of and number of shares held by each
          shareholder. Such list shall be available for inspection by any shareholder,
          beginning two business days after notice of the meeting is given for which the
          list was prepared and continuing to the date of the meeting, at the
          corporation&#146;s principal office or at a place identified in the meeting
          notice in the city where the meeting will be held. A shareholder or his or her
          agent may, on written demand, inspect and, subject to the limitations imposed by
          the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, copy the list, during regular business
          hours and at his or her expense, during the period that it is available for

          her agent or attorney may inspect the list at any time during the meeting or any
          adjournment thereof. Refusal or failure to prepare or make available the
          shareholders&#146; list shall not affect the validity of any action taken at a
          meeting of shareholders. </FONT></P>

          Shares entitled to vote as a separate voting group may take action on a matter
          at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting only if a quorum of those shares exists
          with respect to that matter. If the corporation has only one class of stock
          outstanding, such class shall constitute a separate voting group for purposes of
          this Section 2.07. Except as otherwise provided in the Articles of
          Incorporation, any by-law adopted under authority granted in the Articles of
          Incorporation, or the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law, a majority of the
          votes entitled to be cast on the matter shall constitute a quorum of the voting
          group for action on that matter. Once a share is represented for any purpose at
          any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting, other than for the purpose of objecting
          to holding the meeting or transacting business at the meeting, it is considered
          present for purposes of determining whether a quorum exists for the remainder of
          the meeting and for any adjournment of that meeting unless a new Meeting Record
          Date is or must be set for the adjourned meeting. If a quorum exists, except in
          the case of the election of directors, action on a matter shall be approved if
          the votes cast within the voting group favoring the action exceed the votes cast
          opposing the action, unless the Articles of Incorporation, any by-law adopted
          under authority granted in the Articles of Incorporation, or the Wisconsin
          Business Corporation Law requires a greater number of affirmative votes. Unless
          otherwise provided in the Articles of Incorporation, directors shall be elected
          by a plurality of the votes cast by the shares entitled to vote in the election
          of directors at any Annual Meeting or Special Meeting at which a quorum is
          present. For purposes of this Section 2.07(a), &#147;plurality&#148; means that
          the individuals with the largest number of votes are elected as directors up to
          the maximum number of directors to be chosen at the Annual Meeting or Special
          Meeting. </FONT></P>

          time, upon a resolution of shareholders if the votes cast in favor of such

          secretary of all Annual Meetings and Special Meetings, but, in the absence of
          the Secretary, the presiding officer may appoint any other person to act as
          secretary of the meeting. </FONT></P>

          months from the date of its signing unless a different period is expressly

          annual meeting of shareholders and until his successor shall have been elected
          and qualified, or until there is a decrease in the number of directors which
          takes effect after the expiration of his term, or until his prior death,
          resignation or removal. A director may be removed by the shareholders only at a
          meeting called for the purpose of removing the director, and the meeting notice
          shall state that the purpose, or one of the purposes, of the meeting is removal
          of the director. A director may be removed from office but only for cause (as
          defined herein) if the number of votes cast to remove the director exceeds the
          number of votes cast not to remove him; <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that,
          if the Board of Directors, by resolution, shall have recommended removal of a
          director, then the shareholders may remove such director without cause by the
          vote referred to above. As used herein, &#147;cause&#148; shall exist only if
          the director whose removal is proposed has been convicted of a felony by a court
          of competent jurisdiction, where such conviction is no longer subject to direct
          appeal, or has been adjudged liable for actions or omissions in the performance
          of his duty to the corporation in a matter which has had a materially adverse
          effect on the business of the corporation, where such adjudication is no longer
          subject to appeal. A director may resign at any time by delivering written
          notice which complies with the Wisconsin Business Corporation Law to the
          Chairman of the Board or to the corporation. A director&#146;s resignation is
          effective when the notice is delivered unless the notice specifies a later
          effective date. Directors need not be residents of the State of Wisconsin but
          must be shareholders of the corporation. Except as otherwise provided by the
          Board of Directors, a director shall retire no later than the end of the term in
          which occurs the earlier of the director&#146;s attainment of age seventy (70)
          or the completion of fifteen (15) years of service as a non-employee director;
          <U>provided</U>, <U>however</U>, that the fifteen (15) year limitation shall be
          inapplicable to any director who had completed at least fifteen (15) years as a
          non-employee director as of January 1, 1995. As used herein, a
          &#147;non-employee director&#148; shall mean a director who is not an employee
          of the corporation or any of its subsidiaries. </FONT></P>

          48 hours prior to the time of the meeting. If mailed, such notice shall be

          the Articles of Incorporation or these by-laws or any provision of the Wisconsin
          Business Corporation Law, a waiver thereof in writing, signed at any time,
          whether before or after the time of meeting, by the director entitled to such
          notice, shall be deemed equivalent to the giving of such notice. The corporation
          shall retain any such waiver as part of the permanent corporate records. A

          or promptly upon his arrival objects to holding the meeting or transacting

          of, any regular or special meeting of the Board of Directors need be specified

          held by a director elected by a voting group of shareholders, only the holders
          of shares of that voting group may vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by
          the shareholders, and only the remaining directors elected by that voting group
          may vote to fill the vacancy if it is filled by the directors. A vacancy that
          will occur at a specific later date, because of a resignation effective at a
          later date or otherwise, may be filled before the vacancy occurs, but the new
          director may not take office until the vacancy occurs. </FONT></P>

          Corporation Law, as shall be determined by the Board of Directors. Such
          certificates shall be signed by the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive
          Officer, the President or a Vice-President and by the Secretary or an Assistant
          Secretary. All certificates for shares shall be consecutively numbered or

          shall be entered on the stock transfer books of the corporation. All
          certificates surrendered to the corporation for transfer shall be cancelled and
          no new certificate shall be issued until the former certificate for a like

          such shares as the person exclusively entitled to vote, to receive notifications
          and otherwise to exercise all the rights and powers of an owner. Where a
          certificate for shares is presented to the corporation with a request to
          register for transfer, the corporation shall not be liable to the owner or any
          other person suffering loss as a result of such registration of transfer if (a)
          there were on or with the certificate the necessary endorsements, and (b) the
          corporation had no duty to inquire into adverse claims or has discharged any
          such duty. The corporation may require reasonable assurance that said
          endorsements are genuine and effective and in compliance with such other
          regulations as may be prescribed under the authority of the Board of Directors. </FONT></P>

          certificate for shares has been lost, destroyed or wrongfully taken, a new
          certificate shall be issued in place thereof if the owner (a) so requests before
          the corporation has notice that such shares have been acquired by a bona fide
          purchaser, and (b) files with the corporation a sufficient indemnity bond, and
          (c) satisfies such other reasonable requirements as the Board of Directors may
          prescribe. </FONT></P>

          <U>Consideration for Shares</U>. The Board of Directors may authorize shares to
          be issued for consideration consisting of any tangible or intangible property or
          benefit to the corporation, including cash, promissory notes, services
          performed, contracts for services to be performed or other securities of the
          corporation. Before the corporation issues shares, the Board of Directors shall
          determine that the consideration received or to be received for the shares to be
          issued is adequate. In the absence of a resolution adopted by the Board of
          Directors expressly determining that the consideration received or to be
          received is adequate, Board approval of the issuance of the shares shall be
          deemed to constitute such a determination. The determination of the Board of
          Directors is conclusive insofar as the adequacy of consideration for the
          issuance of shares relates to whether the shares are validly issued, fully paid
          and nonassessable. The corporation may place in escrow shares issued in whole or
          in part for a contract for future services or benefits, a promissory note, or
          other property to be issued in the future, or make other arrangements to
          restrict the transfer of the shares, and may credit distributions in respect of
          the shares against their purchase price, until the services are performed, the
          benefits or property are received or the promissory note is paid. If the
          services are not performed, the benefits or property are not received or the
          promissory note is not paid, the corporation may cancel, in whole or in part,
          the shares escrowed or restricted and the distributions credited. </FONT></P>

          <U>Implied Amendments</U>. Any action taken or authorized by the shareholders or
          by the Board of Directors, which would be inconsistent with the by-laws then in
          effect but is taken or authorized by affirmative vote of not less than the
          number of shares or the number of directors required to amend the by-laws so
          that the by-laws would be consistent with such action, shall be given the same
          effect as though the by-laws had been temporarily amended or suspended so far,
          but only so far, as is necessary to permit the specific action so taken or
          authorized. </FONT></P>
