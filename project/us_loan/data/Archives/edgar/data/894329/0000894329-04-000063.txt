_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for any
Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of
(i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits into
the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6), (ii) the
monthly servicing fee for this Series (see Item 12(b)),
(iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount(see Item 8(b)), and
(iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each
case for this Distribution Date.  For purposes of determining
Group Excess Spread, Series Excess Spread is the amount
calculated as described above minus the amount of any payment
by the Trust under the Trust's subordinated interest rate
swap for this series.  The Series Excess Spread Percentage is
equal to the Series Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve,
divided by the Series Investor Interest for this Series at
the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 15(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 15(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is equal to (a) the sum
of Finance Charge Collections, Yield Collections, Additional
Funds and any Investment Income for this Series (see Item 3(c)),
minus (b) the sum of (i) the product of (A) the Class Invested
Amount for such Distribution Date and (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Class A Weighted Average Certificate
for that Class, and the denominator of which is 360 divided by
the actual number of days from and including the immediately
preceding Distribution Date (or, in the case of the first
Distribution Date, from and including the Series Closing Date)
to but excluding the current Distribution Date, (ii) the
Investor Servicing Fee (see Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor
Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), (iv) the Credit
Enhancement Fee (see Item 13(d)), (v) the Monthly Commitment
Fees, (vi) the positive difference, if any, between MC Purchase
Account Interest and MC Purchase Account Investment Income, and
(vii) tax gross-up amounts, indemnification payments and
increased costs, if any, payable to the MC Purchasers under the
MC Purchase Agreement, in each case for this Distribution Date.
The Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series
Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series
Investor Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4)For purposes of allocations to investors, all recoveries
are treated as Finance Charge Collections and are included
as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for any
Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Subseries is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for any
Class of this Subseries (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of
(i) the monthly interest for this Subseries (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6), (ii) the
monthly servicing fee for this Subseries (see Item 12(b)),
(iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and
(iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each
case for this Distribution Date.  The Series Excess
Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess Spread,
multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Subseries at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Subseries is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for any
Class of this Subseries (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of
(i) the monthly interest for this Subseries (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6), (ii) the
monthly servicing fee for this Subseries (see Item 12(b)),
(iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and
(iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each
case for this Distribution Date.  The Series Excess
Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess Spread,
multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Subseries at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Subseries is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for any
Class of this Subseries (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of
(i) the monthly interest for this Subseries (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6), (ii) the
monthly servicing fee for this Subseries (see Item 12(b)),
(iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and
(iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each
case for this Distribution Date.  The Series Excess
Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess Spread,
multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Subseries at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Subseries is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for any
Class of this Subseries (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of
(i) the monthly interest for this Subseries (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6), (ii) the
monthly servicing fee for this Subseries (see Item 12(b)),
(iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and
(iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each
case for this Distribution Date.  The Series Excess
Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess Spread,
multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Subseries at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Subseries is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for any
Class of this Subseries (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of
(i) the monthly interest for this Subseries (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6), (ii) the
monthly servicing fee for this Subseries (see Item 12(b)),
(iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and
(iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each
case for this Distribution Date.  The Series Excess
Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess Spread,
multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Subseries at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.

_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the highest of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)), the Interchange
Subgroup Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) and the
Series Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(c)) in assessing
the current performance of the Trust and the Receivables.
If necessary, the Trust will use funds available from
series or subseries with positive Series Excess Spreads
to cover expenses (as detailed in note 4 below)for series
or subseries, if any, with negative Series Excess Spreads,
except that any such funds consisting of Interchange will
only be used to cover expenses for Interchange Series.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess
Spreads for each series, including each subseries, in
the Group.  The Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal
to the Group Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve,
divided by the Series Investor Interests at the
beginning of the period for each series, including each
subseries, in the Group.

(3) The Interchange Subgroup Excess Spread Percentage
is the sum of (i) all amounts deposited into the
Group Interchange Reallocation Account for all
Interchange Series and (ii) the Interchange Subgroup
Allocable Group Excess Spread (as such term is defined
in the Series Supplement between Discover Bank and
U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for
each series, including each subseries), multiplied by
twelve, divided by the Series Investor Interest for
all Interchange Series at the beginning of each period.

(4) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Investment Income, Series Interchange and
Additional Funds for any Class of this Series (see
Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of (i) the monthly interest
for this Series (see "Deposits into the SIFA on this
Distribution Date" in Item 6),  (ii) the monthly servicing
fee for this Series (see Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor
Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit
Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each case for
this Distribution Date.  For purposes of determining
Group Excess Spread and the Interchange Subgroup
Shortfall Allocation Percentage, Series Excess Spread
is the amount calculated as described above minus
(i) if the Series Excess Spread for such series is
positive without giving effect to clause (i) of
this sentence, the lesser of Series Interchange or
the amount determined as the Series Excess Spread
without giving effect to this sentence; provided that
Series Excess Spread, for purposes of determining the
Group Excess Spread and the Interchange Subgroup
Shortfall Allocation Percentage, shall not be reduced
below zero as a result of this sentence.  The Series
Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series
Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by
the Series Investor Interest for this Series at the
beginning of the period.

(5) For purposes of allocations to investors,
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3 above.
