_______________________________________
(1) Investors should refer only to the highest of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)), the Interchange
Subgroup Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) and the
Series Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(c)) in assessing
the current performance of the Trust and the Receivables.
If necessary, the Trust will use funds available from
series or subseries with positive Series Excess Spreads
to cover expenses (as detailed in note 4 below)for series
or subseries, if any, with negative Series Excess Spreads,
except that any such funds consisting of Interchange will
only be used to cover expenses for Interchange Series.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess
Spreads for each series, including each subseries, in
the Group.  The Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal
to the Group Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve,
divided by the Series Investor Interests at the
beginning of the period for each series, including each
subseries, in the Group.

(3) The Interchange Subgroup Excess Spread Percentage
is the sum of (i) all amounts deposited into the
Group Interchange Reallocation Account for all
Interchange Series and (ii) the Interchange Subgroup
Allocable Group Excess Spread (as such term is defined
in the Series Supplement between Discover Bank and
U.S. Bank National Association, as Trustee, for
each series, including each subseries), multiplied by
twelve, divided by the Series Investor Interest for
all Interchange Series at the beginning of each period.

(4) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Investment Income, Series Interchange and
Additional Funds for any Class of this Series (see
Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum of (i) the monthly interest
for this Series (see "Deposits into the SIFA on this
Distribution Date" in Item 6),  (ii) the monthly servicing
fee for this Series (see Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor
Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit
Enhancement Fee (see Item 14(d)), in each case for
this Distribution Date.  For purposes of determining
Group Excess Spread and the Interchange Subgroup
Shortfall Allocation Percentage, Series Excess Spread
is the amount calculated as described above minus
(i) if the Series Excess Spread for such series is
positive without giving effect to clause (i) of
this sentence, the lesser of Series Interchange or
the amount determined as the Series Excess Spread
without giving effect to this sentence; provided that
Series Excess Spread, for purposes of determining the
Group Excess Spread and the Interchange Subgroup
Shortfall Allocation Percentage, shall not be reduced
below zero as a result of this sentence.  The Series
Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series
Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by
the Series Investor Interest for this Series at the
beginning of the period.

(5) For purposes of allocations to investors,
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3 above.
