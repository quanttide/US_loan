(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 16(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 16(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is the difference
between (a) the sum of Finance Charge Collections, Yield
Collections, Additional Funds and Investment Income for
any Class of this Series (see Item 3(c)), and (b) the sum
of (i) the monthly interest for this Series (see 'Deposits
into the SIFA on this Distribution Date' in Item 6),
(ii) the monthly servicing fee for this Series (see
Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor Charged-Off Amount (see
Item 8(b)), and (iv) the Credit Enhancement Fee (see
Item 14(d)), in each case for this Distribution Date.  The
Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4) For purposes of allocations to investors, all
recoveries are treated as Finance Charge Collections
and are included as such in Item 3.
