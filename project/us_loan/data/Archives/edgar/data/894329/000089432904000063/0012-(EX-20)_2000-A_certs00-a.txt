(1) Investors should refer only to the higher of the Group
Excess Spread Percentage (Item 15(a)) and the Series Excess
Spread Percentage (Item 15(b)) in assessing the current
performance of the Trust and the Receivables.  If necessary,
the Trust will use funds available from series or subseries
with positive Series Excess Spreads to cover expenses (as
detailed in note 3 below) for series or subseries, if any,
with negative Series Excess Spreads.

(2) Group Excess Spread is the sum of the Series Excess Spreads
for each series, including each subseries, in the Group.  The
Group Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Group Excess
Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series Investor
Interests at the beginning of the period for each series,
including each subseries, in the Group.

(3) Series Excess Spread for this Series is equal to (a) the sum
of Finance Charge Collections, Yield Collections, Additional
Funds and any Investment Income for this Series (see Item 3(c)),
minus (b) the sum of (i) the product of (A) the Class Invested
Amount for such Distribution Date and (B) a fraction, the
numerator of which is the Class A Weighted Average Certificate
for that Class, and the denominator of which is 360 divided by
the actual number of days from and including the immediately
preceding Distribution Date (or, in the case of the first
Distribution Date, from and including the Series Closing Date)
to but excluding the current Distribution Date, (ii) the
Investor Servicing Fee (see Item 12(b)), (iii) the Investor
Charged-Off Amount (see Item 8(b)), (iv) the Credit
Enhancement Fee (see Item 13(d)), (v) the Monthly Commitment
Fees, (vi) the positive difference, if any, between MC Purchase
Account Interest and MC Purchase Account Investment Income, and
(vii) tax gross-up amounts, indemnification payments and
increased costs, if any, payable to the MC Purchasers under the
MC Purchase Agreement, in each case for this Distribution Date.
The Series Excess Spread Percentage is equal to the Series
Excess Spread, multiplied by twelve, divided by the Series
Investor Interest for this Series at the beginning of the period.

(4)For purposes of allocations to investors, all recoveries
are treated as Finance Charge Collections and are included
as such in Item 3.
