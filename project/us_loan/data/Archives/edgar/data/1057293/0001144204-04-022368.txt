ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

                       NEWBRIDGE DECEMBER 2004 FINANCING

On December 15, 2004, SmarTire Systems, Inc. ("we" or "SmarTire") closed on
a transaction pursuant to which we entered into a Subscription Agreement with
several accredited investors in which the investors agreed to lend a principal
amount of $195,000 to us in exchange for SmarTire's 5% convertible debentures.
We issued the convertible debentures to the investors pursuant to Rule 506 of
Regulation D as promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Act"), and/or Section 4(2) of the Act.

The convertible debentures shall pay 5% per annum simple interest in cash
semi-annually beginning six months from the date of the last closing of the
offering in arrears. They will mature 24 months from the date the investor's
funds were disbursed to SmarTire. The holders may convert, at their sole
discretion at any time, the principal amount of some or all of their convertible
debentures into shares of our common stock, par value $.001, at a conversion
price equal to the lesser of (i) 120% of the closing bid price of the common
stock as reported by Bloomberg, L.P. for the trading day immediately preceding
the date that the holder's funds representing the net amount due to SmarTire
from the purchase price of the offering is transmitted by wire transfer or
otherwise to or for the benefit of SmarTire, or (ii) 80% of the lowest closing
prices for the five (5) trading days preceding the date on which the notice of
conversion is sent via facsimile to SmarTire.

Upon providing 3 business days advance written notice to holders, during which
time they may elect to convert up to all of their convertible debentures, we may
redeem the convertible debentures, in whole or part, at 120% of the face value
of each convertible debenture and the investor shall receive 50,000 redemption
warrants for every $100,000 redeemed (the "Redemption Warrants"). The Redemption
Warrants are exercisable at 120% of the closing bid price on our common stock as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P. for the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. The Redemption Warrants will be exercisable until two (2) years
from the date of issuance.

In addition, pursuant to our Private Placement Memorandum dated as of October
15, 2004 we are obligated to file a registration statement that includes all the
shares of our common stock underlying the convertible debentures. If a
registration statement is not (i) filed within 30 days from our 2004 Annual
Meeting of Shareholders which was held on December 10, 2004 (ii) declared
effective within 120 days of filing or (iii) within 3 business days of receipt
by SmarTire of written or oral communication from the SEC that the registration
statement will not be reviewed or that the SEC has no further comments, or (iv)
the registration stated is filed and effective but thereafter ceases to be
effective (without being effected within 15 business days with a replacement or
amendment thereto), then the holders shall receive an amount equal to 1% for the
first 30 days or part thereof pending such non-registration event and 2% for
each 30 days or part thereof, of the purchase price of the convertible debenture
remaining unconverted and purchase price of shares issued upon conversion of the
convertible debenture owned by such holder.

Newbridge Securities Corporation acted as SmarTire's selling agent and received
a commission equal to 10% of the gross proceeds of the offering together with a
non-accountable expense allowance equal to 3% of the gross proceeds.

                CORNELL CAPITAL PARTNERS DECEMBER 2004 FINANCING

In addition, on December 15, 2004 we entered into a Securities Purchase
Agreement with Cornell Capital Partners, L.P., an accredited investor (the
"Investor"), in which the Investor agreed to lend a principal amount of
$2,500,000 to us in exchange for SmarTire's 5% convertible debenture. We issued
the convertible debenture to the Investor pursuant to Rule 506 of Regulation D
as promulgated under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and/or
Section 4(2) of the Act.

The convertible debentures shall pay interest at 5% per annum (computed on the
basis of a 365-day year and the actual days elapsed) from the date of this
convertible debenture until paid in full. The convertible debenture will mature
on December 15, 2007. The holders may convert, at their sole discretion at any
time, the principal amount of some or all of their convertible debentures into
shares of our common stock, par value $.001, at a conversion price equal to the
lesser of (i) 120% of the closing bid price of the common stock as reported by
Bloomberg, L.P. as of December 15, 2004, or (ii) 80% of the lowest closing
prices for the five (5) trading days preceding the date on which the notice of
conversion is sent via facsimile to SmarTire.

Upon providing 3 business days advance written notice to holders, during which
time they may elect to convert up to all of their convertible debentures, we may
redeem the convertible debentures, in whole or part, at 120% of the face value
of each convertible debenture and the investor shall receive 50,000 redemption
warrants for every $100,000 redeemed (the "Redemption Warrants"). The Redemption
Warrants are exercisable at 120% of the closing bid price on our common stock as
reported by Bloomberg, L.P. for the trading day immediately preceding the
Closing Date. The Redemption Warrants will be exercisable until two (2) years
from the date of issuance.

In addition, on December 15, 2004 we entered into a Registration Rights
Agreement with the Investor under which we have agreed to file a registration
statement for the purpose of registering 250,000,000 shares of common stock
potentially issuable upon the conversion of principal and interest, or in
payment of interest, under the 5% convertible debentures at the base conversion
price, and at least 200% of the shares of common stock potentially issuable upon
exercise of the warrants at the base exercise price.

If we default on our obligations under the Registration Rights Agreement,
including our agreement to file the registration statement with the Securities
and Exchange Commission no later than 30 days after December 15, 2004 (or to
file a request for acceleration in accordance with Rule 461 under the Securities
Act of 1933 within five trading days of the date that we are notified by the
Securities and Exchange Commission that the registration statement will not be
"reviewed" or will not subject to further review), or if the registration
statement is not declared effective by 90 days after December 15, 2004, we are
required pay to each debenture holder, as liquidated damages and not as a
penalty, for each month that the registration statement has not been filed or
declared effective, as the case may be, either a cash amount or shares of our
common stock within three (3) business days, after demand therefore, equal to 2%
of the liquidated value of the convertible debentures outstanding.

Out of SmarTire's gross proceeds which was received pursuant to this financing,
we paid an aggregate amount of $1,100,462.24 to the Investor in payment of
certain promissory notes previously issued by SmarTire to the Investor.

ITEM 2.03 CREATION OF A DIRECT FINANCIAL OBLIGATION.

         See Item 1.01 above.

ITEM 3.02 UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

Our board of directors adopted SmarTire's 2004 Non-US Stock Incentive Plan
effective as of December 17, 2004 (the "Plan") which by its terms will continue
in effect for a term of ten (10) years unless sooner terminated. The maximum
aggregate number of shares of our common stock which may be issued pursuant to
all awards (including options) is 50,000,000. The Plan permits SmarTire to grant
awards to eligible employees who are not residents of the United States and/or
not subject to taxation in the United States, including individuals who are an
officer, a director, an employee or a consultant of SmarTire, although awards
may be granted to other eligible employees.

Awards granted pursuant to the Plan involves or may involve the issuance of: (i)
shares of our common stock, (ii) an option, (iii) a SAR or similar right with a
fixed or variable price related to the fair market value of our common stock and
with an exercise or conversion privilege related to the passage of time, the
occurrence of one or more events, or the satisfaction of performance criteria or
other conditions, or (iv) any other security with the value derived from the
value of our common stock. Such awards include, without limitation, options,
SARs, sales or bonuses of restricted stock, performance units or performance
shares, and an award may consist of one such security or benefit, or 2 or more
of them in any combination or alternative.

Any award granted under the Plan shall be exercisable at such times and under
such conditions as determined by the Plan administrator under the terms of the
Plan and specified in an Award Agreement with the officer, director, employee or
consultant of SmarTire. An award shall be deemed to be exercised when written
notice of such exercise has been given to US in accordance with the terms of the
award by the person entitled to exercise the award and full payment for our
common stock with respect to which the award is received by SmarTire. Shares of
our common stock shall not be issued pursuant to the exercise of an award unless
such exercise and the issuance and delivery of such common stock pursuant
thereto shall comply with all applicable laws, and shall be further subject to
the approval of counsel for SmarTire with respect to such compliance.

<PAGE>

We began issuing awards to our eligible employees on December 20, 2004.

In addition, see Item 1.01 above.

ITEM 5.03 AMENDMENTS TO ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION OR BYLAWS; CHANGE IN FISCAL
YEAR

Effective as of December 10, 2004, SmarTire filed a Certificate of Amendment to
its Articles of Incorporation in the Yukon Territory to increase its number of
authorized shares of common stock, par value $.001, from 300,000,000 shares to
an unlimited number of shares. An affirmative vote of a majority of the
outstanding shares of common stock present and voting, in person or by proxy, at
our 2004 Annual Meeting of Shareholders which was held on December 10, 2004,
approved of said amendment. In addition, at the annual meeting, our shareholders

                  a. The  Subscriber  understands  the  business  in  which  the
Corporation  will be engaged and has such  knowledge and experience in financial
and business matters that he is capable of evaluating the merits and risks of an
investment in the  Corporation and making an informed  investment  decision with
respect thereto. He has obtained  sufficient  information to evaluate the merits

                  b. The  Subscriber  and his  attorneys,  investment  advisors,
business  advisors,  tax advisors and accountants have had sufficient  access to
all  documents  and records  pertaining  to the  Corporation  and this  proposed
investment  in the  securities.  Additionally,  the  Subscriber  and  all of his
advisors  have  had  the  opportunity  to  ask  questions  and  receive  answers
concerning the terms and conditions of the offering and other matters pertaining
to  this  investment,   and  all  such  questions  have  been  answered  to  the
satisfaction of the Subscriber.  The Subscriber and all of his advisors have had
an  opportunity  to obtain  any  additional  information  which the  Corporation
possesses,  or can acquire without unreasonable effort or expense,  necessary to
verify the accuracy of the information furnished to the Subscriber, if any;

                  c. The  Subscriber (i) has adequate means of providing for his
current needs and possible  personal  contingencies  and those of his family, if
applicable,  in the same  manner as he would have been able to provide  prior to
making the investment in the securities,  (ii) has no need for liquidity in this
investment,  (iii) is aware of and able to bear the risks of this investment for
an  indefinite  period of time and (iv) is  presently  able to afford a complete

                  d.  The  Subscriber  recognizes  that  an  investment  in  the
securities  involves  significant  risks,  including,  without  limitation,  the
potential loss of the Subscriber's entire investment;

                  e. The Subscriber understands that none of the securities have
been  registered  under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the  "Securities
Act"), or the securities laws of any state in reliance upon exemptions therefrom
for private  offerings.  The Subscriber  understands that the securities must be
held indefinitely  unless the sale thereof is subsequently  registered under the
Securities  Act and applicable  state  securities  laws or exemptions  from such
registration  are  available.   All  certificates  evidencing  the  Subscriber's
ownership of the securities  will bear a legend stating that the securities have
not been registered  under the Securities Act or state  securities laws and they
may not be  resold  unless  they are  registered  under the  Securities  Act and
applicable state securities laws or exempt therefrom.

                  f.  The  securities  are  being   purchased   solely  for  the
Subscriber's  account for investment and not for the account of any other person
and not with a view to or for  distribution,  assignment or resale in connection
with any  distribution  within the meaning of the  Securities  Act, and no other
person has a direct or  indirect  beneficial  interest in such  securities.  The
Subscriber  represents  that he has no agreement,  understanding,  commitment or
other arrangement with any person and no present intention to sell,  transfer or
assign any securities;

                  g. The Subscriber  realizes that he may not be able to sell or
dispose  of any of the  securities  and that no  market of any kind  (public  or
private) may be available for any of the securities. In addition, the Subscriber
understands  that his  right to  transfer  the  securities  will be  subject  to
restrictions contained in applicable Federal and state securities laws;

                  h. All  information  which the  Subscriber has provided to the
Corporation  concerning  himself,  his  financial  position and his knowledge of
financial  and business  matters,  including all  information  contained in this
Subscription  Agreement, is correct and complete as of the date set forth on the
signature  page  hereof,  and if there  should  be any  adverse  change  in such
information  prior  to his  subscription  being  accepted,  he will  immediately
provide the Corporation with such information;

                  i. The Subscriber's  principal  residence (if subscriber is an
individual) or principal  business  address,  as applicable,  is in the State of
_______________,  and the  Subscriber  has no  present  intention  to move  such
residence or principal business address, as applicable, from such State;

                  j. Neither the  Subscriber nor any of his advisors are relying
on any financial  projections in connection  with  determining  the merits of an
investment in the securities.  The Subscriber  understands and acknowledges that
no   representations   concerning  the  accuracy  of  information  or  financial
projections,  if  any,  are  being  made  and he and  all of his  advisors  have
completely  disregarded  such information or financial  projections,  if any, in
determining whether to invest in the securities;


                                       3

                  k. The Subscriber  understands that the Corporation may at any
time,  in its sole  discretion,  arrange  for the offer  and sale of  additional
shares of its  capital  stock to current  or  additional  shareholders,  at such
prices and in such amounts as it, in its sole discretion, may determine to be in
the best interests of the Corporation;

                  l. The  Subscriber is unaware of, is in no way relying on, and
did not become  aware of the offering of the  securities  through or as a result
of, any form of general solicitation or general advertising,  including, without
limitation, any article, notice,  advertisement or other communication published
in any  newspaper,  magazine or similar  media or broadcast  over  television or
radio,  in connection  with the offering and sale of the  securities  and is not
subscribing  for  securities  and did not become  aware of the  offering  of the
securities  through  or as a result  of any  seminar  or  meeting  to which  the
Subscriber was invited by, or any  solicitation  of a subscription  by, a person
not  previously  known to the  Subscriber  in  connection  with  investments  in
securities generally;

                  m. The Subscriber has taken no action which would give rise to
any claim by any person for  brokerage  commissions,  finders'  fees or the like
relating to this Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby; and

                  n. The Subscriber has significant prior investment experience,
including  investment  in  securities  traded on the  Over-the-Counter  Bulletin
Board.  The  Subscriber is  knowledgeable  about  investment  considerations  in
development  stage  companies.   The  investment  is  a  suitable  one  for  the
Subscriber.

         5. The  Subscriber  understands  and agrees that this  subscription  is
subject to the following terms and conditions:

                  a. This  subscription  is  irrevocable  and the  execution and
delivery  of this  Agreement  will  not  constitute  an  agreement  between  the
Subscriber  and the  Corporation  until this  Agreement has been accepted by the
Corporation;

                  b.  The  Corporation  can,  in it sole  discretion,  reject  a
subscription  as  soon  as  practicable   after  receipt  of  the   Subscriber's
subscription.  The Subscriber will be promptly notified by the Corporation as to
whether his subscription has been accepted. If the Subscriber's  subscription is
not  accepted,  his check or wire  transfer  amount  (less any  applicable  bank
charges) will be returned  promptly and all of his  obligations  hereunder shall
terminate; and

                  c. This subscription is not transferable or assignable, either

issuable on account of this subscription will only be issued in the name of, and
delivered to, the Subscriber.

         6.  The   representations,   warranties  and  agreements  made  by  the
Subscriber herein have been made with the intent that they be relied upon by the
Corporation for purposes of the Offering.  The Subscriber  further undertakes to

                        5% SECURED CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE

$________                                                      December 15, 2004

         FOR  VALUE  RECEIVED,   SMARTIRE  SYSTEMS,   INC.,  a  Yukon  Territory
corporation (the "Company"), hereby promises to pay to ____________________ (the
"Holder") having an address at _______________________, two years after the date
hereof,  or earlier upon  prepayment of this Debenture as provided  herein,  the
principal sum of  _______________  Dollars  ($__________),  together with simple
interest  (computed on the basis of a 360-day year of twelve  30-day  months) on
the unpaid balance at the rate of five percent (5%) per annum  beginning six (6)

<PAGE>

months from the date of the last closing of this  Offering in arrears  until the
principal hereof shall have been paid.

         The Company shall pay interest  semi-annually in arrears  beginning six
(6) months from the date of the last  closing of this  Offering and the last day
of every  subsequent  sixth  (6)  month of each  year  that any  portion  of the
principal balance is unpaid.

         All payments of principal  and interest  shall be made to the Holder in
lawful  currency of the United  States of America to the address set forth above
or such other address as to which the Holder shall notify the Company in writing
ten (10) days  prior to the due date of any  payment or upon any  prepayment  of
this Debenture as provided herein.

         Subject to and in compliance  with the  provisions  hereof,  the Holder
may, at its option,  convert  all or any  portion of the  outstanding  principal
balance of this Debenture, and all or any portion of the interest accrued hereon
to such date,  into shares of common stock of the  Company,  par value $.01 (the
"Common  Stock") at a conversion  price (the  "Conversion  Price")  equal to the
lesser of 80% of the lowest closing prices of the Common Stock for the 5 trading
days  preceding the date on which the notice of conversion is sent via facsimile
to the Company or 120% of the closing bid price of the Common  Stock as reported
by Bloomberg,  L.P. for the OTC Bulletin  Board for the trading day  immediately
preceding  the date that the  Holder's  funds are  released  from  escrow by the
escrow agent to the Company.  The Holder hereof shall  communicate its intention
to convert all or any portion of the principal  amount of this Debenture and all
or any portion of interest  accrued through such conversion date by surrendering
this  Debenture,  with the Form of Notice of  Election  to Convert  attached  as
EXHIBIT "A" hereto duly completed and signed,  to the Company at its address for
notice set forth elsewhere herein.

         The  Holder  shall  not be  entitled  to  convert  such  amount  of the
Debenture in  connection  with such number of shares of Common Stock which would
be in excess of the sum of (i) the number of shares of Common Stock beneficially
owned by the Holder and its affiliates on a conversion date, and (ii) the number
of shares of Common Stock  issuable upon the  conversion of the Debenture  which
would result in  beneficial  ownership by the Holder and its  affiliates of more
than  4.99% of the  outstanding  shares of common  stock of the  Company on such
conversion date. For purposes of the preceding  sentence,  beneficial  ownership
shall be  determined  in accordance  with Section  13(d) of the  Securities  and
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  and Regulation 13d-3  thereunder.  Subject to
the foregoing,  the Holder shall not be limited to aggregate conversions of only
4.99% and aggregate  conversions by the Holder may exceed 4.99%.  The Holder may
void the  conversion  limitation  described in this paragraph upon and effective
after 61 days prior written notice to the Company. The Holder may allocate which
of the equity of the Company  deemed  beneficially  owned by the Holder shall be
included in the 4.99%  amount  described  in this  paragraph  and which shall be
allocated to the excess above 4.99%.

         The  Company  may,  at its  option,  redeem  all or any  portion of the
Debentures with 3 business days advanced notice.

         If the Holder elects to convert less than the entire  principal  amount
of this  Debenture  and  interest  accrued to the date of such  conversion,  the
Company  shall issue or cause to be issued and  delivered to the Holder,  at its


                                       2
<PAGE>

expense,  a new Debenture  evidencing  the  outstanding  amount of principal due
hereunder  after giving effect to the amount  applied to the  conversion,  which
such Debenture shall, except as to the principal amount thereof, be identical to
this Debenture in all respects.

         If the Company,  at any time while this Debenture is outstanding  shall
(a) pay a stock dividend or otherwise make a distribution  or  distributions  on
shares of its Common Stock or any other equity or equity  equivalent  securities
payable in shares of Common Stock,  (b) subdivide  outstanding  shares of Common
Stock into a larger number of shares,  (c) combine  (including by way of reverse
stock split) outstanding shares of Common Stock into a smaller number of shares,
or (d) issue by  reclassification  of shares of the  Common  Stock any shares of
capital  stock of the Company,  then the  Conversion  Price shall be adjusted to
offset any of the  aforementioned.  Any adjustment made pursuant to this Section
shall become effective  immediately  after the record date for the determination
of  stockholders  entitled to receive such  dividend or  distribution  and shall
become  effective  immediately  after  the  effective  date  in  the  case  of a
subdivision, combination or re-classification.

         If the  Company  shall  (i)  fail to make a  payment  of  principal  or
interest  when due; or (ii) make an  assignment  for the  benefit of  creditors,
files a petition in bankruptcy, be adjudicated insolvent or bankrupt, suffers an
order for relief  under any  federal  bankruptcy  law,  petition or apply to any
tribunal for the  appointment  of a  custodian,  receiver or any trustee for the
Company or any substantial part of its assets,  or (iii) commence any proceeding
under  any  bankruptcy,  reorganization,   arrangement,  readjustment  of  debt,
dissolution or  liquidation  law or statue of any  jurisdiction,  whether now or
hereafter in effect;  or (iv) have been filed any such petition or  application,
or any such  proceeding  shall have been  commenced  against the Company,  which
remains  undismissed,  unstayed or unbonded  for a period of thirty (30) days or
more;  or (v) by any act or  omission  shall  indicate  consent  to,  approve or
acquiescence in any such petition,  application or proceeding or the appointment
of a custodian,  receiver or any trustee for all or any substantial  part of its
properties,  or (vi) allow such custodianship,  receivership,  or trusteeship to
continue undischarged,  unstayed or unbonded for a period of thirty (30) days or
more, or (vii) violate any term or provision of this  Debenture  then and in any
such event, the outstanding  principal  amount of this Debenture,  together with
all accrued and unpaid interest thereon, shall be and become immediately due and
payable.

         All notices and other communications  provided for herein shall be sent
by certified mail,  return receipt  requested,  or by personal  delivery or by a
nationally  recognized  overnight courier to the Holder or the Company, at their
respective  addresses as set forth herein,  or to such other address as to which
either  party  may  advise  the other by notice  given in  accordance  with this
provision. All such notices shall be deemed given upon the earlier of receipt or
within five (5) business days of mailing if receipt is refused.

         Notwithstanding  any other provision of this Debenture,  interest under
this  Debenture  shall not exceed the maximum rate  permitted by law; and if any
amount is paid under this  Debenture as interest in excess of such maximum rate,
then the  amount so paid will not  constitute  interest  but will  constitute  a
prepayment on account of the principal amount of this Debenture.  If at any time
the  interest  rate under this  Debenture  would,  but for the  provision of the


                                       3
<PAGE>

preceding  sentence,  exceed  the  maximum  rate  permitted  by  law,  then  the
outstanding  principal  balance of this Debenture shall, on demand by the Holder
of this Debenture, become and be due and payable.

         All payments under this Debenture  shall be made without  deduction for
any taxes of any nature now or hereafter imposed.

         The  provisions  of this  Debenture  shall in all respects be construed
according to, and the rights and  liabilities of the parties hereto and shall in
all respects be governed by, the laws of the Province of British Columbia.  This
Debenture  shall be deemed a  contract  made under the laws of the  Province  of
British  Columbia  to be  fully  performed  therein,  and the  validity  of this
Debenture and all rights and liabilities hereunder shall be determined under the
laws of said  Province  without  reference to the  conflicts of laws  provisions
thereof.  For purposes of any proceeding  involving this Debenture,  the Company
and the Holder hereby submit to the exclusive  jurisdiction of the courts of the
Province of British Columbia and of Canada having jurisdiction, and agree not to
raise and waive any  objection  to or  defense  based upon the venue of any such
court or based upon forum non conveniens.

         In the event this  Debenture  is placed in the hands of an attorney for
collection or for enforcement or protection of the security, or if Holder incurs
any costs incident to the collection of the indebtedness evidenced hereby or the
enforcement  or protection of the security,  the Company agrees to pay to Holder
all reasonable  attorneys'  fees so incurred,  all court and other costs and the
reasonable costs of any other collection  efforts,  including all costs incurred
in collecting  any judgment and in any appellate or bankruptcy  proceeding.  The
Company agrees to pay any  documentary  stamp taxes,  intangible  taxes or other
taxes which may now or hereafter  apply to this Debenture or any payment made in
respect of this Debenture.

         No delay or omission  on the part of the Holder in the  exercise of any
right  hereunder  shall  operate as a waiver of such right or of any other right
under this Debenture. A waiver by the Holder of any right or remedy conferred to
it hereunder  on any one occasion  shall not be construed as a bar to, or waiver
of, any such right and/or remedy as to any future occasion.  The Company and all
persons now or hereafter  becoming obligated or liable for the payment hereof do
jointly and severally waive demand,  notice of non-payment,  protest,  notice of
dishonor and presentment.  No failure to accelerate the  indebtedness  evidenced
hereby by reason of default hereunder,  acceptance of a past-due  installment or
other indulgences granted from time to time, shall be construed as a novation of
this Debenture or as a waiver of such right of  acceleration  or of the right of
the Holder  thereafter to insist upon strict  compliance  with the terms of this
Debenture or to prevent the exercise of such right of  acceleration or any other
right granted hereunder or by applicable law.

         This Debenture may be amended only by a written instrument  executed by
the Company and the Holder.

         THE COMPANY HEREBY KNOWINGLY,  VOLUNTARILY AND INTENTIONALLY WAIVES THE
RIGHT WHICH IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY OF ANY CLAIM, DEMAND, ACTION OR CAUSE
OF ACTION BASED HEREON,  OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER OR IN ANY WAY  CONNECTED  WITH

THE WARRANT REPRESENTED BY THIS CERTIFICATE AND THE SECURITIES TO BE ISSUED UPON
ITS EXERCISE HAVE NOT BEEN REGISTERED UNDER THE UNITED STATES  SECURITIES ACT OF
1933 (THE  "SECURITIES  ACT") OR APPLICABLE  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS (THE "STATE

                               REDEMPTION WARRANT

WARRANT NO. ___________                            NUMBER OF SHARES:   _________

                             SMARTIRE SYSTEMS, INC.
                     COMMON STOCK, PAR VALUE $.001 PER SHARE

         This Warrant is issued to  ___________________  ("Holder")  by SmarTire
Systems,  Inc., a Yukon Territory  corporation  (hereinafter with its successors
called the "Company").

         For value received and subject to the terms and conditions  hereinafter
set out, in the event that the Company  exercises  its right of  redemption  for
either all or a portion of the outstanding 5% convertible  debentures which were
issued to the Holder  pursuant to a private  placement by the Company,  and upon
three (3) days advanced written notice to the Holder by the Company,  the Holder
shall receive for every $100,000  invested,  a warrant to purchase 50,000 shares
of common stock, par value $.001 per share ("Common Shares") of the Company. The
warrants  are  exercisable  at 120% of the  closing  bid price on the  Company's
common  stock as reported by  Bloomberg,  L.P.  for the trading day  immediately
preceding the date on which the notice of exercise is sent to the Company.  Such
exercise price per Common Share,  adjusted from time to time as provided herein,
is referred to as the "Exercise Price."

         1. The Holder may  exercise  this  Warrant,  in whole or in part,  upon
surrender of this Warrant,  with the exercise form annexed hereto duly executed,
at the office of the Company,  or such other office as the Company  shall notify
the Holder in writing, together with a certified or bank cashier's check payable
to the order of the Company in the amount of the Exercise Price times the number
of Common Shares being exercised.

         2. The  person  or  persons  in whose  name or  names  any  certificate
representing  Common Shares is issued  hereunder  shall be deemed to have become
the holder of record of the Common Shares represented thereby as of the close of
business on the date on which this  Warrant is  exercised  with  respect to such
shares,  whether or not the transfer books of the Company shall be closed. Until
such time as this Warrant is exercised or terminates, the Exercise Price payable


                                       1
<PAGE>

and the number and  character  of  securities  issuable  upon  exercise  of this
Warrant are subject to adjustment as hereinafter provided.

         3. Unless previously exercised,  this Warrant shall expire at 5:00 p.m.
Eastern Standard Time, two (2) years from the date of issuance and shall be void
thereafter or can be extended at the Company's discretion ("Expiration Date").

         4. The  Company  covenants  that it will at all times  reserve and keep
available a number of its  authorized  Common  Shares,  free from all preemptive
rights,  which will be sufficient  to permit the exercise of this  Warrant.  The
Company  further  covenants  that such  shares as may be issued  pursuant to the
exercise of this Warrant will, upon issuance,  be duly and validly issued, fully
paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens, and charges.

         5. If the Company subdivides its outstanding Common Shares, by split-up
or otherwise, or combines its outstanding Common Shares, the Exercise Price then
applicable to shares covered by this Warrant shall forthwith be  proportionately
decreased in the case of a subdivision, or proportionately increased in the case
of a combination.

         6. If (a) the Company reorganizes its capital, reclassifies its capital
stock,  consolidates or merges with or into another corporation (but only if the
Company is not the  surviving  corporation  and no longer has more than a single
shareholder) or sells,  transfers or otherwise  disposes of all or substantially
all its property,  assets, or business to another corporation,  and (b) pursuant
to the terms of such reorganization, reclassification, merger, consolidation, or
disposition  of assets,  shares of common  stock of the  successor  or acquiring
corporation,  or any cash,  shares of stock, or other  securities or property of
any nature  whatsoever  (including  warrants or other  subscription  or exercise
rights) in addition to or in lieu of common stock of the  successor or acquiring
corporation  ("Other  Property"),  are to be received by or  distributed  to the
holders of Common  Shares,  then (c) Holder shall have the right  thereafter  to
receive,  upon  exercise  of this  Warrant,  the same number of shares of common
stock of the successor or acquiring  corporation  and Other Property  receivable
upon  such   reorganization,   reclassification,   merger,   consolidation,   or
disposition  of assets as a holder of the number of Common Shares for which this
Warrant is  exercisable  immediately  prior to such  event.  At the time of such
reorganization,   reclassification,  merger,  consolidation  or  disposition  of
assets,  the successor or acquiring  corporation  shall expressly assume the due
and punctual observance and performance of each and every covenant and condition
of  this  Warrant  to be  performed  and  observed  by the  Company  and all the
obligations and liabilities  hereunder,  subject to such modifications as may be
deemed appropriate (as determined by resolution of the Board of Directors of the
Company)  in order to adjust  the  number of shares of the  common  stock of the
successor or acquiring  corporation for which this Warrant is  exercisable.  For
purposes  of  this  section,   "common  stock  of  the  successor  or  acquiring
corporation"  shall include stock of such  corporation of any class which is not
preferred  as to  dividends  or  assets  over any  other  class of stock of such
corporation  and which is not subject to  redemption  and shall also include any
evidences  of  indebtedness,  shares of  stock,  or other  securities  which are
convertible into or exchangeable for any such stock,  either immediately or upon
the arrival of a specified  date or the  happening of a specified  event and any
warrants  or other  rights to  subscribe  for or purchase  any such  stock.  The


                                       2
<PAGE>

foregoing  provisions  of this  section  shall  similarly  apply  to  successive
reorganizations,  reclassifications,  mergers, consolidations, or disposition of
assets.

         7. If a voluntary or involuntary dissolution, liquidation or winding up
of the Company (other than in connection with a merger or  consolidation  of the
Company) is at any time proposed  during the term of this  Warrant,  the Company
shall give written notice to the Holder at least thirty days prior to the record
date of the  proposed  transaction.  The notice shall  contain:  (1) the date on
which the  transaction  is to take place;  (2) the record date (which must be at
least  thirty  days after the giving of the  notice) as of which  holders of the
Common Shares entitled to receive  distributions  as a result of the transaction
shall be determined;  (3) a brief  description of the  transaction;  (4) a brief
description  of the  distributions,  if any, to be made to holders of the Common
Shares as a result of the  transaction;  and (5) an  estimate of the fair market
value of the  distributions.  On the  date of the  transaction,  if it  actually
occurs, this Warrant and all rights existing under this Warrant shall terminate.

         8. In no event  shall any  fractional  Common  Share of the  Company be
issued upon any exercise of this  Warrant.  If, upon exercise of this Warrant as
an entirety, the Holder would, except as provided in this Section 8, be entitled
to receive a  fractional  Common  Share,  then the Company  shall issue the next
higher number of full Common  Shares,  issuing a full share with respect to such
fractional  share.  If this  Warrant is  exercised at one time for less than the
maximum  number of Common  Shares  purchasable  upon the  exercise  hereof,  the
Company  shall  issue  to the  Holder  a new  warrant  of like  tenor  and  date
representing  the number of Common  Shares equal to the  difference  between the
number of shares  purchasable  upon full exercise of this Warrant and the number
of shares that were exercised upon the exercise of this Warrant.

         9. No adjustments  in the Exercise Price shall be required  unless such
adjustment  would require an increase or decrease of at least five cents in such
price,  provided however, that any adjustments which by reason of this Section 9
are not  required to be made shall be carried  forward and taken into account in
any subsequent adjustment.

         10. Whenever the Exercise Price is adjusted,  as herein  provided,  the
Company shall  promptly  deliver to the Holder a  certificate  setting forth the

         2. BUYER'S REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES.

         Each Buyer represents and warrants, severally and not jointly, that:

                  (a)   Investment   Purpose.   Each  Buyer  is  acquiring   the
Convertible Debentures and, upon conversion of Convertible Debentures, the Buyer
will  acquire  the  Conversion  Shares  then  issuable,  for its own account for
investment only and not with a view towards,  or for resale in connection  with,
the public sale or distribution thereof,  except pursuant to sales registered or
exempted   under  the  1933  Act;   provided,   however,   that  by  making  the
representations  herein,  such  Buyer  reserves  the  right  to  dispose  of the
Conversion  Shares at any time in  accordance  with or pursuant to an  effective
registration  statement,  filed  with the SEC in  accordance  with the  Investor


                                       2
<PAGE>

Registration   Rights  Agreement  of  even  date  herewith  (the   "Registration
Statement")  covering such Conversion Shares or an available exemption under the
1933 Act.

                  (b) Accredited  Investor Status.  Each Buyer is an "Accredited
Investor" as that term is defined in Rule 501(a)(3) of Regulation D.

                  (c) Reliance on Exemptions.  Each Buyer  understands  that the
Convertible  Debentures are being offered and sold to it in reliance on specific
exemptions from the registration requirements of United States federal and state
securities  laws and that the  Company  is  relying  in part  upon the truth and
accuracy of, and such Buyer's compliance with, the representations,  warranties,
agreements, acknowledgments and understandings of such Buyer set forth herein in
order to determine the  availability  of such  exemptions and the eligibility of
such Buyer to acquire such securities.

                  (d) Information.  Each Buyer and its advisors (and his or, its
counsel),  if any,  have  been  furnished  with all  materials  relating  to the
business,  finances  and  operations  of the Company and  information  he deemed
material to making an informed investment decision regarding his purchase of the
Convertible  Debentures and the Conversion Shares,  which have been requested by
such  Buyer.  Each  Buyer  and its  advisors,  if any,  have been  afforded  the
opportunity  to ask  questions of the Company and its  management.  Neither such
inquiries nor any other due diligence  investigations conducted by such Buyer or
its advisors,  if any, or its representatives shall modify, amend or affect such
Buyer's right to rely on the Company's  representations and warranties contained
in  Section  3  below.  Each  Buyer  understands  that  its  investment  in  the
Convertible Debentures and the Conversion Shares involves a high degree of risk.
Each Buyer is in a position regarding the Company, which, based upon employment,
family relationship or economic bargaining power, enabled and enables such Buyer
to obtain information from the Company in order to evaluate the merits and risks
of this investment. Each Buyer has sought such accounting, legal and tax advice,
as it has  considered  necessary to make an informed  investment  decision  with
respect to its  acquisition  of the  Convertible  Debentures  and the Conversion
Shares.

                  (e) No Governmental  Review.  Each Buyer  understands  that no
United States  federal or state agency or any other  government or  governmental
agency  has  passed  on  or  made  any  recommendation  or  endorsement  of  the
Convertible  Debentures or the Conversion Shares, or the fairness or suitability
of the investment in the Convertible  Debentures or the Conversion  Shares,  nor
have such authorities  passed upon or endorsed the merits of the offering of the
Convertible Debentures or the Conversion Shares.

                  (f) Transfer or Resale.  Each Buyer understands that except as
provided in the Investor  Registration  Rights  Agreement:  (i) the  Convertible
Debentures have not been and are not being  registered under the 1933 Act or any
state  securities  laws,  and may not be offered  for sale,  sold,  assigned  or
transferred  unless (A) subsequently  registered  thereunder,  or (B) such Buyer
shall have  delivered  to the  Company an opinion  of  counsel,  in a  generally
acceptable  form,  to the effect that such  securities  to be sold,  assigned or
transferred may be sold,  assigned or transferred  pursuant to an exemption from
such  registration  requirements;  (ii)  any  sale  of such  securities  made in
reliance on Rule 144 under the 1933 Act (or a  successor  rule  thereto)  ("Rule
144") may be made only in accordance with the terms of Rule 144 and further,  if


                                       3
<PAGE>

Rule 144 is not applicable, any resale of such securities under circumstances in
which the seller (or the person  through whom the sale is made) may be deemed to
be an  underwriter  (as  that  term is  defined  in the 1933  Act)  may  require
compliance  with  some  other  exemption  under  the 1933 Act or the  rules  and
regulations of the SEC  thereunder;  and (iii) neither the Company nor any other
person is under any obligation to register such securities under the 1933 Act or
any state  securities  laws or to comply  with the terms and  conditions  of any
exemption  thereunder.  The Company  reserves  the right to place stop  transfer
instructions against the shares and certificates for the Conversion Shares.

                  (g) Legends.  Each Buyer  understands that the certificates or
other instruments  representing the Convertible Debentures and or the Conversion
Shares shall bear a restrictive  legend in substantially the following form (and
a  stop  transfer   order  may  be  placed   against   transfer  of  such  stock
certificates):

                  THE SECURITIES  REPRESENTED BY THIS  CERTIFICATE HAVE NOT BEEN
                  REGISTERED  UNDER THE SECURITIES  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,  OR
                  APPLICABLE  STATE  SECURITIES  LAWS. THE SECURITIES  HAVE BEEN
                  ACQUIRED  SOLELY FOR  INVESTMENT  PURPOSES AND NOT WITH A VIEW
                  TOWARD  RESALE  AND  MAY  NOT  BE  OFFERED  FOR  SALE,   SOLD,
                  TRANSFERRED  OR  ASSIGNED  IN  THE  ABSENCE  OF  AN  EFFECTIVE
                  REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER THE SECURITIES
                  ACT OF 1933, AS AMENDED,  OR APPLICABLE STATE SECURITIES LAWS,
                  OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL, IN A GENERALLY ACCEPTABLE FORM, THAT
                  REGISTRATION  IS NOT  REQUIRED  UNDER  SAID ACT OR  APPLICABLE
                  STATE SECURITIES LAWS.

The  legend set forth  above  shall be removed  and the  Company  within two (2)
business days shall issue a certificate without such legend to the holder of the
Conversion  Shares upon which it is stamped,  if, unless  otherwise  required by
state securities laws, (i) in connection with a sale  transaction,  provided the
Conversion Shares are registered under the 1933 Act or (ii) in connection with a
sale  transaction,  after such holder  provides  the Company  with an opinion of
counsel,  which  opinion  shall be in form,  substance  and scope  customary for
opinions  of counsel in  comparable  transactions,  to the effect  that a public
sale,  assignment  or  transfer  of the  Conversion  Shares may be made  without
registration under the 1933 Act.

                  (h) Authorization,  Enforcement.  This Agreement has been duly
and validly authorized,  executed and delivered on behalf of such Buyer and is a
valid and binding  agreement of such Buyer  enforceable  in accordance  with its
terms,  except as such  enforceability  may be limited by general  principles of
equity  or  applicable  bankruptcy,  insolvency,   reorganization,   moratorium,
liquidation  and other  similar laws  relating to, or affecting  generally,  the
enforcement of applicable creditors' rights and remedies.

                  (i)  Receipt of  Documents.  Each Buyer and his or its counsel
has  received  and  read  in  their  entirety:   (i)  this  Agreement  and  each
representation,   warranty  and  covenant   set  forth   herein,   the  Investor
Registration  Rights  Agreement,  the  Escrow  Agreement,  and  the  Irrevocable
Transfer  Agent  Instructions;  (ii) all due  diligence  and  other  information
necessary  to verify the  accuracy  and  completeness  of such  representations,
warranties  and  covenants;  (iii) the Company's Form 10-KSB for the fiscal year
ended July 31, 2004; (iv) the Company's Form 10-QSB for the fiscal quarter ended
April 30,  2004 and (v) answers to all  questions  each Buyer  submitted  to the
Company regarding an investment in the Company; and each Buyer has relied on the
information  contained  therein and has not been furnished any other  documents,
literature, memorandum or prospectus.

                  (j) Due  Formation  of  Corporate  and  Other  Buyers.  If the
Buyer(s) is a  corporation,  trust,  partnership  or other entity that is not an
individual  person,  it has been  formed  and  validly  exists  and has not been
organized for the specific purpose of purchasing the Convertible  Debentures and
is not prohibited from doing so.

                  (k) No Legal Advice From the Company. Each Buyer acknowledges,
that it had the  opportunity  to  review  this  Agreement  and the  transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement with his or its own legal counsel and investment
and tax advisors.  Each Buyer is relying solely on such counsel and advisors and
not  on  any  statements  or  representations  of  the  Company  or  any  of its
representatives  or agents for legal,  tax or investment  advice with respect to
this  investment,  the  transactions  contemplated  by  this  Agreement  or  the
securities laws of any jurisdiction.

         3. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES OF THE COMPANY.

         The Company  represents and warrants to each of the Buyers that, except
as set forth in the SEC Documents (as defined herein):

                  (a)  Organization  and  Qualification.  The  Company  and  its
subsidiaries  are  corporations  duly  organized  and  validly  existing in good
standing under the laws of the jurisdiction in which they are incorporated,  and
have the requisite corporate power to own their properties and to carry on their
business as now being  conducted.  Each of the Company and its  subsidiaries  is
duly  qualified as a foreign  corporation to do business and is in good standing
in every  jurisdiction in which the nature of the business conducted by it makes
such  qualification  necessary,  except to the extent  that the failure to be so

the event that the Company's agency  relationship with the transfer agent should
be  terminated  for any reason  prior to a date which is two (2) years after the

shall  require that the new transfer  agent execute and agree to be bound by the
terms of the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions (as defined herein).

                  (l)  Restriction on Issuance of the Capital Stock.  So long as

prior written  consent of the Buyer(s),  issue or sell shares of Common Stock or
Preferred Stock (i) without  consideration or for a consideration per share less
than the Bid  Price of the  Common  Stock  determined  immediately  prior to its
issuance,  (ii) issue any  warrant,  option,  right,  contract,  call,  or other
security  instrument  granting the holder  thereof,  the right to acquire Common
Stock without consideration or for a consideration less than such Common Stock's
Bid Price value determined immediately prior to it's issuance,  (iii) enter into
any security  instrument  granting the holder a security interest in any and all
assets of the Company, or (iv) file any registration statement on Form S-8.

                  (m)  Registration  Statement.   The  Company  shall  file  the
Registration  Statement  with the SEC in accordance  with the terms set forth in
the Investor Registration Rights Agreement of even date herewith.

         5. TRANSFER AGENT INSTRUCTIONS.

         The Company shall issue the Irrevocable  Transfer Agent Instructions to
its transfer agent irrevocably appointing David Gonzalez,  Esq. as its agent for
purpose of having certificates issued, registered in the name of the Buyer(s) or
its respective  nominee(s),  for the Conversion Shares representing such amounts
of Convertible  Debentures as specified from time to time by the Buyer(s) to the
Company  upon  conversion  of the  Convertible  Debentures,  for  interest  owed
pursuant to the Convertible  Debenture,  and for any and all Liquidated  Damages
(as  this  term is  defined  in the  Investor  Registration  Rights  Agreement).
Yorkville  Advisors  Management,  LLC shall be paid a cash fee of Fifty  Dollars
($50) for every  occasion they act pursuant to the  Irrevocable  Transfer  Agent
Instructions.  The  Company  shall not change its  transfer  agent  without  the
express written  consent of the Buyer(s),  which may be withheld by the Buyer(s)
in its sole discretion. Prior to registration of the Conversion Shares under the
1933 Act, all such certificates  shall bear the restrictive  legend specified in
Section 2(g) of this Agreement.  The Company warrants that no instruction  other
than the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions  referred to in this Section 5,
and stop  transfer  instructions  to give effect to Section  2(g) hereof (in the
case of the  Conversion  Shares prior to  registration  of such shares under the
1933  Act)  will be given by the  Company  to its  transfer  agent  and that the
Conversion  Shares  shall  otherwise  be  freely  transferable  on the books and
records of the Company as and to the extent  provided in this  Agreement and the
Investor  Registration Rights Agreement.  Nothing in this Section 5 shall affect


                                       13
<PAGE>

in any way the Buyer's  obligations  and agreement to comply with all applicable
securities laws upon resale of Conversion  Shares.  If the Buyer(s) provides the
Company with an opinion of counsel,  in form, scope and substance  customary for
opinions of counsel in comparable  transactions to the effect that  registration
of a resale by the  Buyer(s)  of any of the  Conversion  Shares is not  required
under the 1933 Act, the Company  shall within two (2) business days instruct its
transfer  agent  to  issue  one or more  certificates  in such  name and in such
denominations as specified by the Buyer. The Company  acknowledges that a breach
by it of its obligations  hereunder will cause  irreparable harm to the Buyer by
vitiating  the  intent  and  purpose  of the  transaction  contemplated  hereby.
Accordingly, the Company acknowledges that the remedy at law for a breach of its
obligations  under this Section 5 will be inadequate and agrees, in the event of
a breach or threatened  breach by the Company of the  provisions of this Section
5, that the  Buyer(s)  shall be  entitled,  in addition  to all other  available
remedies,  to an  injunction  restraining  any  breach and  requiring  immediate
issuance  and  transfer,  without the  necessity  of showing  economic  loss and
without any bond or other security being required.

         6. CONDITIONS TO THE COMPANY'S OBLIGATION TO SELL.

         The  obligation  of  the  Company  hereunder  to  issue  and  sell  the
Convertible  Debentures  to  the  Buyer(s)  at the  Closing  is  subject  to the
satisfaction,  at  or  before  the  Closing  Date,  of  each  of  the  following

immediately  available U.S. funds pursuant to the wire instructions  provided by
the Company.

                  (c) The  representations  and warranties of the Buyer(s) shall
be true and correct in all material  respects as of the date when made and as of
the Closing  Date as though made at that time  (except for  representations  and
warranties  that  speak as of a  specific  date),  and the  Buyer(s)  shall have
performed,  satisfied and complied in all material  respects with the covenants,
agreements and conditions required by this Agreement to be performed,  satisfied
or complied with by the Buyer(s) at or prior to the Closing Date.

         7. CONDITIONS TO THE BUYER'S OBLIGATION TO PURCHASE.

                  (a) In consideration of the Buyer's  execution and delivery of
this  Agreement and  acquiring the  Convertible  Debentures  and the  Conversion
Shares  hereunder,  and in addition to all of the  Company's  other  obligations
under this  Agreement,  the Company  shall defend,  protect,  indemnify and hold
harmless the Buyer(s) and each other holder of the  Convertible  Debentures  and
the  Conversion  Shares,  and all of their  officers,  directors,  employees and
agents  (including,  without  limitation,  those retained in connection with the
transactions   contemplated  by  this  Agreement)   (collectively,   the  "Buyer
Indemnitees")  from and against any and all  actions,  causes of action,  suits,
claims, losses, costs, penalties, fees, liabilities and damages, and expenses in
connection  therewith  (irrespective  of whether any such Buyer  Indemnitee is a
party  to the  action  for  which  indemnification  hereunder  is  sought),  and
including  reasonable   attorneys'  fees  and  disbursements  (the  "Indemnified
Liabilities"),  incurred by the Buyer Indemnitees or any of them as a result of,
or arising  out of, or relating  to (a) any  misrepresentation  or breach of any
representation  or  warranty  made  by  the  Company  in  this  Agreement,   the
Convertible  Debentures  or the Investor  Registration  Rights  Agreement or any
other certificate,  instrument or document  contemplated hereby or thereby,  (b)

to be financed in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, with the proceeds of
the issuance of the Convertible  Debentures or the status of the Buyer or holder
of the Convertible  Debentures the Conversion  Shares, as a Buyer of Convertible
Debentures in the Company.  To the extent that the foregoing  undertaking by the

Liabilities, which is permissible under applicable law.

any of  them  as a  result  of,  or  arising  out  of,  or  relating  to (a) any

Buyer(s)  in this  Agreement,  instrument  or  document  contemplated  hereby or

Registration  Rights Agreement or any other certificate,  instrument or document
contemplated  hereby  or  thereby  executed  by the  Buyer,  or (c) any cause of
action,  suit or claim brought or made against such Company  Indemnitee based on
material  misrepresentations  or due to a material  breach and arising out of or

document  or  agreement   executed   pursuant  hereto  by  any  of  the  Company
Indemnities.  To the extent that the foregoing  undertaking by each Buyer may be
unenforceable for any reason, each Buyer shall make the maximum  contribution to
the payment and  satisfaction of each of the Indemnified  Liabilities,  which is

                     INVESTOR REGISTRATION RIGHTS AGREEMENT

         THIS  REGISTRATION  RIGHTS  AGREEMENT (this  "Agreement"),  dated as of
December 15, 2004, by and among SMARTIRE SYSTEMS,  INC., a corporation organized
and existing under the laws of the Yukon  Territory,  with its principal  office
located at Suite 150, 13151 Vanier Place,  Richmond,  British  Columbia V6V 2J1,
Canada (the "Company"),  and the undersigned  investors (each, an "Investor" and
collectively, the "Investors").

         WHEREAS:

         A. In connection  with the Securities  Purchase  Agreement by and among
the parties hereto of even date herewith (the "Securities Purchase  Agreement"),
the  Company has agreed,  upon the terms and  subject to the  conditions  of the
Securities  Purchase Agreement,  to issue and sell to the Investors  convertible
debentures (the "Convertible  Debentures")  which shall be convertible into that
number  of shares of the  Company's  common  stock,  no par value  (the  "Common
Stock"),  pursuant  to the terms of the  Securities  Purchase  Agreement  for an
aggregate purchase price of up to Two Million Five Hundred Thousand U.S. Dollars
($2,500,000).  Capitalized  terms not  defined  herein  shall  have the  meaning
ascribed to them in the Securities Purchase Agreement.

         B. To induce  the  Investors  to execute  and  deliver  the  Securities
Purchase  Agreement,  the  Company  has agreed to provide  certain  registration
rights  under  the  Securities  Act of  1933,  as  amended,  and the  rules  and
regulations  there under, or any similar successor  statute  (collectively,  the
"1933 Act"), and applicable state securities laws.

         NOW,  THEREFORE,  in  consideration  of the  premises  and  the  mutual
covenants  contained  herein  and other  good and  valuable  consideration,  the
receipt and  sufficiency of which are hereby  acknowledged,  the Company and the
Investors hereby agree as follows:

         1. DEFINITIONS.

         As used in this Agreement, the following terms shall have the following
meanings:

                  (a) "Person" means a corporation, a limited liability company,
an association,  a partnership,  an organization,  a business, an individual,  a
governmental or political subdivision thereof or a governmental agency.

                  (b) "Register,"  "registered," and  "registration"  refer to a
registration   effected  by  preparing  and  filing  one  or  more  Registration
Statements  (as defined  below) in compliance  with the 1933 Act and pursuant to
Rule 415  under  the 1933  Act or any  successor  rule  providing  for  offering
securities on a continuous or delayed basis ("Rule 415"), and the declaration or
ordering of effectiveness of such Registration Statement(s) by the United States
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC").

<PAGE>

                  (c) "Registrable  Securities" means the shares of Common Stock
issuable to Investors upon conversion of the Convertible  Debentures pursuant to
the Securities Purchase Agreement.

                  (d)  "Registration  Statement" means a registration  statement
under the 1933 Act which covers the Registrable Securities.

         2. REGISTRATION.

                  (a) Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, the
Company  shall  prepare  and file,  no later than thirty (30) days from the date
hereof (the "Scheduled Filing Deadline"),  with the SEC a registration statement
on Form S-1 or SB-2 (or, if the Company is then eligible, on Form S-3) under the
1933 Act (the "Initial  Registration  Statement") for the  registration  for the
resale by all  Investors who purchased  Convertible  Debentures  pursuant to the
Securities Purchase Agreement Two Hundred Fifty Million  (250,000,000) shares of
Common Stock  issuable upon  conversion  of the  Convertible  Debentures  issued
pursuant to the Securities  Purchase  Agreement and the Investor's  Shares.  The
Company shall cause the Registration  Statement to remain effective until all of
the  Registrable  Securities  have  been  sold.  Prior  to  the  filing  of  the
Registration  Statement  with the SEC, the Company  shall  furnish a copy of the
Initial  Registration  Statement to the  Investors for their review and comment.
The Investors shall furnish  comments on the Initial  Registration  Statement to
the  Company  within  twenty-four  (24) hours of the  receipt  thereof  from the
Company.

                  (b) Effectiveness of the Initial Registration  Statement.  The
Company  shall  use its  best  efforts  (i) to  have  the  Initial  Registration
Statement declared effective by the SEC no later than ninety (90) days after the
date hereof (the  "Scheduled  Effective  Deadline")  and (ii) to insure that the
Initial Registration Statement and any subsequent Registration Statement remains
in effect until all of the Registrable Securities have been sold, subject to the
terms  and  conditions  of this  Agreement.  It shall  be an  event  of  default
hereunder if the Initial  Registration  Statement is not filed by the  Scheduled
Filing  Deadline or declared  effective  by the SEC by the  Scheduled  Effective
Deadline.

                  (c)   Failure   to  File  or  Obtain   Effectiveness   of  the
Registration  Statement. In the event the Registration Statement is not filed by
the  Scheduled  Filing  Deadline or is not  declared  effective by the SEC on or
before the Scheduled Effective Date, or if after the Registration  Statement has
been  declared  effective  by the SEC,  sales  cannot  be made  pursuant  to the
Registration  Statement  (whether  because of a failure to keep the Registration
Statement  effective,  failure to disclose such  information as is necessary for
sales to be made  pursuant to the  Registration  Statement,  failure to register
sufficient  shares of Common Stock or otherwise)  then as partial relief for the
damages to any holder of  Registrable  Securities by reason of any such delay in
or reduction of its ability to sell the underlying shares of Common Stock (which
remedy shall not be exclusive  of any other  remedies at law or in equity),  the
Company will pay as liquidated damages (the "Liquidated Damages") to the holder,
at the holder's  option,  either a cash amount or shares of the Company's Common
Stock within  three (3) business  days,  after  demand  therefore,  equal to two
percent (2%) of the liquidated value of the Convertible  Debentures  outstanding
as Liquidated Damages for each thirty (30) day period after the Scheduled Filing
Deadline or the Scheduled Effective Date as the case may be.


                                       2
<PAGE>

                  (d) Liquidated  Damages.  The Company and the Investor  hereto
acknowledge  and agree that the sums payable under  subsection  2(c) above shall
constitute liquidated damages and not penalties and are in addition to all other
rights of the  Investor,  including  the right to call a  default.  The  parties
further acknowledge that (i) the amount of loss or damages likely to be incurred
is incapable or is difficult to precisely  estimate,  (ii) the amounts specified
in such  subsections  bear a reasonable  relationship to, and are not plainly or
grossly  disproportionate  to,  the  probable  loss  likely  to be  incurred  in
connection   with  any  failure  by  the  Company  to  obtain  or  maintain  the
effectiveness  of a  Registration  Statement,  (iii) one of the  reasons for the
Company  and the  Investor  reaching  an  agreement  as to such  amounts was the
uncertainty and cost of litigation regarding the question of actual damages, and
(iv) the Company and the Investor are  sophisticated  business  parties and have
been  represented by  sophisticated  and able legal counsel and negotiated  this
Agreement at arm's length.

         3. RELATED OBLIGATIONS.

                  (a)  The  Company  shall  keep  the   Registration   Statement
effective pursuant to Rule 415 at all times until the date on which the Investor
shall have sold all the  Registrable  Securities  covered  by such  Registration
Statement (the "Registration  Period"),  which Registration Statement (including
any amendments or supplements thereto and prospectuses  contained therein) shall
not contain any untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to state a material
fact required to be stated therein, or necessary to make the statements therein,
in light of the circumstances in which they were made, not misleading.

                  (b) The  Company  shall  prepare  and  file  with the SEC such
amendments   (including   post-effective   amendments)   and  supplements  to  a
Registration   Statement  and  the  prospectus  used  in  connection  with  such
Registration  Statement,  which  prospectus is to be filed  pursuant to Rule 424
promulgated  under the 1933 Act, as may be necessary  to keep such  Registration
Statement  effective at all times during the  Registration  Period,  and, during
such  period,  comply with the  provisions  of the 1933 Act with  respect to the
disposition  of all  Registrable  Securities  of the  Company  covered  by  such
Registration  Statement  until such time as all of such  Registrable  Securities
shall  have  been  disposed  of in  accordance  with  the  intended  methods  of
disposition by the seller or sellers  thereof as set forth in such  Registration
Statement. In the case of amendments and supplements to a Registration Statement
which are required to be filed pursuant to this Agreement (including pursuant to
this Section  3(b)) by reason of the  Company's  filing a report on Form 10-KSB,
Form 10-QSB or Form 8-K or any analogous  report under the  Securities  Exchange
Act of 1934,  as amended (the "1934 Act"),  the Company shall  incorporate  such
report by reference into the  Registration  Statement,  if applicable,  or shall
file such  amendments or  supplements  with the SEC on the same day on which the
1934 Act report is filed which created the  requirement for the Company to amend
or supplement the Registration Statement.

                  (c)  The  Company  shall   furnish  to  each  Investor   whose
Registrable  Securities  are  included in any  Registration  Statement,  without
charge,  (i) at least one (1) copy of such  Registration  Statement  as declared
effective  by  the  SEC  and  any  amendment(s)  thereto,   including  financial
statements and schedules,  all documents incorporated therein by reference,  all
exhibits  and each  preliminary  prospectus,  (ii) ten (10)  copies of the final
prospectus  included  in such  Registration  Statement  and all  amendments  and
supplements  thereto  (or such  other  number  of copies  as such  Investor  may


                                       3
<PAGE>

reasonably  request)  and  (iii)  such  other  documents  as such  Investor  may
reasonably  request from time to time in order to facilitate the  disposition of
the Registrable Securities owned by such Investor.

                  (d) The Company shall use its best efforts to (i) register and
qualify the  Registrable  Securities  covered by a Registration  Statement under
such other  securities  or "blue sky" laws of such  jurisdictions  in the United
States as any  Investor  reasonably  requests,  (ii)  prepare  and file in those
jurisdictions,   such  amendments  (including  post-effective   amendments)  and
supplements  to such  registrations  and  qualifications  as may be necessary to
maintain the effectiveness  thereof during the Registration  Period,  (iii) take
such other  actions as may be  necessary  to  maintain  such  registrations  and
qualifications in effect at all times during the Registration  Period,  and (iv)
take all  other  actions  reasonably  necessary  or  advisable  to  qualify  the
Registrable Securities for sale in such jurisdictions;  provided,  however, that
the  Company  shall not be required in  connection  therewith  or as a condition
thereto to (w) make any change to its articles of incorporation or by-laws,  (x)
qualify to do  business  in any  jurisdiction  where it would not  otherwise  be
required to qualify but for this  Section  3(d),  (y) subject  itself to general
taxation in any such  jurisdiction,  or (z) file a general consent to service of
process  in any such  jurisdiction.  The  Company  shall  promptly  notify  each
Investor who holds  Registrable  Securities of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the registration or qualification
of any of the Registrable Securities for sale under the securities or "blue sky"
laws of any jurisdiction in the United States or its receipt of actual notice of
the initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

                  (e) As promptly as  practicable  after  becoming aware of such
event or  development,  the Company shall notify each Investor in writing of the
happening  of any  event  as a result  of which  the  prospectus  included  in a
Registration  Statement,  as then in effect,  includes an untrue  statement of a
material fact or omission to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein, in light of the circumstances under
which they were  made,  not  misleading  (provided  that in no event  shall such
notice  contain any material,  nonpublic  information),  and promptly  prepare a
supplement  or amendment to such  Registration  Statement to correct such untrue
statement  or  omission,  and  deliver  ten (10)  copies of such  supplement  or
amendment to each Investor. The Company shall also promptly notify each Investor
in writing (i) when a prospectus or any prospectus  supplement or post-effective
amendment   has  been  filed,   and  when  a   Registration   Statement  or  any
post-effective   amendment   has   become   effective   (notification   of  such
effectiveness  shall be delivered to each  Investor by facsimile on the same day
of such  effectiveness),  (ii) of any  request  by the  SEC  for  amendments  or
supplements  to a  Registration  Statement  or  related  prospectus  or  related
information,  and  (iii)  of  the  Company's  reasonable  determination  that  a
post-effective amendment to a Registration Statement would be appropriate.

                  (f) The  Company  shall use its best  efforts to  prevent  the
issuance  of  any  stop  order  or  other   suspension  of  effectiveness  of  a
Registration  Statement,  or the suspension of the  qualification  of any of the
Registrable  Securities for sale in any jurisdiction within the United States of
America and, if such an order or suspension is issued,  to obtain the withdrawal
of such order or suspension at the earliest  possible  moment and to notify each
Investor  who holds  Registrable  Securities  being sold of the issuance of such
order  and the  resolution  thereof  or its  receipt  of  actual  notice  of the
initiation or threat of any proceeding for such purpose.

                  (g) At the  reasonable  request of any  Investor,  the Company
shall  furnish  to  such  Investor,  on the  date  of the  effectiveness  of the
Registration  Statement  and  thereafter  from time to time on such  dates as an
Investor  may  reasonably  request  (i) a  letter,  dated  such  date,  from the
Company's  independent  certified public accountants in form and substance as is
customarily given by independent certified public accountants to underwriters in
an underwritten public offering,  and (ii) an opinion, dated as of such date, of
counsel representing the Company for purposes of such Registration Statement, in
form,  scope and substance as is  customarily  given in an  underwritten  public
offering, addressed to the Investors.

                  (h) The Company shall make available for inspection by (i) any
Investor and (ii) one (1) firm of  accountants  or other agents  retained by the
Investors  (collectively,  the "Inspectors")  all pertinent  financial and other
records,  and  pertinent  corporate  documents  and  properties  of the  Company
(collectively,  the "Records"),  as shall be reasonably deemed necessary by each
Inspector,  and cause the Company's officers,  directors and employees to supply
all information which any Inspector may reasonably request;  provided,  however,
that each Inspector  shall agree,  and each Investor  hereby agrees,  to hold in
strict  confidence and shall not make any disclosure  (except to an Investor) or
use any Record or other information  which the Company  determines in good faith
to be confidential,  and of which  determination the Inspectors are so notified,
unless (a) the  disclosure  of such  Records is  necessary to avoid or correct a
misstatement or omission in any Registration  Statement or is otherwise required
under the 1933 Act,  (b) the  release of such  Records is ordered  pursuant to a
final,  non-appealable  subpoena  or order  from a court or  government  body of
competent  jurisdiction,  or (c) the  information  in such Records has been made
generally  available to the public other than by disclosure in violation of this
or any other  agreement of which the Inspector  and the Investor has  knowledge.
Each  Investor  agrees that it shall,  upon  learning  that  disclosure  of such
Records  is  sought  in  or  by  a  court  or  governmental  body  of  competent
jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt notice to the Company and allow
the  Company,  at its  expense,  to  undertake  appropriate  action  to  prevent
disclosure  of,  or to  obtain  a  protective  order  for,  the  Records  deemed
confidential.

                  (i) The  Company  shall  hold in  confidence  and not make any
disclosure of information  concerning an Investor provided to the Company unless
(i) disclosure of such  information is necessary to comply with federal or state
securities  laws, (ii) the disclosure of such  information is necessary to avoid
or correct a misstatement or omission in any Registration  Statement,  (iii) the
release of such  information  is ordered  pursuant to a subpoena or other final,
non-appealable   order  from  a  court  or   governmental   body  of   competent
jurisdiction,  or (iv) such information has been made generally available to the
public other than by  disclosure  in  violation  of this  Agreement or any other
agreement.  The Company agrees that it shall,  upon learning that  disclosure of
such  information  concerning  an  Investor  is  sought  in  or  by a  court  or
governmental body of competent  jurisdiction or through other means, give prompt
written  notice to such  Investor  and allow such  Investor,  at the  Investor's
expense, to undertake  appropriate action to prevent disclosure of, or to obtain
a protective order for, such information.

                  (j) The Company shall use its best efforts either to cause all
the Registrable  Securities covered by a Registration Statement (i) to be listed
on each  securities  exchange  on which  securities  of the same class or series
issued  by the  Company  are  then  listed,  if  any,  if the  listing  of  such
Registrable  Securities  is then  permitted  under the rules of such exchange or
(ii) the  inclusion  for  quotation on the National  Association  of  Securities


                                       5
<PAGE>

Dealers,  Inc. OTC Bulletin Board for such Registrable  Securities.  The Company
shall pay all fees and expenses in connection  with  satisfying  its  obligation
under this Section 3(j).

                  (k) The Company  shall  cooperate  with the Investors who hold
Registrable  Securities  being  offered  and,  to  the  extent  applicable,   to
facilitate the timely  preparation and delivery of certificates (not bearing any
restrictive  legend)  representing  the  Registrable  Securities  to be  offered
pursuant to a Registration  Statement and enable such certificates to be in such
denominations  or amounts,  as the case may be, as the Investors may  reasonably
request and registered in such names as the Investors may request.

                  (l) The  Company  shall  use its best  efforts  to  cause  the
Registrable  Securities covered by the applicable  Registration  Statement to be
registered with or approved by such other  governmental  agencies or authorities
as  may  be  necessary  to  consummate  the  disposition  of  such   Registrable
Securities.

                  (m) The Company shall make generally available to its security
holders  as soon as  practical,  but not later than  ninety  (90) days after the
close of the period covered  thereby,  an earnings  statement (in form complying
with the provisions of Rule 158 under the 1933 Act) covering a twelve (12) month
period  beginning not later than the first day of the Company's  fiscal  quarter
next following the effective date of the Registration Statement.

                  (n) The Company shall otherwise use its best efforts to comply
with all  applicable  rules and  regulations  of the SEC in connection  with any
registration hereunder.

                  (o)  Within  two  (2)  business  days  after  a   Registration
Statement which covers Registrable  Securities is declared effective by the SEC,
the Company  shall  deliver,  and shall  cause legal  counsel for the Company to
deliver,  to the transfer agent for such Registrable  Securities (with copies to
the Investors  whose  Registrable  Securities are included in such  Registration
Statement)  confirmation  that such  Registration  Statement  has been  declared
effective by the SEC in the form attached hereto as Exhibit A.

                  (p) The  Company  shall  take  all  other  reasonable  actions
necessary to expedite and facilitate disposition by the Investors of Registrable
Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement.

         4. OBLIGATIONS OF THE INVESTORS.

         Each Investor  agrees that, upon receipt of any notice from the Company
of the happening of any event of the kind described in Section 3(f) or the first
sentence of 3(e),  such Investor will  immediately  discontinue  disposition  of
Registrable  Securities pursuant to any Registration  Statement(s) covering such
Registrable  Securities  until  such  Investor's  receipt  of the  copies of the
supplemented  or amended  prospectus  contemplated by Section 3(e) or receipt of
notice that no supplement or amendment is required.  Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary,  the Company shall cause its transfer agent to deliver  unlegended
certificates  for  shares of Common  Stock to a  transferee  of an  Investor  in
accordance  with the terms of the  Securities  Purchase  Agreement in connection
with any sale of  Registrable  Securities  with respect to which an Investor has
entered  into a contract  for sale prior to the  Investor's  receipt of a notice


                                       6
<PAGE>

from the Company of the happening of any event of the kind  described in Section
3(f) or the  first  sentence  of 3(e) and for  which  the  Investor  has not yet
settled.

         5. EXPENSES OF REGISTRATION.

         All expenses  incurred in  connection  with  registrations,  filings or
qualifications pursuant to Sections 2 and 3, including,  without limitation, all
registration,  listing and qualifications fees,  printers,  legal and accounting
fees shall be paid by the Company.

         6. INDEMNIFICATION.

         With  respect  to  Registrable  Securities  which  are  included  in  a
Registration Statement under this Agreement:

                  (a) To the fullest extent  permitted by law, the Company will,
and hereby  does,  indemnify,  hold  harmless  and  defend  each  Investor,  the
directors,  officers, partners, employees, agents,  representatives of, and each
Person,  if any, who controls any Investor within the meaning of the 1933 Act or
the 1934 Act (each,  an  "Indemnified  Person"),  against  any  losses,  claims,
damages,  liabilities,  judgments, fines, penalties,  charges, costs, reasonable
attorneys'  fees,  amounts  paid in  settlement  or  expenses,  joint or several
(collectively,  "Claims") incurred in investigating,  preparing or defending any
action, claim, suit, inquiry, proceeding, investigation or appeal taken from the
foregoing  by or  before  any  court or  governmental,  administrative  or other
regulatory  agency,  body or the SEC, whether pending or threatened,  whether or
not an indemnified party is or may be a party thereto  ("Indemnified  Damages"),
to which any of them may become  subject  insofar as such  Claims (or actions or
proceedings,  whether commenced or threatened,  in respect thereof) arise out of
or are based upon:  (i) any untrue  statement or alleged  untrue  statement of a
material  fact  in a  Registration  Statement  or any  post-effective  amendment
thereto  or in any  filing  made in  connection  with the  qualification  of the
offering  under the securities or other "blue sky" laws of any  jurisdiction  in
which Registrable Securities are offered ("Blue Sky Filing"), or the omission or
alleged  omission  to state a material  fact  required  to be stated  therein or
necessary  to make the  statements  therein  not  misleading;  (ii)  any  untrue
statement or alleged untrue  statement of a material fact contained in any final
prospectus  (as  amended or  supplemented,  if the Company  files any  amendment
thereof or supplement  thereto with the SEC) or the omission or alleged omission
to state  therein  any  material  fact  necessary  to make the  statements  made
therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which the statements therein were
made, not misleading; or (iii) any violation or alleged violation by the Company
of the 1933 Act, the 1934 Act, any other law, including, without limitation, any
state  securities  law, or any rule or  regulation  there under  relating to the
offer or sale of the Registrable Securities pursuant to a Registration Statement
(the matters in the  foregoing  clauses (i) through  (iii) being,  collectively,
"Violations").   The  Company  shall  reimburse  the  Investors  and  each  such
controlling  person  promptly  as such  expenses  are  incurred  and are due and
payable,  for any  legal  fees or  disbursements  or other  reasonable  expenses
incurred by them in connection with  investigating  or defending any such Claim.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the  indemnification
agreement  contained in this Section 6(a):  (x) shall not apply to a Claim by an
Indemnified  Person  arising  out of or based upon a Violation  which  occurs in
reliance upon and in  conformity  with  information  furnished in writing to the
Company by such  Indemnified  Person  expressly for use in  connection  with the
preparation  of the  Registration  Statement  or any such  amendment  thereof or


                                       7

supplement thereto; (y) shall not be available to the extent such Claim is based
on a  failure  of the  Investor  to  deliver  or to  cause to be  delivered  the
prospectus  made  available by the Company,  if such  prospectus was timely made
available by the Company  pursuant to Section  3(c);  and (z) shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such  settlement is effected  without
the  prior  written  consent  of  the  Company,   which  consent  shall  not  be
unreasonably  withheld.  Such  indemnity  shall  remain in full force and effect
regardless of any investigation  made by or on behalf of the Indemnified  Person
and shall  survive the transfer of the  Registrable  Securities by the Investors
pursuant to Section 9 hereof.

                  (b) In connection with a Registration Statement, each Investor
agrees to severally and not jointly indemnify,  hold harmless and defend, to the
same extent and in the same manner as is set forth in Section 6(a), the Company,
each of its  directors,  each of its officers,  employees,  representatives,  or
agents and each Person,  if any, who controls the Company  within the meaning of
the 1933 Act or the 1934 Act (each an "Indemnified Party"), against any Claim or
Indemnified Damages to which any of them may become subject, under the 1933 Act,
the 1934 Act or otherwise,  insofar as such Claim or  Indemnified  Damages arise
out of or is based upon any Violation,  in each case to the extent,  and only to
the extent,  that such Violation  occurs in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information  furnished to the Company by such Investor expressly for use
in connection with such  Registration  Statement;  and, subject to Section 6(d),
such Investor will reimburse any legal or other expenses  reasonably incurred by
them in connection  with  investigating  or defending any such Claim;  provided,
however,  that the  indemnity  agreement  contained in this Section 6(b) and the
agreement with respect to contribution contained in Section 7 shall not apply to
amounts paid in settlement of any Claim if such  settlement is effected  without
the  prior  written  consent  of  such  Investor,  which  consent  shall  not be
unreasonably withheld;  provided,  further,  however, that the Investor shall be
liable under this  Section  6(b) for only that amount of a Claim or  Indemnified
Damages as does not exceed the net proceeds to such  Investor as a result of the
sale of Registrable  Securities  pursuant to such Registration  Statement.  Such
indemnity shall remain in full force and effect  regardless of any investigation
made by or on behalf of such Indemnified Party and shall survive the transfer of
the   Registrable   Securities   by  the   Investors   pursuant  to  Section  9.
Notwithstanding  anything to the contrary contained herein, the  indemnification
agreement  contained in this Section 6(b) with respect to any  prospectus  shall
not inure to the benefit of any  Indemnified  Party if the untrue  statement  or
omission of material fact contained in the prospectus was corrected and such new
prospectus  was delivered to each Investor  prior to such  Investor's use of the
prospectus to which the Claim relates.

                  (c)  Promptly  after  receipt  by  an  Indemnified  Person  or
Indemnified  Party  under this  Section 6 of notice of the  commencement  of any
action or proceeding (including any governmental action or proceeding) involving
a Claim,  such  Indemnified  Person or  Indemnified  Party shall,  if a Claim in
respect thereof is to be made against any indemnifying  party under this Section
6,  deliver  to the  indemnifying  party a written  notice  of the  commencement
thereof, and the indemnifying party shall have the right to participate in, and,
to the  extent  the  indemnifying  party so  desires,  jointly  with  any  other
indemnifying party similarly  noticed,  to assume control of the defense thereof
with counsel mutually satisfactory to the indemnifying party and the Indemnified
Person or the Indemnified Party, as the case may be; provided,  however, that an
Indemnified  Person or Indemnified  Party shall have the right to retain its own
counsel  with the fees and  expenses  of not more than one (1)  counsel for such
Indemnified  Person or Indemnified  Party to be paid by the indemnifying  party,


                                       8
<PAGE>

if, in the reasonable opinion of counsel retained by the indemnifying party, the
representation  by such counsel of the Indemnified  Person or Indemnified  Party
and the  indemnifying  party would be  inappropriate  due to actual or potential
differing interests between such Indemnified Person or Indemnified Party and any
other party  represented  by such counsel in such  proceeding.  The  Indemnified
Party or Indemnified Person shall cooperate fully with the indemnifying party in
connection  with any  negotiation  or defense of any such action or claim by the
indemnifying  party and shall furnish to the indemnifying  party all information
reasonably  available  to the  Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person  which
relates  to such  action  or  claim.  The  indemnifying  party  shall  keep  the
Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person fully apprised at all times as to the
status of the defense or any settlement  negotiations  with respect thereto.  No
indemnifying  party shall be liable for any  settlement of any action,  claim or
proceeding effected without its prior written consent;  provided,  however, that
the indemnifying party shall not unreasonably  withhold,  delay or condition its
consent.  No indemnifying party shall,  without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person,  consent to entry of any judgment or
enter into any  settlement  or other  compromise  which  does not  include as an
unconditional  term  thereof  the giving by the  claimant or  plaintiff  to such
Indemnified  Party or  Indemnified  Person of a release  from all  liability  in
respect to such claim or litigation.  Following  indemnification as provided for
hereunder,  the  indemnifying  party  shall be  subrogated  to all rights of the
Indemnified Party or Indemnified Person with respect to all third parties, firms
or corporations  relating to the matter for which indemnification has been made.
The  failure  to  deliver  written  notice to the  indemnifying  party  within a
reasonable  time of the  commencement  of any such action shall not relieve such
indemnifying  party of any liability to the  Indemnified  Person or  Indemnified
Party under this Section 6, except to the extent that the indemnifying  party is
prejudiced in its ability to defend such action.

                  (d) The  indemnification  required by this  Section 6 shall be
made by  periodic  payments  of the  amount  thereof  during  the  course of the
investigation or defense,  as and when bills are received or Indemnified Damages
are incurred.

                  (e) The  indemnity  agreements  contained  herein  shall be in
addition to (i) any cause of action or similar right of the Indemnified Party or
Indemnified  Person  against  the  indemnifying  party or  others,  and (ii) any
liabilities the indemnifying party may be subject to pursuant to the law.

         7. CONTRIBUTION.

         To  the  extent  any   indemnification  by  an  indemnifying  party  is
prohibited or limited by law, the indemnifying  party agrees to make the maximum
contribution  with respect to any amounts for which it would otherwise be liable
under Section 6 to the fullest extent permitted by law; provided, however, that:
(i) no seller of Registrable  Securities guilty of fraudulent  misrepresentation
(within  the  meaning of Section  11(f) of the 1933 Act)  shall be  entitled  to
contribution  from any seller of  Registrable  Securities  who was not guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation; and (ii) contribution by any seller of Registrable
Securities shall be limited in amount to the net amount of proceeds  received by
such seller from the sale of such Registrable Securities.

         8. REPORTS UNDER THE 1934 ACT.

         With a view to making  available to the  Investors the benefits of Rule
144 promulgated  under the 1933 Act or any similar rule or regulation of the SEC
that may at any time permit the  Investors to sell  securities of the Company to
the public without registration ("Rule 144") the Company agrees to:

                  (a) make and keep public information available, as those terms
are understood and defined in Rule 144;

                  (b) file with the SEC in a timely manner all reports and other
documents required of the Company under the 1933 Act and the 1934 Act so long as
the Company  remains  subject to such  requirements  (it being  understood  that
nothing herein shall limit the Company's  obligations  under Section 4(c) of the
Securities  Purchase  Agreement)  and the  filing  of  such  reports  and  other
documents as are required by the applicable provisions of Rule 144; and

                  (c)  furnish to each  Investor so long as such  Investor  owns
Registrable  Securities,  promptly upon request,  (i) a written statement by the
Company that it has complied  with the reporting  requirements  of Rule 144, the
1933 Act and the 1934 Act,  (ii) a copy of the most recent  annual or  quarterly
report of the  Company  and such other  reports  and  documents  so filed by the
Company,  and (iii) such other  information  as may be  reasonably  requested to
permit  the  Investors  to sell such  securities  pursuant  to Rule 144  without
registration.

         9. AMENDMENT OF REGISTRATION RIGHTS.

         Provisions of this Agreement may be amended and the observance  thereof
may  be  waived  (either  generally  or  in a  particular  instance  and  either
retroactively  or  prospectively),  only with the written consent of the Company
and  Investors  who then  hold at  least  two-thirds  (2/3)  of the  Registrable
Securities.  Any amendment or waiver  effected in accordance with this Section 9
shall be binding upon each Investor and the Company.  No such amendment shall be
effective  to the extent that it applies to fewer than all of the holders of the
Registrable Securities.  No consideration shall be offered or paid to any Person
to amend or consent to a waiver or  modification of any provision of any of this
Agreement unless the same consideration also is offered to all of the parties to
this Agreement.

         10. MISCELLANEOUS.

                  (a)  A  Person  is  deemed  to  be  a  holder  of  Registrable
Securities  whenever  such  Person  owns  or is  deemed  to own of  record  such
Registrable  Securities.  If  the  Company  receives  conflicting  instructions,
notices  or  elections  from two (2) or more  Persons  with  respect to the same
Registrable  Securities,  the Company shall act upon the basis of  instructions,
notice  or  election  received  from the  registered  owner of such  Registrable
Securities.

                  (b) Any  notices,  consents,  waivers or other  communications
required or permitted to be given under the terms of this  Agreement  must be in
writing  and will be deemed  to have  been  delivered:  (i) upon  receipt,  when

                         FORM OF NOTICE OF EFFECTIVENESS
                            OF REGISTRATION STATEMENT

Attention:

         Re:  SMARTIRE SYSTEMS, INC.

Ladies and Gentlemen:

         We are counsel to SmarTire Systems,  Inc., a corporation  organized and
existing  under  the  laws of the  Yukon  Territory  (the  "Company"),  and have
represented  the Company in  connection  with that certain  Securities  Purchase
Agreement (the "Securities  Purchase  Agreement")  entered into by and among the
Company and the investors named therein (collectively, the "Investors") pursuant
to which the Company issued to the Investors  shares of its Common Stock, no par
value (the "Common Stock"). Pursuant to the Purchase Agreement, the Company also
has  entered  into a  Registration  Rights  Agreement  with the  Investors  (the
"Investor  Registration Rights Agreement") pursuant to which the Company agreed,
among other things,  to register the  Registrable  Securities (as defined in the
Registration Rights Agreement) under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"1933 Act"). In connection with the Company's obligations under the Registration
Rights  Agreement,  on  ____________  ____,  the  Company  filed a  Registration
Statement  on Form  ________  (File No.  333-_____________)  (the  "Registration
Statement")  with the  Securities  and Exchange SEC (the "SEC")  relating to the
Registrable   Securities  which  names  each  of  the  Investors  as  a  selling
stockholder there under.

         In connection  with the  foregoing,  we advise you that a member of the
SEC's  staff has  advised  us by  telephone  that the SEC has  entered  an order
declaring the Registration Statement effective under the 1933 Act at [ENTER TIME
OF  EFFECTIVENESS]  on [ENTER DATE OF  EFFECTIVENESS]  and we have no knowledge,
after  telephonic  inquiry of a member of the SEC's  staff,  that any stop order
suspending its  effectiveness  has been issued or that any  proceedings for that
purpose  are  pending  before,  or  threatened  by, the SEC and the  Registrable
Securities  are  available  for  resale  under  the  1933  Act  pursuant  to the
Registration Statement.

                                       Very truly yours,

                                       SICHENZIA ROSS FRIEDMAN FERENCE LLP

                                       By:

                            5% CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE

                                DECEMBER 15, 2007

No. CCP-1                                                        US$2,500,000.00

         This Convertible Debenture (the "Debenture") is issued on December ___,
2004 (the "Closing Date") by SmarTire Systems, Inc., a corporation organized and
existing  under the laws of the Yukon  Territory  (the  "Company"),  to  Cornell
Capital Partner, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (together with its permitted
successors and assigns,  the "Holder")  pursuant to exemptions from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

                                   ARTICLE I.

         SECTION 1.01 PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.  For value  received,  the Company
hereby  promises  to pay to the order of the  Holder on  December  ___,  2007 in
lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately  available funds
the   principal  sum  of  Two  Million  Five  Hundred   Thousand  U.S.   Dollars
(US$2,500,000), together with interest on the unpaid principal of this Debenture
at the rate of five  percent  (5%) per year  (computed on the basis of a 365-day
year and the actual days elapsed) from the date of this Debenture until paid. At
the Company's option, the entire principal amount and all accrued interest shall
be either (a) paid to the Holder on the third  (3rd) year  anniversary  from the
date hereof or (b)  converted in accordance  with Section 1.02 herein  provided,
however, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert this Debenture
for a number of shares  of  Common  Stock in excess of that  number of shares of
Common  Stock  which,  upon giving  effect to such  conversion,  would cause the

<PAGE>

aggregate number of shares of Common Stock  beneficially owned by the Holder and
its  affiliates  to exceed 4.99% of the  outstanding  shares of the Common Stock
following such conversion.

         SECTION  1.02  OPTIONAL  CONVERSION.  The  Holder is  entitled,  at its
option, to convert, and sell on the same day, at any time and from time to time,
until payment in full of this Debenture, all or any part of the principal amount
of the Debenture,  plus accrued interest,  into shares (the "Conversion Shares")
of the Company's common stock, no par value ("Common  Stock"),  at the price per
share (the "Conversion Price") equal to the lesser of (a) an amount equal to one
hundred  twenty  percent  (120%) of the closing bid price of the Common Stock as
listed on a Principal  Market (as defined  herein),  as quoted by Bloomberg L.P.
(the  "Fixed  Price") as of the date  hereof,  or (b) an amount  equal to eighty
percent (80%) of the lowest closing bid price of the Company's  Common Stock, as
quoted by Bloomberg, LP, for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the
Conversion  Date  (as  defined  herein).  Subparagraphs  (a) and (b)  above  are
individually  referred to as a "Conversion  Price".  As used herein,  "Principal
Market"  shall  mean The  National  Association  of  Securities  Dealers  Inc.'s
Over-The-Counter  Bulletin  Board,  Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market,  or American Stock
Exchange.  If the Common Stock is not traded on a Principal Market,  the Closing
Bid Price and/or the VWAP shall mean, the reported Closing Bid Price or the VWAP
for the Common  Stock,  as furnished by the National  Association  of Securities
Dealers,  Inc.,  for the  applicable  periods.  No  fraction  of shares or scrip
representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of
shares  issuable  shall be rounded to the nearest  whole share.  To convert this
Debenture, the Holder hereof shall deliver written notice thereof, substantially
in the form of Exhibit "A" to this Debenture,  with appropriate  insertions (the
"Conversion  Notice"),  to the Company at its address as set forth  herein.  The
date upon which the conversion shall be effective (the "Conversion  Date") shall
be deemed to be the date set forth in the Conversion Notice.

         SECTION 1.03 RESERVATION OF COMMON STOCK. The Company shall reserve and
keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely
for the purpose of effecting the  conversion of this  Debenture,  such number of
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be  sufficient  to effect such
conversion, based upon the Conversion Price. If at any time the Company does not
have a sufficient number of Conversion Shares authorized and available, then the
Company shall call and hold a special meeting of its stockholders  within thirty
(30)  days of that  time  for the sole  purpose  of  increasing  the  number  of
authorized shares of Common Stock.

         SECTION 1.04 RIGHT OF REDEMPTION.  The Company at its option shall have
the right to redeem,  with three (3) business days advance  written  notice (the
"Redemption Notice"), a portion or all outstanding  convertible  debenture.  The
redemption  price  shall be one  hundred  twenty  percent  (120%) of the  amount
redeemed plus accrued interest.

         In the event the  Company  exercises  a  redemption  of either all or a
portion  the  Convertible  Debenture,  the  Holder  shall  receive a warrant  to
purchase fifty thousand  (50,000) shares of the Company's Common Stock for every
One  Hundred  Thousand  U.S.  Dollars  (US$100,000)   redeemed,  pro  rata  (the
"Warrant").  The  Warrant  shall be  exercisable  on a "cash  basis" and have an
exercise  price of one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the Closing Bid Price of


                                       2
<PAGE>

the  Company's  Common  Stock  on the  Closing  Date.  The  Warrant  shall  have
"piggy-back" and demand  registration rights and shall survive for two (2) years
from the Closing Date.

         SECTION 1.05 REGISTRATION  RIGHTS. The Company is obligated to register
the  resale of the  Conversion  Shares  under  the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as
amended,  pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement,  between the
Company and the Holder of even date herewith (the "Investor  Registration Rights
Agreement").

         SECTION 1.06 INTEREST PAYMENTS. The interest so payable will be paid at
the time of maturity or conversion to the person in whose name this Debenture is
registered.  At the time such  interest  is  payable,  the  Holder,  in its sole
discretion,  may elect to receive  the  interest  in cash (via wire  transfer or
certified  funds) or in the form of Common  Stock.  In the event of default,  as
described in Article III Section 3.01  hereunder,  the Holder may elect that the
interest be paid in cash (via wire  transfer or certified  funds) or in the form
of Common Stock. If paid in the form of Common Stock,  the amount of stock to be
issued  will be  calculated  as  follows:  the value of the  stock  shall be the
Closing Bid Price on: (i) the date the  interest  payment is due; or (ii) if the
interest  payment is not made when due, the date the interest payment is made. A
number of shares of Common  Stock with a value  equal to the amount of  interest
due shall be issued.  No  fractional  shares will be issued;  therefore,  in the
event  that the value of the  Common  Stock  per share  does not equal the total
interest due, the Company will pay the balance in cash.

         SECTION 1.07 PAYING AGENT AND  REGISTRAR.  Initially,  the Company will
act as paying  agent and  registrar.  The Company  may change any paying  agent,
registrar,  or  Company-registrar  by giving  the  Holder not less than ten (10)
business  days' written  notice of its election to do so,  specifying  the name,
address, telephone number and facsimile number of the paying agent or registrar.
The Company may act in any such capacity.

                                  ARTICLE II.

         SECTION 2.01 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVER OF DEFAULT. The Debenture may not be
amended.  Notwithstanding  the above,  without the  consent of the  Holder,  the
Debenture may be amended to cure any ambiguity,  defect or inconsistency,  or to
provide for assumption of the Company obligations to the Holder.

                                  ARTICLE III.

         SECTION  3.01  EVENTS OF  DEFAULT.  An Event of  Default  is defined as
follows:  (a) failure by the Company to pay amounts due hereunder within fifteen
(15) days of the date of maturity of this Debenture;  (b) failure by the Company
to comply with the terms of the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions attached
to the  Securities  Purchase  Agreement;  (c) failure by the Company's  transfer
agent to issue freely  tradeable Common Stock to the Holder within five (5) days
of the Company's  receipt of the attached Notice of Conversion from Holder;  (d)
failure by the Company  for ten (10) days after  notice to it to comply with any
of  its  other  agreements  in  the  Debenture;  (e)  events  of  bankruptcy  or
insolvency;  (f) a breach by the Company of its obligations under the Securities
Purchase  Agreement or the Investor  Registration  Rights Agreement which is not
cured by the  Company  within  ten (10) days after  receipt  of  written  notice
thereof. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Holder may, in its sole
discretion,  accelerate full repayment of all debentures outstanding and accrued


                                       3
<PAGE>

interest  thereon or may,  notwithstanding  any  limitations  contained  in this
Debenture and/or the Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof between
the  Company  and Cornell  Capital  Partners,  L.P.  (the  "Securities  Purchase
Agreement"),  convert all debentures  outstanding and accrued  interest  thereon
into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.02 herein.

         SECTION 3.02 FAILURE TO ISSUE  UNRESTRICTED  COMMON STOCK. As indicated
in Article III Section  3.01, a breach by the Company of its  obligations  under
the Investor  Registration Rights Agreement shall be deemed an Event of Default,
which if not cured within ten (10) days,  shall entitle the Holder to accelerate
full repayment of all debentures  outstanding and accrued  interest  thereon or,
notwithstanding   any  limitations   contained  in  this  Debenture  and/or  the
Securities Purchase Agreement, to convert all debentures outstanding and accrued
interest  thereon into shares of Common  Stock  pursuant to Section 1.02 herein.
The Company  acknowledges  that  failure to honor a Notice of  Conversion  shall
cause irreparable harm to the Holder.

                                  ARTICLE IV.

         SECTION 4.01 RIGHTS AND TERMS OF CONVERSION.  This Debenture,  in whole
or in part, may be converted at any time following the Closing Date, into shares
of Common Stock at a price equal to the Conversion Price as described in Section
1.02 above.

         SECTION  4.02  RE-ISSUANCE  OF  DEBENTURE.  When the  Holder  elects to
convert a part of the Debenture,  then the Company shall reissue a new Debenture
in the same form as this Debenture to reflect the new principal amount.

         SECTION 4.03  TERMINATION OF CONVERSION  RIGHTS.  The Holder's right to
convert the Debenture  into the Common Stock in accordance  with  paragraph 4.01
shall  terminate on the date that is the third (3rd) year  anniversary  from the
date hereof and this Debenture shall be automatically  converted on that date in
accordance  with  the  formula  set  forth  in  Section  4.01  hereof,  and  the
appropriate shares of Common Stock and amount of interest shall be issued to the
Holder.

                                   ARTICLE V.

         SECTION 5.01 ANTI-DILUTION.  In the event that the Company shall at any
time subdivide the  outstanding  shares of Common Stock,  or shall issue a stock
dividend  on the  outstanding  Common  Stock,  the  Conversion  Price in  effect
immediately  prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such dividend shall be
proportionately  decreased,  and in the event that the Company shall at any time
combine the outstanding  shares of Common Stock,  the Conversion Price in effect
immediately  prior  to such  combination  shall  be  proportionately  increased,
effective at the close of business on the date of such subdivision,  dividend or
combination as the case may be.

         SECTION 5.02 CONSENT OF HOLDER TO SELL CAPITAL STOCK OR GRANT  SECURITY
INTERESTS.  So long as any of the  principal  of or interest  on this  Debenture
remains unpaid and unconverted, the Company shall not, without the prior consent
of the Holder,  issue or sell (i) any Common  Stock or Preferred  Stock  without
consideration  or for a consideration  per share less than its fair market value
determined  immediately prior to its issuance,  (ii) issue or sell any Preferred
Stock, warrant,  option, right, contract,  call, or other security or instrument


                                       4
<PAGE>

granting  the  holder   thereof  the  right  to  acquire  Common  Stock  without
consideration  or for a  consideration  per share less than such Common  Stock's
fair market value determined immediately prior to its issuance, (iii) enter into
any security  instrument  granting the holder a security  interest in any of the
assets of the Company, or (iv) file any registration statement on Form S-8.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

Date of Issuance: __________________

SmarTire Systems,  Inc., _______  corporation (the "Company"),  hereby certifies
that,  for Ten  United  States  Dollars  ($10.00)  and other  good and  valuable
consideration,  the receipt and  sufficiency  of which are hereby  acknowledged,
Cornell Capital Partners LP, a Delaware  limited  partnership  ("Cornell"),  the
registered holder hereof or its permitted assigns,  is entitled,  subject to the
terms set forth  below,  to purchase  from the Company  upon  surrender  of this
Warrant,  at any time or times on or after the date hereof,  but not after 11:59
P.M.  Eastern Time on the Expiration Date (as defined  herein)  ________________
fully paid and  nonassessable  shares of Common Stock (as defined herein) of the
Company  (the  "Warrant  Shares") at the  exercise  price per share  provided in
Section 1(b) below or as subsequently  adjusted;  provided,  however, that in no
event  shall the holder be entitled  to  exercise  this  Warrant for a number of
Warrant  Shares in excess of that number of Warrant  Shares  which,  upon giving
effect to such  exercise,  would cause the aggregate  number of shares of Common
Stock beneficially owned by the holder and its affiliates to exceed 4.99% of the
outstanding  shares of the Common Stock  following such exercise,  except within
sixty (60) days of the Expiration  Date. For purposes of the foregoing  proviso,
the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock  beneficially owned by the holder
and its  affiliates  shall include the number of shares of Common Stock issuable
upon  exercise of this Warrant with respect to which the  determination  of such
proviso is being made,  but shall exclude  shares of Common Stock which would be
issuable upon (i) exercise of the remaining,  unexercised Warrants  beneficially
owned by the holder and its  affiliates  and (ii)  exercise or conversion of the
unexercised  or  unconverted  portion  of any other  securities  of the  Company
beneficially  owned  by  the  holder  and  its  affiliates  (including,  without
limitation, any convertible notes or preferred stock) subject to a limitation on

<PAGE>

conversion or exercise analogous to the limitation  contained herein.  Except as
set forth in the preceding sentence, for purposes of this paragraph,  beneficial
ownership shall be calculated in accordance with Section 13(d) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.  For purposes of this Warrant,  in determining
the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock a holder may rely on the number
of  outstanding  shares of Common Stock as reflected in (1) the  Company's  most
recent Form 10-QSB or Form 10-KSB,  as the case may be, (2) a more recent public
announcement  by the  Company  or (3) any  other  notice by the  Company  or its
transfer  agent setting forth the number of shares of Common Stock  outstanding.
Upon the written request of any holder,  the Company shall  promptly,  but in no
event later than one (1)  Business  Day  following  the receipt of such  notice,
confirm in writing to any such holder the number of shares of Common  Stock then
outstanding. In any case, the number of outstanding shares of Common Stock shall
be determined after giving effect to the exercise of Warrants (as defined below)
by such  holder and its  affiliates  since the date as of which  such  number of
outstanding shares of Common Stock was reported.

         Section 2.  Exercise  of Warrant.  Subject to the terms and  conditions

Business  Day on or  after  the  opening  of  business  on  such  Business  Day,
commencing  with the first day after the date  hereof,  and prior to 11:59  P.M.
Eastern Time on the Expiration Date, by (i) delivery of a written notice, in the
form of the  subscription  notice  attached as Exhibit A hereto  (the  "Exercise
Notice"), of such holder's election to exercise this Warrant, which notice shall
specify  the  number of  Warrant  Shares to be  purchased,  (ii)  payment to the
Company of an amount equal to the Warrant  Exercise  Price(s)  applicable to the
Warrant Shares being  purchased,  multiplied by the number of Warrant Shares (at
the  applicable  Warrant  Exercise  Price)  as to which  this  Warrant  is being
exercised (plus any applicable issue or transfer taxes) (the "Aggregate Exercise
Price") in cash or wire transfer of  immediately  available  funds and (iii) the
surrender of this  Warrant (or an  indemnification  undertaking  with respect to
this Warrant in the case of its loss,  theft or destruction) to a common carrier
for  overnight  delivery to the Company as soon as  practicable  following  such
date. In the event of any exercise of the rights  represented by this Warrant in
compliance  with this Section 2, the Company  shall on the fifth (5th)  Business
Day following the date of receipt of the Exercise Notice, the Aggregate Exercise
Price and this Warrant (or an  indemnification  undertaking with respect to this
Warrant in the case of its loss,  theft or  destruction)  and the receipt of the
representations of the holder specified in Section 6 hereof, if requested by the
Company  (the  "Exercise  Delivery  Documents"),  and if the Common Stock is DTC
eligible  credit such  aggregate  number of shares of Common  Stock to which the
holder shall be entitled to the holder's or its designee's  balance account with
The Depository Trust Company; provided, however, if the holder who submitted the
Exercise Notice requested physical delivery of any or all of the Warrant Shares,
or, if the Common Stock is not DTC eligible then the Company shall, on or before
the  fifth  (5th)  Business  Day  following  receipt  of the  Exercise  Delivery
Documents, issue and surrender to a common carrier for overnight delivery to the
address specified in the Exercise Notice, a certificate,  registered in the name
of the  holder,  for the  number of shares of Common  Stock to which the  holder
shall be entitled pursuant to such request. Upon delivery of the Exercise Notice
and Aggregate Exercise Price referred to in clause (ii) above the holder of this
Warrant shall be deemed for all corporate  purposes to have become the holder of


                                       4
<PAGE>

record of the  Warrant  Shares  with  respect  to which  this  Warrant  has been
exercised.  In the case of a  dispute  as to the  determination  of the  Warrant
Exercise  Price,  the Closing  Bid Price or the  arithmetic  calculation  of the
Warrant  Shares,  the Company shall  promptly  issue to the holder the number of
Warrant Shares that is not disputed and shall submit the disputed determinations
or arithmetic  calculations to the holder via facsimile  within one (1) Business
Day of receipt of the holder's  Exercise  Notice.  If the holder and the Company
are unable to agree upon the  determination  of the  Warrant  Exercise  Price or
arithmetic calculation of the Warrant Shares within one (1) day of such disputed
determination or arithmetic  calculation being submitted to the holder, then the
Company shall immediately submit via facsimile (i) the disputed determination of
the Warrant Exercise Price or the Closing Bid Price to an independent, reputable
investment  banking  firm or (ii) the  disputed  arithmetic  calculation  of the
Warrant Shares to its independent,  outside accountant.  The Company shall cause
the investment  banking firm or the  accountant,  as the case may be, to perform
the  determinations or calculations and notify the Company and the holder of the
results no later than  forty-eight  (48)  hours  from the time it  receives  the
disputed  determinations  or  calculations.  Such  investment  banking firm's or
accountant's  determination or calculation,  as the case may be, shall be deemed
conclusive absent manifest error.

                  (a) Unless the rights  represented  by this Warrant shall have
expired  or shall have been  fully  exercised,  the  Company  shall,  as soon as
practicable and in no event later than five (5) Business Days after any exercise
and at its own  expense,  issue a new Warrant  identical in all respects to this
Warrant  exercised  except it shall  represent  rights to purchase the number of
Warrant Shares purchasable immediately prior to such exercise under this Warrant
exercised,  less the number of Warrant Shares with respect to which such Warrant
is exercised.

                  (b) No fractional Warrant Shares are to be issued upon any pro
rata  exercise of this Warrant,  but rather the number of Warrant  Shares issued
upon such  exercise of this  Warrant  shall be rounded up or down to the nearest
whole number.

                  (c) If the  Company or its  Transfer  Agent shall fail for any
reason or for no reason to issue to the  holder  within ten (10) days of receipt
of the Exercise  Delivery  Documents,  a  certificate  for the number of Warrant
Shares to which the holder is entitled or to credit the holder's balance account
with The Depository Trust Company for such number of Warrant Shares to which the
holder is  entitled  upon the  holder's  exercise of this  Warrant,  the Company
shall,  in addition to any other  remedies  under this Warrant or the  Placement
Agent Agreement or otherwise available to such holder, pay as additional damages
in cash to such holder on each day the issuance of such  certificate for Warrant
Shares is not timely  effected  an amount  equal to 0.025% of the product of (A)
the sum of the  number of  Warrant  Shares  not issued to the holder on a timely
basis and to which the holder is entitled,  and (B) the Closing Bid Price of the
Common Stock for the trading day  immediately  preceding  the last possible date
which the Company  could have issued  such  Common  Stock to the holder  without
violating this Section 2.

                  (d) If within ten (10) days after the Company's receipt of the
Exercise Delivery  Documents,  the Company fails to deliver a new Warrant to the
holder  for the  number of  Warrant  Shares  to which  such  holder is  entitled
pursuant to Section 2 hereof,  then, in addition to any other available remedies
under this Warrant or the Placement Agent Agreement,  or otherwise  available to
such holder,  the Company shall pay as additional damages in cash to such holder
on each day after such tenth  (10th) day that such  delivery of such new Warrant
is not timely  effected  in an amount  equal to 0.25% of the  product of (A) the


                                       5
<PAGE>

number of Warrant Shares represented by the portion of this Warrant which is not
being  exercised  and (B) the  Closing  Bid  Price of the  Common  Stock for the
trading day immediately preceding the last possible date which the Company could
have issued such Warrant to the holder without violating this Section 2.

         Section 3. Covenants as to Common Stock.  The Company hereby  covenants
and agrees as follows:

                  (a) This Warrant is, and any Warrants  issued in  substitution
for or  replacement  of this Warrant will upon issuance be, duly  authorized and
validly issued.

                  (b) All Warrant  Shares  which may be issued upon the exercise
of the rights  represented  by this  Warrant  will,  upon  issuance,  be validly
issued,  fully paid and nonassessable and free from all taxes, liens and charges
with respect to the issue thereof.

                  (c) During the period within which the rights  represented  by
this Warrant may be exercised, the Company will at all times have authorized and
reserved at least one hundred  percent  (100%) of the number of shares of Common
Stock needed to provide for the exercise of the rights then  represented by this
Warrant and the par value of said shares will at all times be less than or equal
to the applicable  Warrant  Exercise  Price. If at any time the Company does not
have a sufficient  number of shares of Common Stock  authorized  and  available,
then the  Company  shall  call and hold a special  meeting  of its  stockholders
within  thirty  (30) days of that time for the sole  purpose of  increasing  the
number of authorized shares of Common Stock.

                  (d) If at any time  after the date  hereof the  Company  shall
file a  registration  statement,  the Company shall  include the Warrant  Shares
issuable  to the  holder,  pursuant  to the  terms  of this  Warrant  and  shall
maintain,  so long as any other shares of Common Stock shall be so listed,  such
listing of all Warrant  Shares from time to time  issuable  upon the exercise of
this Warrant; and the Company shall so list on each national securities exchange
or  automated  quotation  system,  as the case may be, and shall  maintain  such
listing of, any other shares of capital  stock of the Company  issuable upon the
exercise of this Warrant if and so long as any shares of the same class shall be
listed on such national securities exchange or automated quotation system.

                  (e) The Company  will not,  by  amendment  of its  Articles of
Incorporation or through any reorganization,  transfer of assets, consolidation,
merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities, or any other voluntary action,
avoid or seek to avoid the  observance or  performance of any of the terms to be
observed  or  performed  by it  hereunder,  but will at all times in good  faith
assist in the  carrying  out of all the  provisions  of this  Warrant and in the
taking of all such action as may  reasonably  be requested by the holder of this
Warrant in order to protect the exercise privilege of the holder of this Warrant
against dilution or other  impairment,  consistent with the tenor and purpose of
this  Warrant.  The  Company  will not  increase  the par value of any shares of
Common Stock  receivable  upon the  exercise of this  Warrant  above the Warrant
Exercise  Price  then in  effect,  and  will  take all  such  actions  as may be
necessary or appropriate in order that the Company may validly and legally issue
fully paid and  nonassessable  shares of Common  Stock upon the exercise of this
Warrant.

                  (f) This Warrant will be binding upon any entity succeeding to
the Company by merger,  consolidation or acquisition of all or substantially all
of the Company's assets.

         Section 4. Taxes.  The Company shall pay any and all taxes,  except any
applicable  withholding,  which may be payable  with respect to the issuance and
delivery of Warrant Shares upon exercise of this Warrant.

         Section 5. Warrant Holder Not Deemed a Stockholder. Except as otherwise
specifically  provided  herein,  no holder,  as such,  of this Warrant  shall be
entitled  to vote or  receive  dividends  or be deemed  the  holder of shares of
capital stock of the Company for any purpose,  nor shall  anything  contained in
this Warrant be construed to confer upon the holder hereof,  as such, any of the
rights of a  stockholder  of the Company or any right to vote,  give or withhold
consent to any corporate  action  (whether any  reorganization,  issue of stock,
reclassification  of stock,  consolidation,  merger,  conveyance or  otherwise),
receive  notice of  meetings,  receive  dividends  or  subscription  rights,  or
otherwise,  prior to the  issuance to the holder of this  Warrant of the Warrant
Shares which he or she is then entitled to receive upon the due exercise of this
Warrant.  In addition,  nothing  contained in this Warrant shall be construed as
imposing  any  liabilities  on such  holder to  purchase  any  securities  (upon
exercise of this  Warrant or  otherwise)  or as a  stockholder  of the  Company,
whether  such  liabilities  are  asserted by the Company or by  creditors of the
Company.  Notwithstanding this Section 5, the Company will provide the holder of
this Warrant with copies of the same notices and other  information given to the
stockholders of the Company generally, contemporaneously with the giving thereof
to the stockholders.

         Section 6.  Representations of Holder.  The holder of this Warrant,  by
the  acceptance  hereof,  represents  that it is acquiring  this Warrant and the
Warrant  Shares  for its own  account  for  investment  only and not with a view
towards,  or for resale in connection  with, the public sale or  distribution of
this  Warrant or the Warrant  Shares,  except  pursuant to sales  registered  or
exempted  under the  Securities  Act;  provided,  however,  that by  making  the
representations herein, the holder does not agree to hold this Warrant or any of
the Warrant Shares for any minimum or other specific term and reserves the right
to dispose of this Warrant and the Warrant Shares at any time in accordance with
or pursuant to a  registration  statement or an exemption  under the  Securities
Act. The holder of this Warrant further represents,  by acceptance hereof, that,
as of this date, such holder is an "accredited investor" as such term is defined
in Rule  501(a)(1) of Regulation D promulgated  by the  Securities  and Exchange
Commission under the Securities Act (an "Accredited Investor"). Upon exercise of
this Warrant the holder shall, if requested by the Company,  confirm in writing,
in a form satisfactory to the Company,  that the Warrant Shares so purchased are
being acquired  solely for the holder's own account and not as a nominee for any
other party, for investment,  and not with a view toward  distribution or resale
and that such holder is an Accredited Investor.  If such holder cannot make such
representations  because  they  would  be  factually  incorrect,  it  shall be a
condition to such  holder's  exercise of this  Warrant that the Company  receive
such other  representations  as the Company  considers  reasonably  necessary to
assure the Company that the  issuance of its  securities  upon  exercise of this
Warrant shall not violate any United States or state securities laws.

         Section 7. Ownership and Transfer.

                  (a) The  Company  shall  maintain at its  principal  executive
offices (or such other  office or agency of the Company as it may  designate  by
notice to the holder hereof), a register for this Warrant,  in which the Company
shall  record the name and address of the person in whose name this  Warrant has
been issued, as well as the name and address of each transferee. The Company may
treat the person in whose name any Warrant is  registered on the register as the
owner and holder  thereof for all  purposes,  notwithstanding  any notice to the
contrary,  but in all events  recognizing  any transfers made in accordance with
the terms of this Warrant.

         Section 8.  Adjustment of Warrant  Exercise Price and Number of Shares.
The Warrant  Exercise  Price and the number of shares of Common  Stock  issuable
upon exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted from time to time as follows:

                  (a) Adjustment of Warrant  Exercise Price and Number of Shares
upon Issuance of Common Stock.  If and whenever on or after the Issuance Date of
this Warrant,  the Company issues or sells, or is deemed to have issued or sold,
any shares of Common Stock (other than (i) Excluded  Securities  and (ii) shares
of Common Stock which are issued or deemed to have been issued by the Company in
connection  with an Approved  Stock Plan or upon  exercise or  conversion of the
Other  Securities)  for a  consideration  per  share  less  than  a  price  (the
"Applicable  Price") equal to the Warrant  Exercise Price in effect  immediately
prior to such issuance or sale,  then  immediately  after such issue or sale the
Warrant  Exercise  Price then in effect  shall be reduced to an amount  equal to
such  consideration per share. Upon each such adjustment of the Warrant Exercise
Price  hereunder,  the number of Warrant  Shares  issuable upon exercise of this
Warrant shall be adjusted to the number of shares  determined by multiplying the
Warrant  Exercise Price in effect  immediately  prior to such  adjustment by the
number of Warrant  Shares  issuable  upon  exercise of this Warrant  immediately
prior to such  adjustment  and  dividing  the  product  thereof  by the  Warrant
Exercise Price resulting from such adjustment.

                  (b) Effect on Warrant  Exercise Price of Certain  Events.  For
purposes of determining the adjusted  Warrant  Exercise Price under Section 8(a)
above, the following shall be applicable:

                           (i)  Issuance of Options.  If after the date  hereof,
the Company in any manner  grants any Options and the lowest price per share for
which one share of Common Stock is issuable upon the exercise of any such Option
or upon  conversion  or exchange of any  convertible  securities  issuable  upon
exercise of any such Option is less than the Applicable  Price,  then such share
of Common  Stock shall be deemed to be  outstanding  and to have been issued and
sold by the Company at the time of the  granting or sale of such Option for such
price per share.  For  purposes of this  Section  8(b)(i),  the lowest price per
share for which one share of Common  Stock is  issuable  upon  exercise  of such
Options or upon conversion or exchange of such  Convertible  Securities shall be
equal to the sum of the lowest  amounts of  consideration  (if any)  received or
receivable by the Company with respect to any one share of Common Stock upon the
granting or sale of the Option,  upon exercise of the Option or upon  conversion
or exchange of any convertible  security  issuable upon exercise of such Option.
No further  adjustment  of the  Warrant  Exercise  Price  shall be made upon the
actual issuance of such Common Stock or of such convertible  securities upon the


                                       8
<PAGE>

exercise of such  Options or upon the actual  issuance of such Common Stock upon
conversion or exchange of such convertible securities.

                           (ii)  Issuance  of  Convertible  Securities.  If  the
Company in any manner issues or sells any convertible  securities and the lowest
price  per share for  which  one  share of  Common  Stock is  issuable  upon the
conversion  or exchange  thereof is less than the  Applicable  Price,  then such
share of Common Stock shall be deemed to be outstanding  and to have been issued
and sold by the Company at the time of the issuance or sale of such  convertible
securities for such price per share. For the purposes of this Section  8(b)(ii),
the lowest price per share for which one share of Common Stock is issuable  upon
such  conversion or exchange  shall be equal to the sum of the lowest amounts of
consideration (if any) received or receivable by the Company with respect to one
share of Common Stock upon the issuance or sale of the convertible  security and
upon conversion or exchange of such convertible  security. No further adjustment
of the Warrant  Exercise  Price  shall be made upon the actual  issuance of such
Common Stock upon conversion or exchange of such convertible securities,  and if
any such issue or sale of such  convertible  securities is made upon exercise of
any Options for which  adjustment of the Warrant  Exercise Price had been or are
to be made  pursuant  to other  provisions  of this  Section  8(b),  no  further
adjustment of the Warrant  Exercise  Price shall be made by reason of such issue
or sale.

                           (iii) Change in Option  Price or Rate of  Conversion.
If the purchase price provided for in any Options, the additional consideration,
if any,  payable  upon the issue,  conversion  or  exchange  of any  convertible
securities, or the rate at which any convertible securities are convertible into
or exchangeable for Common Stock changes at any time, the Warrant Exercise Price
in effect at the time of such change  shall be adjusted to the Warrant  Exercise
Price  which  would  have  been in  effect  at such  time  had such  Options  or
convertible  securities  provided for such changed  purchase  price,  additional
consideration  or  changed  conversion  rate,  as the case  may be,  at the time
initially granted, issued or sold and the number of Warrant Shares issuable upon
exercise of this Warrant shall be  correspondingly  readjusted.  For purposes of
this Section 8(b)(iii),  if the terms of any Option or convertible security that
was  outstanding  as of the  Issuance  Date of this  Warrant  are changed in the
manner  described in the  immediately  preceding  sentence,  then such Option or
convertible  security  and the  Common  Stock  deemed  issuable  upon  exercise,
conversion  or  exchange  thereof  shall be deemed to have been issued as of the
date of such change.  No adjustment  pursuant to this Section 8(b) shall be made
if such  adjustment  would result in an increase of the Warrant  Exercise  Price
then in effect.

                  (c) Effect on Warrant  Exercise Price of Certain  Events.  For
purposes of determining the adjusted  Warrant Exercise Price under Sections 8(a)
and 8(b), the following shall be applicable:

                           (i)  Calculation of  Consideration  Received.  If any
Common Stock, Options or convertible  securities are issued or sold or deemed to
have been issued or sold for cash, the consideration  received therefore will be
deemed to be the net amount  received  by the Company  therefore.  If any Common
Stock, Options or convertible  securities are issued or sold for a consideration
other than cash, the amount of such  consideration  received by the Company will
be the  fair  value  of such  consideration,  except  where  such  consideration
consists of  marketable  securities,  in which case the amount of  consideration


                                       9
<PAGE>

received by the Company will be the market price of such  securities on the date
of  receipt of such  securities.  If any Common  Stock,  Options or  convertible
securities  are issued to the owners of the  non-surviving  entity in connection
with any merger in which the  Company  is the  surviving  entity,  the amount of
consideration  therefore  will be deemed to be the fair value of such portion of
the net assets and business of the  non-surviving  entity as is  attributable to
such Common Stock,  Options or convertible  securities,  as the case may be. The
fair value of any consideration other than cash or securities will be determined
jointly  by the  Company  and the  holders  of  Warrants  representing  at least
two-thirds (b) of the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of the Warrants then
outstanding.  If such parties are unable to reach agreement within ten (10) days
after the occurrence of an event requiring  valuation (the  "Valuation  Event"),
the fair value of such consideration will be determined within five (5) Business
Days after the tenth (10th) day following the Valuation Event by an independent,
reputable  appraiser jointly selected by the Company and the holders of Warrants
representing  at  least  two-thirds  (b) of the  Warrant  Shares  issuable  upon
exercise of the Warrants then  outstanding.  The determination of such appraiser
shall be final and binding  upon all  parties and the fees and  expenses of such
appraiser shall be borne jointly by the Company and the holders of Warrants.

                           (ii) Integrated  Transactions.  In case any Option is
issued in connection with the issue or sale of other  securities of the Company,
together   comprising   one   integrated   transaction   in  which  no  specific
consideration is allocated to such Options by the parties  thereto,  the Options
will be deemed to have been issued for a consideration of $.01.

                           (iii) Treasury Shares. The number of shares of Common
Stock  outstanding at any given time does not include shares owned or held by or
for the account of the Company,  and the  disposition  of any shares so owned or
held will be considered an issue or sale of Common Stock.

                           (iv) Record  Date.  If the Company  takes a record of
the holders of Common Stock for the purpose of  entitling  them (1) to receive a
dividend  or  other  distribution   payable  in  Common  Stock,  Options  or  in
convertible securities or (2) to subscribe for or purchase Common Stock, Options
or convertible  securities,  then such record date will be deemed to be the date
of the issue or sale of the shares of Common Stock deemed to have been issued or
sold  upon  the  declaration  of such  dividend  or the  making  of  such  other
distribution  or the  date of the  granting  of such  right of  subscription  or
purchase, as the case may be.

                  (d) Adjustment of Warrant  Exercise Price upon  Subdivision or
Combination  of  Common  Stock.  If the  Company  at any time  after the date of
issuance  of this  Warrant  subdivides  (by any  stock  split,  stock  dividend,
recapitalization  or otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding shares of
Common  Stock into a greater  number of shares,  any Warrant  Exercise  Price in
effect immediately prior to such subdivision will be proportionately reduced and
the number of shares of Common Stock  obtainable  upon  exercise of this Warrant
will be proportionately  increased. If the Company at any time after the date of
issuance  of this  Warrant  combines  (by  combination,  reverse  stock split or
otherwise) one or more classes of its outstanding  shares of Common Stock into a
smaller number of shares, any Warrant Exercise Price in effect immediately prior
to such combination will be proportionately  increased and the number of Warrant
Shares issuable upon exercise of this Warrant will be proportionately decreased.


                                       10
<PAGE>

Any  adjustment  under this Section 8(d) shall become  effective at the close of
business on the date the subdivision or combination becomes effective.

                  (e)  Distribution  of Assets.  If the Company shall declare or
make any dividend or other  distribution of its assets (or rights to acquire its
assets)  to holders of Common  Stock,  by way of return of capital or  otherwise
(including,  without  limitation,  any  distribution  of  cash,  stock  or other
securities,   property   or   options   by  way  of  a   dividend,   spin   off,
reclassification,  corporate  rearrangement  or other  similar  transaction)  (a
"Distribution"),  at any time after the issuance of this Warrant,  then, in each
such case:

                           (i) any Warrant Exercise Price in effect  immediately
prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the  Distribution  shall be reduced,
effective as of the close of business on such record date, to a price determined
by  multiplying  such  Warrant  Exercise  Price by a  fraction  of which (A) the
numerator shall be the Closing Sale Price of the Common Stock on the trading day
immediately  preceding such record date minus the value of the  Distribution (as
determined in good faith by the Company's Board of Directors)  applicable to one
share of Common Stock,  and (B) the denominator  shall be the Closing Sale Price
of the Common Stock on the trading day  immediately  preceding such record date;
and

                           (ii)   either  (A)  the  number  of  Warrant   Shares
obtainable  upon  exercise of this  Warrant  shall be  increased  to a number of
shares  equal to the  number of shares of Common  Stock  obtainable  immediately
prior to the close of business on the record date fixed for the determination of
holders of Common Stock entitled to receive the  Distribution  multiplied by the
reciprocal of the fraction set forth in the immediately preceding clause (i), or
(B) in the event that the  Distribution  is of common  stock of a company  whose
common stock is traded on a national securities exchange or a national automated
quotation  system,  then the holder of this Warrant  shall receive an additional
warrant to purchase Common Stock, the terms of which shall be identical to those
of this Warrant,  except that such warrant shall be exercisable  into the amount
of the  assets  that  would  have been  payable  to the  holder of this  Warrant
pursuant to the Distribution  had the holder exercised this Warrant  immediately
prior to such  record  date and with an  exercise  price  equal to the amount by
which the  exercise  price of this  Warrant was  decreased  with  respect to the
Distribution pursuant to the terms of the immediately preceding clause (i).

                  (f)  Certain   Events.   If  any  event  occurs  of  the  type
contemplated by the provisions of this Section 8 but not expressly  provided for
by such  provisions  (including,  without  limitation,  the  granting  of  stock
appreciation rights, phantom stock rights or other rights with equity features),
then the Company's Board of Directors will make an appropriate adjustment in the
Warrant  Exercise Price and the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable upon
exercise  of this  Warrant  so as to protect  the  rights of the  holders of the
Warrants;  provided, except as set forth in section 8(d),that no such adjustment
pursuant  to this  Section  8(f) will  increase  the Warrant  Exercise  Price or
decrease the number of shares of Common Stock obtainable as otherwise determined
pursuant to this Section 8.

                  (g) Notices.

                           (i)  Immediately  upon any  adjustment of the Warrant
Exercise  Price,  the Company will give written  notice thereof to the holder of
this  Warrant,   setting  forth  in  reasonable  detail,  and  certifying,   the
calculation of such adjustment.

                           (ii) The  Company  will  give  written  notice to the
holder of this  Warrant  at least  ten (10) days  prior to the date on which the
Company  closes its books or takes a record (A) with  respect to any dividend or
distribution   upon  the  Common  Stock,  (B)  with  respect  to  any  pro  rata
subscription  offer to holders of Common Stock or (C) for determining  rights to
vote with  respect to any Organic  Change (as  defined  below),  dissolution  or
liquidation,  provided that such  information  shall be made known to the public
prior to or in conjunction with such notice being provided to such holder.

                           (iii) The Company  will also give  written  notice to
the holder of this Warrant at least ten (10) days prior to the date on which any
Organic Change,  dissolution or liquidation will take place,  provided that such
information  shall be made known to the public prior to or in  conjunction  with
such notice being provided to such holder.

         Section   9.   Purchase   Rights;   Reorganization,   Reclassification,
Consolidation, Merger or Sale.

                  (a) In  addition  to any  adjustments  pursuant  to  Section 8
above,  if at any  time  the  Company  grants,  issues  or  sells  any  Options,
Convertible  Securities  or rights to purchase  stock,  warrants,  securities or
other  property pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock (the
"Purchase Rights"), then the holder of this Warrant will be entitled to acquire,
upon the terms applicable to such Purchase Rights, the aggregate Purchase Rights
which such  holder  could have  acquired  if such  holder had held the number of
shares of  Common  Stock  acquirable  upon  complete  exercise  of this  Warrant
immediately  before the date on which a record is taken for the grant,  issuance
or sale of such Purchase Rights,  or, if no such record is taken, the date as of
which the record  holders of Common  Stock are to be  determined  for the grant,
issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.

                  (b) Any  recapitalization,  reorganization,  reclassification,
consolidation,  merger, sale of all or substantially all of the Company's assets
to another Person or other  transaction in each case which is effected in such a
way that  holders of Common Stock are  entitled to receive  (either  directly or
upon subsequent  liquidation) stock,  securities or assets with respect to or in
exchange for Common Stock is referred to herein as an "Organic Change." Prior to
the  consummation of any (i) sale of all or  substantially  all of the Company's
assets to an acquiring  Person or (ii) other Organic Change  following which the
Company is not a  surviving  entity,  the  Company  will  secure from the Person
purchasing  such assets or the successor  resulting from such Organic Change (in
each case,  the "Acquiring  Entity") a written  agreement (in form and substance
satisfactory to the holders of Warrants  representing at least  two-thirds (iii)
of the Warrant Shares  issuable upon exercise of the Warrants then  outstanding)
to deliver to each holder of Warrants in exchange for such Warrants,  a security
of the Acquiring Entity evidenced by a written instrument  substantially similar
in form and  substance  to this Warrant and  satisfactory  to the holders of the
Warrants  (including an adjusted  warrant  exercise price equal to the value for


                                       12
<PAGE>

the Common Stock reflected by the terms of such  consolidation,  merger or sale,
and exercisable for a corresponding  number of shares of Common Stock acquirable
and receivable  upon exercise of the Warrants  without regard to any limitations
on  exercise,  if the value so  reflected  is less than any  Applicable  Warrant
Exercise Price immediately prior to such  consolidation,  merger or sale). Prior
to the  consummation  of any  other  Organic  Change,  the  Company  shall  make
appropriate  provision  (in form and  substance  satisfactory  to the holders of
Warrants representing a majority of the Warrant Shares issuable upon exercise of
the  Warrants  then  outstanding)  to  insure  that each of the  holders  of the
Warrants will  thereafter have the right to acquire and receive in lieu of or in
addition  to (as the case may be) the  Warrant  Shares  immediately  theretofore
issuable and  receivable  upon the exercise of such holder's  Warrants  (without
regard to any  limitations  on  exercise),  such shares of stock,  securities or
assets  that would  have been  issued or payable  in such  Organic  Change  with
respect to or in exchange for the number of Warrant Shares which would have been
issuable and  receivable  upon the exercise of such  holder's  Warrant as of the
date of such Organic  Change  (without  taking into account any  limitations  or
restrictions on the exercisability of this Warrant).

         Section 10.  Lost,  Stolen,  Mutilated or  Destroyed  Warrant.  If this
Warrant is lost, stolen,  mutilated or destroyed, the Company shall promptly, on
receipt  of an  indemnification  undertaking  (or,  in the  case of a  mutilated
Warrant,  the Warrant),  issue a new Warrant of like  denomination  and tenor as
this Warrant so lost, stolen, mutilated or destroyed.

         Section  11.   Notice.   Any  notices,   consents,   waivers  or  other
communications required or permitted to be given under the terms of this Warrant
must be in writing and will be deemed to have been delivered:  (i) upon receipt,
when delivered  personally;  (ii) upon receipt, when sent by facsimile (provided

hereof. This Warrant, in all events, shall be wholly void and of no effect after
the close of business on the Expiration Date,  except that  notwithstanding  any
other provisions  hereof,  the provisions of Section 8(b) shall continue in full
force and effect  after such date as to any Warrant  Shares or other  securities
issued upon the exercise of this Warrant.

         Section 13. Amendment and Waiver.  Except as otherwise provided herein,
the  provisions  of the  Warrants  may be amended  and the  Company may take any
action  herein  prohibited,  or omit to perform  any act herein  required  to be

         Section  14.  Descriptive  Headings;  Governing  Law.  The  descriptive

                  reason that the  Administrator  considers in the best interest
                  of the Company;

            (viii)to   establish   additional   terms,   conditions,   rules  or
                  procedures  to  accommodate  the  rules or laws of  applicable
                  foreign   jurisdictions  and  to  afford  Grantees  favourable
                  treatment under such laws;  provided,  however,  that no Award
                  shall be granted under any such additional terms,  conditions,
                  rules  or  procedures  with  terms  or  conditions  which  are
                  inconsistent with the provisions of the Plan; and

            (ix)  to take such other action,  not inconsistent with the terms of
                  the Plan, as the Administrator deems appropriate.

      (c)   Effect of Administrator's  Decision.  All decisions,  determinations
            and  interpretations  of the  Administrator  shall be conclusive and
            binding on all persons.

5.    ELIGIBILITY

Options and Awards other than Options may be granted to Eligible  Employees.  An
Eligible Employee who has been granted an Award may, if otherwise  eligible,  be
granted additional Awards.

6.    TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF AWARDS

      (a)   Type of Awards.  The  Administrator  is authorized under the Plan to
            award any type of  arrangement  to an Eligible  Employee that is not
            inconsistent  with the  provisions of the Plan and that by its terms
            involves  or might  involve  the  issuance  of (i)  Shares,  (ii) an
            Option,  (iii) a SAR or similar right with a fixed or variable price
            related to the Fair Market  Value of the Shares and with an exercise
            or  conversion  privilege  related  to  the  passage  of  time,  the
            occurrence of one or more events, or the satisfaction of performance
            criteria or other  conditions,  or (iv) any other  security with the
            value  derived  from the value of the Shares.  Such awards  include,
            without  limitation,  Options,  SARs, sales or bonuses of Restricted
            Stock,  Performance  Units or Performance  Shares,  and an Award may
            consist of one such security or benefit,  or two (2) or more of them
            in any  combination or alternative.

      (b)   Designation  of Award.  Each Award shall be  designated in the Award
            Agreement.

      (c)   Conditions  of  Award.  Subject  to  the  terms  of  the  Plan,  the
            Administrator shall determine the provisions,  terms, and conditions
            of each Award  including,  but not  limited  to,  the Award  vesting
            schedule, repurchase provisions, rights of first refusal, forfeiture
            provisions,  form of payment (cash,  Shares, or other consideration)

                                       7
<PAGE>

            upon   settlement   of  the  Award,   payment   contingencies,   and
            satisfaction of any performance  criteria.  The performance criteria
            established  by the  Administrator  may be based  on any one of,  or
            combination of, increase in share price,  earnings per share,  total
            shareholder return,  return on equity,  return on assets,  return on
            investment, net operating income, cash flow, revenue, economic value
            added,  personal  management   objectives,   or  other  measures  of
            performance  selected by the Administrator.  Partial  achievement of
            the   specified   criteria  may  result  in  a  payment  or  vesting
            corresponding to the degree of achievement as specified in the Award
            Agreement.

      (d)   Acquisitions and Other  Transactions.  The  Administrator  may issue
            Awards under the Plan in settlement, assumption or substitution for,
            outstanding   awards  or  obligations  to  grant  future  awards  in
            connection  with the Company or a Related Entity  acquiring  another
            entity, an interest in another entity or an additional interest in a
            Related Entity whether by merger, stock purchase,  asset purchase or
            other form of transaction.

      (e)   Deferral of Award Payment.  The  Administrator  may establish one or
            more  programs  under  the  Plan to  permit  selected  Grantees  the
            opportunity to elect to defer receipt of consideration upon exercise
            of an Award,  satisfaction of performance  criteria,  or other event
            that  absent the  election  would  entitle the Grantee to payment or
            receipt  of  Shares  or  other  consideration  under an  Award.  The
            Administrator may establish the election  procedures,  the timing of
            such  elections,  the  mechanisms  for  payments  of, and accrual of
            interest or other  earnings,  if any,  on  amounts,  Shares or other
            consideration so deferred, and such other terms,  conditions,  rules
            and  procedures  that  the  Administrator  deems  advisable  for the
            administration of any such deferral program.

      (f)   Award Exchange Programs. The Administrator may establish one or more
            programs under the Plan to permit  selected  Grantees to exchange an
            Award under the Plan for one or more other types of Awards under the
            Plan on such terms and conditions as determined by the Administrator
            from time to time.

      (g)   Separate  Programs.  The  Administrator  may  establish  one or more
            separate  programs  under  the  Plan  for  the  purpose  of  issuing
            particular  forms of Awards to one or more  classes of  Grantees  on
            such terms and  conditions as determined by the  Administrator  from
            time to time.

      (h)   Individual  Option and SAR Limit.  The maximum number of Shares with
            respect to which  Options and SARs may be granted to any Employee in
            any fiscal year of the  Company  shall be five  percent  (5%) of the
            outstanding  Shares.  The  foregoing  limitation  shall be  adjusted
            proportionately  in  connection  with any  change  in the  Company's
            capitalization pursuant to Section 10, below.

      (i)   Early  Exercise.  The Award  Agreement may, but need not,  include a
            provision  whereby  the  Grantee  may  elect  at any  time  while an
            Eligible  Employee to exercise any part or all of the Award prior to
            full vesting of the Award. Any unvested Shares received  pursuant to
            such exercise may be subject to a repurchase  right in favour of the
            Company  or a  Related  Entity  or  to  any  other  restriction  the
            Administrator determines to be appropriate.

      (j)   Term of Award.  The term of each Award  shall be the term  stated in
            the Award Agreement,  provided,  however, that the term of an Option
            shall be no more than ten (10) years from the date of grant thereof.


                                       8
<PAGE>

      (k)   Transferability  of  Awards.  Options  may  not  be  sold,  pledged,
            assigned,  hypothecated,  transferred,  or disposed of in any manner
            other than by will or by the laws of descent or distribution and may
            be  exercised,  during  the  lifetime  of the  Grantee,  only by the
            Grantee;  provided,  however,  that  the  Grantee  may  designate  a
            beneficiary  of the  Grantee's  Option in the event of the Grantee's
            death  on  a   beneficiary   designation   form   provided   by  the
            Administrator.  Other  Awards  shall be  transferable  to the extent
            provided in the Award Agreement.

      (l)   Time of Granting Awards. The date of grant of an Award shall for all
            purposes  be  the  date  on  which  the   Administrator   makes  the
            determination  to  grant  such  Award,  or  such  other  date  as is
            determined by the Administrator.  Notice of the grant  determination
            shall be given to each  Employee,  Director or Consultant to whom an
            Award is so granted within a reasonable  time after the date of such
            grant.

7.    AWARD EXERCISE OR PURCHASE PRICE, CONSIDERATION, TAXES AND RELOAD OPTIONS

      (a)   Exercise or Purchase Price.  The exercise or purchase price, if any,
            for  an  Award  shall  be as  determined  by  the  Administrator  in
            compliance with the Applicable Laws.

      (b)   Consideration.  Subject to Applicable Laws, the  consideration to be
            paid for the Shares to be issued  upon  exercise  or  purchase of an
            Award  including  the method of payment,  shall be determined by the
            Administrator (and, in the case of an Option, shall be determined at
            the time of grant).  In addition to any other types of consideration
            the Administrator may determine,  the Administrator is authorized to
            accept  as  consideration  for  Shares  issued  under  the  Plan the
            following:

            (i)   cash;

            (ii)  check;

            (iii) surrender of Shares or delivery of a properly executed form of
                  attestation  of ownership of Shares as the  Administrator  may
                  require (including withholding of Shares otherwise deliverable
                  upon  exercise of the Award) which have a Fair Market Value on
                  the date of surrender or  attestation  equal to the  aggregate
                  exercise  price of the Shares as to which said Award  shall be
                  exercised  (but only to the extent  that such  exercise of the
                  Award would not result in an  accounting  compensation  charge
                  with  respect to the  Shares  used to pay the  exercise  price
                  unless otherwise determined by the Administrator); or

            (iv)  any combination of the foregoing methods of payment.

      (c)   Taxes. No Shares shall be delivered under the Plan to any Grantee or
            other   person   until  such   Grantee  or  other  person  has  made
            arrangements acceptable to the Administrator for the satisfaction of
            any foreign,  federal,  state,  or local income and  employment  tax
            withholding obligations,  including, without limitation, obligations
            incident to the receipt of Shares or the  disqualifying  disposition
            of Shares  received on exercise  of an Option.  Upon  exercise of an
            Award,  the Company shall withhold or collect from Grantee an amount
            sufficient to satisfy such tax obligations.


                                       9
<PAGE>

      (d)   Reload  Options.  In the event the exercise price or tax withholding
            of an Option is satisfied by the Company or the  Grantee's  employer
            withholding  Shares  otherwise   deliverable  to  the  Grantee,  the
            Administrator may issue the Grantee an additional Option, with terms
            identical  to  the  Award  Agreement  under  which  the  Option  was
            exercised,   but  at  an  exercise   price  as   determined  by  the
            Administrator in accordance with the Plan.

8.    EXERCISE OF AWARD

      (a)   Procedure for Exercise; Rights as a Shareholder.

            (i)   Any Award granted hereunder shall be exercisable at such times
                  and under such  conditions as determined by the  Administrator
                  under  the  terms  of the  Plan  and  specified  in the  Award
                  Agreement.

            (ii)  An Award shall be deemed to be exercised  when written  notice
                  of such  exercise has been given to the Company in  accordance
                  with the terms of the Award by the person entitled to exercise
                  the Award and full  payment  for the  Shares  with  respect to
                  which the Award is received by the Company. Until the issuance
                  (as  evidenced  by the  appropriate  entry on the books of the
                  Company or of a duly authorized transfer agent of the Company)
                  of the stock  certificate  evidencing such Shares, no right to
                  vote or receive dividends or any other rights as a shareholder
                  shall  exist  with  respect  to  Shares  subject  to an Award,
                  notwithstanding  the exercise of an Option or other Award. The
                  Company  shall  issue  (or  cause  to be  issued)  such  stock
                  certificate promptly upon exercise of the Award. No adjustment
                  will be made for a  dividend  or other  right  for  which  the
                  record  date is prior to the date  the  stock  certificate  is
                  issued,  except as provided in the Award  Agreement or Section
                  10, below.

      (b)   Exercise of Award Following Termination of Continuous Service.

            (i)   An Award may not be exercised  after the  termination  date of
                  such  Award  set  forth  in the  Award  Agreement  and  may be
                  exercised following the termination of a Grantee's  Continuous
                  Service only to the extent provided in the Award Agreement.

            (ii)  Where the Award  Agreement  permits a Grantee to  exercise  an
                  Award  following the  termination of the Grantee's  Continuous
                  Service for a specified  period,  the Award shall terminate to
                  the  extent  not  exercised  on the last day of the  specified
                  period  or the last  day of the  original  term of the  Award,
                  whichever occurs first.

      (c)   Buyout  Provisions.  The  Administrator may at any time offer to buy
            out for a payment in cash or Shares,  an Award  previously  granted,
            based  on such  terms  and  conditions  as the  Administrator  shall
            establish and communicate to the Grantee at the time that such offer
            is made.

9.    CONDITIONS UPON ISSUANCE OF SHARES

      (a)   Shares  shall not be issued  pursuant  to the  exercise  of an Award
            unless the  exercise of such Award and the  issuance and delivery of
            such Shares pursuant  thereto shall comply with all Applicable Laws,
            and shall be further  subject  to the  approval  of counsel  for the
            Company with respect to such compliance.


                                       10
<PAGE>

      (b)   As a condition to the exercise of an Award,  the Company may require
            the person  exercising  such Award to  represent  and warrant at the
            time of any such exercise that the Shares are being  purchased  only
            for  investment  and  without  any  present  intention  to  sell  or
            distribute  such  Shares  if,  in the  opinion  of  counsel  for the
            Company, such a representation is required by any Applicable Laws.

10.   ADJUSTMENTS UPON CHANGES IN CAPITALIZATION

Subject to any required action by the shareholders of the Company, the number of
Shares covered by each  outstanding  Award,  and the number of Shares which have
been  authorized  for issuance under the Plan but as to which no Awards have yet
been granted or which have been  returned to the Plan,  the exercise or purchase
price of each  such  outstanding  Award,  as well as any  other  terms  that the
Administrator  determines require  adjustment shall be proportionately  adjusted
for (i) any increase or decrease in the number of issued Shares resulting from a
stock   split,   reverse   stock   split,   stock   dividend,   combination   or
reclassification  of the  Shares,  (ii) any other  increase  or  decrease in the
number of  issued  Shares  effected  without  receipt  of  consideration  by the
Company,  or (iii) as the  Administrator  may determine in its  discretion,  any
other reorganization transaction with respect to Common Stock; provided, however
that conversion of any convertible securities of the Company shall not be deemed
to have been "effected without receipt of  consideration.  Such adjustment shall
be made by the Administrator and its determination  shall be final,  binding and
conclusive.  Except as the Administrator  determines, no issuance by the Company
of shares of stock of any class, or securities  convertible into shares of stock
of any class,  shall  affect,  and no  adjustment by reason hereof shall be made
with  respect  to,  the  number or price of  Shares  subject  to an  Award.

11.   CORPORATE TRANSACTIONS/CHANGES IN CONTROL/RELATED ENTITY DISPOSITIONS

Except as may be provided in an Award Agreement the Administrator shall have the
authority,  exercisable either in advance of any actual or anticipated Corporate
Transaction,  Change in Control or Related Entity  Disposition or at the time of
an actual Corporate Transaction, Change in Control or Related Entity Disposition
and  exercisable at the time of the grant of an Award under the Plan or any time
while an Award remains  outstanding,  to provide for the full automatic  vesting
and exercisability of one or more outstanding unvested Awards under the Plan and
the release from restrictions on transfer and repurchase or forfeiture rights of
such Awards in  connection  with a Corporate  Transaction,  Change in Control or
Related Entity  Disposition,  on such terms and conditions as the  Administrator
may specify.  The  Administrator  also shall have the authority to condition any
such Award vesting and  exercisability or release from such limitations upon the
subsequent  termination  of the  Continuous  Service  of the  Grantee  within  a
specified  period  following  the effective  date of the Corporate  Transaction,
Change in Control or Related Entity  Disposition.  The Administrator may provide
that any Awards so vested or released from such limitations in connection with a
Change in Control or Related Entity Disposition,  shall remain fully exercisable
until the  expiration or sooner  termination  of the Award.  Effective  upon the
consummation of a Corporate  Transaction,  all outstanding Awards under the Plan
shall terminate unless assumed by the successor company or its parent.

12.   EFFECTIVE DATE AND TERM OF PLAN

The Plan shall become  effective  upon its adoption by the Board of Directors of
the  Company.  It shall  continue in effect for a term of ten (10) years  unless
sooner terminated. Subject to Section 17, below, and Applicable Laws, Awards may
be granted under the Plan upon its becoming effective.

13.   AMENDMENT, SUSPENSION OR TERMINATION OF THE PLAN

      (a)   The Board may at any time amend,  suspend or terminate  the Plan. To
            the extent  necessary to comply with  Applicable  Laws,  the Company
            shall obtain  shareholder  approval of any Plan  amendment in such a
            manner and to such a degree as required.

      (b)   No Award may be granted  during any  suspension of the Plan or after
            termination  of  the  Plan.

      (c)   Any  amendment,  suspension or  termination  of the Plan  (including
            termination  of the Plan  under  Section  13 (a),  above)  shall not
            affect Awards already granted,  and such Awards shall remain in full
            force and effect as if the Plan had not been  amended,  suspended or
            terminated, unless mutually agreed otherwise between the Grantee and
            the Administrator,  which agreement must be in writing and signed by
            the Grantee and the Company.

14.   RESERVATION OF SHARES

      (a)   The Company,  during the term of the Plan, will at all times reserve
            and keep  available  such number of Shares as shall be sufficient to
            satisfy the requirements of the Plan.

      (b)   The inability of the Company to obtain authority from any regulatory
            body having jurisdiction, which authority is deemed by the Company's
            counsel  to be  necessary  to the  lawful  issuance  and sale of any
            Shares  hereunder,  shall  relieve the Company of any  liability  in
            respect of the failure to issue or sell such Shares as to which such
            requisite  authority shall not have been obtained.

15.   NO EFFECT ON TERMS OF EMPLOYMENT/CONSULTING RELATIONSHIP

The Plan  shall not  confer  upon any  Grantee  any right  with  respect  to the
Grantee's  Continuous Service, nor shall it interfere in any way with his or her
right or the Company's  right to terminate the Grantee's  Continuous  Service at
any time, with or without cause.

16.   NO EFFECT ON RETIREMENT AND OTHER BENEFIT PLANS

Except as  specifically  provided in a retirement  or other  benefit plan of the
Company  or a  Related  Entity,  Awards  shall not be  deemed  compensation  for
purposes of computing benefits or contributions under any retirement plan of the
Company or a Related  Entity,  and shall not affect any benefits under any other
benefit plan of any kind or any benefit plan subsequently instituted under which
the availability or amount of benefits is related to level of compensation.


                                       12
<PAGE>

17.   GOVERNING LAW

The Plan shall be governed by the laws of the  Province of British  Columbia and
the laws of  Canada  applicable  therein;  provided,  however,  that  any  Award
Agreement  may provide by its terms that it shall be governed by the laws of any
other jurisdiction as may be deemed appropriate by the parties thereto.
