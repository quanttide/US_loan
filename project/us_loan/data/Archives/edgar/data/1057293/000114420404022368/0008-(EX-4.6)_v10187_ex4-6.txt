                            5% CONVERTIBLE DEBENTURE

                                DECEMBER 15, 2007

No. CCP-1                                                        US$2,500,000.00

         This Convertible Debenture (the "Debenture") is issued on December ___,
2004 (the "Closing Date") by SmarTire Systems, Inc., a corporation organized and
existing  under the laws of the Yukon  Territory  (the  "Company"),  to  Cornell
Capital Partner, LP, a Delaware limited partnership (together with its permitted
successors and assigns,  the "Holder")  pursuant to exemptions from registration
under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended.

                                   ARTICLE I.

         SECTION 1.01 PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST.  For value  received,  the Company
hereby  promises  to pay to the order of the  Holder on  December  ___,  2007 in
lawful money of the United States of America and in immediately  available funds
the   principal  sum  of  Two  Million  Five  Hundred   Thousand  U.S.   Dollars
(US$2,500,000), together with interest on the unpaid principal of this Debenture
at the rate of five  percent  (5%) per year  (computed on the basis of a 365-day
year and the actual days elapsed) from the date of this Debenture until paid. At
the Company's option, the entire principal amount and all accrued interest shall
be either (a) paid to the Holder on the third  (3rd) year  anniversary  from the
date hereof or (b)  converted in accordance  with Section 1.02 herein  provided,
however, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled to convert this Debenture
for a number of shares  of  Common  Stock in excess of that  number of shares of
Common  Stock  which,  upon giving  effect to such  conversion,  would cause the

<PAGE>

aggregate number of shares of Common Stock  beneficially owned by the Holder and
its  affiliates  to exceed 4.99% of the  outstanding  shares of the Common Stock
following such conversion.

         SECTION  1.02  OPTIONAL  CONVERSION.  The  Holder is  entitled,  at its
option, to convert, and sell on the same day, at any time and from time to time,
until payment in full of this Debenture, all or any part of the principal amount
of the Debenture,  plus accrued interest,  into shares (the "Conversion Shares")
of the Company's common stock, no par value ("Common  Stock"),  at the price per
share (the "Conversion Price") equal to the lesser of (a) an amount equal to one
hundred  twenty  percent  (120%) of the closing bid price of the Common Stock as
listed on a Principal  Market (as defined  herein),  as quoted by Bloomberg L.P.
(the  "Fixed  Price") as of the date  hereof,  or (b) an amount  equal to eighty
percent (80%) of the lowest closing bid price of the Company's  Common Stock, as
quoted by Bloomberg, LP, for the five (5) trading days immediately preceding the
Conversion  Date  (as  defined  herein).  Subparagraphs  (a) and (b)  above  are
individually  referred to as a "Conversion  Price".  As used herein,  "Principal
Market"  shall  mean The  National  Association  of  Securities  Dealers  Inc.'s
Over-The-Counter  Bulletin  Board,  Nasdaq  SmallCap  Market,  or American Stock
Exchange.  If the Common Stock is not traded on a Principal Market,  the Closing
Bid Price and/or the VWAP shall mean, the reported Closing Bid Price or the VWAP
for the Common  Stock,  as furnished by the National  Association  of Securities
Dealers,  Inc.,  for the  applicable  periods.  No  fraction  of shares or scrip
representing fractions of shares will be issued on conversion, but the number of
shares  issuable  shall be rounded to the nearest  whole share.  To convert this
Debenture, the Holder hereof shall deliver written notice thereof, substantially
in the form of Exhibit "A" to this Debenture,  with appropriate  insertions (the
"Conversion  Notice"),  to the Company at its address as set forth  herein.  The
date upon which the conversion shall be effective (the "Conversion  Date") shall
be deemed to be the date set forth in the Conversion Notice.

         SECTION 1.03 RESERVATION OF COMMON STOCK. The Company shall reserve and
keep available out of its authorized but unissued shares of Common Stock, solely
for the purpose of effecting the  conversion of this  Debenture,  such number of
shares of Common Stock as shall from time to time be  sufficient  to effect such
conversion, based upon the Conversion Price. If at any time the Company does not
have a sufficient number of Conversion Shares authorized and available, then the
Company shall call and hold a special meeting of its stockholders  within thirty
(30)  days of that  time  for the sole  purpose  of  increasing  the  number  of
authorized shares of Common Stock.

         SECTION 1.04 RIGHT OF REDEMPTION.  The Company at its option shall have
the right to redeem,  with three (3) business days advance  written  notice (the
"Redemption Notice"), a portion or all outstanding  convertible  debenture.  The
redemption  price  shall be one  hundred  twenty  percent  (120%) of the  amount
redeemed plus accrued interest.

         In the event the  Company  exercises  a  redemption  of either all or a
portion  the  Convertible  Debenture,  the  Holder  shall  receive a warrant  to
purchase fifty thousand  (50,000) shares of the Company's Common Stock for every
One  Hundred  Thousand  U.S.  Dollars  (US$100,000)   redeemed,  pro  rata  (the
"Warrant").  The  Warrant  shall be  exercisable  on a "cash  basis" and have an
exercise  price of one hundred twenty percent (120%) of the Closing Bid Price of


                                       2
<PAGE>

the  Company's  Common  Stock  on the  Closing  Date.  The  Warrant  shall  have
"piggy-back" and demand  registration rights and shall survive for two (2) years
from the Closing Date.

         SECTION 1.05 REGISTRATION  RIGHTS. The Company is obligated to register
the  resale of the  Conversion  Shares  under  the  Securities  Act of 1933,  as
amended,  pursuant to the terms of a Registration Rights Agreement,  between the
Company and the Holder of even date herewith (the "Investor  Registration Rights
Agreement").

         SECTION 1.06 INTEREST PAYMENTS. The interest so payable will be paid at
the time of maturity or conversion to the person in whose name this Debenture is
registered.  At the time such  interest  is  payable,  the  Holder,  in its sole
discretion,  may elect to receive  the  interest  in cash (via wire  transfer or
certified  funds) or in the form of Common  Stock.  In the event of default,  as
described in Article III Section 3.01  hereunder,  the Holder may elect that the
interest be paid in cash (via wire  transfer or certified  funds) or in the form
of Common Stock. If paid in the form of Common Stock,  the amount of stock to be
issued  will be  calculated  as  follows:  the value of the  stock  shall be the
Closing Bid Price on: (i) the date the  interest  payment is due; or (ii) if the
interest  payment is not made when due, the date the interest payment is made. A
number of shares of Common  Stock with a value  equal to the amount of  interest
due shall be issued.  No  fractional  shares will be issued;  therefore,  in the
event  that the value of the  Common  Stock  per share  does not equal the total
interest due, the Company will pay the balance in cash.

         SECTION 1.07 PAYING AGENT AND  REGISTRAR.  Initially,  the Company will
act as paying  agent and  registrar.  The Company  may change any paying  agent,
registrar,  or  Company-registrar  by giving  the  Holder not less than ten (10)
business  days' written  notice of its election to do so,  specifying  the name,
address, telephone number and facsimile number of the paying agent or registrar.
The Company may act in any such capacity.

                                  ARTICLE II.

         SECTION 2.01 AMENDMENTS AND WAIVER OF DEFAULT. The Debenture may not be
amended.  Notwithstanding  the above,  without the  consent of the  Holder,  the
Debenture may be amended to cure any ambiguity,  defect or inconsistency,  or to
provide for assumption of the Company obligations to the Holder.

                                  ARTICLE III.

         SECTION  3.01  EVENTS OF  DEFAULT.  An Event of  Default  is defined as
follows:  (a) failure by the Company to pay amounts due hereunder within fifteen
(15) days of the date of maturity of this Debenture;  (b) failure by the Company
to comply with the terms of the Irrevocable Transfer Agent Instructions attached
to the  Securities  Purchase  Agreement;  (c) failure by the Company's  transfer
agent to issue freely  tradeable Common Stock to the Holder within five (5) days
of the Company's  receipt of the attached Notice of Conversion from Holder;  (d)
failure by the Company  for ten (10) days after  notice to it to comply with any
of  its  other  agreements  in  the  Debenture;  (e)  events  of  bankruptcy  or
insolvency;  (f) a breach by the Company of its obligations under the Securities
Purchase  Agreement or the Investor  Registration  Rights Agreement which is not
cured by the  Company  within  ten (10) days after  receipt  of  written  notice
thereof. Upon the occurrence of an Event of Default, the Holder may, in its sole
discretion,  accelerate full repayment of all debentures outstanding and accrued


                                       3
<PAGE>

interest  thereon or may,  notwithstanding  any  limitations  contained  in this
Debenture and/or the Securities Purchase Agreement dated the date hereof between
the  Company  and Cornell  Capital  Partners,  L.P.  (the  "Securities  Purchase
Agreement"),  convert all debentures  outstanding and accrued  interest  thereon
into shares of Common Stock pursuant to Section 1.02 herein.

         SECTION 3.02 FAILURE TO ISSUE  UNRESTRICTED  COMMON STOCK. As indicated
in Article III Section  3.01, a breach by the Company of its  obligations  under
the Investor  Registration Rights Agreement shall be deemed an Event of Default,
which if not cured within ten (10) days,  shall entitle the Holder to accelerate
full repayment of all debentures  outstanding and accrued  interest  thereon or,
notwithstanding   any  limitations   contained  in  this  Debenture  and/or  the
Securities Purchase Agreement, to convert all debentures outstanding and accrued
interest  thereon into shares of Common  Stock  pursuant to Section 1.02 herein.
The Company  acknowledges  that  failure to honor a Notice of  Conversion  shall
cause irreparable harm to the Holder.

                                  ARTICLE IV.

         SECTION 4.01 RIGHTS AND TERMS OF CONVERSION.  This Debenture,  in whole
or in part, may be converted at any time following the Closing Date, into shares
of Common Stock at a price equal to the Conversion Price as described in Section
1.02 above.

         SECTION  4.02  RE-ISSUANCE  OF  DEBENTURE.  When the  Holder  elects to
convert a part of the Debenture,  then the Company shall reissue a new Debenture
in the same form as this Debenture to reflect the new principal amount.

         SECTION 4.03  TERMINATION OF CONVERSION  RIGHTS.  The Holder's right to
convert the Debenture  into the Common Stock in accordance  with  paragraph 4.01
shall  terminate on the date that is the third (3rd) year  anniversary  from the
date hereof and this Debenture shall be automatically  converted on that date in
accordance  with  the  formula  set  forth  in  Section  4.01  hereof,  and  the
appropriate shares of Common Stock and amount of interest shall be issued to the
Holder.

                                   ARTICLE V.

         SECTION 5.01 ANTI-DILUTION.  In the event that the Company shall at any
time subdivide the  outstanding  shares of Common Stock,  or shall issue a stock
dividend  on the  outstanding  Common  Stock,  the  Conversion  Price in  effect
immediately  prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such dividend shall be
proportionately  decreased,  and in the event that the Company shall at any time
combine the outstanding  shares of Common Stock,  the Conversion Price in effect
immediately  prior  to such  combination  shall  be  proportionately  increased,
effective at the close of business on the date of such subdivision,  dividend or
combination as the case may be.

         SECTION 5.02 CONSENT OF HOLDER TO SELL CAPITAL STOCK OR GRANT  SECURITY
INTERESTS.  So long as any of the  principal  of or interest  on this  Debenture
remains unpaid and unconverted, the Company shall not, without the prior consent
of the Holder,  issue or sell (i) any Common  Stock or Preferred  Stock  without
consideration  or for a consideration  per share less than its fair market value
determined  immediately prior to its issuance,  (ii) issue or sell any Preferred
Stock, warrant,  option, right, contract,  call, or other security or instrument


                                       4
<PAGE>

granting  the  holder   thereof  the  right  to  acquire  Common  Stock  without
consideration  or for a  consideration  per share less than such Common  Stock's
fair market value determined immediately prior to its issuance, (iii) enter into
any security  instrument  granting the holder a security  interest in any of the
assets of the Company, or (iv) file any registration statement on Form S-8.

                                  ARTICLE VI.
