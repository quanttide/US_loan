Release:


MEMPHIS, Tenn., Dec 23, 2004 / / Limelight Media Group, Inc. (OTCBB: LMMG ) of
Memphis, TN announced today that it has entered into an agreement to sell 5
million common shares at $0.30 per share plus 6000 media advertising exposures
to American Marketing Complex (AMC) for a total of $3,000,000 cash equivalent.

According to the agreement, American Marketing Complex will purchase one fourth
of the available time on the existing network of 39 stores over the next two
years. This buy represents 6000 media exposure spots with a retail value of
$250.00 per spot for a total of $1,500,000. AMC is paying for the exposures with
cash equivalent credits which may be used by Limelight to offset operational and
capitalization costs over the next two years. Additionally, AMC has the right to
redeem the cash equivalent credits for cash as it places the exposures with
advertisers. Limelight may not use any of the cash equivalent credits until AMC
has placed all the exposures with advertisers.

In addition, to the purchase of the media exposure spots, AMC also agreed to
purchase five million restricted shares in the company for another $1,500,000 in
cash equivalent credits which equates to $0.30 per share. The cash equivalent
credits may be used in combination with cash, to obtain, if and when available,
on a best efforts basis, certain goods and services used in the daily ongoing
business of Limelight Media as well as providing the potential to satisfy
certain other obligations of the Company from time and time.

Norman King, Chairman of American Marketing Complex stated, "We are pleased to
be working with Limelight and really excited about the future of the company."
Norman King, an author of over 20 books, is known as a pioneer of the media
