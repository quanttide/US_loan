                                 I. INTRODUCTION

      Premier Concepts, Inc., d/b/a Impostors, Impostors Copy Jewels, Elegant
Pretenders, Premier Jewelry and Joli Joli, is the debtor in a Chapter 11
bankruptcy case. On October 10, 2003, Premier Concepts, Inc. commenced a
bankruptcy case by filing a voluntary Chapter 11 petition under the United
States Bankruptcy Code ("Code"), 11 U.S.C. Section 101 ET SEQ. Chapter 11 allows
the Debtor, and under some circumstances, creditors and others parties in
interest, to propose a plan of reorganization ("Plan"). This document is the
Chapter 11 Plan ("Plan") proposed by Premier Concepts, Inc. ("Proponent" or
"Debtor"). Sent to you in the same envelope as this document is the Disclosure
Statement which has been approved by the Court, and which is provided to help
you understand the Plan.


                                       1
<PAGE>

      The Plan is a reorganizing plan. The Proponent seeks to accomplish
reorganization by restructuring its debt and making payments under the Plan;
canceling existing stock in the Debtor, issuing new stock (the "New
Securities"); acquiring the stock of another company in exchange for a portion
of the New Securities, which acquired company will become a wholly owned
subsidiary of the Reorganized Debtor; and continuing its business operations
under new management.

      Distributions under the Plan will be from the Debtor's operations.

      The Debtor's secured creditors, Bank One, Stephlaur, Inc. and Yurman
Designs, Inc., shall receive monthly cash payments of principal and interest
until their claims are paid in full. Secured creditor G. David Gordon, Jr.,
shall receive an unsecured convertible promissory note in full satisfaction of
Gordon's secured claim. Post-petition administrative secured claimant Clark
Capital Corp. shall receive common stock in the Reorganized Debtor in full
satisfaction of its post-petition DIP financing administrative expense
obligation of $250,000.

      Unsecured creditors will receive ten percent of their allowed claims which
will be paid in two installments, one-half (1/2) on January 15, 2005 and the
balance on January 15, 2006.

      Subject only to Confirmation of the Plan, and pursuant to the Plan,
Premier has entered into a binding agreement with the owners of all outstanding
shares of USN Television Group, Inc. ("USN") for the acquisition by Premier of
all outstanding USN stock. USN is a retail seller of consumer products through
interactive electronic media including broadcast, cable and satellite television
and the internet. The Debtor believes that the acquisition of USN will
substantially enhance its consolidated balance sheet, cash flow and
profitability.

      The current owners of USN, Messrs. M. Reinstein and Brian Kelly are also
principals of The Archetype Group, Inc. ("Archetype") which is managing the
Debtor's operations pursuant to a Management Consulting and Corporate Governance
Agreement (the "Management Agreement"). These current owners of USN shall
receive 4,850,000 shares of the Reorganized Debtor's New Securities in exchange
for their shares in USN.

      USN has recently been advanced one million dollars by Philip Wasserman and
the Philip Roy Fund (the "New USN Investors") in exchange for convertible
promissory notes which the New USN Investors may convert into USN stock. Neither
Mr. Wasserman nor the Philip Roy Fund, a hedge fund registered with the SEC,
have any prior relationship or affiliation with the Debtor. Prior to Plan
confirmation, the New USN Investors will convert their USN debt into USN stock
and will receive approximately 700,000 shares of the New Securities in exchange
for their USN stock. On confirmation of the Plan, the Reorganized Debtor will
change its name from Premier Concepts, Inc. to USN Corporation, and continue the
operations of the combined entities.

            III. CLASSIFICATION AND TREATMENT OF CLAIMS AND INTERESTS

A.    GENERAL OVERVIEW

      As required by the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan classifies claims and
interests in various classes according to their right to priority. The Plan
states whether each class of claims or interests is impaired or unimpaired. The
Plan provides the treatment each class will receive under the Plan.

B.    UNCLASSIFIED CLAIMS

      Certain types of claims are not placed into voting classes; instead they
are unclassified. They are not considered impaired and they do not vote on the
Plan because they are automatically entitled to specific treatment provided for
them in the Bankruptcy Code. As such, the Proponent has NOT placed the following
claims in a class. The treatment of these claims is provided below.

1.          ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      Administrative expenses are claims for costs or expenses of administering
the Debtor's Chapter 11 case which are allowed under Code Section 507(a)(1). The
Code requires that all administrative claims be paid on the Effective Date of
the Plan, unless a particular claimant agrees to a different treatment.

      The following chart estimates the Debtor's Section. 507(a)(1)
administrative claims (leasehold administrative rent claims asserted by lessors
are listed in Exhibit "L") and their treatment under this Plan.

      COURT APPROVAL OF FEES REQUIRED:

      Other than fees for the Clerk's Office and UST, the Court must rule on all
professional fees which may be sought before the fees will be owed. For all fees
except Clerk's Office fees and U.S. Trustee's fees, the professional in question
must file and serve a properly noticed fee application and the Court must rule
on the application. Only the amount of fees allowed by the Court will be owed
and required to be paid under the Plan.

      As indicated above, the Debtor will need to pay approximately $285,000 of
administrative claims (or perhaps more or less) as soon after the Effective Date
as the Court approves such fees and costs. As indicated elsewhere in this Plan,
Debtor will have more than ample cash on hand on the Effective Date of the Plan.
The source of this cash will be from the acquisition of USN and the Debtor's own
operating capital.

a.          BAR DATE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

            i)    PROFESSIONALS

      All professionals requesting compensation or reimbursement of expenses for
services performed before the Effective Date of the Plan are required to file
with the Bankruptcy Court and deliver to the attorneys for the Debtor an
application for final allowance of compensation and reimbursement of expenses no
later than forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. The Debtor shall
calendar a hearing on the applications and give notice of the hearing in
accordance with the Local Bankruptcy Rules. Professional services rendered for
the Debtor after the Effective Date shall not be the subjects of fee
applications and shall be paid directly by the Reorganized Debtor pursuant to
such arrangement as may be agreed to by the parties.


            ii)   NON-PROFESSIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS WHICH ARE NOT IN
                  ORDINARY COURSE

      All holders of Administrative Claims requesting compensation of
administrative costs and expenses incurred on or before the Effective Date for
administrative claims incurred outside the ordinary course of business pursuant
to Bankruptcy Code section 507(a)(1) or 507(b) or the terms hereof (except for
post-petition date claims for professional fees incurred during the Chapter 11
case, and claims under 28 U.S.C. Section. 1930) must file and serve an
application for such costs and expenses no later than 30 days after the
Effective Date. Any holder of an Administrative Claim not yet allowed or listed
on Exhibit "L" to the Disclosure Statement that does not file an application for
payment of such Claim or expense by the deadline set forth in the Plan SHALL BE
FOREVER BARRED from asserting such Claim against the Debtor, the estate, the
Reorganized Debtor, their successors, assigns, or their respective property and
shall receive no distribution under the Plan or otherwise on account of such
Claim.

            iii)  ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

            v)    Payment of all administrative expenses incurred in the
                  ordinary course of the Debtor's business shall be paid in the
                  ordinary course without further application.

2.          PRIORITY TAX CLAIMS

      Priority tax claims are certain unsecured income, employment and other
taxes described by Code Section 507(a)(8). The Code requires that each holder of
such a 507(a)(8) priority tax claim receive the present value of such claim in
deferred cash payments, over a period not exceeding six years from the date of
the assessment of such tax. The Reorganized Debtor shall deposit with the Plan
Trust, sufficient funds for the Disbursing Agent to pay the quarterly priority
tax payments pursuant to the Plan.

      The following chart lists ALL of the Debtor's Section 507(a)(8) priority
tax claims and their treatment under this Plan.

      Certain priority claims that are referred to in Code Sections 507(a)(3),
(4), (5), (6), and (7) are required to be placed in classes. These types of
claims are entitled to priority treatment as follows: the Code requires that
each holder of such a claim receive cash on the Effective Date equal to the
allowed amount of such claim. However, a class of unsecured priority claim
holders may vote to accept deferred cash payments of a value, as of the
Effective Date, equal to the allowed amount of such claims.

claims to $200.00. These are unsecured claims not entitled to priority under
section 507(a) except that they have been placed in a convenience class and are
therefore treated as provided in the chart below.

      The equity interest of existing shareholders in the Debtor is reduced to
approximately 6%. Nevertheless their continued ownership of stock in the
R3.
eorganized Debtor is critical to the reorganization. The Debtor believes that
as a public company it must retain a count of approximately 500 shareholders,
and that without such a shareholder base, it will incur risk of manipulation of
its stock price. Moreover, without such a base trading volume in its stock must
suffer dramatically; its prospective ability to reach the stock values which it
has estimated in this plan is threatened significantly, as is its agreement for
the acquisition of USN, and therefore its ability to fund the Plan and properly
fund its operations.

D.    MEANS OF EFFECTUATING THE PLAN

      1.    ACQUISITION OF USN

      Immediately prior to and subject to Plan Confirmation and the occurrence
of the Effective Date, the Debtor shall acquire all outstanding stock of USN,
including without limitation, the stock of Philip Wasserman and The Philip Roy
Fund, each of whom shall have converted the entireties of the convertible note
obligations owed to them by USN to stock in USN. To the extent that up to an
additional $2 million is advanced to USN in exchange for convertible notes prior
to Plan Confirmation, they shall be converted to equity in USN and then in the
Debtor at a percentage equal to not less than $1.42 of debt per share of the
Reorganized Debtor. The Debtor believes that the private placement is also
exempt under Section. 1145 of the Bankruptcy Code. At the option of Messrs.
Reinstein, Kelly, Wasserman and The Philip Roy Fund, the Reorganized Debtor
shall seek to have their shares filed for registration with the Securities
Exchange Commission at the earliest time at which the Reorganized Debtor is
reasonably able to so do.

Class 7 Claims.

2.          FUNDING FOR THE PLAN

4.          INCENTIVE PLAN FOR DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS

      The Reorganized Debtor shall set aside 300,000 shares of New Securities as
part of an incentive package for current officers and directors to be

period of one year from date of issuance.

5.          DISBURSING AGENT

      The Reorganized Debtor shall act as the Disbursing Agent for the purpose

services rendered and expenses incurred pursuant to the Plan.

      The Disbursing Agent shall make payments to Class 7 Allowed Claimants pro
rata. If, on a distribution date, a Class 7 Claim has neither been allowed nor
disallowed, the Disbursing Agent shall segregate the amount which might
otherwise be paid on such claim if allowed and pay the same if and when the
claim is allowed.


                                       27
<PAGE>

a.          Delivery of Distributions in General

      Distributions to holders of allowed claims shall be made: (a) at the
addresses set forth in the proofs of claim filed by such holders; (b) at the
addresses set forth in any written notices of address change delivered to the
Debtor or to the Disbursing Agent after the date on which any related proof of
claim was filed; or (c) at the addresses reflected in the Schedules relating to
the applicable claim if no proof of claim was filed and the Disbursing Agent
received no written notice of a change of address.

b.          UNDELIVERABLE DISTRIBUTIONS

      If the distribution to any holder of an allowed claim is returned to the
Disbursing Agent as undeliverable, no further distribution shall be made to such
holder unless and until the Disbursing Agent is notified in writing of such
holder's then current address. Any holder of an allowed claim who does not
assert a claim pursuant to the Plan for an undeliverable distribution to be made
by the Disbursing Agent within six months after the date on which the
distribution is returned to the Disbursing Agent shall have its claim for such
undeliverable distribution discharged and shall be forever barred from asserting
any such claim for an undeliverable distribution against the Debtor, the
Reorganized Debtor or either of their property or against the Disbursing Agent.
In such a case, any cash held for distribution on account of such claim for
undeliverable distributions shall become property of the Reorganized Debtor.


                                       28
<PAGE>

c.          COMPLIANCE WITH TAX REQUIREMENTS

appropriate to effectuate any amendments to the Reorganized Debtor's Articles of
Incorporation, Bylaws and other organizational documents consistent with the
Plan, and the President of the Reorganized Debtor shall be authorized to

<PAGE>


      The order confirming the Plan shall constitute an order approving the
rejection of a lease or contract that has not been assumed or the subject of a
motion seeking assumption. If you are a party to a contract or lease to be
rejected and you object to the rejection of your contract or lease, you must
file and serve your objection to the proposed rejection within the deadline for
objecting to the confirmation of the Plan. See Section I.B.3 of the Disclosure

EXECUTORY CONTRACT OR AN UNEXPIRED LEASE MUST BE FILED WITHIN 30 DAYS AFTER SAID
PARTY IS SERVED WITH WRITTEN NOTICE THAT SAID CONTRACT OR LEASE HAS BEEN
REJECTED BY THE BANKRUPTCY ESTATE, OR BY DECEMBER 7, 2004, WHICHEVER DATE IS
LATER. Any claim based on the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired
lease will be barred if the proof of claim is not timely filed, unless the Court
later orders otherwise.

B.    CHANGES IN RATES SUBJECT TO REGULATORY COMMISSION APPROVAL

      This Debtor is not subject to governmental regulatory commission approval
of its rates.

C.    RETENTION OF JURISDICTION

Plan.

B.    REVESTING OF PROPERTY IN THE DEBTOR

subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, revests all of the property of
the estate in the Reorganized Debtor.

C.    MODIFICATION OF PLAN

confirmation. However, the Court may require a new disclosure statement and/or
revoting on the Plan if Proponent modifies the Plan before confirmation.

after confirmation only if (1) the Plan has not been substantially consummated
AND (2) if the Court authorizes the proposed modifications after notice and a
hearing.

E.    CLAIMS INJUNCTION

      From and after the Effective Date, except as otherwise expressly provided

transaction or other activity of any kind or nature satisfied, released or
discharged under the Plan to the fullest extent available under the Bankruptcy
Code.

F.    SATISFACTION AND TERMINATION

      Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Plan or the Confirmation

proceeding; (b) enforcing, attaching, collecting or recovering in any manner any

<PAGE>

G.    POST-CONFIRMATION STATUS REPORT

      Within 120 days of the entry of the order confirming the Plan, Plan
Proponent shall file a status report with the Court explaining what progress has
been made toward consummation of the confirmed Plan. The status report shall be
served on the United States Trustee, the twenty largest unsecured creditors, and
those parties who have requested special notice. Further status reports shall be
filed every 120 days and served on the same entities.

H.    POST-CONFIRMATION CONVERSION/DISMISSAL

      A creditor or party in interest may bring a motion to convert or dismiss
the case under Section. 1112(b), after the Plan is confirmed, if there is a
default in performing the Plan. If the Court orders the case converted to
Chapter 7 after the Plan is confirmed, then all property of the Reorganized
Debtor that has not been disbursed pursuant to the Plan, will revest in the
Chapter 7 estate. The automatic stay will be reimposed upon the revested
property, but only to the extent that relief from stay was not previously
authorized by the Court during this case.


                                       36
<PAGE>

      The order confirming the Plan may also be revoked under very limited
circumstances. The Court may revoke the order if the order of confirmation was
procured by fraud and if the party in interest brings an adversary proceeding to
revoke confirmation within 180 days after the entry of the order of
confirmation.

      Each holder of an Allowed Class 7 Claim shall have standing and the right
to bring an action to enforce the rights afforded to all holders of Class 7
Claims, including, but not limited to, the rights to payment granted in this
Plan, on behalf of all holders of claims in Class 7. If, at any time, the
Reorganized Debtor is in default of its obligations under this Plan to holders
of Allowed Class 7 Claims, or any of them, then the Reorganized Debtor shall
bear and be liable for, including the reimbursement of any entity paying or
providing, any and all legal or professional fees and expenses incurred by any
creditor seeking to enforce the Reorganized Debtor's obligations under this
Plan, including the obligations and guarantees of any of the Debtor's or
Reorganized Debtor's subsidiaries or affiliates. To the extent allowed under the
law, such obligations shall be an administrative expense of the Debtor's estate,
or any chapter 7 estate arising from conversion of this Case.

I.    FINAL DECREE

Rule 3022, the Plan Proponent, or other party as the Court shall designate in
the Plan Confirmation Order, shall file a motion with the Court to obtain a
final decree to close the case.
