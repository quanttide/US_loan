ITEM 1.01   ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

As a part of the plan of reorganization approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the
Central District of California, Los Angeles, California, USN Corporation (the
"Company") will acquire USN Television Group, Inc., a Delaware corporation
("USN"). The terms of the acquisition, the consideration paid, the principle
followed in determining the amount of the consideration, the identity of the
persons from whom USN will be acquired, and the material relationships between
the Company and the persons from whom USN will be acquired are discussed under
Item 1.03.

ITEM 1.03   BANKRUPTCY OR RECEIVERSHIP

On December 13, 2004 (defined as one day after the entry of the confirmation
order) (the "Effective Date") of the plan of reorganization for USN Corporation
as approved by the Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California, Los
Angeles, California, the common stock and preferred stock of the Company will be
reclassified, the management of the Company will be changed, and certain shares
of common stock of the Company will be issued, all as discussed below.

                      SUMMARY OF THE PLAN OF REORGANIZATION

A.    THE PRINCIPAL ELEMENTS

      The elements of the Plan proposed by the Proponent are as follows:

  1.  The change of the Reorganized Debtor's name, Premier Concepts, Inc., to
      USN Corporation;
  2.  The acquisition of USN;
  3.  The classification and treatment of creditors and interest holders;
  4.  The issuance of New Securities of Reorganized Debtor to certain
      administrative claimants, USN shareholders and the Plan Trust; and
  5.  The liquidation of the New Securities to fund Plan payments.

B.    ACQUISITION OF USN

      All outstanding shares of USN will be acquired by the Debtor from the USN
owners in exchange for New Securities with registration rights, whereby, the
Reorganized Debtor has agreed to file a registration statement with the SEC in
the near term. The New Securities will be exempt under the Bankruptcy Code and
as a private placement the shares will be issued in exchange for the obligation
owed by the Debtor to USN's shareholders for the acquisition of their stock
immediately prior to Plan confirmation. New Securities will be issued to the USN
owners as follows:

      USN will be a wholly owned subsidiary of the Reorganized Debtor. USN and
the Debtor will maintain a consolidated balance sheet and income statement and
will file consolidated tax returns.

      The Reorganized Debtor will enter into a consulting agreement with The
Archetype Group, Inc. ("TAG") whereby they will assist the Reorganized Debtor in
areas which include strategic business development, investor and public
relations, financial review and analysis, Broadcast TV/Satellite TV/Cable TV
relations, and retail store oversight among other services. The Reorganized
Debtor will also enter into an agreement with Transact Media Corporation ("TMC")
which will license technology to the Reorganized Debtor. TMC will provide the
Reorganized Debtor with its fully integrated web-based technology platform and
advanced database system which manages fulfillment, inventory control, sales and
service, among other things. TAG and TMC are wholly owned by Messrs. Reinstein
and Kelly. TAG will receive 550,000 shares of the Company's common stock in
exchange for services performed as administrative expenses.

      As previously mentioned, an opinion concerning the reasonableness of the
Reorganized Debtor's acquisition of USN pursuant to the Plan is attached hereto
as Exhibit K. However, there is no assurance as to the value of New Securities
to be issued pursuant to the Plan. USN's annual revenue for the year ended
December 31, 2003 was $3.57 million, according to the unaudited financial
statements attached hereto as Exhibit J.

      USN's net sales figures for its first year of operations were based on 12
hours of weekly programming. In May 2004, USN significantly expanded its
programming reach to include over 80 hours per week of live shopping.
Programming is now run 7 days per week for 11 hours each day from 6:00 p.m. to
5:00 a.m. Pacific Time (with an additional 8 hours of daytime programming on the
weekends). USN currently broadcasts in over 29 million homes nationwide which
include 14 million DirecTV subscribers, 6.9 million cable subscribers and 8.4
million Dish Network/Echostar subscribers. USN believes that it is now on a run
rate to earn over $12 million in revenue in its second year of operations.

      USN believes that it has developed a unique television commerce model that
distinguishes it in the marketplace from its competitors. The customer base
loyalty has resulted in repeat customers generating over 70% of USN's revenues.
USN believes that its average sale is over $700 which is substantially higher
than the industry norm and that the company has already developed an extremely
high-end clientele that is prized heavily in the public markets. USN reports
that its top 50 customers have already spent over $5,000 at USN within the last
90 days and over 40 customers have each already spent over $20,000 at USN in the
last 9 months. Within the last year, USN's top 3 customers have spent $185,000,
$100,000 and $70,000 respectively. USN believes that this level of spending is
highly distinguishable from the leading shopping networks who position
themselves as mass marketers as opposed to luxury retailers. USN and the Debtor
believe that the public markets will place a premium on a luxury brand like USN
due to the spending habits and loyalty of its customer base.

      USN believes it has already built the necessary infrastructure which it
believes will enable it to exponentially expand its reach without a substantial
increase in infrastructure costs. USN reports that it has developed a
proprietary technology platform that provides real time order management,
inventory control, customer service, fulfillment, vendor management, and
e-commerce functionality, which is highly scalable and efficient and enables USN
to scale its operations with minimal additional costs and a limited additional
headcount. USN has also built a state of the art broadcast production center
which will decrease its production costs and enhance its production quality.

C.    WHAT CREDITORS AND INTEREST HOLDERS WILL RECEIVE UNDER THE PROPOSED PLAN

      As required by the Bankruptcy Code, the Plan classifies claims and
interests in various classes according to their right to priority. The Plan
states whether each class of claims or interests is impaired or unimpaired. The
Plan provides the treatment each class will receive.

D.    UNCLASSIFIED CLAIMS

      Certain types of claims are not placed into voting classes; instead they
are unclassified. They are not considered impaired and they do not vote on the
Plan because they are automatically entitled to specific treatment provided for
them in the Bankruptcy Code. As such, the Proponent has NOT placed the following
claims in a class.

      1.    ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      Administrative expenses are claims for costs or expenses of administering
the Debtor's Chapter 11 case which are allowed under Code Section 507(a)(1). The
Code requires that all administrative claims be paid on the Effective Date of
the Plan, unless a particular claimant agrees to a different treatment.

      The following chart estimates the Debtor's ss. 507(a)(1) administrative
claims (leasehold administrative rent claims asserted by lessors are listed in
Exhibit "L") and their treatment under the Plan:

<PAGE>


      As indicated above, the Debtor will need to pay approximately $285,000 of
administrative claims (or perhaps more or less) as soon after the Effective Date
as the Court approves such fees and costs.

A.    BAR DATE FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      i.    PROFESSIONALS

      All professionals requesting compensation or reimbursement of expenses for
services performed before the Effective Date of the Plan are required to file
with the Bankruptcy Court and deliver to the attorneys for the Debtor an
application for final allowance of compensation and reimbursement of expenses no
later than forty-five (45) days after the Effective Date. The Debtor shall
calendar a hearing on the applications and give notice of the hearing in
accordance with the Local Bankruptcy Rules. Professional services rendered for
the Debtor after the Effective Date shall not be the subjects of fee
applications and shall be paid directly by the Reorganized Debtor pursuant to
such arrangement as may be agreed to by the parties.

      ii.   NON-PROFESSIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE CLAIMS WHICH ARE NOT IN ORDINARY
      COURSE

      All holders of Administrative Claims requesting compensation of
administrative costs and expenses incurred on or before the Effective Date for
administrative claims incurred outside the ordinary course of business pursuant
to Bankruptcy Code section 507(a)(1) or 507(b) or the terms hereof (except for

case, and claims under 28 U.S.C. ss. 1930) must file and serve an application
for such costs and expenses no later than 30 days after the Effective Date. Any
holder of an Administrative Claim not yet allowed or listed on Exhibit "L" to

Claim or expense by the deadline set forth in the Plan SHALL BE FOREVER BARRED
from asserting such Claim against the Debtor, the estate, the Reorganized
Debtor, their successors, assigns, or their respective property and shall
receive no distribution under the Plan or otherwise on account of such Claim.

                                        8

<PAGE>


      iii.  ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

      Payment of all administrative expenses incurred in the ordinary course of
the Debtor's business shall be paid in the ordinary course without further
application.

      2.    PRIORITY TAX CLAIMS

      Priority tax claims are certain unsecured income, employment and other
taxes described by Code Section 507(a)(8). The Code requires that each holder of
such a 507(a)(8) priority tax claim receive the present value of such claim in
deferred cash payments, over a period not exceeding six years from the date of
the assessment of such tax. The Reorganized Debtor shall deposit with the Plan
Trust, sufficient funds for the Disbursing Agent to pay the quarterly priority
tax payments pursuant to the Plan.

      The following chart lists ALL of the Debtor's Section 507(a)(8) priority
tax claims and their treatment under this Plan.

2.          CLASSES OF PRIORITY UNSECURED CLAIMS

Certain priority claims that are referred to in Code Sections 507(a)(3), (4),
(5), (6), and (7) are required to be placed in classes. These types of claims
are entitled to priority treatment as follows: the Code requires that each
holder of such a claim receive cash on the Effective Date equal to the allowed
amount of such claim. However, a class of unsecured priority claim holders may
vote to accept deferred cash payments of a value, as of the Effective Date,
equal to the allowed amount of such claims.

The Debtor does not believe it has any section 507(a)(3), (a)(4), (a)(5),
(a)(6), and (a)(7) priority unsecured claims.

                                                                 16

3.          CLASS OF ADMINISTRATIVE CONVENIENCE UNSECURED CLAIMS

      Administrative Convenience Unsecured Claims are unsecured claims in the
amounts of $200.00 or less including those claimants who elect to reduce their
claims to $200.00. These are unsecured claims not entitled to priority under
section 507(a) except that they have been placed in a convenience class and are
therefore treated as provided in the chart below.

5.        CLASS OF INTEREST HOLDERS

      Interest holders are the parties who hold ownership interest (i.e., equity
interest) in the Debtor. If the Debtor is a corporation, entities holding
preferred or common stock in the Debtor are interest holders. If the Debtor is a
partnership, the interest holders include both general and limited partners. If
the Debtor is an individual, the Debtor is the interest holder. The following
chart identifies the Plan's treatment of the class of interest holders (see

====================================================================================================================================
</TABLE>

      The equity interest of existing shareholders in the Debtor is reduced to
approximately 6%. Nevertheless their continued ownership of stock in the
Reorganized Debtor is critical to the reorganization. The Debtor believes that
as a public company it must retain a count of approximately 500 shareholders,
and that without such a shareholder base, it will incur risk of manipulation of
its stock price. Moreover, without such a base, trading volume in its stock must
suffer dramatically; its prospective ability to reach the stock values which it
has estimated in this disclosure statement is threatened significantly, as is
its agreement for the acquisition of USN, and therefore its ability to fund its
Plan and properly fund its operations.

The activity in the Company's common stock is summarized in Item 3.02.

The Company's November 2004 report filed with the office of the United States
Trustee is attached as Exhibit 99.1.


                                                                 18

ITEM 2.01   COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS

As part of the plan of reorganization approved by the Bankruptcy Court, the
Company will acquire USN. The terms of the acquisition, the consideration paid,
the principle followed in determining the amount of the consideration, the
identity of the persons from whom USN will be acquired, and the material
relationships between the Company and the persons from whom USN will be acquired
are discussed under Item 1.03. There follows a brief description of USN.

                                     GENERAL

USN was incorporated in 2003 as a Delaware corporation. USN Television Group,
Inc., is a retail seller of consumer products through interactive electronic
media including broadcast, cable and satellite television and the Internet.

USN believes it has developed a unique television commerce model that targets
consumers looking to purchase high-end merchandise at discounted prices. The
average ticket price for a USN sale is over $700 which is quite distinguishable
from other television commerce companies. USN focuses on presenting high-end
consumer products at attractive price points that can leverage the visual appeal
of television including jewelry, collectibles and entertainment products.

USN purchases, or obtains (usually on consignment), products from manufacturers
and wholesalers, often on favorable terms based on the volume of the
transactions. USN's programming is transmitted by satellite to cable television
systems, direct broadcast satellite (DBS) systems and television broadcasting
stations across the United States.

USN's television revenues are primarily generated from sales of merchandise and
services offered through its television home shopping programming. USN's
programs feature on-air television personalities in a friendly and informal
sales environment resembling a traditional talk show or interview program. USN
utilizes live television to create an interactive and entertaining atmosphere to
effectively describe and demonstrate its merchandise. USN believes its customers
make purchases based primarily on convenience, value and quality of merchandise.

USN segments its programming into product or theme categories and each program
uses a show-host approach, with the host conveying information about the
products and demonstrating their use. The viewers can purchase any product USN
offers, subject to availability. USN seeks to differentiate itself from other
televised shopping programmers by utilizing an exciting and entertaining style
of presentation and by offering unique and innovative products.

                                    PRODUCTS

USN sells a variety of consumer products and accessories including jewelry and
collectibles. USN obtains products from manufacturers and wholesalers and is
often able to make purchases on favorable terms based on the volume of the
transactions. One of the Company's strategies is to have products produced to
its specifications or designed exclusively for sale by USN.

<PAGE>


                                  DISTRIBUTION

USN ships merchandise to its customers promptly from its distribution center in
Los Angeles, CA.

                                PROGRAM CARRIERS

USN's business is highly dependent on its affiliation with Program Carriers for
the transmission of the USN programming to cable, broadcast and satellite
television homes.

USN has entered into media distribution agreements with cable, broadcast and
satellite television providers to carry the USN programming on their platforms.

                                  RISK FACTORS

In addition to the general investment risks and those factors set forth
throughout this document (including those set forth under the caption
"Cautionary Statement Concerning Forward-Looking Information"), the following
risks should be considered regarding the Company.

THE COMPANY HAS A HISTORY OF LOSSES AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN
PROFITABLE OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

The Company experienced an operating loss of $268,537 in fiscal year 2003. There
is no assurance that the Company will be able to achieve or maintain profitable
operations in future fiscal years.

INTENSE COMPETITION IN THE GENERAL MERCHANDISE RETAILING INDUSTRY AND
PARTICULARLY LIVE HOME SHOPPING COULD LIMIT THE COMPANY'S GROWTH AND REDUCE ITS
PROFITABILITY.

                                       20
<PAGE>

As a general merchandise retailer, the Company competes for consumer
expenditures with other forms of retail businesses, including department,
discount, warehouse and specialty stores, television home shopping, mail order
and catalog companies and other direct sellers. The catalog and direct mail
industry includes a wide variety of specialty and general merchandise retailers
and is both highly fragmented and competitive. The Company also competes with
retailers who sell and market their products through the highly competitive
Internet. In addition, as the use of the Internet increases, larger,
well-established and well-financed entities may continue to acquire, invest in
or form joint ventures with providers of e-commerce and direct marketing
solutions, and existing providers of e-commerce and direct marketing solutions
may continue to consolidate. Any of these trends would increase the competition
with respect to the Company. The Company also competes with a wide variety of
department, discount and specialty stores, which have greater financial,
distribution and marketing resources than the Company. The home shopping
industry is also highly competitive and is dominated by two companies, HSN and
QVC. The Company's television home shopping programming also competes directly
with HSN, QVC, SHOPNBC, SATH and ACN for cable distribution in virtually all of
the Company's markets. The Company is at a competitive disadvantage in
attracting viewers due to the fact that the Company's programming is not carried
full-time in all of its markets, and the Company may have less desirable cable
channels in many markets. QVC, HSN and SHOPNBC are well-established and reach a
significantly larger percentage of United States television households than the
Company's broadcast, while offering home shopping programming similar to the
Company through cable systems, owned or affiliated full and low power television
stations and directly to satellite dish owners. The television home shopping
industry is also experiencing vertical integration. QVC, HSN and SATH are all
affiliated with cable operators or cable networks serving significant numbers of
subscribers nationwide. While the Cable Television Consumer Protection and
Competition Act of 1992 includes provisions designed to prohibit coercion and
discrimination in favor of such affiliated programmers, the FCC has decided that
it will rule on the scope and effect of these provisions on a case-by-case
basis. In 2004, SATH and Scripps announced the completion of a transaction that
resulted in Scripps obtaining a 100% ownership interest in the SATH
television-retailing network. Scripps is a media company with interests in
newspaper publishing, broadcast television, national cable television networks
and interactive media. QVC is owned by Liberty Media Corp. HSN is a wholly owned
subsidiary of InterActiveCorp. Liberty Media, Scripps and InterActiveCorp are
larger, more diversified and have greater financial, marketing and distribution
resources than the Company. SHOPNBC is partially owned by General Electric and
utilizes the distribution resources of its NBC-Universal Subsidiary.

THE CONSOLIDATION OF CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION SERVICE PROVIDERS COULD
LIMIT THE COMPANY'S PROGRAM DISTRIBUTION ALTERNATIVES AND RESTRICT THE COMPANY'S
ABILITY TO EXECUTE FAVORABLE CABLE AFFILIATION CONTRACTS IN THE FUTURE.

The television home shopping and cable television industries are undergoing
consolidation, with large, well-established enterprises acquiring less
well-established, less well-financed entities in the industry. The competitive
pressures arising as a result of this industry consolidation include greater
importance on increasing programming distributions and customer penetration. On
December 19, 2001, AT&T Corp. ("AT&T") and Comcast Corporation ("Comcast")
announced the execution of a definitive agreement to combine AT&T Broadband with
Comcast. The new company, called AT&T Comcast Corporation ("AT&T Comcast"), has
approximately 22 million subscribers. AT&T Comcast's assets consist of both
companies' cable TV systems, as well as AT&T's interests in cable television
joint ventures and its 25.5 percent interest in Time Warner Entertainment, E!
Entertainment, The Golf Channel, and other entertainment properties. The
continued consolidation of the television home shopping, cable television and
broadcasting industries may result in fewer alternatives for the Company's
programming distribution and may also restrict the Company's opportunity to
execute economically favorable cable affiliation contracts in the future.

A NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS MAY BE TERMINATED
UPON SHORT NOTICE OR NOT RENEWED UPON EXPIRATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
SALES GROWTH IN THE COMPANY'S HOME SHOPPING BUSINESS.

                                       21
<PAGE>


A number of the Company's television distribution agreements are terminable by
either party upon 30 days or less notice. The Company's television home shopping
business could be materially adversely affected in the event that a significant
number of its cable television distribution agreements are terminated or not
renewed on acceptable terms.

THE COMPANY MAY NOT BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS SATELLITE SERVICES IN CERTAIN
UNCONTROLLABLE SITUATIONS, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY'S PROGRAMMING TO GO OFF
THE AIR FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND INCUR SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL COSTS TO THE
COMPANY.

The Company's programming is presently distributed to cable systems, full power
television stations and satellite dish owners via a leased communications fiber
line which connects it to various media distributor's satellite transponders. In
the future, satellite service may be interrupted due to a variety of
circumstances beyond the Company's control, such as satellite transponder
failure, satellite fuel depletion, governmental action, preemption by the
satellite lessor and service failure. The Company could arrange for back-up
service, on a first-come first-serve basis, if satellite transmission is
interrupted. However, there can be no assurance that the Company will be able to
maintain such arrangements and the Company may incur substantial additional
costs to enter into new arrangements and be unable to broadcast its signal for
some period of time.

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS FOR ON AIR
MISREPRESENTATIONS OR IF PEOPLE OR PROPERTIES ARE HARMED BY PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE
COMPANY.

Products sold by the Company and representations related to such products may
expose the Company to potential liability from claims by purchasers of such
products, subject to the Company's rights, in certain instances, to seek
indemnification against such liability from the manufacturers of such products.
In addition to potential claims of personal injury, wrongful death or damage to
personal property, the live unscripted nature of the Company's television
broadcasting may subject the Company to claims of misrepresentation by its
customers, the Federal Trade Commission and state attorneys general. The Company
has generally required the manufacturers and vendors of these products to carry
product liability and errors and omissions insurance, although in certain
instances the vendor may not be formally required to carry product liability
insurance. There can be no assurance that such parties will continue to maintain
this insurance or that this coverage will be adequate or even available with
respect to any particular claims. There can be no assurance that the Company
will be able to maintain such coverage or obtain additional coverage on
acceptable terms, or that such insurance will provide adequate coverage against
all potential claims or even available with respect to any particular claim.

THE COMPANY PLACES A SIGNIFICANT RELIANCE ON TECHNOLOGY AND INFORMATION
MANAGEMENT TOOLS TO RUN ITS EXISTING BUSINESSES, BROADCAST FACILITIES AND
FULFILLMENT FACILITIES, THE FAILURE OF WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE
COMPANY'S OPERATIONS.

                                       22
<PAGE>


The Company's businesses are dependent, in part, on the use of sophisticated
technology, some of which is provided to the Company by third parties. Such
technologies include, but are not necessarily limited to, satellite based
transmission of the Company's programming, use of the Internet in relation to
the Company's on-line business, new digital technology used to manage and
supplement the Company's television broadcast operations and a network of
complex computer hardware and software to manage an ever increasing need for
information and information management tools. The failure of any such
technologies, or the Company's ability to have such technology supported,
updated, expanded or integrated into other technologies, could adversely impact
the operations of the Company. Although the Company has, when possible,
developed alternative sources of such technology and built redundancy into such
computer networks and tools, there can be no assurance that the Company's effort
to date would protect the Company against all potential issues or disaster
occurrences related to the loss of any such technologies or their use.

THE EXPANSION OF DIGITAL CABLE COMPRESSION TECHNOLOGY MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE
COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE FOR TELEVISION VIEWERS.

A significant number of cable operators have started to offer cable programming
on a digital basis. The use of digital compression technology provides cable
companies with greater channel capacity. While greater channel capacity
increases the opportunity for the Company to be more widely distributed, it also
may adversely impact the Company's ability to compete for television viewers to
the extent it results in (i) higher channel position; (ii) placement of the
Company's programming in separate programming tiers, or (iii) an expanding
universe of programming choices all competing for the same audience viewership.

THE UNANTICIPATED LOSS OF ONE OF THE COMPANY'S LARGER VENDORS COULD IMPACT THE
COMPANY'S SALES ON A TEMPORARY BASIS.

The Company obtains products for its electronic direct marketing businesses from
domestic and foreign manufacturers and suppliers and is often able to make
purchases on favorable terms based on the volume of transactions. Many of the
Company's purchasing arrangements with its television home shopping vendors
include inventory terms that allow for return privileges of a portion of the
order or stock balancing. The Company has not historically entered into long
term supply arrangements that would require vendors to provide products on an
ongoing basis.

THE COMPANY'S INABILITY TO RECRUIT AND RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT
THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUSTAIN GROWTH.

The Company's continued growth is contingent, in part, on its ability to retain
and recruit employees that have the unique skills necessary in a business that
demands knowledge of the general retail industry, television production,
direct-to-consumer marketing and fulfillment and the Internet. The marketplace
for such employees is very competitive and limited. The Company's growth may be
adversely impacted if the Company is unable to retain such key employees.

THE COMPANY'S GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS SALES
VOLUME DOES NOT MEET EXPECTATIONS TO COVER THE COMPANY'S HIGH FIXED COST
INFRASTRUCTURE.

The Company's television home shopping business operates with a high fixed cost
base, which is primarily driven by fixed contractual fees paid to cable and
satellite operators to carry the Company's programming.

THE COMPANY'S TELEVISION HOME SHOPPING AND INTERNET BUSINESSES ARE SENSITIVE TO
POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND MAJOR NEWS EVENTS, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT
CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND ULTIMATELY NET SALES.

The Company's television home shopping and e-commerce businesses are sensitive
to general economic conditions and business conditions affecting consumer
spending. The Company's two major categories of sales merchandise are jewelry
and collectibles, which due to their nature and relatively higher price points
are more economically sensitive to consumer demand than other product
categories. The recent general deterioration in economic conditions in the
United States and uncertainties associated with global events has led to reduced
consumer confidence, reduced disposable income and increased competitive
activity, as well as the business failure of companies in the retail and direct
marketing industries. Such economic conditions may lead to a reduction in
consumer spending generally and in home shopping specifically, and may lead to a
reduction in consumer spending on the types of merchandise the Company currently
offers on its television programming and over the Internet. Although the
Company's current plan and effort is to further diversify its product mix away
from primarily jewelry and collectibles, future revenue growth could be
adversely affected if overall consumer spending or the demand for jewelry and
collectibles decline. Additionally, the Company's television audience and sales
revenue can be significantly impacted by major world or domestic events, which
divert audience attention away from the Company's programming. Economic
conditions may also have a material adverse impact on the financial strength of
the Company's vendors and suppliers, some of whom are focused on a limited range
of product categories or who are dependent on home shopping as a primary outlet
for their sales.

RISKS RELATED TO OUR BUSINESS

Our limited operating history makes it difficult for us to accurately forecast
net sales and appropriately plan our expenses.

      We were formed in 2003 and have a limited operating history. As a result,
it is difficult to accurately forecast our net sales and plan our operating
expenses. We base our current and future expense levels on our operating
forecasts and estimates of future net sales. Net sales and operating results are
difficult to forecast because they generally depend on the volume and timing of
the orders we receive, which are uncertain. Some of our expenses are fixed, and,
as a result, we may be unable to adjust our spending in a timely manner to
compensate for any unexpected shortfall in net sales. This inability could cause
our net income in a given quarter to be lower than expected.

                                       24
<PAGE>


WE HAVE INCURRED SIGNIFICANT OPERATING LOSSES IN THE PAST AND MAY NOT BE ABLE TO
SUSTAIN PROFITABILITY IN THE FUTURE.

      We experienced significant operating losses in each quarter from our
inception in 2003 through the third quarter of 2004. As a result, our business
has no record of profitability. If we are unable to acquire product at
commercially reasonable prices, if net sales decline or if our expenses
otherwise exceed our expectations, we may not be able to sustain or increase
profitability on a quarterly or annual basis.

      As a result of our significant operating losses in prior periods, we have
accrued substantial net operating loss carryforwards. If we are unsuccessful in
generating sufficient net income in future periods, these assets may expire
before they are utilized.

WE EXPECT OUR QUARTERLY FINANCIAL RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE WHICH MAY LEAD TO
VOLATILITY IN OUR STOCK PRICE. WE EXPECT OUR NET SALES AND OPERATING RESULTS TO
VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM QUARTER TO QUARTER DUE TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING
CHANGES IN:

     o    demand for our products;

     o    our ability to retain existing customers or encourage repeat
          purchases;

     o    our ability to manage our product mix and inventory;

     o    consumer tastes and preferences;

     o    our ability to manage our fulfillment operations;

     o    general economic conditions;

     o    advertising and other marketing costs;

     o    our, or our competitors', pricing and marketing strategies;

      As a result of the variability of these and other factors, our operating
results in future quarters may be below the expectations of public market
analysts and investors. In this event, the price of our common stock may
decline.

AS A RESULT OF SEASONAL FLUCTUATIONS IN OUR NET SALES, OUR QUARTERLY RESULTS MAY
FLUCTUATE AND COULD BE BELOW EXPECTATIONS.

      We have experienced and expect to continue to experience seasonal
fluctuations in our net sales. In particular, a disproportionate amount of our
net sales has been realized during the fourth quarter as a result of the
December holiday season, and we expect this seasonality to continue in the
future. In the future, our seasonal sales patterns may become more pronounced,
may strain our personnel and fulfillment activities and may cause a shortfall in
net sales as compared to expenses in a given period, which would substantially
harm our business and results of operations.

                                       25
<PAGE>


SPECIFIC FACTORS THAT COULD PREVENT CONSUMERS FROM PURCHASING FROM US INCLUDE:

     o    concerns about buying luxury products such as fine jewelry without a
          physical storefront, face-to-face interaction with sales personnel
          and the ability to physically handle and examine products;

     o    delivery time associated with orders;

     o    product offerings that do not reflect consumer tastes and
          preferences;

     o    pricing that does not meet consumer expectations;

     o    concerns about the security of transactions and the privacy of
          personal information;

     o    delayed shipments or shipments of incorrect or damaged products; and

     o    inconvenience associated with returning or exchanging purchased
          items.

IF OUR FULFILLMENT OPERATIONS OR BROADCAST FACILITY ARE INTERRUPTED FOR ANY
SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME, OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS WOULD BE
SUBSTANTIALLY HARMED.

      Our success depends on our ability to successfully receive and fulfill
orders and to promptly and securely deliver our products to our customers. Our
inventory management, packaging, labeling and product return processes are
performed in a single fulfillment center. This facility is susceptible to damage
or interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications
failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar
events. We do not currently maintain back-up power systems at our fulfillment
center. We do not presently have a formal disaster recovery plan. We may
transfer our fulfillment operations to a larger fulfillment center in the
future. Any interruptions in our fulfillment center operations for any
significant period of time, including interruptions resulting from the transfer
to a new facility, could damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm
our business and results of operations. If transmission from our broadcast
facility is interrupted for any extended time our business will be severely
impacted.

WE MAY FAIL TO SUCCESSFULLY EXPAND OUR FULFILLMENT CAPABILITIES, WHICH WOULD
SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

      We currently provide, through a single fulfillment center, our own order
fulfillment services for substantially all products we sell. If we fail to
quickly and efficiently fill customer orders, our operating results may suffer.
We believe that increased demand and other considerations will require us to
significantly expand our fulfillment capabilities and facilities in the near
future. Our need to rapidly adapt and expand our fulfillment capabilities is
particularly acute during the fourth quarter. If we do not successfully expand
our fulfillment capabilities to accommodate increases in demand, we may not be
able to substantially increase our net sales. Our efforts at expanding our
fulfillment capabilities may cause disruptions in other areas of our business
which could substantially harm our business and results of operations.

                                       26
<PAGE>


WE RELY ON OUR SUPPLIERS AND THIRD-PARTY CARRIERS AS PART OF OUR FULFILLMENT
PROCESS, AND THESE THIRD PARTIES MAY FAIL TO ADEQUATELY SERVE OUR CUSTOMERS.

      In general, we rely on our suppliers to promptly ship us product ordered
by our customers. Any failure by our suppliers to sell and ship such products to
us in a timely manner will have an adverse effect on our ability to fulfill
customer orders and harm our business and results of operations. Our suppliers,
in turn, rely on third-party carriers to ship product to us, and in some cases,
directly to our customers. We also rely on third-party carriers for product
shipments to our customers. We and our suppliers are therefore subject to the
risks, including employee strikes and inclement weather, associated with such
carriers' abilities to provide delivery services to meet our and our suppliers'
shipping needs. Our suppliers' and third-party carriers' failure to deliver
products to us or our customers in a timely manner or to otherwise adequately
serve our customers would damage our reputation and brand and substantially harm
our business and results of operations.

WE FACE THE RISK OF THEFT OF OUR PRODUCTS FROM INVENTORY OR DURING SHIPMENT.

      We may experience theft of our products while they are being held in our
fulfillment center or during the course of shipment to our customers by
third-party shipping carriers.

OUR FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE THE GROWTH IN OUR OPERATIONS MAY PREVENT US
FROM SUCCESSFULLY EXPANDING OUR BUSINESS.

      We have experienced, and in the future may experience, rapid growth in
operations which has placed, and could continue to place, a significant strain
on our operations, services, internal controls and other managerial, operational
and financial resources. To effectively manage future expansion, we will need to
maintain our operational and financial systems and managerial controls and
procedures, which include the following processes:

     o    transaction-processing and fulfillment;

     o    inventory management;

     o    customer support;

     o    management of multiple supplier relationships;

     o    operational, financial and managerial controls;

     o    reporting procedures; and

     o    training, supervision, retention and management of our employees.

      If we are unable to manage future expansion, our ability to provide a high
quality customer experience could be harmed, which would damage our reputation
and brand and substantially harm our business and results of operations.

                                       27
<PAGE>


IF THE SINGLE FACILITY WHERE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR COMPUTER, BROADCAST,
PRODUCTION, AND COMMUNICATIONS HARDWARE IS LOCATED FAILS, OUR BUSINESS, RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION WOULD BE HARMED.

      Our ability to successfully receive and fulfill orders and to provide high
quality customer service depends in part on the efficient and uninterrupted
operation of our computer and communications systems. Substantially all of the
computer hardware necessary to operate our web site is located at a single
leased facility. Our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or
interruption from human error, fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications
failure, terrorist attacks, acts of war, break-ins, earthquake and similar
events. Although we have developed an alternative call center, we do not
presently have redundant systems in multiple locations or a formal disaster
recovery plan. In addition, our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses,
physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions, which could lead to
interruptions, delays, loss of critical data, the inability to accept and
fulfill customer orders or the unauthorized disclosure of confidential customer
data. The occurrence of any of the foregoing risks could substantially harm our
business and results of operations.

FAILURE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY COULD SUBSTANTIALLY HARM
OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

      We rely on a combination of patent, trademark, trade secret and copyright
law and contractual restrictions to protect our intellectual property. These
afford only limited protection. Despite our efforts to protect our proprietary
rights, unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of our web site
features and functionality or to obtain and use information that we consider as
proprietary, such as the technology used to operate our web site, our content
and our trademarks.

      Litigation or proceedings before the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office may
be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights, to
protect our trade secrets and domain names and to determine the validity and
scope of the proprietary rights of others. Any litigation or adverse priority
proceeding could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and
could substantially harm our business and results of operations. Finally, we
intend to sell our products internationally, and the laws of many countries do
not protect our proprietary rights to as great an extent as do the laws of the
United States.

INCREASED PRODUCT RETURNS AND THE FAILURE TO ACCURATELY PREDICT PRODUCT RETURNS
COULD SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

      We offer our customers an unconditional 14-day return policy that allows
our customers to return most products if they are not satisfied for any reason.
We make allowances for product returns in our financial statements based on
historical return rates. Actual merchandise returns are difficult to predict and
may significantly exceed our allowances. Any significant increase in merchandise
returns above our allowances would substantially harm our business and results
of operations.

                                       28
<PAGE>


WE RELY ON OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH A THIRD-PARTY MERCHANT PROCESSING COMPANY TO
OFFER CREDIT CARD PROCESSING FACILITIES FOR THE PURCHASE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

      The purchase of the products we sell is a substantial expense for many of
our customers. We currently rely on our relationship with a single financial
institution to provide credit card processing facilities for customer sales made
via credit card. If we are unable to maintain this or other similar
arrangements, we may not be able to offer financing alternatives to our
customers, which may reduce demand for our products and substantially harm our
business and results of operations.

WE MAY UNDERTAKE ACQUISITIONS TO EXPAND OUR BUSINESS, WHICH MAY POSE RISKS TO
OUR BUSINESS AND DILUTE THE OWNERSHIP OF OUR EXISTING STOCKHOLDERS.

      Integrating any newly acquired businesses, technologies or services may be
expensive and time-consuming. To finance any acquisitions, it may be necessary
for us to raise additional funds through public or private financings.
Additional funds may not be available on terms that are favorable to us, and, in
the case of equity financings, would result in dilution to our stockholders. If
we do complete any acquisitions, we may be unable to operate such acquired
businesses profitably or otherwise implement our strategy successfully. If we
are unable to integrate any newly acquired entities or technologies effectively,
our business and results of operations could suffer. The time and expense
associated with finding suitable and compatible businesses, technologies or
services could also disrupt our ongoing business and divert our management's
attention. Future acquisitions by us could also result in large and immediate
write-offs or assumptions of debt and contingent liabilities, any of which could
substantially harm our business and results of operations.

OUR NET SALES MAY BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IF WE ARE REQUIRED TO CHARGE TAXES ON
PURCHASES.

      We do not collect or have imposed upon us sales or other taxes related to
the products we sell, except for certain corporate level taxes and sales taxes
with respect to purchases by customers located in the State of California.
However, one or more states or foreign countries may seek to impose sales or
other tax collection obligations on us in the future. A successful assertion by
one or more states or foreign countries that we should be collecting sales or
other taxes on the sale of our products could result in substantial tax
liabilities for past sales, discourage customers from purchasing products from
us, decrease our ability to compete with traditional retailers or otherwise
substantially harm our business and results of operations.

      Currently, decisions of the U.S. Supreme Court restrict the imposition of
obligations to collect state and local sales and use taxes with respect to sales
made over the Internet. However, implementation of the restrictions imposed by
these Supreme Court decisions is subject to interpretation by state and local
taxing authorities. While we believe that these Supreme Court decisions
currently restrict state and local taxing authorities outside the State of
California from requiring us to collect sales and use taxes from purchasers
located within their jurisdictions, taxing authorities outside the State of
California could disagree with our interpretation of these decisions. Moreover,
a number of states, as well as the U.S. Congress, have been considering various
initiatives that could limit or supercede the Supreme Court's position regarding
sales and use taxes on Internet sales. If any state or local taxing jurisdiction
were to disagree with our interpretation of the Supreme Court's current position
regarding state and local taxation of Internet sales, or if any of these
initiatives were to address the Supreme Court's constitutional concerns and
result in a reversal of its current position, we could be required to collect
sales and use taxes from purchasers located in states other than California. The
imposition by state and local governments of various taxes upon Internet
commerce could create administrative burdens for us and could decrease our
future net sales.

                                       29
<PAGE>


GOVERNMENTREGULATION OF THE INTERNET AND E-COMMERCE IS EVOLVING AND UNFAVORABLE
CHANGES COULD SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

      We are subject to general business regulations and laws as well as
regulations and laws specifically governing the Internet and e-commerce.
Existing and future laws and regulations may impede the growth of the Internet
or other online services. These regulations and laws may cover taxation,
restrictions on imports and exports, customs, tariffs, user privacy, data
protection, pricing, content, copyrights, distribution, electronic contracts and
other communications, consumer protection, the provision of online payment
services, broadband residential Internet access and the characteristics and
quality of products and services. It is not clear how existing laws governing
issues such as property ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal
privacy apply to the Internet and e-commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these
issues may substantially harm our business and results of operations.

OUR FAILURE TO PROTECT CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR NETWORK
AGAINST SECURITY BREACHES COULD DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND AND
SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

      A significant barrier to online commerce and communications is the secure
transmission of confidential information over public networks, and our failure
to prevent security breaches could damage our reputation and brand and
substantially harm our business and results of operations. Currently, a
significant number of our customers authorize us to bill their credit card
accounts directly. We rely on encryption and authentication technology licensed
from third parties to effect secure transmission of confidential information,
including credit card numbers. Advances in computer capabilities, new
discoveries in the field of cryptography or other developments may result in a
compromise or breach of the technology used by us to protect customer
transaction data. Any such compromise of our security could damage our
reputation and brand and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible
liability which would substantially harm our business and results of operations.
In addition, anyone who is able to circumvent our security measures could
misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our operations.
We may need to expend significant resources to protect against security breaches
or to address problems caused by breaches.

INTERRUPTIONS TO OUR SYSTEMS THAT IMPAIR CUSTOMER ACCESS TO OUR WEB SITE WOULD
DAMAGE OUR REPUTATION AND BRAND AND SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS
OF OPERATIONS.

                                       30
<PAGE>


      The satisfactory performance, reliability and availability of our web
site, transaction processing systems and network infrastructure are critical to
our reputation and our ability to attract and retain customers and to maintain
adequate customer service levels. Any future systems interruption that results
in the unavailability of our web site or reduced order fulfillment performance
could result in negative publicity, damage our reputation and brand and cause
our business and results of operations to suffer. Although we have not
experienced any material disruption in our services to date, we may be
susceptible to such disruptions in the future. We may also experience temporary
system interruptions for a variety of other reasons in the future, including
power failures, software errors or an overwhelming number of visitors trying to
reach our web site during periods of strong seasonal demand or promotions.
Because we are dependent in part on third parties for the implementation and
maintenance of certain aspects of our systems and because some of the causes of
system interruptions may be outside of our control, we may not be able to remedy
such interruptions in a timely manner, or at all.

OUR FAILURE TO ADDRESS RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT CARD FRAUD COULD DAMAGE OUR
REPUTATION AND BRAND AND MAY CAUSE OUR BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS TO
SUFFER.

      Under current credit card practices, we are liable for fraudulent credit
card transactions because we do not obtain a cardholder's signature. We do not
currently carry insurance against this risk. To date, we have experienced
minimal losses from credit card fraud, but we face the risk of significant
losses from this type of fraud as our net sales increase. Our failure to
adequately control fraudulent credit card transactions could damage our
reputation and brand and substantially harm our business and results of
operations.

OUR FAILURE TO RAPIDLY RESPOND TO TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE COULD RESULT IN OUR
SERVICES OR SYSTEMS BECOMING OBSOLETE AND SUBSTANTIALLY HARM OUR BUSINESS AND
RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

      As the Internet and online commerce industries evolve, we may be required
to license emerging technologies useful in our business, enhance our existing
services, develop new services and technologies that address the increasingly
sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers and respond to
technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a
cost-effective and timely basis. We may not be able to successfully implement
new technologies or adapt our web site, proprietary technologies and
transaction-processing systems to customer requirements or emerging industry
standards. Our failure to do so would substantially harm our business and
results of operations.

IF SECURITIES OR INDUSTRY ANALYSTS DO NOT PUBLISH RESEARCH OR REPORTS ABOUT OUR
BUSINESS, OUR STOCK PRICE AND TRADING VOLUME COULD DECLINE.

                                       31
<PAGE>


      The trading market for our common stock will depend on the research and
reports that securities or industry analysts publish about us or our business.
We do not have any control over these analysts. If one or more of the analysts
who cover us downgrade our stock, our stock price would likely decline. If one
or more of these analysts cease coverage of our company or fail to regularly
publish reports on us, we could lose visibility in the financial markets, which
could cause our stock price or trading volume to decline.

FUTURE SALES OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD LOWER THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR COMMON
STOCK.

      A number of our current security holders hold registration rights relating
to our common stock. If we propose to register any of our securities under the
Securities Act either for our own account or for the accounts of other security
holders after this offering, subject to certain conditions and limitations, the
holders of registration rights will be entitled to include their shares of
common stock in the registered offering. In addition, holders of registration
rights may require us on not more than two occasions at any time beginning
approximately six months from the date of the closing of this offering, to file
a registration statement under the Securities Act with respect to their shares
of common stock. Further, the holders of registration rights may require us to
register their shares on Form S-3 if and when we become eligible to use that
form.

      In the future, we may also issue additional shares to our employees,
directors or consultants, in connection with corporate alliances or acquisitions
and in follow-on offerings to raise additional capital. As such, sales of a
substantial number of shares of our common stock in the public market could
occur at any time. These sales could reduce the market price of our common
stock.

                  OFFICERS, DIRECTORS AND KEY EMPLOYEES OF USN

In connection with the acquisition of USN the Company is negotiating employment
contracts with current USN personnel.

Terry Washburn, Gary Wolfe and Paul Johnson will remain as directors of the

      2.    The Company will issue 5,539,655 shares of its common stock as a
            part of the acquisition of USN; and

      3.    The Company will issue 2,383,333 shares of its common stock for
            convertible obligations.

      4.    The Company will reserve 550,000 shares of its common stock for
            options for management and for convertible debt.
