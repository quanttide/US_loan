Item 8.01.  Other Events.

DUSA Pharmaceuticals, Inc. ("DUSA") issued a press release today attached to and
made a part of this report which announced that it had filed a lawsuit against
New England Compounding Center ("NECC") of Framingham, Massachusetts alleging
violations of U.S. patent law. The suit has been filed in the United States
District Court in Boston, Massachusetts.

In addition, DUSA believes that certain actions of NECC go beyond the activities
which are permitted under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act, and as a result, it
has advised the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and local health
authorities of its concerns.

Except for historical information, this report contains certain forward-looking
statements that involve known and unknown risk and uncertainties, which may
cause actual results to differ materially from any future results, performance
or achievements expressed or implied by the statements made. These
forward-looking statements relate to the Company's belief regarding NECC
activities and its intention to protect its product's reputation and other risks
identified in DUSA's SEC filings from time to time.
