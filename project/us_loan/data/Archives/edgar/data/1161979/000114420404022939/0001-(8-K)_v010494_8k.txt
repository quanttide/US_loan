ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

      On December 16, 2004, we entered into a Securities Purchase Agreement with
DCOFI Master Ltd. for the sale of $500,000 in Senior Subordinated Secured Notes.

      The investors are  obligated to purchase the Senior  Subordinated  Secured
Notes as follows:

      o     $275,000 was purchased on December 16, 2004; and

      o     $225,000 will be purchased  ninety (90) days from December 16, 2004,
            assuming  we are in  compliance  with the  terms  of the  Securities
            Purchase Agreement.

      The Senior  Subordinated  Secured  Notes bear  interest  at 12% per annum,
payable monthly,  and mature on June 15, 2005. In addition,  we agreed to pay to
the holders a fee of 4% per annum, payable monthly, on the balance due under the
Senior Subordinated  Secured Notes until the Senior  Subordinated  Secured Notes
are paid in full.

      We have the option to prepay the principal,  and all accrued interest,  at
any time prior to the date of  maturity.  In the event that we prepay the Senior
Subordinated  Secured  Notes on or prior to ninety days from  December 16, 2004,
the prepayment amount shall be 105% of the principal due, plus accrued interest;
after ninety days from December 16, 2004, the prepayment amount shall be 105% of
the principal due, plus accrued  interest.  In the event that we raise more than
$2,000,000  from the sale of  securities in one or more  transactions,  upon the
closing of such transaction,  we are obligated to repay the Senior  Subordinated
Secured Notes in full, plus accrued interest.  In the event that we do not repay
the Senior  Subordinated  Secured  Notes within two trading days of the maturity
date,  we are  obligated  to issue to the holders  100,000  shares of our common
stock.

      The full principal amount of the Senior Subordinated Secured Notes, plus a
default  interest  rate of 20%,  is due upon a  default  under  the terms of the
Senior  Subordinated  Secured  Notes.  In addition,  we granted the  investors a
second priority lien in substantially all of our assets, which security interest
is junior to that  granted to the  holders of our 8% Secured  Convertible  Notes
issued November 15, 2004.
