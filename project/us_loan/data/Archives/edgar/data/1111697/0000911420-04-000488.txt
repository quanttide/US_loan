SECTION 3 - SECURITIES AND TRADING MARKETS

ITEM 3.02.  UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         On December 17, 2004, we completed the final closing of the second
tranche of our December 2003 private placement. At closing, we issued to
investors 6,000,000 shares of common stock and warrants to purchase 1,500,000
shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.54 per share, and realized net
proceeds of approximately $3,000,000. After giving effect to the shares of
common stock issued at the closing, we had approximately 43,748,000 shares of
common stock issued and outstanding. Cash transaction costs were paid by us at
the closing of the first tranche of the private placement in December 2003. We
also issued warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $1.54 per share to our financial advisors in connection with the
closing of the second tranche of the December 2003 private placement.

         Final closing conditions were met on November 30, 2004, when we
completed 20 patient clinical scans in connection with the ComfortScan(TM)
system PMA clinical trial, and shipped 10 revenue-producing, production-level
ComfortScan systems.

         Following the closing, we reduced the conversion price of our
outstanding shares of series A convertible preferred stock from $2.00 per share
to $1.79 per share to give effect to anti-dilution provisions contained in the
Certificate of Designation, Preferences and Rights relating to the series A
convertible preferred stock that were triggered by a reduction in the purchase
price per share of the common stock issued at the final closing of the December
2003 private placement.

         In connection with the closing of the second tranche of the December
2003 private placement, we agreed with Verus Support Services Inc. to terminate
our Strategic Advisory Agreement pursuant to which Verus had been providing
various support services as part of the December 2003 private placement.
Pursuant to the termination, we agreed to issue to Verus warrants to purchase
227,500 shares of common stock at an exercise price of $1.54 per share.

SECTION 8 - OTHER EVENTS

ABOUT DOBI MEDICAL INTERNATIONAL, INC.

DOBI Medical is a development stage medical imaging company working to create a
new means for the improved diagnosis of cancer through the detection of abnormal
vascularization ("angiogenesis") associated with tumors. DOBI Medical
International's first application of the technology is the ComfortScan system, a
gentle, non-invasive, and non-ionizing, optical imaging system designed to
assist physicians in the detection and management of breast cancer. The
ComfortScan system is intended to achieve this by providing new,
physiology-based imagery of abnormal vascularization in the breast that are not
readily available today. The ComfortScan system is an investigational device and
is not commercially available in the United States.
