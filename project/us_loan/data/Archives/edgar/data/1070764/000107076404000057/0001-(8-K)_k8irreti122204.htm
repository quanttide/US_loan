<P>A copy of the press release is attached to this Current Report on Form 8-K as Exhibit 99.2 and is incorporated in its entirety in this Item 7.01 disclosure by reference.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company currently is in negotiations with an institutional investor to enter into a joint venture arrangement.  Under the joint venture arrangement, the institutional investor would contribute 80% of the equity and the Company would contribute 20% of the equity to a newly formed company.  Funds contributed to the joint venture will be used primarily to acquire properties located east of the Mississippi River that satisfy certain parameters (unless waived by the parties), including the Company's current acquisition underwriting guidelines.  The Company makes no assurances that the joint venture arrangement will be consummated.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Company is providing guidance on its 2004 funds from operations and distributions for 2004.  The Company projects that its 2004 funds from operations, excluding any adjustment to funds from operations resulting from the accounting treatment attributable to the merger, will range between $0.91 and $0.92 per common weighted average share, and its 2004 distributions will remain at $0.83 per common weighted average share.  The Company does not expect to regularly update or provide financial projections in the future.  The foregoing statements are forward-looking statements covered by the provisions of the following grammatical paragraph.</P>
