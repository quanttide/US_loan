<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">OAK BROOK, IL (December 22, 2004) -- Inland Retail Real Estate Trust, Inc. (the &quot;Company&quot; or &quot;we&quot;), announced today that its shareholders have ratified the Company's entry into a merger agreement and have approved a merger pursuant to which the Company will acquire Inland Retail Real Estate Advisory Services, Inc., Inland Southern Management Corp., Inland Mid-Atlantic Management Corp. and Inland Southeast Property Management Corp.  These companies provide business management, advisory and property management services to the Company.  The merger is scheduled to occur on December 29, 2004, subject to satisfaction of customary closing conditions.  If any of the closing conditions are not satisfied, or their satisfaction is delayed, the transaction may not close or the closing may be delayed.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;This transaction is part of our business plan of becoming a self-administered and self-managed real estate investment trust, which is generally considered a prerequisite for publicly traded REITs,&quot; said Robert D. Parks, Chairman of the Board of the Company. &quot;We are also extremely pleased with the overwhelming support expressed by our shareholders as evidenced by the fact that in excess of 96% of the votes cast ratified our entry into the merger agreement and approved the merger, with only 2.24% of the votes cast disapproving the merger.&quot;  </P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&quot;If we close by the end of this year, we anticipate that our funds from operations for 2005 could increase by $0.06 per share as a result of the merger,&quot; said Barry L. Lazarus, Chief Executive Officer of the Company.  &quot;Also, we believe that this transaction is a first step to pursuing a potential listing of our shares on a national exchange, subject, of course, to future market conditions.&quot;</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></P>
<P>Additionally, at the shareholder meeting, the shareholders approved the following matters:</P>
