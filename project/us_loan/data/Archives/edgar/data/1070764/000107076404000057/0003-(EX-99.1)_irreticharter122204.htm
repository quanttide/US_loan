Any Director may resign by written notice to the Board, effective upon execution and delivery to the Company of such written notice or upon any future date specified in the notice.  Subject to the rights of holders of one or more classes or series of Preferred Stock to elect or remove one or more Directors, a Director may be removed at any time, with or without cause, at an annual or special meeting of the Stockholders, by the affirmative vote of the holders of not less than a majority of the shares of Equity Stock then outstanding and entitled to vote generally in the election of Directors. For purposes of this paragraph, "cause" shall mean with respect to any particular director, conviction of a felony or a final judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction holding that such dir

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 4. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Service as Nominee</U>.  Legal title to any Property shall be vested in the Company, but the Company may cause legal title to any such Property to be held by or in the name of any or all of the Directors or any other person as nominee. Upon the resignation or removal of any Director, or his otherwise ceasing to be a Director, he shall automatically cease to have any right, title or interest in and to any Property and shall execute and deliver such documents as the remaining Directors require for the conveyance of any such Property held in his name, and shall account to the remaining Directors as they require for all such Property which he holds as Director. Any right, title or interest of the Director in and to any Property shall automatically vest in successor and additional Directors upon their qualification and ac

Written evidence of the qualification and acceptance of election or appointment of successor and additional Directors may be filed with the records of the Company and in any such other offices, agencies or places as the Company or Directors may deem necessary or desirable.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 5. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Duties and Powers</U>.</P>

The business and affairs of the Company shall be managed under the direction of the Board of Directors. All powers of the Company may be exercised by or under authority of the Board of Directors except as conferred on or reserved to the Stockholders by law or by the Articles or the Bylaws. This Charter shall be construed with a presumption in favor of the grant of power and authority to the Board of Directors.  Any construction of this Charter or determination made in good faith by the Board of Directors concerning its powers and authority hereunder shall be conclusive. The enumeration and definition of particular powers of the Board of Directors included in this Charter or in the Bylaws shall in no way be construed or deemed by inference or otherwise in any manner to excl
ude or limit the powers conferred upon the Board of Directors under the Maryland General Corporation Law, the general laws of the State of Maryland or any other applicable laws as now or hereafter in force.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>REIT Qualification</U>.  The Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the Company to qualify for U.S. federal income tax treatment in accordance with the provisions of the Code applicable to a REIT. In furtherance of the foregoing, the Board shall use its reasonable best efforts to take such actions as are necessary, and may take such actions as in its sole judgment and discretion are desirable, to preserve the status of the Company as a REIT; provided, however, that if a majority of the Board (including a majority of the Independent Directors) determines that it is no longer in the best interest of the Company to continue to have the Company qualify as a REIT, the Board may revoke or otherwise terminate the Company's REIT election pursuant to Section 856(g) of the Code. The Board of Directors also may determine that compliance
 with any restriction or limitation on stock ownership and transfers set forth in Article IX is no longer required for REIT qualification.</P>

The Board of Directors may authorize the issuance from time to time of shares of stock of the Company of any class or series, whether now or  hereafter authorized, or securities or rights convertible into shares of its stock or any class or series, whether now or hereafter authorized, for such consideration as the Board of Directors may deem advisable (or without consideration in the case of a stock split or stock dividend), subject to such  restrictions or limitations, if any, as may be set forth in this Charter or the Bylaws.</P>

The Company intends to pay, but shall not be obligated to pay, regular quarterly distributions to its Stockholders ("Distributions").  However, the Company reserves the right to pay Distributions on a monthly basis in an amount determined by the Board.  Distributions will be at the discretion of the Board. The Company's ability to pay Distributions and the size of these Distributions will depend upon a variety of factors. There can  be no assurance that Distributions will be made or that any particular level of Distributions established in the future, if any, will be maintained by the Company.</P>

<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To the extent possible, the Company seeks to avoid the fluctuations in Distributions which might result if Distributions were based on actual cash received during the Distribution period. To avoid fluctuation, the Company may use Cash Flow received during prior periods, or Cash Flow received subsequent to the Distribution period and prior to the payment date for such Distribution, in order to pay annualized Distributions consistent with the Distribution level established  from time to time by the Board. The Company's ability to maintain this policy is dependent upon the Company's Cash Flow and the applicable requirements for qualifying as a REIT as contained in Code Section 856 through 960 and the Regulations promulgated thereunder. There can be no assurance that there will be Cash Flow available to pay Distributions, or that Distribution amounts will not fluctuate. Quarterly Distributions will be calculated with daily record and Distribution declaration dates. However, the Board could, at
 any time, elect to pay Distributions monthly, and later switch back to quarterly, to reduce administrative costs.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Concurrently with any Distribution, the Company shall provide Stockholders with a statement disclosing the source of the funds distributed. If such information is not available concurrently with the making of a Distribution, a statement setting forth the reasons why such information is not available shall be provided concurrently. In no event shall such information be provided to Stockholders more than 60 days after the close of the fiscal year in which the Distribution was made.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Distributions in-kind shall not be permitted, except for Distributions of: (i) readily marketable securities; (ii) beneficial interests in a liquidating trust established for the dissolution of the Company and the liquidation of its assets; or (iii) Distributions of in-kind property which meet all of the following conditions: (a) the Directors advise each Stockholder of the risks associated with direct ownership of the in-kind Property; (b) the Directors offer each Stockholder the election of receiving in-kind property Distributions,; and (c) the Directors distribute in-kind property only to those Stockholders who accept the Directors' offer.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Directors shall endeavor to declare and pay such Distributions as shall be necessary under the Code; however, Stockholders shall have no right to any Distribution unless and until declared by the Directors. The exercise of the powers and rights of the Directors pursuant to this Section 5 shall be subject to the provisions of any class or series of Equity Stock at the time outstanding. The receipt by any person in whose name  any shares of Equity Stock are registered on the records of the Company or by his, her or its duly authorized agent shall be a sufficient discharge for all dividends or distributions payable  or deliverable in respect of such shares of Equity Stock and from all liability related to the application thereof. </P>

Mortgage indebtedness on any property shall not exceed such property's appraised value.

The appraisal shall be maintained in the Company's records for at least five years, and shall be available for inspection and duplication by any Stockholder.

Inspection of the Company's books and records by a state securities administrator shall be provided upon reasonable notice and during normal business hours. In addition, an alphabetical list of names, addresses and business telephone numbers of the Stockholders of the Company along with the number of shares of Equity Stock held by each of them (the "Stockholder List") shall be maintained and updated quarterly as part of the books and records of the Company and shall be available for inspection by any Stockholder or the Stockholder'

A copy of the Stockholder List shall be mailed to any Stockholder requesting the Stockholder List within ten days of the request. The copy of the Stockholder List shall be printed in alphabetical order, on white paper, and in a readily readable type size (in no event smaller than 10-point type). The Company may impose a reasonable charge for expenses incurred in reproducing such list. The permitted purposes for which a Stockholder may request a copy of the Stockholder List include, without limitation, matters relating to Stockholders' voting rights under this Charter and the exercise of Stockholders' rights under federal proxy laws. If the Directors of the Company neglect or refuse to exhibit, produce or mail a copy of the Stockholder List as requested in accordance with and as required by applicable law and this Charter, the Directors shall be liable to any Stockholder requesting the Stockholder List, for the costs
, including reasonable attorneys' fees, incurred by that Stockholder for compelling the production of the Stockholder List, and for actual damages suffered by any Stockholder by reason of such refusal or neglect. It shall be a defense to such liability that the actual purpose and reason for the requests for inspection or for a copy of the Stockholder List is to secure such list of Stockholders or other information for the purpose of selling such Stockholder List or copies thereof, or of using the same for a commercial purpose or other purpose not in the interest of the applicant as a Stockholder relative to the affairs of the Company). The Company may require the Stockholder requesting the Stockholder List to represent that the Stockholder List is not requested for a commercial purpose unrelated to the Stockholder's interest in the Company.
