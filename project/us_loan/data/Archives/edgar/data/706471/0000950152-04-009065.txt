ITEM 1.01         ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 14, 2004, the board of directors of Max & Erma's
Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") authorized the Company to enter into a letter
agreement (the "Letter Agreement") with The Provident Bank, whose successor by
merger is National City Bank (the "Lender"), and National City Bank and The
Huntington National Bank (collectively, the "Participants"), to amend the
Company's Fifth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated September
22, 2003 and amended on December 31, 2003 and May 17, 2004 (the "Credit
Agreement").

         Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the parties have agreed to amend or
eliminate certain negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement as
follows:

         -    the Company's "fixed charge coverage ratio" will be amended so
              that the ratio shall not be less than: (i) 1.00 to 1 from November
              1, 2004 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005, (ii)
              1.05 to 1 during the third quarter of fiscal 2005, (iii) 1.10 to 1
              during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, (iv) 1.15 to 1 during
              the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and (v) 1.20 to 1 on and after
              the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2006;

         -    the Company's "earnings before taxes" covenant will be eliminated;

         -    the Company's "interest coverage ratio" will be eliminated; and

         -    the Company's "senior debt to EBITDA" ratio will be amended so
              that the ratio shall not be more than: (i) 2.50 to 1 through
              October 31, 2005, and (ii) 2.25 to 1 subsequent to October 31,
              2005.

In addition, the parties have agreed to add a new financial ratio test so that
(Senior Debt + (Current Year Future Minimum Rental Commitments x 8))/EBITDA (the
"New Ratio") will not be more than: (i) 5.75 to 1 from November 1, 2004 through
October 30, 2005, (ii) 5.50 to 1 from October 31, 2005 through October 29, 2006,
(iii) not more than 5.25 to 1 on and after October 30, 2006.

         Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the pricing on all credit facilities
shall remain at the Company's option of Prime + 0.75% or LIBOR + 3.50%, floating
through October 30, 2005. On and after October 31, 2005, pricing shall be
dependent upon the New Ratio calculation described above. If the New Ratio is
less than 4.25 to 1, then pricing will be either Prime - 0.25% or LIBOR + 2.50%,
at the Company's option. If the New Ratio is greater than or equal to 4.25 to 1
but less than 5.00 to 1, then pricing will be either Prime + 0.25% or LIBOR +
3.00%, at the Company's option. If the New Ratio is greater than or equal to
5.00 to 1, then pricing will be either Prime + 0.75% or LIBOR + 3.50%, at the
Company's option.

         The Company is not permitted to redeem shares of its issued and
outstanding common stock for a total amount in excess of $1,000,000 through
October 31, 2005. The Company paid Lender a fee of $36,000 to be distributed
pro-rata between the Lender and the Participants in

                                       2

connection with the execution of the Letter Agreement. The parties intend to
enter into a formal amendment to the Credit Agreement, which will incorporate
the terms of the Letter Agreement.

Columbus, Ohio, December 16, 2004 - Max & Erma's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq/NMS:
MAXE) today reported record fourth quarter and fiscal 2004 year-end results.


Revenues for 2004 rose 9% to a record $183.0 million from $167.1 million in
2003. Net income and net income per share dropped 27% and 25%, respectively to
$1,097,000 or $0.42 per diluted share for 2004 from $1,494,000 or $0.56 per
diluted share for 2003.


For the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company reported revenues of $45.6 million
and a net loss of $220,000 or $(0.09) per diluted share, as compared to revenues
of $39.5 million and a net loss of $683,000 or $(0.28) per diluted share for the
fourth quarter of 2003. The fourth quarter and year-to-date results for 2003
were impacted by a $1.07 million pre-tax charge for the impairment of assets.
The Company wrote down the carrying value of two under-performing restaurants.


Todd Barnum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Max & Erma's credited the
record 2004 revenues to the opening of five company-owned restaurants and a 34%
increase in franchise fees and royalties. Mr. Barnum reported that franchisees
opened four restaurants during 2004 and at year-end there were 20 franchised Max
& Erma's in operation. Mr. Barnum said that same-store-sales were negative 0.4%
for both the fourth quarter and the year. However, he noted that the five
restaurants opened in 2004, reported average weekly sales of over $63,000 or 38%
above the overall chain average. He added that this may be the best group of
openings in the Company's history and that they are expected to contribute
significantly to 2005's results.


Mr. Barnum said the margin pressure brought on by rising commodity costs,
benefit costs and utilities that began in mid-2003 intensified in 2004. As a
result, restaurant level profit margins dipped below 10% for the first time
since 1986. Mr. Barnum said rising beef, chicken and dairy prices cost the
Company approximately $2.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003 prices. Mr.
Barnum noted that the Company is attacking this problem in several ways. We have
reviewed and adjusted menu prices, contracted for chicken at a 22% savings from
its peak price and reviewed virtually every menu item for recipe and spec
savings. The Company expects to see an improvement in cost of goods sold as a
percentage of sales in 2005. He added that changes in the benefits

<PAGE>

area should also lower our benefit expense in 2005 by 30 to 40 basis points.
Most importantly, though, Mr. Barnum said the company is increasing its
marketing budget to improve margins through sales growth. He noted that, with
much of our restaurants expenses fixed, any growth in same-store-sales has a
significant effect on the bottom line.


Mr. Barnum said the Company expects to open two to three restaurants in 2005 and
that franchisees are expected to open an additional four to five restaurants. No
restaurants are currently under construction. However, Mr. Barnum said the
Company is in the final stages of permitting two restaurants and franchisees are
about to commence construction on two locations.


Max & Erma's currently owns and operates 78 casual dining full-service
restaurants under the Max & Erma's name in Akron, Columbus, Cleveland,
Cincinnati, Toledo, Dayton and Niles, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Detroit, Ann
Arbor, Grand Rapids and Lansing, Michigan; Pittsburgh and Erie, Pennsylvania;
Lexington and Louisville, Kentucky; Chicago, Illinois; Charlotte, North
Carolina; Atlanta, Georgia and Norfolk and Virginia Beach, Virginia. The Company
also franchises 20 restaurants in Chillicothe, Cincinnati, Cleveland, Columbus,
Dayton, Sandusky and Wilmington, Ohio, the Ohio Turnpike, St. Louis, Missouri,
Green Bay, Wisconsin, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania and Southern Indiana. The
Company's common shares are traded on the NASDAQ National Market System under
the symbol MAXE.


This release includes "forward-looking" information statements, as defined in
the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, including the statements
relating to future restaurant openings. Actual performance may differ materially
from that projected in such statements. Major factors potentially affecting
performance include a significant change in the performance of any existing
restaurants, the ability to obtain locations for, and complete construction of,
additional restaurants at acceptable costs, changes in the cost of food items,
the ability to obtain the services of qualified personnel at acceptable wages,
an other risks of the restaurant business. The Cautionary statements regularly
filed by the Company in its most recent annual report to the Securities and
Exchange Commission on Form 10-K and its Quarterly Reports to the SEC on Forms
10-Q are incorporated herein by reference. Investors are specifically referred
to such Cautionary statements for a discussion of factors which could affect the
Company's operations and forward-looking statements made in this communication.
