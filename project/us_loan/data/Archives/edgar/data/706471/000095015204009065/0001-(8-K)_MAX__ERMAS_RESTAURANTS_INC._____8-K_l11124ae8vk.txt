ITEM 1.01         ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

         On December 14, 2004, the board of directors of Max & Erma's
Restaurants, Inc. (the "Company") authorized the Company to enter into a letter
agreement (the "Letter Agreement") with The Provident Bank, whose successor by
merger is National City Bank (the "Lender"), and National City Bank and The
Huntington National Bank (collectively, the "Participants"), to amend the
Company's Fifth Amended and Restated Revolving Credit Agreement, dated September
22, 2003 and amended on December 31, 2003 and May 17, 2004 (the "Credit
Agreement").

         Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the parties have agreed to amend or
eliminate certain negative covenants contained in the Credit Agreement as
follows:

         -    the Company's "fixed charge coverage ratio" will be amended so
              that the ratio shall not be less than: (i) 1.00 to 1 from November
              1, 2004 through the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2005, (ii)
              1.05 to 1 during the third quarter of fiscal 2005, (iii) 1.10 to 1
              during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, (iv) 1.15 to 1 during
              the first quarter of fiscal 2006, and (v) 1.20 to 1 on and after
              the beginning of the second quarter of fiscal 2006;

         -    the Company's "earnings before taxes" covenant will be eliminated;

         -    the Company's "interest coverage ratio" will be eliminated; and

         -    the Company's "senior debt to EBITDA" ratio will be amended so
              that the ratio shall not be more than: (i) 2.50 to 1 through
              October 31, 2005, and (ii) 2.25 to 1 subsequent to October 31,
              2005.

In addition, the parties have agreed to add a new financial ratio test so that
(Senior Debt + (Current Year Future Minimum Rental Commitments x 8))/EBITDA (the
"New Ratio") will not be more than: (i) 5.75 to 1 from November 1, 2004 through
October 30, 2005, (ii) 5.50 to 1 from October 31, 2005 through October 29, 2006,
(iii) not more than 5.25 to 1 on and after October 30, 2006.

         Pursuant to the Letter Agreement, the pricing on all credit facilities
shall remain at the Company's option of Prime + 0.75% or LIBOR + 3.50%, floating
through October 30, 2005. On and after October 31, 2005, pricing shall be
dependent upon the New Ratio calculation described above. If the New Ratio is
less than 4.25 to 1, then pricing will be either Prime - 0.25% or LIBOR + 2.50%,
at the Company's option. If the New Ratio is greater than or equal to 4.25 to 1
but less than 5.00 to 1, then pricing will be either Prime + 0.25% or LIBOR +
3.00%, at the Company's option. If the New Ratio is greater than or equal to
5.00 to 1, then pricing will be either Prime + 0.75% or LIBOR + 3.50%, at the
Company's option.

         The Company is not permitted to redeem shares of its issued and
outstanding common stock for a total amount in excess of $1,000,000 through
October 31, 2005. The Company paid Lender a fee of $36,000 to be distributed
pro-rata between the Lender and the Participants in

                                       2

enter into a formal amendment to the Credit Agreement, which will incorporate
the terms of the Letter Agreement.
