Columbus, Ohio, December 16, 2004 - Max & Erma's Restaurants, Inc. (Nasdaq/NMS:
MAXE) today reported record fourth quarter and fiscal 2004 year-end results.


Revenues for 2004 rose 9% to a record $183.0 million from $167.1 million in
2003. Net income and net income per share dropped 27% and 25%, respectively to
$1,097,000 or $0.42 per diluted share for 2004 from $1,494,000 or $0.56 per
diluted share for 2003.


For the fourth quarter of 2004 the Company reported revenues of $45.6 million
and a net loss of $220,000 or $(0.09) per diluted share, as compared to revenues
of $39.5 million and a net loss of $683,000 or $(0.28) per diluted share for the
fourth quarter of 2003. The fourth quarter and year-to-date results for 2003
were impacted by a $1.07 million pre-tax charge for the impairment of assets.
The Company wrote down the carrying value of two under-performing restaurants.


Todd Barnum, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Max & Erma's credited the
record 2004 revenues to the opening of five company-owned restaurants and a 34%
increase in franchise fees and royalties. Mr. Barnum reported that franchisees
opened four restaurants during 2004 and at year-end there were 20 franchised Max
& Erma's in operation. Mr. Barnum said that same-store-sales were negative 0.4%
for both the fourth quarter and the year. However, he noted that the five
restaurants opened in 2004, reported average weekly sales of over $63,000 or 38%
above the overall chain average. He added that this may be the best group of
openings in the Company's history and that they are expected to contribute
significantly to 2005's results.


Mr. Barnum said the margin pressure brought on by rising commodity costs,
benefit costs and utilities that began in mid-2003 intensified in 2004. As a
result, restaurant level profit margins dipped below 10% for the first time
since 1986. Mr. Barnum said rising beef, chicken and dairy prices cost the
Company approximately $2.9 million in 2004, as compared to 2003 prices. Mr.
Barnum noted that the Company is attacking this problem in several ways. We have
reviewed and adjusted menu prices, contracted for chicken at a 22% savings from
its peak price and reviewed virtually every menu item for recipe and spec
savings. The Company expects to see an improvement in cost of goods sold as a
percentage of sales in 2005. He added that changes in the benefits

area should also lower our benefit expense in 2005 by 30 to 40 basis points.
Most importantly, though, Mr. Barnum said the company is increasing its
marketing budget to improve margins through sales growth. He noted that, with
much of our restaurants expenses fixed, any growth in same-store-sales has a
significant effect on the bottom line.


Mr. Barnum said the Company expects to open two to three restaurants in 2005 and
that franchisees are expected to open an additional four to five restaurants. No
restaurants are currently under construction. However, Mr. Barnum said the
Company is in the final stages of permitting two restaurants and franchisees are
about to commence construction on two locations.


Max & Erma's currently owns and operates 78 casual dining full-service
restaurants under the Max & Erma's name in Akron, Columbus, Cleveland,
Cincinnati, Toledo, Dayton and Niles, Ohio; Indianapolis, Indiana; Detroit, Ann
Arbor, Grand Rapids and Lansing, Michigan; Pittsburgh and Erie, Pennsylvania;
