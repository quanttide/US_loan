Item 8.01.     Other Events.

     During the week of December 6, 2004, we uncovered evidence
suggesting that a former employee embezzled funds from us in the amount
of approximately $970,000.  Upon making a preliminary determination of
impropriety, we engaged our audit committee, and filed a criminal
complaint.  In addition, we involved our external auditors and our
outside counsel to confirm our preliminary determination of impropriety.
As a result of the investigation performed to date, we believe that we
have identified the extent of the fraudulent activity.  Specifically, we
believe that the fraud was perpetrated by a single individual during the
period beginning approximately May 2001 and ending approximately
November 2004.  Our investigation is not complete.  We have notified our
insurance company of the loss under our crime insurance policy and
believe we have sufficient coverage to recoup our losses; however, the
insurance carrier is continuing its review of the matter.

     We are currently working with the audit committee of our board of
directors and our external auditors to ensure appropriate accounting
treatment and to identify any potential impact on our historical
financial statements.  We currently believe there will be no net income
(loss) change for any of the historical financial statements.  To the
extent the Company recovers under any of its insurance policies, the
gain would be reflected in future financial statements.

     We are continuing to review our internal controls over financial
reporting, both overall and in light of this development.  As an initial
step to prevent future fraudulent activity, we have modified certain of
our internal controls including the process by which bad debt expense is
authorized and approved.  We are evaluating further actions to improve
our internal controls as a result of this matter.  However, there can be
no assurance that our controls and procedures will prevent future errors
or fraudulent activity.
