<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;23, 2004, Maxtor Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) and Quantum Corporation (&#147;Quantum&#148;)
entered into a &#147;Mutual General Release and Global Settlement Agreement&#148; (the &#147;General Release&#148;) by
which the parties, among other things, (i)&nbsp;amended the &#147;Tax Sharing and Indemnity Agreement&#148; dated
April&nbsp;2, 2001 among Quantum, Insula Corporation and the Company (the &#147;Tax Sharing Agreement&#148;),
filed as Exhibit&nbsp;2.4 to the Company&#146;s Form 8-K filed April&nbsp;17, 2001 and (ii)&nbsp;amended the
&#147;Transitional Services Agreement&#148; dated April&nbsp;2, 2001 among Quantum, Insula Corporation and the
Company (the &#147;Services Agreement&#148;), filed as Exhibit&nbsp;2.5 to the Company&#146;s Form 8-K filed April&nbsp;17,
2001. The parties entered into the Tax Sharing Agreement and Services Agreement in connection with
the acquisition by the Company of Quantum&#146;s hard disk drive business on April&nbsp;2, 2001. A
discussion of the Company&#146;s obligations under the Tax Sharing Agreement is provided within
&#147;Management&#146;s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations &#151; Provision
for Income Taxes&#148; in the Company&#146;s Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December&nbsp;27, 2003 and Form
10-Q for the period ended September&nbsp;25, 2004. The Company&#146;s obligations under the Services
Agreement had been completed, other than the matters resolved by the General Release.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the General Release, the parties (a)&nbsp;clarified the parties&#146;
obligations as well as rights to any tax refunds with respect to the Internal Revenue Service&#146;s
audits of Quantum for the fiscal years ending March&nbsp;31, 1997 through and including March&nbsp;31, 1999,
(b)&nbsp;agreed upon control of and payment of fees and costs associated with the Internal Revenue
Service&#146;s audit of Quantum for the fiscal years ending March&nbsp;31, 2000 through and including March
31, 2002, (c)&nbsp;settled certain claims that the parties had with each other, and (d)&nbsp;released and
discharged each other from certain claims that the parties had with each other. The amendments to
the Tax Sharing Agreement and the Services Agreement material to the Company are further described
below:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Release amended the Tax Sharing Agreement in the following respects material to
the Company:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Section&nbsp;1 of the Tax Sharing Agreement provided for the sharing of the tax liabilities of
the HDD business acquired by the Company and the DSS business retained by Quantum for periods prior
to April&nbsp;2, 2001. The Company and Quantum have disputed the operation of this section. Under the
General Release all claims arising under this section are released and the section is terminated in
its entirety.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Section&nbsp;3(a) of the Tax Sharing Agreement provided for the Company&#146;s indemnity of Quantum
for various taxes attributable to periods prior to April&nbsp;2, 2001. Under the Tax Sharing Agreement,
this indemnity obligation was limited to the sum of $142,000,000 plus 50% of the excess over
$142,000,000. As of the time of entering into the Tax Sharing Agreement the Company concluded that
the likelihood of this tax indemnity obligation exceeding $142,000,000 in the aggregate was remote.
As of September&nbsp;25, 2004 the Company had paid $8,303,368 under this tax indemnity. Since
September&nbsp;25, 2004 the Company made additional payments of $246,240 under this tax indemnity.
Under the General Release, the Company&#146;s remaining tax indemnity liability under section 3(a) for
all tax claims (other than the IRS audit of Quantum for the fiscal years ending March&nbsp;31, 1997
through and including March&nbsp;31, 1999) is limited to $8,760,000. In addition, under the General
Release, the Company shall have no tax indemnity liability for the IRS audit of Quantum for the
fiscal years ending March&nbsp;31, 1997 through and including March&nbsp;31, 1999, except in circumstances
that the Company believes are remote.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Under the Tax Sharing Agreement, the Company has the right to control the contest of a
claimed tax deficiency that would be subject to indemnity and is responsible for the costs of such
contest. Under the General Release, the Company and Quantum shall jointly control the Internal
Revenue Service audit of Quantum for the fiscal years ending March&nbsp;31, 2000 through and including
March&nbsp;31, 2002, and shall share such audit defense costs.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;In all other material respects the Tax Sharing Agreement is unchanged.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The General Release amended the Services Agreement in the following respects material to the
Company:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Under the Services Agreement, Quantum provided certain transitional services to the
Company. The Company and Quantum disputed amounts owed under the Services Agreement. Under the
General Release, all claims arising under the Services Agreement are released.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;In all other material respects the Services Agreement is unchanged.
