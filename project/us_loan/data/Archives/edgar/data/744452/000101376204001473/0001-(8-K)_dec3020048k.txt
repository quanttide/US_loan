Item 8.01  Other events.

On December 29, 2004, Applied DNA Sciences, Inc. filed a late notice with the
Commission for an extension in filing its 10-KSB for the year ended September
30, 2004. As a courtesy to the public, the Company wishes to articulate, in more
detail, the reason for this delay.

Earlier this year our Chief Financial Officer, Mr. Gerhardt Wehr, suffered a
stroke and we have been actively seeking a qualified replacement. Rob Hutchison,
our Chairman, has been acting as interim CFO during this period. On December 20,
2004, we engaged the services of a qualified CPA to assist management in
completing our financials for the completion of the audit, and due to limited
staff availability over the holidays, it was administratively impossible to file
on time. It is Management's commitment that the 10-KSB will be filed prior to 15
day extension period.
