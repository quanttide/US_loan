ITEM 5.01 CHANGES IN CONTROL OF REGISTRANT

     On December 15, 2004, Timothy Harrington, Chief Executive officer of Able
Energy, Inc. (the "Company"), sold an aggregate of 1,007,300 shares of the
Company's common stock to All American Plazas, Inc. ("All American"). The
purchase price for the sale was $7,500,000, of which $2,750,000 was paid in cash
and All American issued promissory notes in the aggregate principal amount of
$4,750,000 to Mr. Harrington. For the first 12 months, only interest is payable
to Mr. Harrington. Thereafter, principal and interest shall be payable on a
monthly basis. In the event All American and Able were to enter into any
transaction pursuant to which the promissory notes become an obligation of the
Company and the Company enters into a material financing transaction, the notes
will become immediately due and payable. There are currently no plans,
arrangements or agreements for the notes to become obligations of the Company.
$3,000,000 of the notes are secured by the personal guarantee of a family member
of the trust which owns a majority of the stock of All American (the
"Guarantee"), and by a security interest in certain assets of All American (the
"All American Security"). All of the notes are secured by a pledge of the
1,007,300 shares of the Company's common stock (the "Pledge"). Upon the issuance
of surety bonds guaranteeing the payment of the $3,000,000 of notes, the
Guarantee and the All American Security will terminate and the Pledge, by its
terms, will cover only the $1,750,000 note which is not covered by a surety
bond. All American acquired approximately 50.03% of the total outstanding number
of shares of common stock of the Company and the 1,007,300 shares represent All
American's entire beneficial holdings in the Company. All American financed the
acquisition through its cash flow, with the assistance of its fuel supplier,
TransMontaigne Product Services, Inc., that extended its credit line to All
American.

     No arrangement or understandings were made in connection with respect to
the election of directors or other matters, although the parties anticipate they
will discuss such matters in the future.
