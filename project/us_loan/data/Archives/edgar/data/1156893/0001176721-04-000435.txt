Item  1.01  Entry  into  a  Material  Definitive  Agreement.

     Effective  December 23, 2004, NS8 Corporation (the "Company") determined to
reduce  the exercise price of all of its outstanding warrants to purchase common
stock,  $.0001  par  value  per  share  ("Common  Stock"),  of the Company.  The
warrants,  which are exercisable to purchase an aggregate of 9,012,001 shares of
Common  Stock  and are held by six warrant holders, had original exercise prices
ranging  from  $0.57  per  share  to $2.00 per share.  The new exercise price is
$0.61  per  share, which the Company believes more accurately reflects the value
of  the  Common  Stock  underlying  the  warrants.  The  warrants were issued to
private  investors  in transactions which were exempt from registration pursuant
to  Section  4(2)  of  the  Securities  Act  of  1933  (the  "1933  Act") and/or
Regulation  D  promulgated  under  the  1933 Act.  The Company and the investors
orally  agreed  to  the  repricing.

     Certain  information  regarding the warrants and their holders is set forth
below.

     Clarion  Finance  AG  was  issued  warrants on December 29, 2003 to acquire
233,333  shares  of  Common  Stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.  The
warrants  expire  on  December  29,  2005.

     Centrum  Bank was issued warrants on December 29, 2003 to acquire 1,166,667
shares  of  Common  Stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.  The warrants
expire  on  December  29,  2005.

     4Com  Corporation  was  issued warrants on April 26, 2004 to acquire 75,000
shares  of  Common  Stock at an exercise price of $1.00 per share.  The warrants
expire  on  April  25,  2006.

     Martin Calvert was issued three warrants to purchase an aggregate of 97,500
shares of Common Stock during the period June 1, 2004 through December 17, 2004.
All  of  these  warrants  expire two years from their date of issuance, and were
exercisable  at  prices  ranging  from  $0.57  to  $1.04 per share.  Mr. Calvert
resigned  as  a  director  of  the  Company  in  August  2004.

     Maximum  Ventures,  Inc.  was  issued  warrants  on May 18, 2004 to acquire
5,439,501  shares  of Common Stock at an exercise price of $2.00 per share.  The
warrants  expire  on  May  18,  2009.

     On  October  7, 2004, Leap Consulting, Inc. was issued warrants to purchase
1,000,000  shares  of  Common  Stock at an exercise price of $1.03 per share and
warrants  to  purchase  1,000,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of
$1.13  per  share.  All  of  these  warrants  expire  on  October  7,  2009.

     To  date,  none  of  the  above  warrants  have  been  exercised.

issued,  and the warrants as repriced will be reissued, pursuant to an exemption
