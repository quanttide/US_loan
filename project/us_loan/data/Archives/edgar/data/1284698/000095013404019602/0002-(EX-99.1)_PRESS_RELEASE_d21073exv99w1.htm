<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>UGC Acquires Liberty Media International&#146;s Interests<BR>
In European Operators Telenet and Chorus</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Denver, Colorado &#151; December&nbsp;20, 2004</B>: UnitedGlobalCom, Inc. (&#147;UGC&#148;) (Nasdaq: UCOMA) and
Liberty Media International, Inc. (&#147;LMI&#148;) (Nasdaq: LBTYA, LBTYB) today announced transactions
involving LMI&#146;s indirect interests in Telenet Group Holding N.V. (&#147;Telenet&#148;), Belgium&#146;s largest
cable television operator, and Chorus Communications Limited (&#147;Chorus&#148;), a major pay television
provider in Ireland.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the first transaction, indirect wholly-owned European subsidiaries of UGC (&#147;UGC Newcos&#148;) first
acquired from LMI various debt instruments of Cable Partners Europe (&#147;CPE&#148;) and one of its
subsidiaries and then participated with CPE in a restructuring which resulted in the UGC Newcos now
holding a 78.4% common equity interest and 100% preferred equity interest in Belgian Cable
Investors (&#147;BCI&#148;). BCI in turn holds an indirect 14.1% interest in Telenet. The aggregate
consideration to complete the transactions above was approximately $143&nbsp;million, of which $121
million was paid to LMI. As a result of the transactions above, the UGC Newcos have appointed two
representatives to the board of Telenet and will benefit from certain rights related to governance
and the potential acquisition of additional equity in Telenet. Telenet is Belgium&#146;s largest cable
operator with approximately 2.5&nbsp;million video, voice and broadband Internet RGUs. The total
consideration paid by the UGC Newcos for the interest in BCI represents a multiple of approximately
7.8 times Telenet&#146;s 2004 EBITDA on a nine-month annualized basis.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">In the second transaction, UGC has acquired LMI&#146;s 100% ownership interest in Chorus for 6.4&nbsp;million
shares of UGC Class&nbsp;A common stock valued at approximately $55&nbsp;million. Chorus is Ireland&#146;s second
largest cable television and MMDS operator providing video, voice and broadband Internet services
to over 200,000 RGUs. Chorus also had <FONT face="'Times New Roman',times,serif">&#128;</FONT>80.1&nbsp;million of indebtedness for borrowed money at October
31, 2004. The purchase price for Chorus represents a multiple of approximately 6.9 times estimated
2004 EBITDA.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mike Fries, President and Chief Executive Officer of UGC, said, &#147;These acquisitions strengthen our
position as the leading broadband operator in Europe. Telenet is one of the most attractive
stand-alone assets in our business with a triple play strategy and results that largely mirror our
own. And we will consolidate meaningful operating cash flow from Chorus.&#148;

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;This transaction reinforces UGC&#146;s position as our primary European broadband vehicle,&#148; stated John
C. Malone, President and Chief Executive Officer of LMI. Mr.&nbsp;Malone went on to say, &#147;The Telenet
and Chorus management teams have done an outstanding job growing their respective businesses and
delivering superior broadband services to their customers. These teams now have the opportunity to
benefit from UGC&#146;s significant scale, operating efficiency and expertise.<I>&#148;</I>
