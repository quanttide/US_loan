  A Porphyry System And Suggest Direction Of Porphyry Center </font></B> </P>
<P align="justify"> Tucson, Arizona &#150; December 24, 2004 &#150;Liberty Star
  Gold Corp. (the &#147;Company&#148;), (symbol: LBTS.OB) is pleased to announce
  receipt of assay results on the White Sox initial drilling program. White Sox
  lies about 9 miles north east of the massive Northern Dynasty Pebble Project
  (TSX.V: NDM; OTCBB: NDMLF) in Southwestern Alaska. </P>
<P align="justify"> <B>White Sox, </B>(see last NR)<B> </B>was the target of a
  4-hole diamond drill program taking place between October 21 &amp; October 31,
  2004; 1,329 feet (405 meters) of diamond core was drilled. Altered and mineralized
  sedimentary rocks cut by porphyry dikes and quartz veins were intersected. Copper
  and molybdenum sulphides were visible in some intervals of the core. The alteration,
  mineralization and intrusive dikes are of the same type as the Pebble deposit
  approximately 9 miles to the southeast. </P>
<P align="justify"> Assay values from the split core have been returned from ALS
  Chemex, a Certified Assay Laboratory in Vancouver, B.C. Canada. The core samples
  were analysed for forty-eight elements including gold, copper, molybdenum (moly)
  and silver. Most values were in the low range but these widely spaced holes,
  approximately 0.6 miles (about 0.95 km) apart, were intended to be a preliminary
  test of widely spaced IP geophysics and geochemical samples related to magnetic
  anomalies. The holes have served their purpose in that holes BC 1 and BC 4 intercepted
  strong sulphides but low to nil copper and moly values while holes BC 2 and
  3 which lie between but to the east of BC- 1 &amp; 4 have significantly anomalous
  values of copper, moly, lead and silver showing higher values in the drill holes
  in the same interval, related to mineralized fractures, veinlets and dikes.
  This is characteristic of porphyry deposits where metals are zoned in a bull&#146;s
  eye fashion with a high moly center, surrounded by copper that is in turn surrounded
  by lead, then silver and zinc. There are also alteration mineral zones that
  correspond roughly to the metal zones. This zoning pattern was first understood
  and described by Dr. John Guilbert (with J David Lowell) as the &#147;Porphyry
  Copper Model&#148; for which, among other accomplishments, he was awarded the
  Penrose and Jackling Gold Medals &#150; mining&#146;s highest awards. Dr Guilbert
  is on the board of directors of Liberty Star Gold Corp. These combinations of
  metals in the various holes describe patterns that suggest we are on the edge
  of a porphyry copper-gold-moly-silver center, which lies to the east of the
  current drill holes. Additional geochem sampling and IP ground electrical survey
  lines will be concentrated to the east, where the center is thought to be located.
  The IP lines will be extended to define the other side of the pyrite halo which
  is thought to surround the mineral center and which holes BC 1 and 4 appear
  to have intersected the west side of. </P>
<P align="justify"> In summary, all holes intercepted measurable but low grade
  gold ranging from 0.5 ppb (parts per billion) to a high of 44 ppb in BC-1; copper
  ranged from 48 ppm to 564 ppm (or about 0.06%) in drill hole BC- 3; moly ranged
  from 0.38 ppm in BC-1 to 289 ppm (about 0.03% or higher than the Pebble average
  grade of moly) in BC-3. Drill hole BC-3 (closer to the mineral center) had 456
  ppm (about 0.05%) copper over 8.1 meters between 70.82 and 78.94 meters, and
  564 ppm (about 0.06%) copper over 3 meters at a depth of 42 meters. </P>
<P align="justify"> It is concluded that holes BC 1 and 4 are in the low copper-moly
  pyrite halo and holes BC-2 and 3 are in the propylitic &#150;phyllic alteration
  boundary and outer metal halo and closer to the porphyry center. </P>
<P align="justify"> Coupled with aeromag, IP, and geochemical data, the information
  from these 4 widely spaced holes is very encouraging. It shows characteristics
  of the outer portions of a porphyry system and points toward the porphyry center
  that appears to lie to the east of drill hole BC-3. </P>
