(1) Subject to a variance of plus or minus 10%.

(2) As of the delivery date, the ``assumed final distribution date'' with
respect to any class of offered certificates is the distribution date on which
the final distribution would occur for such class of certificates based upon the
assumptions, among others, that all payments are made when due and that no
mortgage loan is prepaid, in whole or in part, prior to its stated maturity and
otherwise based on the maturity assumptions described in this prospectus
supplement, if any. The actual performance and experience of the mortgage loans
will likely differ from such assumptions. See ``Yield and Maturity
Considerations'' in this prospectus supplement.

(3) It is a condition to their issuance that the classes of offered certificates
be assigned ratings by
Standard & Poor's Ratings Services, a division of The McGraw-Hill Companies,
Inc. and/or Fitch, Inc. no lower than those set forth above. The ratings on the
offered certificates do not represent any assessments of (i) the likelihood or
frequency of voluntary or involuntary principal prepayments on the mortgage
loans, (ii) the degree to which such prepayments might differ from those
originally anticipated, (iii) whether and to what extent prepayment premiums
will be collected on the mortgage loans in connection with such prepayments or
the corresponding effect on yield to investors or (iv) whether and to what
extent default interest will be received or net aggregate prepayment interest
shortfalls will be realized.

(4) The ``rated final distribution date'' for each class of offered certificates
has been set at the first distribution date that follows two years after the end
of the amortization term for the mortgage loan that, as of the cut-off date, has
the longest remaining amortization term, irrespective of its scheduled maturity.
See ``Ratings'' in this prospectus supplement.

(5) The Class A-4 and Class A-J Certificates will accrue interest at a fixed
rate subject to a cap at the weighted average net mortgage rate.

(6) The Class B, Class C and Class D Certificates will accrue interest at either
(i) a fixed rate, (ii) a fixed rate subject to a cap at the weighted average net
mortgage rate, (iii) the weighted average net mortgage rate or (iv) the weighted
average net mortgage rate less a specified percentage.

(7) The Class XP Certificates will not have a certificate balance and their
holders will not receive distributions of principal, but such holders are
entitled to receive payments of the aggregate interest accrued on the notional
amount of the Class XP Certificates, as described in this prospectus supplement.
The interest rate applicable to the Class XP Certificates for each distribution
date will be as described in this prospectus supplement. See ``Description of
the Certificates--Pass- Through Rates'' in this prospectus supplement.

For purpose of deriving the Schedule WAC for the PAC IO, run the the following
scenarios:

1) 100% CPY with a 1% Call for the PAC IO and 6% CDR starting in month 1, 35%
loss severity, 12 month lag 2) 100% CPY with 1% Call for the PAC IO (after
LO/YM) 3) 100% CPR with 1% Call for the PAC IO (after LO) 4) 0% CPR with 1 %
Call for the PAC IO
