     On December 22, 2004 we completed the sale of our Mallusk, Northern Ireland
facility and certain equipment located at the facility to John McCann. The
purchase price was (pound)5.0 million ($9.6 million), paid in cash. Other than
the sales transaction, there is no other relationship existing between the
purchaser and us or any of our affiliates, directors or officers, or any
associates of any of them. At the time of the sale, we were not using the
facility in our operations.

     The proceeds from the sale were used to payoff the two outstanding
mortgages held on the facility for approximately (pound)3.2 million ($6.2
million), closing and clean-up costs of (pound)250,000 ($482,000) and payment of
approximately (pound)1.5 million ($2.9 million) of our obligations under the
settlement agreement described in Item 8.01 below.

     The Company expects to record a gain on the sale of the assets of
approximately $4.5 million.

     Giving effect to the sale of the facility and equipment and the settlement
agreement described in Item 8.01 as if they had occurred at September 30, 2004,
these transactions would have had a pro forma effect on our balance sheet of (i)
reducing current liabilities by approximately $2.1 million, (ii) reducing total
liabilities by approximately $10.0 million, (iii) increasing working capital by
approximately $2.2 million and (iv) reducing property, plant and equipment, net
and total assets by approximately $4.8 million.

ITEM 8.01 OTHER EVENTS.

     On December 21, 2004, we and Invest Northern Ireland, formerly known as the
Ireland Development Board ("INI"), entered into a settlement agreement pursuant
to which INI agreed to release us of all outstanding claims and other
obligations owing to INI in connection with grants previously provided to it for
our Mallusk, Northern Ireland manufacturing facility. In consideration for the
release, we agreed to pay to INI a total of (pound)3.0 million ($5.8 million).
Of this amount, (pound)1.0 million ($1.9 million) was satisfied by delivering a
total of 539,416 shares of our common stock to INI. Under the agreement, the
remaining amount ((pound)2.0 million or $3.9 million), is required to be paid on
the earlier of the sale of our Mallusk, Northern Ireland manufacturing facility
and June 2005. As a result of the transactions described in Item 2.01 above, all
but approximately (pound)350,000 owing under the settlement agreement has been
paid as of the date of this report.

     A copy of the settlement agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and
is incorporated into this Item 8.01 by reference.
