Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 22, 2004, we sold 928,503 Units to 16 accredited investors
in a second closing of the private transaction previously reported on a Form 8-K
filed on October 7, 2004. Each unit is comprised of one share of our common
stock and a warrant to purchase one-fifth of one share of our common stock for
$2.50 per share exercisable during the next five years. The investors paid $1.50
per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,392,755.

         The details of the sale of the Units, including all information
required by Item 1.01. of this Current Report on Form 8-K (this "Report"), are
set forth in Item 3.02. " Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities " below, the
contents of which are incorporated by reference herein.


Item 3.02.  Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

         On December 22, 2004, we sold 928,503 Units to 16 accredited investors
in a second closing of the private transaction. Each unit is comprised of one
share of our common stock and a warrant to purchase one-fifth of one share of
our common stock for $2.50 per share exercisable during the next five years. The
investors paid $1.50 per Unit, for aggregate gross proceeds of $1,392,755.

         This sale was the second closing of a private placement of up to
3,500,000 Units authorized by our board of directors.

         We agreed to register the resale of the shares of common stock issued
in connection with the sale of the Units and the shares issuable upon the
exercise of the warrants issued in connection with the sale of the Units. If we
fail to do so within 180 days of November 30, 2004, then each investor will
receive additional shares of common stock at the rate of 1% of the number of
shares of common stock included in the Units purchased by such investor per full
month thereafter that such registration statement is not effective.

         We sold the Units pursuant to certain exemptions from registration
provided by Rule 506 of Regulation D and Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of
1933, as amended.
