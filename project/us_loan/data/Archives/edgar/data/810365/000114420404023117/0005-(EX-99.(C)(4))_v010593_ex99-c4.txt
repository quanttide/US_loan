another  appropriate  form in accordance  herewith)  and shall  contain  (unless

attached hereto as Annex A. Subject to the terms of this Agreement,  the Company
shall use its best  efforts to cause the  Registration  Statement to be declared
effective  under the  Securities  Act as promptly  as possible  after the filing
thereof, but in any event prior to the applicable  Effectiveness Date, and shall
use its best efforts to keep such Registration  Statement continuously effective
under the  Securities  Act  until all  Registrable  Securities  covered  by such
Registration  Statement  have  been sold in any  manner  or may be sold  without
volume restrictions  pursuant to Rule 144(k) as determined by the counsel to the
Company  pursuant to a written  opinion  letter to such  effect,  addressed  and
acceptable  to the  Company's  transfer  agent  and the  affected  Holders  (the
"Effectiveness  Period").  The  Company  shall  promptly  notify the Holders via
facsimile of the  effectiveness  of the  Registration  Statement on the same day
that the Company receives notification of the effectiveness from the Commission.
Failure to so notify the Holder within 1 Trading Day of such notification  shall
be deemed an Event under Section 2(b).

            (b) If: (i) a Registration Statement is not filed on or prior to its
Filing Date (if the Company files a Registration Statement without affording the
Holders the opportunity to review and comment on the same as required by Section
3(a),  the Company  shall not be deemed to have  satisfied  this clause (i)), or
(ii) the Company fails to file with the Commission a request for acceleration in
accordance  with Rule 461  promulgated  under the  Securities  Act,  within five
Trading  Days of the date that the  Company is  notified  (orally or in writing,
whichever is earlier) by the Commission  that a Registration  Statement will not
be  "reviewed,"  or not  subject  to  further  review,  or (iii) a  Registration
Statement filed or required to be filed  hereunder is not declared  effective by
the Commission by its Effectiveness  Date, or (iv) after the Effectiveness Date,
a Registration  Statement ceases for any reason to remain continuously effective
as to all  Registrable  Securities for which it is required to be effective,  or
the Holders are not permitted to utilize the  Prospectus  therein to resell such


                                       3
<PAGE>

Registrable  Securities  for 15  consecutive  calendar  days but no more than an
aggregate  of 25 calendar  days during any  12-month  period  (which need not be
consecutive  Trading  Days) (any such failure or breach being  referred to as an
"Event",  and for  purposes  of clause (i) or (iii) the date on which such Event
occurs,  or for  purposes of clause (ii) the date on which such five Trading Day
period is exceeded,  or for purposes of clause (iv) the date on which such 15 or
25 calendar day period,  as applicable,  is exceeded being referred to as "Event
Date"),  then in addition to any other rights the Holders may have  hereunder or
under applicable law, on each such Event Date and on each monthly anniversary of
each such Event Date (if the applicable  Event shall not have been cured by such
date) until the applicable  Event is cured, the Company shall pay to each Holder
an amount in cash, as partial liquidated damages and not as a penalty,  equal to
2% of the aggregate  purchase price paid by such Holder pursuant to the Purchase
Agreement  for any  Registrable  Securities  then  held by such  Holder.  If the
Company fails to pay any partial  liquidated damages pursuant to this Section in
full within  seven days after the date  payable,  the Company  will pay interest
thereon  at a rate of 18% per  annum  (or such  lesser  maximum  amount  that is
permitted to be paid by applicable  law) to the Holder,  accruing daily from the
date such partial liquidated  damages are due until such amounts,  plus all such
interest thereon,  are paid in full. The partial  liquidated damages pursuant to
the terms  hereof  shall  apply on a daily  pro-rata  basis for any portion of a
month prior to the cure of an Event.

      3. Registration Procedures

            In connection with the Company's registration obligations hereunder,
the Company shall:

            (a) Not less  than two  Trading  Days  prior to the  filing  of each
Registration  Statement or any related Prospectus or any amendment or supplement
thereto  (including  any  document  that would be  incorporated  or deemed to be
incorporated  therein by  reference),  the  Company  shall,  (i) furnish to each
Holder copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, which documents (other
than those  incorporated  or deemed to be  incorporated  by  reference)  will be
subject  to the  review  of such  Holders,  and  (ii)  cause  its  officers  and
directors,  counsel and independent  certified public  accountants to respond to
such inquiries as shall be necessary,  in the  reasonable  opinion of respective
counsel  to  conduct  a  reasonable  investigation  within  the  meaning  of the
Securities  Act. The Company  shall not file the  Registration  Statement or any
such Prospectus or any amendments or supplements thereto to which the Holders of
a majority of the Registrable  Securities shall reasonably object in good faith,
provided  that,  the Company is notified of such  objection  in writing no later
than one  Trading Day after the Holders  have been so  furnished  copies of such
documents.   Each   Holder   agrees  to  furnish  to  the  Company  a  completed
Questionnaire  in the form  attached  to this  Agreement  as Annex B (a "Selling
Shareholder  Questionnaire")  not less than two Trading Days prior to the Filing
Date or by the end of the second  Trading Day  following  the date on which such
Holder receives draft  materials in accordance with this Section.  Copies of any
of the aforementioned documents may be delivered to the investors via e-mail.

            (b) (i)  Prepare  and file  with  the  Commission  such  amendments,
including  post-effective  amendments,  to  a  Registration  Statement  and  the
Prospectus  used  in  connection  therewith  as  may  be  necessary  to  keep  a
Registration  Statement  continuously effective as to the applicable Registrable
Securities for the Effectiveness Period and prepare and file with the Commission
such  additional  Registration  Statements in order to register for resale under
the Securities  Act all of the  Registrable  Securities;  (ii) cause the related
Prospectus to be amended or supplemented by any required  Prospectus  supplement
(subject to the terms of this  Agreement),  and as so supplemented or amended to
be filed pursuant to Rule 424; (iii) respond as promptly as reasonably  possible
to any comments  received  from the  Commission  with respect to a  Registration
Statement  or any  amendment  thereto  and as promptly  as  reasonably  possible
provide the Holders true and complete copies of all  correspondence  from and to
the  Commission  relating to a  Registration  Statement;  and (iv) comply in all
material respects with the provisions of the Securities Act and the Exchange Act
with  respect to the  disposition  of all  Registrable  Securities  covered by a
Registration  Statement during the applicable  period in accordance  (subject to
the terms of this  Agreement)  with the intended  methods of  disposition by the
Holders  thereof set forth in such  Registration  Statement  as so amended or in
such Prospectus as so supplemented.

                                       4
<PAGE>

            (c) If during the  Effectiveness  Period,  the number of Registrable
Securities  at any time exceeds 75% of the number of shares of Common Stock then
registered in a Registration  Statement,  then the Company shall file as soon as
reasonably  practicable but in any case prior to the applicable  Filing Date, an
additional Registration Statement covering the resale by the Holders of not less
than 175% of the number of such Registrable Securities.

            (d) Notify the Holders of  Registrable  Securities to be sold (which
notice shall, pursuant to clauses (ii) through (vi) hereof, be accompanied by an
instruction  to suspend the use of the  Prospectus  until the requisite  changes
have been made) as promptly as reasonably  possible  (and, in the case of (i)(A)
below, not less than two Trading Days prior to such filing) and (if requested by
any such  Person in  writing)  confirm  such notice in writing no later than one
Trading  Day  following  the day  (i)(A)  when a  Prospectus  or any  Prospectus
supplement or post-effective  amendment to a Registration  Statement is proposed
to be filed; (B) when the Commission  notifies the Company whether there will be
a "review" of such Registration  Statement and whenever the Commission  comments
in writing on such  Registration  Statement  (the Company shall provide true and
complete  copies  thereof  and  all  written  responses  thereto  to each of the
Holders); and (C) with respect to a Registration Statement or any post-effective
amendment,  when the same  has  become  effective;  (ii) of any  request  by the
Commission or any other Federal or state  governmental  authority for amendments
or  supplements  to a  Registration  Statement or Prospectus  or for  additional
information;  (iii) of the issuance by the  Commission  or any other  federal or
state governmental authority of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of a
Registration  Statement covering any or all of the Registrable Securities or the
initiation  of any  Proceedings  for that  purpose;  (iv) of the  receipt by the
Company of any notification  with respect to the suspension of the qualification
or exemption from qualification of any of the Registrable Securities for sale in
any  jurisdiction,  or the  initiation or threatening of any Proceeding for such
purpose; (v) of the occurrence of any event or passage of time that requires any
revisions to a Registration Statement, Prospectus or other documents so that, in
the case of a Registration  Statement or the Prospectus,  as the case may be, it
will not contain any untrue  statement  of a material  fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the statements
therein,  in  light  of the  circumstances  under  which  they  were  made,  not
misleading;  and (vi) the  occurrence  or  existence  of any  pending  corporate
development  with  respect  to the  Company  that the  Company  believes  may be
material and that, in the determination of the Company, makes it not in the best
interest  of the Company to allow  continued  availability  of the  Registration
Statement or  Prospectus;  provided that any and all of such  information  shall
remain  confidential  to each Holder until such  information  otherwise  becomes
public,  unless  disclosure by a Holder is required by law;  provided,  further,
notwithstanding  each Holder's agreement to keep such information  confidential,
the Holders  make no  acknowledgement  that any such  information  is  material,
non-public information.

                                       5
<PAGE>

            (e) Use its best  efforts to avoid the  issuance  of, or, if issued,
obtain  the  withdrawal  of (i) any  order  suspending  the  effectiveness  of a
Registration  Statement,  or  (ii)  any  suspension  of  the  qualification  (or
exemption from  qualification) of any of the Registrable  Securities for sale in
any jurisdiction, at the earliest practicable moment.

            (f) Furnish to each Holder upon request,  without  charge,  at least
one  conformed  copy of each  such  Registration  Statement  and each  amendment
thereto,   including   financial   statements  and   schedules,   all  documents
incorporated  or deemed to be  incorporated  therein by  reference to the extent
requested  by such  Person,  and all  exhibits to the extent  requested  by such
Person  (including  those  previously  furnished or  incorporated  by reference)
promptly after the filing of such documents with the Commission. The Company may
be deemed to have furnished such document by sending the Holder,  via electronic
mail,  a website  link to such  registration  statement  on  www.sec.gov  or any
similar website.

            (g) Promptly deliver to each Holder,  without charge, as many copies
of the Prospectus or  Prospectuses  (including each form of prospectus) and each
amendment  or  supplement  thereto as such  Persons  may  reasonably  request in
connection with resales by the Holder of Registrable Securities.  Subject to the
terms  of  this  Agreement,  the  Company  hereby  consents  to the  use of such
Prospectus  and each  amendment  or  supplement  thereto by each of the  selling
Holders in connection with the offering and sale of the  Registrable  Securities
covered by such Prospectus and any amendment or supplement thereto, except after
the giving on any notice pursuant to Section 3(d).

            (h) Prior to any resale of Registrable  Securities by a Holder,  use
its commercially reasonable efforts to register or qualify or cooperate with the
selling  Holders  in  connection  with the  registration  or  qualification  (or
exemption from the Registration or qualification) of such Registrable Securities
for the  resale  by the  Holder  under the  securities  or Blue Sky laws of such
jurisdictions  within the United  States as any Holder  reasonably  requests  in
writing,  to keep each  registration or qualification  (or exemption  therefrom)
effective  during the  Effectiveness  Period and to do any and all other acts or
things reasonably  necessary to enable the disposition in such  jurisdictions of
the Registrable  Securities  covered by each Registration  Statement;  provided,
that the Company  shall not be required to qualify  generally  to do business in
any jurisdiction  where it is not then so qualified,  subject the Company to any
material tax in any such jurisdiction  where it is not then so subject or file a
general consent to service of process in any such jurisdiction.

            (i) If  requested  by the  Holders,  cooperate  with the  Holders to
facilitate  the timely  preparation  and delivery of  certificates  representing
Registrable   Securities  to  be  delivered  to  a  transferee   pursuant  to  a
Registration  Statement,  which  certificates  shall  be  free,  to  the  extent
permitted by the Purchase Agreement,  of all restrictive  legends, and to enable
such Registrable  Securities to be in such  denominations and registered in such
names as any such Holders may request.

                                       6
<PAGE>

            (j) Upon the occurrence of any event contemplated by this Section 3,
as promptly as reasonably  possible under the circumstances  taking into account
the Company's good faith  assessment of any adverse  consequences to the Company
and its  stockholders  of the  premature  disclosure  of such  event,  prepare a
supplement or amendment, including a post-effective amendment, to a Registration
Statement or a supplement to the related Prospectus or any document incorporated
or deemed to be incorporated  therein by reference,  and file any other required
document so that, as thereafter delivered,  neither a Registration Statement nor
such Prospectus  will contain an untrue  statement of a material fact or omit to
state a material  fact  required to be stated  therein or  necessary to make the
statements  therein,  in light of the circumstances  under which they were made,
not misleading.  If the Company  notifies the Holders in accordance with clauses
(ii)  through  (v) of Section  3(d) above to suspend  the use of any  Prospectus
until the requisite  changes to such Prospectus have been made, then the Holders
shall suspend use of such  Prospectus.  The Company will use its best efforts to
ensure  that  the  use of  the  Prospectus  may be  resumed  as  promptly  as is
practicable.  The Company  shall be  entitled  to exercise  its right under this
Section  3(j) to  suspend  the  availability  of a  Registration  Statement  and
Prospectus,  subject to the payment of partial  liquidated  damages  pursuant to
Section 2(b),  for a period not to exceed 90 days (which need not be consecutive
days) in any 12 month period.

            (k)  Comply  with  all  applicable  rules  and  regulations  of  the
Commission.

            (l) The Company may require  each  selling  Holder to furnish to the
Company a  certified  statement  as to the  number  of  shares  of Common  Stock
beneficially owned by such Holder and, if required by the Commission, the person
thereof  that has voting and  dispositive  control  over the Shares.  During any
periods  that the  Company  is unable  to meet its  obligations  hereunder  with
respect to the  registration  of the Registrable  Securities  solely because any
Holder  fails to furnish  such  information  within  three  Trading  Days of the
Company's  request,  any liquidated damages that are accruing at such time as to
such  Holder  and its  Affiliates  only  shall be tolled  and any Event that may
otherwise  occur  solely  because of such delay  shall be  suspended  as to such
Holder and its  Affiliates  only,  until such  information  is  delivered to the
Company.

      4.  Registration   Expenses.   All  fees  and  expenses  incident  to  the
performance  of or compliance  with this Agreement by the Company shall be borne
by the Company  whether or not any  Registrable  Securities are sold pursuant to
the Registration  Statement.  The fees and expenses referred to in the foregoing
sentence shall include, without limitation, (i) all registration and filing fees
(including,  without  limitation,  fees and expenses (A) with respect to filings
required  to be made with the Trading  Market on which the Common  Stock is then
listed for trading,  (B) in compliance with applicable  state securities or Blue
Sky laws  reasonably  agreed to by the  Company in writing  (including,  without
limitation, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company in connection with
Blue  Sky  qualifications  or  exemptions  of  the  Registrable  Securities  and

                                       7

determination  of the eligibility of the  Registrable  Securities for investment
under the laws of such  jurisdictions  as requested by the Holders) and (C) with
respect  to any filing  that may be  required  to be made by any broker  through
which a  Holder  intends  to make  sales of  Registrable  Securities  with  NASD
Regulation,  Inc.  pursuant  to the NASD  Rule  2710,  so long as the  broker is
receiving no more than a customary brokerage  commission in connection with such
sale,  (ii)  printing  expenses  (including,  without  limitation,  expenses  of
printing certificates for Registrable Securities and of printing prospectuses if
the  printing  of  prospectuses  is  reasonably  requested  by the  holders of a
majority of the Registrable  Securities  included in a Registration  Statement),
(iii) messenger, telephone and delivery expenses, (iv) fees and disbursements of
counsel for the Company, (v) Securities Act liability insurance,  if the Company
so desires  such  insurance,  and (vi) fees and  expenses  of all other  Persons
retained by the Company in connection with the  consummation of the transactions
contemplated  by this Agreement.  In addition,  the Company shall be responsible
for all of its internal expenses incurred in connection with the consummation of
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement (including,  without limitation,
all salaries and expenses of its  officers  and  employees  performing  legal or
accounting  duties),  the expense of any annual  audit and the fees and expenses
incurred in  connection  with the listing of the  Registrable  Securities on any
securities  exchange  as  required  hereunder.  In no event shall the Company be
responsible  for any  broker or  similar  commissions  or,  except to the extent
provided for in the Transaction Documents,  any legal fees or other costs of the
Holders.

      5. Indemnification

            (a)   Indemnification   by   the   Company.   The   Company   shall,
notwithstanding  any termination of this Agreement,  indemnify and hold harmless
each Holder,  the officers,  directors,  agents,  brokers (including brokers who
offer and sell  Registrable  Securities  as principal as a result of a pledge or
any failure to perform under a margin call of Common Stock), investment advisors
and employees of each of them,  each Person who controls any such Holder (within
the meaning of Section 15 of the  Securities  Act or Section 20 of the  Exchange
Act) and the officers,  directors, agents and employees of each such controlling
Person,  to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, from and against any
and  all  losses,  claims,  damages,  liabilities,   costs  (including,  without
limitation,  reasonable attorneys' fees) and expenses (collectively,  "Losses"),
as  incurred,  arising  out of or  relating  to any  untrue  or  alleged  untrue
statement  of a  material  fact  contained  in  a  Registration  Statement,  any
Prospectus or any form of  prospectus or in any amendment or supplement  thereto
or in any preliminary prospectus,  or arising out of or relating to any omission
or  alleged  omission  of a  material  fact  required  to be stated  therein  or
necessary to make the statements  therein (in the case of any Prospectus or form
of prospectus or supplement  thereto,  in light of the circumstances under which
they were made) not  misleading,  except to the extent,  but only to the extent,
that (i) such untrue  statements or omissions are based solely upon  information
regarding  such  Holder  furnished  in  writing to the  Company  by such  Holder
expressly  for use therein,  or to the extent that such  information  relates to
such Holder or such Holder's  proposed  method of  distribution  of  Registrable
Securities  and was  reviewed and  expressly  approved in writing by such Holder
expressly for use in a Registration  Statement,  such Prospectus or such form of
Prospectus or in any amendment or supplement  thereto (it being  understood that
the Holder has approved  Annex A hereto for this purpose) or (ii) in the case of
an occurrence of an event of the type  specified in Section  3(d)(ii)-(vi),  the
use by such Holder of an outdated or defective  Prospectus after the Company has
notified such Holder in writing that the Prospectus is outdated or defective and
prior to the receipt by such Holder of the Advice  contemplated in Section 6(d).
The Company  shall  notify the Holders  promptly of the  institution,  threat or
assertion of any Proceeding  arising from or in connection with the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement of which the Company is aware.

                                       8

            (b) Indemnification by Holders. Each Holder shall, severally and not
jointly,  indemnify  and hold  harmless the Company,  its  directors,  officers,
agents and employees,  each Person who controls the Company  (within the meaning
of Section 15 of the Securities Act and Section 20 of the Exchange Act), and the
directors,  officers,  agents or employees of such controlling  Persons,  to the
fullest  extent  permitted by applicable  law,  from and against all Losses,  as
incurred,  to the extent  arising out of or based solely upon: (x) such Holder's
failure to comply with the prospectus  delivery  requirements  of the Securities
Act or (y) any untrue or alleged  untrue  statement of a material fact contained
in any Registration Statement, any Prospectus,  or any form of prospectus, or in
any amendment or supplement thereto or in any preliminary prospectus, or arising
out of or  relating  to any  omission  or alleged  omission  of a material  fact
required to be stated  therein or necessary to make the  statements  therein not
misleading (i) to the extent, but only to the extent, that such untrue statement
or omission is  contained  in any  information  so  furnished in writing by such
Holder to the Company specifically for inclusion in such Registration  Statement
or such  Prospectus  or (ii) to the extent  that (1) such untrue  statements  or
omissions are based solely upon  information  regarding such Holder furnished in
writing to the  Company by such  Holder  expressly  for use  therein,  or to the
extent that such  information  relates to such Holder or such Holder's  proposed
method of distribution of Registrable  Securities and was reviewed and expressly
approved  in  writing  by such  Holder  expressly  for  use in the  Registration
Statement (it being  understood  that the Holder has approved Annex A hereto for
this purpose), such Prospectus or such form of Prospectus or in any amendment or
supplement  thereto or (2) in the case of an  occurrence of an event of the type
specified  in Section  3(d)(ii)-(vi),  the use by such  Holder of an outdated or
defective  Prospectus after the Company has notified such Holder in writing that
the  Prospectus is outdated or defective and prior to the receipt by such Holder
of the Advice  contemplated  in Section 6(d). In no event shall the liability of
any selling Holder  hereunder be greater in amount than the dollar amount of the
net proceeds received by such Holder upon the sale of the Registrable Securities
giving rise to such indemnification obligation.

            (c) Conduct of Indemnification  Proceedings. If any Proceeding shall
be brought or asserted  against any Person  entitled to indemnity  hereunder (an
"Indemnified  Party"),  such Indemnified  Party shall promptly notify the Person
from whom  indemnity is sought (the  "Indemnifying  Party") in writing,  and the
Indemnifying Party shall have the right to assume the defense thereof, including
the employment of counsel  reasonably  satisfactory to the Indemnified Party and
the  payment  of all fees and  expenses  incurred  in  connection  with  defense
thereof; provided, that the failure of any Indemnified Party to give such notice
shall not relieve  the  Indemnifying  Party of its  obligations  or  liabilities
pursuant  to this  Agreement,  except  (and only) to the extent that it shall be
finally determined by a court of competent  jurisdiction (which determination is
not subject to appeal or further review) that such failure shall have prejudiced
the Indemnifying Party.

                                       9
<PAGE>

      An Indemnified  Party shall have the right to employ  separate  counsel in
any such Proceeding and to participate in the defense thereof,  but the fees and
expenses of such counsel  shall be at the expense of such  Indemnified  Party or
Parties  unless:  (1) the  Indemnifying  Party has agreed in writing to pay such
fees and  expenses;  (2) the  Indemnifying  Party shall have failed  promptly to
assume  the  defense  of  such  Proceeding  and  to  employ  counsel  reasonably
satisfactory to such Indemnified Party in any such Proceeding;  or (3) the named
parties to any such Proceeding  (including any impleaded  parties)  include both
such  Indemnified  Party  and  the  Indemnifying  Party,  and  counsel  for  the
Indemnifying Party shall reasonably believe that a material conflict of interest
is likely to exist if the same counsel were to represent such Indemnified  Party
and the Indemnifying  Party (in which case, if such  Indemnified  Party notifies
the  Indemnifying  Party in writing that it elects to employ separate counsel at
the expense of the Indemnifying Party, the Indemnifying Party shall not have the
right to assume the defense  thereof and the reasonable fees and expenses of one
separate  counsel  shall  be at the  expense  of the  Indemnifying  Party).  The
Indemnifying Party shall not be liable for any settlement of any such Proceeding
effected  without its written  consent,  which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.  No Indemnifying Party shall, without the prior written consent of the
Indemnified Party, effect any settlement of any pending Proceeding in respect of
which any  Indemnified  Party is a party,  unless  such  settlement  includes an
unconditional  release of such  Indemnified  Party from all  liability on claims
that are the subject matter of such Proceeding.

      Subject to the terms of this  Agreement,  all reasonable fees and expenses
of the Indemnified  Party (including  reasonable fees and expenses to the extent
incurred in connection with investigating or preparing to defend such Proceeding
in a manner not inconsistent with this Section) shall be paid to the Indemnified
Party,  as incurred,  within ten Trading Days of written  notice  thereof to the
Indemnifying  Party;  provided,   that  the  Indemnified  Party  shall  promptly
reimburse  the  Indemnifying  Party for that  portion of such fees and  expenses
applicable to such actions for which such  Indemnified  Party is not entitled to
indemnification  hereunder,  determined  based upon the  relative  faults of the
parties.

      (d)  Contribution.  If a claim for  indemnification  under Section 5(a) or
5(b) is  unavailable  to an  Indemnified  Party (by  reason of public  policy or
otherwise),   then  each  Indemnifying  Party,  in  lieu  of  indemnifying  such
Indemnified  Party,  shall  contribute  to the  amount  paid or  payable by such
Indemnified  Party  as a  result  of  such  Losses,  in  such  proportion  as is
appropriate  to  reflect  the  relative  fault  of the  Indemnifying  Party  and
Indemnified  Party in connection with the actions,  statements or omissions that
resulted in such Losses as well as any other relevant equitable  considerations.
The relative fault of such  Indemnifying  Party and  Indemnified  Party shall be
determined by reference to, among other things,  whether any action in question,
including any untrue or alleged untrue  statement of a material fact or omission
or alleged omission of a material fact, has been taken or made by, or relates to
information  supplied by, such Indemnifying  Party or Indemnified Party, and the
parties'  relative intent,  knowledge,  access to information and opportunity to
correct or prevent  such  action,  statement  or  omission.  The amount  paid or
payable by a party as a result of any Losses shall be deemed to include, subject
to the  limitations set forth in this  Agreement,  any reasonable  attorneys' or
other reasonable fees or expenses  incurred by such party in connection with any
Proceeding to the extent such party would have been indemnified for such fees or
expenses if the  indemnification  provided for in this Section was  available to
such party in accordance with its terms.

                                       10

      The  parties  hereto  agree  that it would  not be just and  equitable  if
contribution  pursuant  to  this  Section  5(d)  were  determined  by  pro  rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation  that does not take into account
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this Section 5(d), no Holder shall be required
to contribute, in the aggregate, any amount in excess of the amount by which the
proceeds  actually  received  by such  Holder  from the sale of the  Registrable
Securities subject to the Proceeding exceeds the amount of any damages that such
Holder has  otherwise  been  required to pay by reason of such untrue or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission, except in the case of fraud by
such Holder.

      The indemnity and contribution agreements contained in this Section are in
addition  to any  liability  that  the  Indemnifying  Parties  may  have  to the
Indemnified Parties.

      6. Miscellaneous

            (a)  Remedies.  In the  event of a  breach  by the  Company  or by a
Holder,  of any of their  obligations  under this Agreement,  each Holder or the
Company,  as the case may be, in  addition to being  entitled  to  exercise  all
rights granted by law and under this Agreement,  including  recovery of damages,
will be entitled to specific performance of its rights under this Agreement. The
Company and each Holder agree that monetary  damages would not provide  adequate
compensation  for any losses  incurred by reason of a breach by it of any of the
provisions of this Agreement and hereby further agrees that, in the event of any
action for specific  performance  in respect of such breach,  it shall waive the
defense that a remedy at law would be adequate.

            (b) No Piggyback on  Registrations.  Except as set forth on Schedule
6(b) attached hereto, neither the Company nor any of its security holders (other
than the Holders in such capacity pursuant hereto) may include securities of the
Company in the Registration Statement other than the Registrable Securities. The
Company shall not file any other  registration  statements until at least thirty
days after the initial  Registration  Statement  required  hereunder is declared
effective by the Commission,  provided that this Section 6(b) shall not prohibit
the Company from filing amendments to registration statements already filed.

            (c) Compliance. Each Holder covenants and agrees that it will comply
with the prospectus delivery requirements of the Securities Act as applicable to
it  in  connection  with  sales  of  Registrable   Securities  pursuant  to  the
Registration Statement.

            (d) Discontinued Disposition.  Each Holder agrees by its acquisition
of such  Registrable  Securities that, upon receipt of a notice from the Company
of the  occurrence  of any event of the kind  described  in Section  3(d),  such
Holder will forthwith  discontinue  disposition of such  Registrable  Securities
under a Registration  Statement until such Holder's receipt of the copies of the
supplemented  Prospectus and/or amended Registration  Statement,  or until it is
advised in writing (the  "Advice") by the Company that the use of the applicable
Prospectus  may be resumed,  and, in either  case,  has  received  copies of any
additional  or  supplemental  filings  that are  incorporated  or  deemed  to be
incorporated  by reference in such  Prospectus or  Registration  Statement.  The
Company will use its best efforts to ensure that the use of the  Prospectus  may
be resumed as promptly as it  practicable.  The Company agrees and  acknowledges
that any  periods  during  which  the  Holder is  required  to  discontinue  the
disposition  of the  Registrable  Securities  hereunder  shall be subject to the
provisions of Section 2(b).

                                       11
<PAGE>

            (e)   Piggy-Back   Registrations.   If  at  any  time   during   the
Effectiveness Period there is not an effective  Registration  Statement covering
all of the Registrable Securities and the Company shall determine to prepare and
file with the  Commission a registration  statement  relating to an offering for
its own account or the account of others under the  Securities Act of any of its
equity securities, other than on Form S-4 or Form S-8 (each as promulgated under
the Securities Act) or their then equivalents  relating to equity  securities to
be issued solely in connection with any acquisition of any entity or business or
equity securities issuable in connection with the stock option or other employee
benefit or  consultant  plans,  then the  Company  shall  send to each  Holder a
written notice of such  determination and, if within fifteen days after the date
of such notice,  any such Holder shall so request in writing,  the Company shall
include  in such  registration  statement  all or any  part of such  Registrable
Securities  such holder requests to be registered;  provided,  that, the Company
shall not be required to register any  Registrable  Securities  pursuant to this
Section 6(e) that are eligible for resale  pursuant to Rule 144  (provided  that
all   Registrable   Securities   may  be  resold   immediately   without  volume
restrictions)  or Rule 144(k)  promulgated  under the Securities Act or that are
the subject of a then effective Registration Statement.

            (f)  Amendments  and  Waivers.  The  provisions  of this  Agreement,
including  the  provisions  of this  sentence,  may not be amended,  modified or
supplemented,  and waivers or consents to departures from the provisions  hereof
may not be given,  unless the same shall be in writing and signed by the Company
and each Holder of the then outstanding Registrable Securities.  Notwithstanding
the  foregoing,  a waiver or consent to depart from the  provisions  hereof with
respect to a matter that relates  exclusively  to the rights of Holders and that
does not directly or indirectly  affect the rights of other Holders may be given
by Holders of all of the Registrable  Securities to which such waiver or consent
relates;  provided,  however,  that the  provisions  of this sentence may not be
amended,  modified,  or supplemented except in accordance with the provisions of
the immediately preceding sentence.

            (g)  Notices.  Any  and  all  notices  or  other  communications  or
deliveries  required or permitted to be provided hereunder shall be delivered as
set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

            (h)  Successors  and  Assigns.  This  Agreement  shall  inure to the
benefit of and be binding upon the successors  and permitted  assigns of each of
the parties and shall inure to the benefit of each  Holder.  The Company may not
assign its rights or obligations  hereunder without the prior written consent of
all of the Holders of the then-outstanding  Registrable Securities.  Each Holder
may assign their respective rights hereunder in the manner and to the Persons as
permitted under the Purchase Agreement.

            (i) No Inconsistent  Agreements.  Neither the Company nor any of its
subsidiaries has entered, as of the date hereof, nor shall the Company or any of
its  subsidiaries,  on or  after  the  date of this  Agreement,  enter  into any
agreement  with  respect  to its  securities,  that  would  have the  effect  of
impairing  the rights  granted to the  Holders in this  Agreement  or  otherwise
conflicts  with the  provisions  hereof.  Except as set forth on Schedule  6(i),
neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries has previously  entered into any
agreement granting any registration rights with respect to any of its securities
to any Person that have not been satisfied in full.

                                       12
<PAGE>

            (j) Execution and  Counterparts.  This  Agreement may be executed in
any number of counterparts, each of which when so executed shall be deemed to be
an original and, all of which taken together  shall  constitute one and the same
Agreement.   In  the  event  that  any   signature  is  delivered  by  facsimile
transmission,  such  signature  shall create a valid  binding  obligation of the
party  executing  (or on whose behalf such  signature is executed) the same with
the same  force and  effect as if such  facsimile  signature  were the  original
thereof.

            (k)  Governing  Law.  All  questions  concerning  the  construction,
validity,  enforcement and  interpretation of this Agreement shall be determined
with the provisions of the Purchase Agreement.

            (l) Cumulative Remedies. The remedies provided herein are cumulative
and not exclusive of any remedies provided by law.

            (m) Severability. If any term, provision, covenant or restriction of
this  Agreement  is held by a court of  competent  jurisdiction  to be  invalid,
illegal,  void  or  unenforceable,  the  remainder  of  the  terms,  provisions,
covenants  and  restrictions  set forth  herein  shall  remain in full force and
effect and shall in no way be affected, impaired or invalidated, and the parties
hereto  shall use their  commercially  reasonable  efforts to find and employ an
alternative  means to achieve the same or substantially  the same result as that
contemplated  by such term,  provision,  covenant or  restriction.  It is hereby
stipulated  and declared to be the intention of the parties that they would have
executed the remaining terms,  provisions,  covenants and  restrictions  without
including any of such that may be hereafter declared invalid,  illegal,  void or
unenforceable.

            (n) Headings.  The headings in this Agreement are for convenience of
reference only and shall not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

            (o)  Independent  Nature of Holders'  Obligations  and  Rights.  The
obligations  of each  Holder  hereunder  are  several  and not  joint  with  the
obligations of any other Holder hereunder, and no Holder shall be responsible in
any way for the  performance of the  obligations of any other Holder  hereunder.
Nothing contained herein or in any other agreement or document  delivered at any
closing, and no action taken by any Holder pursuant hereto or thereto,  shall be
deemed to  constitute  the Holders as a  partnership,  an  association,  a joint
venture or any other kind of entity,  or create a  presumption  that the Holders
are in any way  acting  in  concert  with  respect  to such  obligations  or the
transactions  contemplated by this  Agreement.  Each Holder shall be entitled to
protect and enforce its rights,  including without limitation the rights arising
out of this Agreement,  and it shall not be necessary for any other Holder to be
joined as an additional party in any proceeding for such purpose.

            (p) Next Business Day.  Whenever any obligation  hereunder  shall be
due on a day other than a Business  Day,  such payment shall be made on the next
succeeding Business Day.
