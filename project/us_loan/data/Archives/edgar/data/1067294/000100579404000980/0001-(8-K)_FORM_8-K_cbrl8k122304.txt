     On December 22, 2004, Lawrence E. White, Chief Financial Officer and Senior
Vice President of CBRL Group, Inc. (the "Company"), notified the Company that he
had entered  into a trading plan to exercise  certain  options and sell up to an
aggregate of 35,385 shares of the  Company's  common stock in order to diversify
his investments.  The sales are expected to occur during a period  commencing on
January  3, 2005 and  ending  on March 31,  2005.  Mr.  White  does not have any
control over the timing of the sales under the plan.  The shares to be sold will
be issued  pursuant to the exercise of certain  stock options held by Mr. White.
Upon execution of the transactions under the plan, Mr. White will continue to be
ahead of the predetermined schedule for full compliance with the Company's stock
ownership  guidelines for executive officers.  Mr. White presently directly owns
26,289 shares of the Company's common stock, which he will continue to own after
transactions under the plan are completed,  and he will continue to have options
for an  additional  98,682  shares of common stock  following  completion of the
trading plan. Any sales under the plan will be publicly disclosed through Form 4
filings with the Commission.

     Mr.  White's  trading  plan is  intended  to comply with Rule 10b5-1 of the
Securities  Exchange  Act of 1934,  as amended.  It is the  Company's  policy to
disclose when the Chief Executive  Officer,  Chief Financial Officer or Chairman
of the Board  enter into a trading  plan that is  intended  to comply  with Rule
