STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">GALION, Ohio &#150; December 22, 2004 &#150; PECO II, Inc. (Nasdaq:PIII), a full-service provider of engineering and installation on-site services and a manufacturer of
communications power systems and equipment to the communications industry, announced today that a major customer has postponed delivery of power products from PECO II into the first quarter of 2005. Accordingly, PECO II&#146;s earlier projections of
financial break-even for the fourth quarter of 2004 are being revised downward. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
SIZE="2">James L. Green, president and chief executive officer, said, &#147;Due to the postponement of delivery of power products by a major customer into the first quarter of 2005, we now expect that sales for the fourth quarter will be slightly
below the $9.2 million we recorded in the third quarter of 2004. We also now believe that we will have an operating loss for the fourth quarter in the range of approximately $0.03 to $0.05 per diluted share, compared with our earlier projection of a
break-even quarter. These projections are preliminary and subject to change based on actual sales from the shipment of products between now and December 31, 2004; determination of the actual percentage of completion of various service projects at
December 31, 2004; and the final accounting and audit of our financial statements for 2004.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Green added, &#147;We have made good progress in 2004, with sales increasing from $6.6 million in the first quarter, to $7.2 million in the second quarter, to $9.2 million in the third quarter. The slight decrease in
expected sales for the fourth quarter is due to the fact that we have a few large customers who can significantly affect any given quarter by changing the delivery dates for their orders from one quarter to the next.&#148; </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">&#147;For this reason, we look at our business on a longer-term basis, and we think the
business is headed in the right direction from a sales and earnings standpoint when the entire year is assessed,&#148; Green said. &#147;We expect to see continuing improvement in our business next year, assuming that the market for
telecommunications capital expenditures continues to improve. We are confident that PECO II has the right products and services to meet customer demands.&#148; </FONT></P>
