Item 3.02 Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities.

     On December 23, 2004, New Frontier Energy, Inc. (the "Company") held a
closing on the sale (the "Offering") to accredited investors of an aggregate of
60 investment units (the "Units") at a purchase price of $13,000 per Unit for
gross proceeds of $780,000. Each Unit consists of: (i) $13,000 of 12% Series B
Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock, par value $0.001 (the "Series B
Preferred"), convertible into 20,000 shares of the Company's $0.001 par value
common stock (the "Common Stock") at a price of $0.65 per share; and (ii) a
three-year warrant to purchase 20,000 shares of Common Stock at an exercise
price of $1.50 per share (the "Warrants").

     The Series B Preferred pays a cumulative, preferential cash dividend equal
to 12% and is payable quarterly in arrears. The Company has the right to redeem
the Series B Preferred commencing two years from a final closing date provided
that the Company's common stock has been trading at not less than $1.30 per
share for twenty consecutive trading days. The Warrants are exercisable at $1.50
per common share and have a call feature provided that the Company's common
stock has been trading at not less than $3.50 per share for twenty consecutive
trading days and the underlying shares are subject to an effective registration
statement that has been continuously effective for a minimum of thirty days.
This description of the terms of the Series B Preferred is qualified in its
entirety to the Certificate of Designation of Preferences, Rights and
Limitations of the Series B 12% Cumulative Convertible Preferred Stock filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the "SEC") on Form 8-K on November
17, 2004.

     The Company received $683,070 in proceeds from the sale of the Units, net
of commissions and fees payable to the placement agent. The Company agreed to
issue to the placement agent warrants to purchase a number of Units equal to 10%
of the Units purchased in the Offering, at the price per unit equal to that paid
by the investors in the Offering ("Placement Agent Warrants").

     The Company agreed to file a resale registration statement (the
"Registration Statement") under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the
"Securities Act") for the resale of the shares of Common Stock: (i) underlying
the Series B Preferred; (ii) underlying the Warrants; (iii) issuable upon any
anti-dilution or other adjustments for the benefit of purchasers of Units; and
(iv) underlying the Placement Agent Warrants.

     The Units were offered and sold in reliance upon Rule 506 promulgated under
Section 4(2) of the Securities Act. The Units sold in the Offering have not been
registered under the Securities Act or state securities laws and may not be
offered or sold absent registration with the SEC or an applicable exemption from
the registration requirements.
