applicable to the Company. The Company and the Subsidiaries maintain a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to provide reasonable assurance that (i) transactions are executed in accordance with management&#146;s general or specific
authorizations, (ii) transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles and to maintain asset accountability, (iii) access to assets is permitted only in
accordance with management&#146;s general or specific authorization, and (iv) the recorded accountability for assets is compared with the existing assets at reasonable intervals and appropriate action is taken with respect to any differences. The
Company has established disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in 1934 Act Rules 13a-14 and 15d-14) for the Company and designed such disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the Company, including
the Subsidiaries, is made known to the certifying officers by others within those entities, particularly during the period in which the Company&#146;s most recently filed period report under the 1934 Act, as the case may be, is being prepared. The
Company&#146;s certifying officers have evaluated the effectiveness of the Company&#146;s controls and procedures as of the end of the period covered by the most recently filed periodic report under the 1934 Act (such date, the &#147;Evaluation
Date&#148;). The Company presented in its most recently filed periodic report under the 1934 Act the conclusions of the certifying officers about the effectiveness of the disclosure controls and procedures based on their evaluations as of the
Evaluation Date. Since the Evaluation Date, there have been no significant changes in the Company&#146;s internal controls (as such term is defined in Item 307(b) of Regulation S-K) or, to the Company&#146;s Knowledge, in other factors that could
significantly affect the Company&#146;s internal controls. The Company maintains and will continue to maintain a standard system of accounting established and administered in accordance with GAAP and the applicable requirements of the 1934 Act.
