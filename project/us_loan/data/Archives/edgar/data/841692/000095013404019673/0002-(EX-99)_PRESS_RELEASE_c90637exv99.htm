<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>FSI International, Inc. Announces First Quarter Fiscal 2005 Financial Results</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Higher Than Expected Gross Profit Margins and Lower Operating Expenses Offset the Impact of Lower
Revenues</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MINNEAPOLIS (Dec. 21, 2004)&#151;FSI International, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSII), a manufacturer of capital
equipment for the microelectronics industry, today reported financial results for the first quarter
of fiscal 2005 ended November&nbsp;27, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were $19.4&nbsp;million, compared to $22.5&nbsp;million for
the same period of fiscal 2004. The Company&#146;s loss for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 was $3.3
million, or $0.11 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.0&nbsp;million or $0.03 per share for the
first quarter of fiscal 2004. The first quarter of fiscal 2004 financial results included a $2.0
million gain, reported in other income, from the sale of Metron Technology common stock.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;A number of our customers reacted quickly to the semiconductor device inventory build-up that
occurred earlier this fall,&#148; said Don Mitchell, FSI&#146;s chairman and chief executive officer. &#147;During
the first quarter, certain customers requested shipment delays, while others delayed the placement
of orders that we were anticipating; one customer canceled orders for two spray processing systems,
and in a few cases we did not receive acceptance on products that customers were evaluating.
However, customer-requested shipment delays had the most significant impact on our revenue level
for the first quarter as we expected to ship and recognize revenue on certain orders during the
quarter,&#148; continued Mitchell.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Despite the overall weaker than expected orders and revenue during the quarter, we received a
multi-unit ANTARES<SUP>&#174;</SUP> CryoKinetic Cleaning System order, following a successful
evaluation,&#148; stated Mitchell. &#147;Also, we received another ANTARES System evaluation order from a
European microprocessor manufacturer and a follow-on ZETA<SUP>&#174;</SUP> Batch Spray Processing System
order from a major Korean customer for back-end-of-line applications. Finally, today we are
announcing that we have received follow-on ZETA System orders from additional international
customers,&#148; concluded Mitchell.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Cash Position</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company used $8.3&nbsp;million of net cash for operating activities during the first quarter of
fiscal 2005. The cash usage in the quarter was related to the timing of shipments during the
quarter and the increase in inventory that resulted from the requested shipment and order delays.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of today, the Company owns 1.5&nbsp;million shares of Nortem N.V. (formerly Metron Technology
N.V.) common stock at a cost basis of $0.94 per share, or $1.4&nbsp;million in the aggregate. On
November&nbsp;27, 2004, we carried this investment as a marketable security valued at $6.6&nbsp;million. On
December&nbsp;14, 2004, Applied Materials closed on the acquisition of substantially all of the assets
of Metron Technology. We anticipate receiving approximately $7.0&nbsp;million in cash distributions over
the next six months as Nortem N.V. is liquidated.* We expect to record a gain of $4.0 to $5.0
million in the second quarter of fiscal 2005, depending upon the amount and timing of the initial
distribution.*


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our legacy POLARIS product group operates in a 162,000 square foot owned facility located in
Allen, Texas. During the first quarter of fiscal 2005, we entered into a non-binding letter of
intent to sell the facility and sublease back a portion of the space. We expect to close on this
transaction in the second quarter of fiscal 2005.* We believe that this facility has a market value
of $12 to $15&nbsp;million,* and we carried the building and property, plant and equipment on the
balance sheet at a value of approximately $8.0&nbsp;million at the end of the first quarter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Excluding any cash received from the transactions mentioned above, we expect to use $2.5 to
$3.5&nbsp;million of net cash for operating activities in the second quarter.* The cash will primarily
be used to purchase inventory required for the anticipated placement of additional evaluation
systems and an increase in accounts receivable from the expected increase in shipments in the
second quarter,&#148;* concluded Mitchell.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Balance Sheet</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company continues to maintain a strong balance sheet with approximately $134.0&nbsp;million in
assets, including $32.8&nbsp;million in cash, restricted cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities. This includes $6.6&nbsp;million of marketable securities associated with the Company&#146;s
investment in Nortem N.V. At the end of the first quarter, the Company had a current ratio of 3.5
to 1.0, no debt and a book value of $3.59 per share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Outlook</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on the backlog and deferred revenue levels at the end of the first quarter and expected
second quarter orders, the Company expects second quarter fiscal 2005 revenues to increase to $23
to $26&nbsp;million.* Based upon the anticipated gross profit margins, the operating expense run rate
and the gain on the Nortem N.V. initial distribution, the Company expects a net income in the $1.0
to $2.0&nbsp;million range for the second quarter.* This excludes any gain on the possible sale of the
Allen, Texas facility.*


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Conference Call Details</B>
