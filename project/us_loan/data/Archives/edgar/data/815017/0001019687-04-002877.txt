HONG KONG--(MARKET WIRE)-- December 16, 2004 -- PacificNet Inc.

Clickcom offers a wide variety of wireless internet services such as SMS, WAP,
and Java mobile applications. The acquisition should be completed in January
2005.

The purchase consideration for 51% of Clickcom is based on three times the
anticipated earnings of Clickcom in 2005, payable 30% in cash and 70% in
restricted shares of PACT. The purchase price is payable upon achievement of
certain quarterly earn-out targets based on net profits, through the issuance of
130,000 restricted shares of common stock of PacificNet.

stock, at a strike price based on the five-day Volume Weighted Average Price of
PacificNet's common stock before signing the agreement.

The warrants are exercisable for a period of three years.

"This strategic acquisition is a compelling move by PacificNet to capture part
of the rapidly growing value-added telecom services market in China," said Tony
Tong, CEO of PacificNet. "We have high respect for Clickcom's business success
and the strong telecom experience offered by their founders. We are planning
further strategic moves in the VAS market which we believe will increase our
customer base, revenue and profit fundamentals, and improve our shareholder
value. We believe this acquisition should be accretive to PacificNet's revenues,
profits, and earnings per share in 2005."

"With the early success of our value added telecom services in China, we believe
the market potential is strong for our VAS products, especially for wireless SMS
and internet content," said Wen Chu, CEO of Clickcom. "We believe our unique and
innovative communication products will contribute positively to PacificNet's
overall revenues and profits. We look forward to growing along with the
PacificNet VAS platform. This transaction should create great synergies in
management, sales/marketing and VAS technology.

With China being the largest and fastest growing telecom market in the world,
with over 310 million mobile subscribers and 75 million wireless XiaoLingTong
subscribers, we believe our strong experience in the mobile value-added services
will contribute positively to PacificNet's bottom line."
