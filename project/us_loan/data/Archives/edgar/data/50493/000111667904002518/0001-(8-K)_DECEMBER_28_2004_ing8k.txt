Item 3.01      Notice of  Delisting  or Failure to Satisfy a  Continued  Listing
               Rule or Standard; Transfer of Listing.

On December 28, 2004, Ingles Markets,  Incorporated  (the "Company")  received a
notice from the staff of The Nasdaq Stock Market  indicating that the Company is
not in compliance  with Nasdaq's  requirement  for the continued  listing of the
Company's  securities  on The Nasdaq  Stock  Market due to the failure to timely
file its Form 10-K for the period ended  September 25, 2004,  as required  under
Marketplace Rule 4310(c)(14). Receipt of the notice does not result in immediate
delisting of the Company's  securities,  although  Nasdaq stated that unless the
Company  requests  a  hearing  on  Nasdaq's   delisting  notice,  the  Company's
securities  will be  delisted  from The Nasdaq  Stock  Market at the  opening of
business on January 6, 2005. As of the opening of business on December 30, 2004,
an "E" will be  appended  to the end of the  Company's  trading  symbol  for its
securities.  Therefore, commencing December 30, 2004, the trading symbol for the
Company's Class A Common Stock will be changed from "IMKTA" to "IMKTE".

The  Company  expects  to make a timely  request  for a hearing  with the Nasdaq
Listing  Qualifications  Panel on this  matter  which  will  stay the  delisting
pending the hearing and a  determination  by the Nasdaq  Listing  Qualifications
Panel. There can be no assurance that the Panel will grant the Company's request
for continued listing.

Item 9.01      Financial Statements and Exhibits.

        December 29, 2004.
