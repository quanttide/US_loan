Item 1.01.     Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     Effective  December 27, 2004,  Payments Inc.  ("Payments"),  a wholly-owned
subsidiary of DCAP Group, Inc.  ("DCAP"),  entered into a Financing and Security
Agreement  (the  "Financing  Agreement")  with  Manufacturers  and Traders Trust
Company  ("M&T")  with  respect to a new line of credit to finance  its  premium
finance  receivables.  The new facility  replaces  M&T's existing line of credit
which was scheduled to mature in July 2005. Pursuant to the Financing Agreement,
the size of the  credit  facility  has been  increased  from $18  million to $25
million. Subject to certain conditions,  M&T has agreed to arrange an additional
$10 million credit  facility with other lenders on a "best efforts"  basis.  The
new line matures on June 30, 2007.  The Financing  Agreement  also provides that
Payments  will have the  choice of a  LIBOR-based  rate or a rate based on M&T's
prime  rate.  This will  result in an initial  reduction  in the  interest  rate
payable by Payments,  relative to its existing line of credit,  of at least 1.5%
per annum. In addition,  the Financing Agreement permits the early redemption of
up  to  $2  million  of  DCAP's   12.625%   subordinated   debt  under   certain
circumstances.

     On December 20,  2004,  DCAP amended its 1998 Stock Option Plan with regard
to the satisfaction of tax withholding  obligations that arise upon the exercise
of a nonstatutory  stock option.  The amendment gives its Board of Directors and
Compensation Committee discretion to permit the withholding by DCAP of a portion
of the stock  issuable  upon the  exercise of an option in  connection  with the
satisfaction  of such  obligations.  On  December  20,  2004,  pursuant  to such
amendment and in connection with the exercise by Barry Goldstein,  President and
Chief Executive Officer of DCAP, of nonstatutory  stock options for the purchase
of  34,000  shares  of  Common  Stock  of DCAP and the  satisfaction  of the tax
withholding  obligations,  the Board of Directors  permitted the  withholding by
DCAP of 6,789 of the 34,000 shares.
