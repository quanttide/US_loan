Material Definitive Agreement</I> </FONT> </H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>On December 22, 2004, we entered into
an employment agreement with Jeffrey H. Buchalter, the Chairman of our Board of Directors,
pursuant to which Mr. Buchalter will serve as our Chief Executive Officer. The initial
term of the employment agreement will expire no earlier than December 31, 2009 and no
later than twelve months after either party gives notice to the other that such party does
not wish for the agreement to continue beyond such twelve-month period (a &#147;notice of
non-renewal&#148;). </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The agreement provides for a base
salary of $550,000 per year and participation in Enzon&#146;s bonus plan for management.
Under the bonus plan, Mr. Buchalter will be eligible to receive an annual
performance-based cash bonus in an amount between zero and 200% of base salary, based on
individual and/or corporate factors to be established and determined by the Board of
Directors each year. The annual target bonus is equal to 100% of Mr. Buchalter&#146;s base
salary. For the fiscal year ended June 30, 2005, Mr. Buchalter will receive a guaranteed
minimum bonus in the amount of $412,500. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Under the agreement, Mr. Buchalter
was granted an option under our 2001 Incentive Stock Plan to purchase 725,000 shares of
our Common Stock at a per share exercise price of $13.54 (the last reported sale price of
our common stock on December 22, 2004). This option is currently exercisable with respect
to 225,000 shares and will become vested and exercisable as to an additional 125,000
shares on each of the first four anniversaries of the date of grant, provided Mr.
Buchalter remains employed as our Chief Executive Officer on each such date. Mr. Buchalter
also received 75,000 shares of restricted Common Stock, 22,500 of which shares will vest
on each of the third and fourth anniversaries of the date of grant and the remaining
30,000 of which shares will vest on the fifth anniversary of the date of grant, provided
Mr. Buchalter remains employed as our Chief Executive Officer on each such date. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>In the event Mr. Buchalter&#146;s
employment is terminated without cause (as defined in the employment agreement) by us or
terminated by Mr. Buchalter for good reason (as defined in the employment agreement), Mr.
Buchalter will be entitled to (i) a cash payment equal to any unpaid base salary through
the date of termination plus any earned bonus relating to the preceding fiscal year that
remains unpaid on the date of termination plus (ii) a lump sum cash payment equal to four
times his annual base salary plus a <I>pro rata</I> portion of his target bonus for the
period worked during the fiscal year in which the termination occurs. In addition, we will
reimburse Mr. Buchalter for any medical and dental coverage available to him and his
family for a period of up to 18 months commencing on the date of termination, and all
options and shares of restricted stock described above that have not vested at the time of
termination will vest immediately upon termination. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>If we experience a change of control
(as defined in Mr. Buchalter&#146;s employment agreement) and we terminate Mr.
Buchalter&#146;s employment without cause or he terminates his employment for good reason
within the period commencing 90 days before such change of control and ending two years
after the change of control, Mr. Buchalter will be entitled to (i) a cash payment equal to
any unpaid base salary through the date of termination plus any earned bonus relating to
the preceding fiscal year that remains unpaid on the date of termination plus (ii) a lump
sum cash payment equal to six times his annual base salary plus a <I>pro rata</I> portion
of his target bonus for the period worked during the fiscal year in which the termination
occurs. In addition, we will reimburse Mr. Buchalter for any medical and dental coverage
available to him and his family for a period of up to 18 months commencing on the date of
termination. Further, upon a change of control any of Mr. Buchalter&#146;s options to
purchase Common Stock and shares of resticted Common Stock described above that have not
vested immediately prior to the effective date of the change of control shall vest at such
time. </FONT></P>
