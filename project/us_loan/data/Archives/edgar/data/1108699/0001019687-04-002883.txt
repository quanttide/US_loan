Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operation

Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On Monday December 13, 2005, the registrant prepared and submitted an
Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA") dated December 10, 2004 by and between Sega
Gameworks LLC, as debtor and debtor in possession under Case No. LA 04-15404-BB
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California,
Los Angeles Division ("the Court") and the registrant. This APA was prepared in
contemplation of an auction to be held on December 15, 2004 to sell the assets
of Sega Gameworks ("the Sega Assets") in accordance with Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The APA contains a purchase price for the assets of Sega
Gameworks in an amount equal to Six Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($6,150,000). Concurrent with the submission of the APA, the registrant placed
an earnest money deposit equal to ten percent (10%) of the purchase price into a
segregated trust account maintained by the counsel of Sega Gameworks in an
amount equal to six hundred fifteen thousand dollars ($615,000).

         In order to finance the possible acquisition of the Sega Assets by the
registrant, the registrant agreed to and accepted a Commitment Letter dated
December 13, 2004 from Mellon HBV Alternative Strategies, LLC ("Mellon HBV").
The transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter are expressly subject to
the consummation of the acquisition of the Sega Assets by the registrant. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Commitment Letter,
Mellon HBV agreed to provide a revolving credit facility for Four Million
Dollars ($4,000,000) at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 600 basis points for
thirty six months. The revolving credit facility will be secured by
substantially all of the assets of the registrant.

         Mellon HBV also agreed to provide between Six Million and Eight Million
Dollars ($6,000,000-8,000,000) of equity financing. Fifty percent of the equity
investment will be made in shares of a newly-created class of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.66 per
share. Fifty percent of the equity investment will be made in shares of common
stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.18 per share. Additionally, a
five year warrant shall be issued providing for the purchase of 631,118
additional shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.36 per share (the
"Warrant"). The Warrant shall not be exercisable until the first anniversary of
the closing of the purchase of the assets of Sega Gameworks. After giving effect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Series A Preferred and Common Stock
to be acquired by Mellon HBV shall constitute 45% (determined on an "as
converted basis") of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Company on a
fully-diluted basis (assuming an aggregate investment of $6,000,000).

         In connection with the agreement and acceptance by the registrant of
the Commitment Letter, the registrant issued a Promissory Note with a face value
of Four Hundred Five Thousand Dollars ($405,000) with an interest rate equal to
six percent (6%) per annum to Mellon HBV related to the earnest money deposit
referred to above. Principal and any accrued but unpaid interest under this Note
shall be due and payable as follows: $100,000 of the principal shall be due and
payable on December 20, 2004, and the remaining principal and any accrued but
unpaid interest under this Note shall be due and payable upon the termination of
the Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms.

         On Wednesday December 15, 2004 the registrant participated in the
auction of the Sega Assets. In spite of being the highest bidder at the auction
by in excess of $1.2 million, the counsel for the creditor judged the bid of the
registrant to be an inferior bid and deemed SS Entertainment USA, a subsidiary
of Sega Corporation, to be the winning bidder. Sega Corporation is a large
creditor and a joint venture partner of Sega Gameworks. The registrant has been
deemed to be the back-up bidder pursuant to a sales procedure order of the
Court. The registrant is obligated to purchase the assets as the back-up bidder
for a period of 30 days from the date of a sale hearing by the Court which is
scheduled to take place on January 6, 2005.

<PAGE>

         In the event that SS Entertainment USA fails to complete the purchase
of the Sega assets Gameworks, the registrant would become the prevailing party
in the auction and purchase the assets at the last bid qualified by the
auctioneer. The last bid qualified by the auctioneer was Seven Million Eight
Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($7,825,000).

         The registrant reserved its right to contest the outcome. The
registrant has consulted counsel regarding the filing of an opposition motion to
vacate the sale proceeding and reopen the auction.

                                    of capital stock involving a change in
                                    control (each, a "Corporate Transaction"),
                                    the holders of Series A Preferred shall be
                                    entitled to receive, prior and in preference

                                    Price, plus all accrued but unpaid dividends
                                    thereon (the "Corporate Transaction
                                    Liquidation Amount"). Any proceeds remaining
                                    after payment of the Corporate Transaction
                                    Liquidation Amount shall be distributed to
                                    the holders of Series A Preferred and Common
                                    Stock on a PRO RATA basis (determined on an
                                    "as converted basis").

OPTIONAL CONVERSION                 The Series A Preferred may be converted into
                                    Common Stock, at any time or from time to
                                    time, at the option of the holder of such
                                    shares of Series A Preferred. The number of
                                    shares of Common Stock into which shares of
                                    Series A Preferred may be converted shall be
                                    determined by dividing the Original Issuance
                                    Price by the conversion price, as adjusted
                                    and then in effect. The initial conversion
                                    price shall be $0.363238, reflecting an
                                    initial conversion ratio of 4.57:1. Such
                                    conversion price shall be subject to the
                                    anti-dilution adjustments described below.

AUTOMATIC CONVERSION                The Series A Preferred shall be converted
                                    automatically into Common Stock, at the
                                    then-applicable conversion rate, on the
                                    tenth consecutive trading day on which the
                                    closing price of the Company's Common Stock
                                    is no less than $6.50 per share (subject to
                                    proportionate adjustments for stock splits,
                                    dividends, combinations and similar events).

ANTI-DILUTION PROTECTION            The conversion price of the Series A
                                    Preferred will be subject to narrow based
                                    weighted average anti-dilution protection in
                                    the event that the Company issues or is
                                    deemed to issue equity (other than customary
                                    excluded issuances ("Excluded Securities"))
                                    at a purchase price less than the Original
                                    Issuance Price (or the then current
                                    conversion price). The conversion price
                                    shall also be subject to proportionate
                                    adjustments for stock splits, dividends,
                                    combinations and similar events.

     RE: Commitment Letter for a Revolving Credit Facility and Equity Investment
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------


Mr. Bushnell:

         uWink, Inc. ("you" or the "Company") has advised Mellon HBV Alternative
Strategies LLC ("us" or "Mellon HBV") that the Company will make a bid (the
"Initial Bid") on the date hereof of $6,150,000 to purchase substantially all of
the assets of Sega Gameworks LLC (the "Target Assets"), a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Debtor"), as debtor and debtor in possession under Case
No. LA 04-15404-BB in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California, Los Angeles Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"), pursuant
to a sale commenced under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. You have further
advised us that you will deposit $615,000 of earnest money (the "Earnest Money
Deposit") with SSG Capital Advisors, L.P., the financial advisor to the Debtor
(the "Advisor"), and that as a result of the Initial Bid and the Earnest Money
Deposit, you will be deemed a "Qualified Bidder" as defined in the order of the
Bankruptcy Court entered on November 24, 2004 (the "Order"). You have further
advised us that you may increase the Initial Bid up to ten million dollars (the
"Auction Bid Amount") at your discretion at the auction to be held on December
15, 2004 by the Advisor (the "Auction"). You have further advised us that the
Company would like to obtain a revolving credit facility for four million
dollars (the "Loan") and sell shares of preferred stock and common stock of the
Company and warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock of the
Company (together, the "Equity Securities") for an aggregate purchase price of
between six million dollars and eight million dollars (the final amount to be
based on the Auction Bid Amount) to finance the purchase of the Target Assets,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Annex A and Annex B
attached hereto. We are pleased to inform you that we are willing to agree to
provide you with the Loan and purchase the Equity Securities upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Commitment Letter, including Annex A and Annex B
attached hereto.

         Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. COMMITMENTS. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Commitment Letter and Annex A attached hereto, you hereby agree to issue
to us the Equity Securities, and we hereby agree to purchase the Equity
Securities from you. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Commitment Letter and Annex B attached hereto, you hereby agree to accept
the Loan from us, and we hereby agree to provide the Loan to you.

                                        2
<PAGE>

         Prior to the provision of the Loan and the sale and issuance of the
Equity Securities, Mellon HBV and the Company will enter into definitive
documents consistent with the terms set forth in this Commitment Letter,
including Annex A and Annex B attached hereto, and having other standard market
terms comparable to the terms of similar documents executed in connection with
similar offerings of equity securities and revolving credit facilities, modified
as appropriate to reflect the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, in
form and substance satisfactory to Mellon HBV and the Company.

         Our commitment to make the Loan to you and purchase the Equity
Securities under this Commitment Letter is subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Annex A and Annex B attached hereto. It is currently
expected that the Company will attend the Auction and use its best efforts to
obtain the Target Assets on terms that meet the parameters set forth herein. It
is further expected that in the event the Company is the "Successful Bidder" (as
defined in the Order) following the Auction, the Company will use its best
efforts to (i) consummate the purchase of the Target Assets on commercially
reasonable terms on or before February 15, 2005, and (ii) take all actions
necessary or advisable in connection therewith (including obtaining all
requisite consents and approvals and making all necessary regulatory filings).

         2. ASSIGNMENT OF COMMITMENT. Mellon HBV, in its sole discretion, may
assign its rights and obligations under this Commitment Letter to Allen &
Company and/or one or more of its affiliates.

         3. NOTICE. The Company will promptly notify Mellon HBV of any material
fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to keep the Company from
satisfying any one or more of the conditions set forth in Annex A or Annex B
attached hereto.

         4. TERMINATION. Mellon HBV may terminate its commitments hereunder
pursuant to any one or more of the following: (i) mutual agreement of the
parties; (ii) the Company is not the "Successful Bidder" or the "Back-Up Bidder"
(as defined in the Order) at the Auction; (iii) the Company fails to consummate
the purchase of the Target Assets on or before February 15, 2005; (iv) willful
breach of the terms of the Commitment Letter by the Company or a failure on the
part of the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy all
conditions set forth herein or in Annex A or Annex B attached hereto; (v) it
becomes apparent in Mellon HBV's reasonable judgment that the Company will be
unable to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth herein or in Annex A
or B attached hereto on or before February 15, 2005; and (vi) Mellon HBV is not
satisfied, in its sole discretion, with its business and legal due diligence
review of the Company and the acquisition of the Target Assets (the "Due
Diligence Out"). Upon any termination of this Commitment Letter, the obligations
of the parties hereunder shall terminate, except for the obligations of the
Company in the manner contemplated under the headings "Fees, Costs and
Expenses," "Confidentiality," and "Promissory Note."

         5. FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES. Upon execution and delivery of this
Commitment Letter by the Company, regardless of whether the transactions
contemplated hereby are ultimately consummated, Mellon HBV shall be entitled to
reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees of legal
counsel, financial advisers, and industry consultant(s). This provision shall
survive termination of this Commitment Letter.

the Due Diligence Out, the principle amount of the Promissory Note shall be
reduced by $305,000 and such amount shall be forgiven. Any other principle and
interest due under the Promissory Note shall be subject to the terms thereof.

consummate, with any third party other than the Mellon HBV, any transaction
involving the financing, recapitalization or sale of the Company or any other
transaction that would render impracticable the transactions contemplated
hereby. Any current negotiations or discussions shall have been terminated
immediately prior to execution and delivery hereof.

                            ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT

         THIS ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT (the "AGREEMENT") is made and entered
into as of December 10, 2004 by and between SEGA GAMEWORKS, L.L.C., a Delaware

("PURCHASER").

                                 R E C I T A L S

         WHEREAS, on March 9, 2004 (the "PETITION DATE"), Seller commenced the

referred to herein as the "BUSINESS") as debtor and debtor in possession
pursuant to Sections 1107(a) and 1108 of the Bankruptcy Code; and

         WHEREAS, Seller wishes to sell, transfer, convey, assign and deliver to
Purchaser, in accordance with Sections 363 and 365 and the other applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, all of the Purchased Assets (as hereinafter
defined), together with the Assumed Liabilities (as hereinafter defined), of
Seller upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in this Agreement;

         WHEREAS, Purchaser wishes to purchase and take delivery of such
Purchased Assets and Assumed Liabilities upon such terms and subject to such
conditions;

         WHEREAS, the Purchased Assets will be sold pursuant to a Sale Order (as
hereinafter defined) of the Bankruptcy Court approving such sale under Section
363 of the Bankruptcy Code and such Sale Order will include the assumption and
assignment of certain executory contracts, unexpired leases and liabilities

         WHEREAS, all of the obligations of the parties under this Agreement are
conditioned upon the approval of the Bankruptcy Court in accordance with Article
3 hereof.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants
and agreements herein set forth and for other good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the parties hereto
hereby agree as follows:

                                   ARTICLE 1
                                PURCHASE AND SALE

         Except as otherwise provided and subject to the terms and conditions

interest in and to the Purchased Assets (as defined in Section 2.1 hereof), free
and clear of all Liens (as defined in Section 15.15 hereof) other than the

                                    ARTICLE 2
   DESCRIPTION OF PURCHASED ASSETS; EXCLUDED ASSETS; ASSUMPTION OF LIABILITIES

         Section 2.1. PURCHASED ASSETS. The assets, properties and rights to be
conveyed to Purchaser shall include all of Seller's right, title and interest in
and to real and personal, tangible and intangible assets, properties and rights
owned or leased by Seller of whatever description and used or held for use in
the ownership, operation or management of the Business, including Seller's
right, title and interest in and to all property and rights relating exclusively
to the Business acquired or obtained by Seller from the date hereof through the
date of Closing and in accordance with the terms hereof, but excluding the
Excluded Assets (the assets so included, the "PURCHASED ASSETS"), which
Purchased Assets shall include all of Seller's right, title and interest in and
to its Affiliates and the following assets, properties and rights of Seller to
the extent relating exclusively to the Business:

                  (a) all of Seller's rights under (i) all Contracts (as defined
in Section 15.15 hereof) listed on SCHEDULES 2.1(a)(i) attached hereto and all
Assumed Leases (as defined in Section 2.1(c)), (ii) all Contracts added to
SCHEDULE 2.1(a)(i) attached hereto by Purchaser and Seller during the period
commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date (as defined in
Article 6 hereof); provided, however, that if any Contract is added to Schedule
2.1(a)(i) by Purchaser, then it shall not be a condition precedent to
Purchaser's obligations under this Agreement that the Sale Order authorize the
assumption and assignment of the contracts, but rather, Seller shall use good
faith efforts to obtain approval of the assumption and assignment of such
contracts, which approval may occur after the closing of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, and (iii) all Contracts entered into during the
period commencing on the date hereof and ending on the Closing Date which either
(xx) are entered into by Seller in the ordinary course of Seller's business or
expressly approved in writing by Purchaser; provided however any Contracts
hereafter entered into in the ordinary course which have a fixed term that will
continue for more than three (3) months following the Closing must be expressly
approved in writing by Purchaser (it being expressly understood that this
proviso shall not apply to renewal terms under Contracts existing as of the
mutual execution and delivery of this Agreement that occur automatically under
such Contracts upon the occurrence or non-occurrence of certain events), or (yy)
Purchaser agrees to assume in accordance with Section 2.3(a) hereof (all such
Contracts described in clauses (i) and (ii) hereof are collectively referred to
herein as the "ASSUMED CONTRACTS");

                  (b) all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to (i)
the office equipment, computers and, to the extent transferable or assignable,
related software, (ii) furniture, fixtures, supplies, uniforms and inventory,

                  (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
3.1 or any other provision of this Agreement, in the event that an Alternative
Bid of a third party (an "ALTERNATIVE BUYER" and the underlying agreement
between the Alternative Buyer and Seller, the "ALTERNATIVE APA") is approved by
the Bankruptcy Court at the hearing on the Sale Motion, this Agreement, shall
become a "back-up bid" which shall remain open for acceptance by Seller for a
period of thirty (30) days following the date upon which such hearing is
concluded, but subject and subordinate in all respects to the rights of the
Alternative Buyer under the Alternative APA.

         Section 3.2. CERTAIN BANKRUPTCY UNDERTAKINGS BY SELLER.

                  (a) Seller shall, in good faith, using its commercially
reasonable efforts, seek entry of the Sale Procedure Order on or before fifteen

action, which action or failure to act would reasonably be expected to (i)
prevent or impede the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement in accordance with the terms of this Agreement; or (ii) result in (A)
the reversal, avoidance, revocation, vacating or modification (in any manner
that would reasonably be expected to materially and adversely affect Purchaser's

any Person (or a petition for certiorari or motion for rehearing or reargument
shall be filed with respect thereto), Seller, with the cooperation and support
of Purchaser, shall take all steps as may be reasonable and appropriate to
defend against such appeal, petition or motion, and shall endeavor to obtain an
expedited resolution of such appeal; provided, however, in no event shall Seller
be obligated to continue the efforts contemplated by this Section 3.2(d) beyond
the Outside Date.

         Section 5.3. ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE. Prior to Closing, Purchaser

Purchase Price among the various assets comprising the Purchased Assets in
accordance with Treasury Regulation 1.1060-1 (or any comparable provisions of
state or local tax law) or any successor provision. If the parties are able to
agree upon the allocation of the Purchase Price , Purchaser and Seller shall

Purchaser and Seller shall file or cause to be filed any and all forms
(including U.S. Internal Revenue Service Form 8594), statements and schedules
with respect to such allocation, including any required amendments to such
forms. If, on the other hand, Purchaser and Seller are unable mutually to agree
upon the manner in which the Purchase Price should be allocated, Purchaser and
Seller shall be free to make their own respective allocations of the Purchase
Price for tax purposes. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement,
in the event the parties hereto mutually agree upon the allocation of the
Purchase Price, Purchaser's and Seller's obligations under this Section 5.3
shall survive Closing.

         Section 5.4. PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT. As set forth in this Section
5.4, the Purchase Price shall be adjusted based upon changes in Seller's
operating asset components for accounts receivable, Inventory (as defined below)
and real estate expenses and taxes and upon the amounts of Party Deposits and
certain other deposits and prepaid expenses as noted below.

                           (ii)     reduced by the amount, if any, by which the

                                    determined pursuant to Section 5.4(b)(i),

                           (iv)     decreased by the dollar amount of the gift

                                    are greater than the actual Lease Savings

                                    calculated on an aggregate basis) as of the
                                    Closing Date which amount shall be
                                    discounted at the rate of four percent (4%)
                                    per annum; and

                           (vi)     decreased by the dollar amount, if any, of
                                    the Excluded Prepaid Insurance Amount, as
                                    determined pursuant to Section 5.4(d).

is a party, the performance by Seller of its obligations hereunder and
thereunder and the consummation by Seller of the transactions contemplated
herein will not violate in any material respect, any statute or Law or any
judgment, decree, order, regulation or rule of any court or governmental
authority to which Seller is subject or any contract, instrument or other
agreement to which Seller is a party.

         Section 7.7. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS IN COMPLIANCE WITH LAW. The conduct of
the Business as it relates to the Purchased Assets is and has been in compliance
with all Laws, except where the failure to so comply, individually or in the
aggregate, would not have a Material Adverse Effect on Seller, the Business as
it relates to the Purchased Assets has all material Permits necessary for the
operation of the Purchased Assets as currently operated. It is expressly
understood that nothing in this Section 7.7 is intended to address any
compliance issue that is specifically addressed by any other representation or
warranty set forth herein, which compliance issues must be met to the full
standard required by the applicable representation and warranty.

not covered by insurance) by any or on behalf of any of the employees of the

as set forth on SCHEDULE 7.10 attached hereto, no claims have been asserted or
threatened nor has any Seller received notice of any such claim that (i) the

                           PURCHASER'S REPRESENTATIONS

         Purchaser represents and warrants (and as to Section 8.5, acknowledges)
to Seller that the statements contained in this Article 8 are true, correct and
complete as of the date of this Agreement and will be correct and complete as of

substituted for the date of this Agreement throughout this Article 8).

         Section 8.1. ORGANIZATION; QUALIFICATION AND CORPORATE POWER. Purchaser
is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in good standing under the
Laws of the State of Utah. Purchaser has all necessary power and authority to
(a) own and operate its properties, (b) carry on its business as it is now being

TRANSACTION DOCUMENTS. All necessary consents and approvals have been obtained

<PAGE>

have been duly and validly authorized and approved by all necessary corporate
action. Purchaser has full power, right and authority to acquire the Purchased
Assets. This Agreement is, and each of the other Transaction Documents when so
executed and delivered will be, a valid and binding obligation of Purchaser,
enforceable against it in accordance with its terms.

         Section 8.3. BROKERS. Purchaser has not engaged any agent, broker or
other Person acting pursuant to the express or implied authority of Purchaser
which is or may be entitled to a commission or broker or finder's fee in
connection with the transactions contemplated by this Agreement or otherwise

         Section 8.4. FUNDING. Purchaser has available to it all of the required
cash or financing to pay the Purchase Price at Closing and to otherwise perform
all of Purchaser's obligations pursuant to this Agreement. Purchaser's financial
ability to consummate the transaction under this Agreement is therefore not
subject to any financing contingency.

         Section 8.5. "AS IS" TRANSACTION; DISCLAIMER OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES.
Except as expressly provided in Article VII above, Purchaser hereby acknowledges
and agrees that Seller makes no representations or warranties whatsoever,
express or implied, with respect to any matter relating to the Purchased Assets
(including income to be derived or expenses to be incurred in connection with
the Purchased Assets, the physical condition of any personal property comprising
a part of the Purchased Assets or which is the subject of any Assumed Contract,
the environmental condition or other matter relating to the physical condition
of any real property or improvements which are the subject of any Assumed
Contract, the zoning of any such real property or improvements, the value of the
Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof), the transferability of the Purchased
Assets, the terms, amount, validity, collectibility or enforceability of any
accounts receivable or any Assumed Liabilities or Assumed Contract, the title of
the Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof), the merchantability or fitness of
the personal property comprising a portion of the Purchased Assets or any other
portion of the Purchased Assets for any particular purpose, or any other matter
or thing relating to the Purchased Assets (or any portion thereof). Without in
any way limiting the foregoing, except as otherwise expressly provided in
Article VII above, Sellers hereby disclaim any warranty (express or implied) of
merchantability or fitness for any particular purpose as to any portion of the
Purchased Assets. Purchaser further acknowledges that Purchaser has conducted an
independent inspection and investigation of the physical condition of all
portions the Purchased Assets and all such other matters relating to or
affecting the Purchased Assets as Purchaser deemed necessary or appropriate and
that in proceeding with the consummation of its acquisition of the Purchased
Assets, except for the representations and warranties set forth in Article VII
above, Purchaser is doing so based solely upon such independent inspections and
investigations. Accordingly, and in light of the fact that the representations
and warranties set forth in Article VII will lapse and terminate and be of no
further force or effect following the Closing, Purchaser will accept the
Purchased Assets at the Closing "AS IS," "WHERE IS," AND "WITH ALL FAULTS."

                                   ARTICLE 9
                       SELLER'S AND PURCHASER'S COVENANTS

         Section 9.1. CONDUCT OF BUSINESS. Subject to any restrictions and
obligations imposed by the Bankruptcy Court, Seller will not, without
Purchaser's consent, engage in any practice, take any action, or enter into any
transaction outside the Ordinary Course of Business, including, without
limitation, any amendment or change to its employee retention program. Without
limiting the generality of the foregoing (but subject to the express limitation
set forth in the immediately preceding sentence), Seller will, other than in the
Ordinary Course of Business, refrain from doing any of the following in respect
of the Purchased Assets: (i) disposing of, or transferring, any material
Purchased Asset, (ii) transferring any tangible Purchased Asset to any other
location to the extent that such other location is not among the locations which
is the subject of an Assumed Lease or otherwise part of the Purchased Assets,
(iii) except as otherwise provided or required in this Agreement with respect to
the Lease Modifications, terminating, amending or modifying the material terms
of any of the Assumed Contracts; provided that Seller shall have the right to
further modify and amend the Lease Modifications and Assumed Contracts if such
modifications and amendments do not adversely affect the material terms thereof,
or, if so, then only so long as when aggregated with all others made to the
Lease Modifications and/or Assumed Contracts from the date hereof to the
Closing, such modifications and amendments would not result in a Material
Adverse Effect, or (iv) making any change in the compensation payable or to
become payable to the employees of the Business, other than increases or
promotions in the Ordinary Course of Business or compensation provided for in
Seller's key employee retention program approved by the Bankruptcy Court by
order entered on April 27, 2004; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in the preceding sentence, Seller may, upon prior written notice to
Purchaser in their reasonable discretion take such actions in connection with or
as a result of the consequences (adverse or otherwise) of filing the Chapter 11
Case, if any, to cure defaults in respect of the Assumed Contracts.

         Section 9.2. MUTUAL COVENANTS. The parties hereto mutually covenant
(and subject to the other terms of this Agreement):

                  (a) from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, to
cooperate with each other in determining whether filings are required to be made
or consents required to be obtained in any jurisdiction in connection with the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement and in making or
causing to be made any such filings promptly and in seeking to obtain timely any
such consents (each party hereto shall furnish to the other and to the other's
counsel all such information as may be reasonably required in order to
effectuate the foregoing action), which consents shall not, in any event,
include any consent the need for which is obviated by the Sale Order or
otherwise by the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code;

                  (b) after the Closing Date, each of the parties hereto will
give, or cause to be given, to the other and/or the other's representatives,
during normal business hours: (i) reasonable access, to the extent permitted by
applicable law, to its personnel, properties, titles, contracts, books, records,
files and documents (collectively, the "DOCUMENTATION"); PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
Seller shall only be entitled to such reasonable access from Purchaser as
required in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby or as is
otherwise necessary or appropriate in connection with Seller's ongoing


                                       20
<PAGE>

administration and/or closing of the Bankruptcy Case; and (ii) at the requesting
party's expense, copies of such Documentation, as necessary to allow the
requesting party to obtain information in connection with any claims, demands,
other audits, suits, actions or proceedings by or against such requesting party
as the owner and operator of the Purchased Assets and the Business or otherwise
in furtherance of the purposes described in clause (i) above, including, without
limitation, in connection with Seller's bankruptcy proceedings. In connection
with access to the records of a party's accountants, the requesting party shall
execute and deliver such "hold harmless" agreements as the other party's
accountants may reasonably request; and

                  (c) from the date of this Agreement to the Closing Date, to
advise the other parties promptly if such party determines that any condition
precedent to its obligations hereunder will not be satisfied in a timely manner.

         Section 9.3. FILINGS AND AUTHORIZATIONS. The parties hereto shall, as
promptly as practicable, cause to be made all such filings and submissions as
may be required to consummate the terms of this Agreement. Seller and Purchaser
shall keep each other apprised of the status of any communications with, and
inquiries or requests for additional information from, any Governmental
Authority, and shall comply promptly with any such inquiry or request. Seller
shall not make any filings or submissions without the prior approval of
Purchaser, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld.

         Section 9.4. ACCESS TO INFORMATION.

                  (a) Prior to and through the date on which the Sale Order is
entered by the Bankruptcy Court, Seller shall, so long as such cooperation and
access are not materially disruptive of Seller's operation of the Business,
cooperate with Purchaser and shall give Purchaser and its representatives
(including Purchaser's accountants, consultants, counsel and employees), upon
reasonable notice and during normal business hours, full access to the
properties (including any Leased Real Property), contracts, leases, equipment,
employees, affairs, books, documents, records and other information of Seller to
the extent relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities,
and any other aspect of this Agreement and shall cause their respective
officers, employees, agents and representatives to furnish to Purchaser all
available documents, records and other information (and copies thereof), to the
extent relating to the Business, the Purchased Assets, Assumed Liabilities, and
any other aspect of this Agreement as Purchaser may reasonably request.
Purchaser expressly acknowledges and agrees that nothing in this Section 9.4 is
intended to give rise to a condition or contingency of any kind to Purchaser's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement.

                  (b) Seller agrees to use commercially reasonable efforts to
obtain consent from any third party with respect to a restriction against
allowing Purchaser to receive and review any contract, agreement or lease of
Seller.

         Section 9.5. PUBLIC ANNOUNCEMENT. Subject to the provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code and Seller's right to make such filings and disclosures as it in
good faith deems necessary or appropriate in connection with the Bankruptcy
Case, no party hereto shall make or issue, or cause to be made or issued, any


                                       21
<PAGE>

public announcement or written statement concerning this Agreement or the
transactions contemplated hereby without the prior written consent of the other
party hereto (which will not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), unless
counsel to such party advises that such announcement or statement is required by
law (in which case the parties hereto shall make reasonable efforts to consult
with each other prior to such required announcement).

         Section 9.6. TAXES.

                  (a) Seller shall be responsible for all taxes, charges, fees,
levies, penalties or other assessments imposed by any federal, state,
territorial, local or foreign taxing authority, including income, gross
receipts, excise, property, sales, transfer, franchise, payroll, withholding,
social security and other taxes, and shall include any interest, penalties or
additions attributable thereto ("TAXES") in connection with, relating to or
arising out of the Business or the ownership of the Purchased Assets, or the
Assumed Liabilities attributable to taxable periods, or portions thereof, ending
on or before the Closing, which Taxes shall be a Non-Assumed Liability.
Purchaser shall be responsible for all Taxes in connection with, relating to or
arising out of the Purchased Assets attributable to taxable periods, or portions
thereof, from and after the Closing. All state and local sales and use Taxes, to
the extent attributable to periods prior to the Closing, shall be paid or
otherwise discharged by Seller.

                  (b) If Seller is unable to obtain an exemption, pursuant to
Section 1146(c) of the Bankruptcy Code in the Sale Order, from all transfer and
documentary Taxes and recording fees and Taxes applicable to the transactions
contemplated hereby (collectively, the "TRANSFER TAXES"), such Transfer Taxes
shall be borne and paid fifty percent (50%) by Seller and fifty percent (50%) by
Purchaser.

                  (c) Seller and Purchaser shall (i) provide the other with such
assistance as may reasonably be requested by either of them in connection with
the preparation of any return, report, information return or other document
(including any related or supporting information) ("TAX RETURN"), any audit or
other examination by any taxing authority or any judicial or administrative
proceeding with respect to Taxes, (ii) retain and provide the other with any
records or other information which may be relevant to such return, audit,
examination or proceeding, and (iii) provide the other with any final
determination of any such audit or examination proceeding or determination that
affects any amount required to be shown on any Tax Return of the other for any
period (which shall be maintained confidentially).

         Section 9.7. CONSENTS. Each party hereto will use its reasonable
commercial efforts and will cooperate with the other party hereto to obtain all
consents required from third persons, whose consent or approval is required
pursuant to any Assumed Contract, Assumed Lease, Permit, or otherwise, in order
to consummate the transaction contemplated hereby; provided it shall be the
responsibility of Seller to obtain any necessary such consents; and further
provided that Purchaser and Seller agree that Seller shall not be required to
obtain any consent the need for which is obviated by the entry of the Sale Order
or otherwise by any provision of the Bankruptcy Code.

         Section 9.8. GOOD FAITH EFFORTS. Without limiting the specific
obligations of any party hereto under any covenant or agreement hereunder, each
party hereto shall use its good faith efforts to take all action and do all
things necessary to consummate the transactions contemplated in this Agreement
on or before the Outside Date.


                                       22
<PAGE>

         Section 9.9. EMPLOYEES. Purchaser shall, prior to the Closing Date,
make offers of employment, to substantially all of Seller's current employees.
The employment of any employees of Seller to whom Purchaser offers employment
and who accept such employment with Purchaser after the Closing shall be
at-will. Nothing in this Section 9.9 is intended to create any claim or right
against Purchaser on the part of any employee of Seller and no such employee
shall be entitled to assert any claim or right hereunder. Subject to the
foregoing, Purchaser shall have the right in the good faith exercise of
operations and managerial discretion in its sole discretion to make changes or
cause changes to be made after the Closing in compensation, benefits and other
terms of employment to terminate any such transferred employee. In addition,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.9, Purchaser may, in
it sole discretion, terminate any transferred employee with or without cause, at
any time.

                  Section 9.10. COBRA LIABILITY. To the extent "continuation
coverage" (within the meaning of Internal Revenue Code ("Code") Section 4980B)
is required to be provided, Purchaser will assume responsibility for individuals
who are "M & A qualified beneficiaries" (within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations under Code Section 4980B) with respect to the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement, either through Purchaser's own group health
plans or through the group health plans of a member of the Purchaser's
controlled group, as of the Closing. In addition, Purchaser agrees that in the
event any of the "covered employees' (within the meaning of Treasury Regulation
under Code Section 4980B) currently employed at Seller's Las Vegas Joint Venture
location, the assets of which location shall not be acquired as part of this
transaction, becomes a qualified beneficiary during the period ending thirty
(30) days after the Closing Puraser shall make continuation coverage available
to such employee on the same terms as if the qualified beneficiary was an M&A
qualified beneficiary under the prior sentence.

                  Section 9.11. LIQUOR LICENSES. Purchaser shall be responsible
for and use its commercially reasonable efforts to obtain all required consents
of alcoholic beverage control and similar governmental authorities to the
transactions contemplated herein. If any such required consents have not been
obtained with respect to any locations of the Business included in the Purchased
Assets such that Purchaser would not be able to operate such locations (herein a
"FAILED SITE") on and after the Closing, then Seller and Purchaser shall, to the
extent reasonably practicable enter into such management, concession or similar
arrangements reasonably requested by Purchaser (an "ALTERNATIVE ARRANGEMENT") as
may be permitted under alcoholic beverage control laws that would permit the
operation of the Failed Site(s) by Purchaser after the Closing without any
adverse economic effect on Purchaser or Seller. Purchaser shall indemnify,
defend (with counsel reasonably satisfactory to Seller), protect and save and
hold Seller and its respective, officers, directors, employees, agents, and
other representatives of, from and against any claims, demands, liabilities,
demands, actions, causes or action, losses, costs, penalties, and expenses
(including, without limitation, attorneys' fees, except that in the case of
attorneys' fees incurred by Seller in connection with an Alternative
Arrangement, (i) expenses shall only include reasonable attorneys' fees ; and
(ii) such reasonable attorneys' fees shall only be so included if Seller
promptly caused written notice of the assertion of any such claim of which it
had knowledge which it reasonably believed to be covered by this indemnity to
have been forwarded to Purchaser) as they or any of them may suffer or incur in


                                       23
<PAGE>

connection with or by reason of any Alternative Arrangement(s) the parties may
at any time enter into. If, as of the date of Closing, no Alternative
Arrangement can be implemented without material adverse impact on Purchaser or
Seller, then at the Closing, (i) the amount of the Purchase Price attributable
to such Failed Site(s) (as set forth on SCHEDULE 9.11 hereto) will be set aside
from the Purchase Price and paid by Purchaser to the Escrow Agent; (ii) the
Closing as to such Failed Site(s) will be extended (although not beyond the
Outside Closing Date) until the required consent(s) are obtained, (iii) if the
Closing as to such Failed Site(s) occurs, the Escrow Agent shall pay all funds
held by it in respect of the applicable Failed Site(s) to Seller, and (iv) if
the Closing as to such Failed Site(s) does not occur prior to the Outside
Closing Date for any reason, the Escrow Agent shall return all funds held by it
in respect of the applicable Failed Site(s) to Purchaser. In addition, if the
Closing as to such Failed Site(s) does not occur prior to the Outside Closing
Date for any reason, the lease associated with such Failed Site(s) shall no
longer be assumed by Purchaser and such lease(s) shall be an Excluded Contract.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.11 or any other
provision of this Agreement, (i) any location with respect to which the
alcoholic beverage control or other similar governmental authorities disapprove
the transfer of a liquor license to Purchaser by reason of the identity of any
principal of Purchaser or for any other reason specific or particular to
Purchaser shall not be deemed a Failed Site and Seller have no obligation to
enter into an Alternative Arrangement with respect thereto, (ii) Purchaser's
obligation to consummate the transactions contemplated herein shall not be
conditioned upon the transfer of the liquor license with respect to such
location, (iii) Purchaser shall not be entitled to any reduction or other
adjustment of the Purchase Price on account of the fact that such liquor license
is not among the Purchased Assets transferred to Purchaser at the Closing, and
(iv) as provided in the immediately preceding sentence of this Section 9.11, the
lease associated with such location shall be deemed an Excluded Contract at
Purchasers option in its sole discretion.

                  Section 9.12. CURE PAYMENTS. Seller shall be responsible for
paying, as and when required by the Sale Order, any cure payments or amounts
which the Bankruptcy Court determines to be due and payable as a condition to
assumption and assignment of the Assumed Contracts and the Assumed Leases.

                  Section 9.13. FURTHER ASSURANCES. From time to time after the
Closing and without further consideration, Purchaser and Seller, at the request
of the other, will execute and deliver such other instruments of conveyance and
transfer or other instruments or documents, and take or arrange for such other
actions, as may reasonably be required to effect any of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement or to provide any party hereto with the benefits
intended to be conferred and conveyed by this Agreement; provided that,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section 9.13 or any other
provision of this Agreement, neither Purchaser nor Seller shall be required to
execute any document or take any action that would (i) increase the liability or
obligation of the party of whom such document or action is requested beyond that
such party would have pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, (ii)
require or cause the party of whom such action or document is requested to
initiate, join in or otherwise become a party to any litigation, action or other
proceeding, (iii) cause such party to incur any material cost or expense that is
not already imposed upon it by another provision of this Agreement. The parties
undertake, for a period of two (2) years (or the applicable statute of
limitations) after the Closing Date (or, as to Seller, until the Bankruptcy Case


                                       24
<PAGE>

is closed if that occurs sooner), to retain at their own expense all records and
documents relating to the Purchased Assets and to make such records and
documents available for inspection and copying at reasonable times and upon
reasonable notice, at the expense of the requesting party; provided, however, no
party shall be required to make available records and documents which it is
prohibited to make available by law.

         Section 9.14. NO SURVIVAL OF REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES. Except for
the provisions of Section 8.5 hereof (which Purchaser and Seller expressly agree

or Purchaser contained in this Agreement or made in any other documents or
instruments delivered pursuant to this Agreement shall survive the Closing

         Section 9.18. LITIGATION. Seller agrees to continue to cooperate with
and reasonably assist Purchaser with respect to litigation matters related to
the Purchased Assets that arise or relate to the period after the Closing;
provided, however, such assistance shall not require Seller to initiate, join in

provided, further that any material out of pocket costs relating to Seller's
obligations under this paragraph shall be borne by Purchaser.

event shall Seller be required to take any action in connection therewith that
would (i) increase Seller's liability or obligation beyond that Seller would
have pursuant to the other provisions of this Agreement, (ii) require or cause
Seller to initiate, join in or otherwise become a party to any litigation,
action or other proceeding, or (iii) cause Seller to incur any material cost or

particular date) and at and as of the Closing Date, except to the extent that
such representations and warranties are qualified by terms such as "material"

<PAGE>

following the Closing, the benefits and liabilities of the transaction
contemplated under this Agreement, and (iii) none of the Assumed Leases and

                                   ARTICLE 11

                                   ARTICLE 12
                                 INDEMNIFICATION

         Section 12.1. INDEMNIFICATION BY PURCHASER. Subject to the provisions
of this Article 12 and if (but only if) the Closing is consummated, Purchaser
agrees to indemnify, defend and hold Seller, its subsidiaries, officers,
directors, advisors, employees, representatives, Affiliates, successors and
assigns (collectively, the "SELLER INDEMNIFIED PARTIES") harmless of, from and
against the aggregate of all losses, costs, damages, claims, demands,
obligations, liabilities, actions, causes of action, fine, liens, charges,
penalties, costs and expenses (including, without limitation, all court costs
and attorneys' fees) (collectively, "INDEMNIFICATION COSTS") incurred or
suffered by Seller, resulting from failure of Purchaser to satisfy the Assumed
Liabilities.

         Section 12.2. DETERMINATION OF DAMAGES AND RELATED MATTERS. In
calculating any amounts payable pursuant to Section 12.1 hereof, Purchaser shall
receive credit for any insurance recoveries. Seller shall have no right to
recover special, consequential or punitive damages.

         Section 12.3. NOTICE OF INDEMNIFICATION. In the event any legal
proceeding shall be instituted or any claim or demand shall be asserted by any
Seller Indemnified Party entitled to indemnification in respect of which payment
may be sought under the provisions of this Article 12, any Seller Indemnified
Party entitled to indemnification seeking indemnification (the "INDEMNITEE")
shall promptly cause written notice of the assertion of any such claim of which
it has knowledge which it reasonably believes to be covered by this indemnity to
be forwarded to Purchaser (the "INDEMNITOR"); provided, however, that the
failure to give such notice shall not affect the indemnification provided
hereunder except to the extent the Indemnitor has actually been prejudiced as a
result of such failure. Subject to the foregoing, any notice of a claim shall
state specifically the facts giving rise to an alleged basis for the claim and
the amount of the liability asserted against the Indemnitor by reason of the
claim. Any claim for indemnification by Seller against Purchaser shall be
settled exclusively and finally by the Bankruptcy Court. For the avoidance of
doubt, no party hereto may seek indemnification under the provisions of this
Article 12 unless a legal proceeding shall have been instituted or a claim or
demand shall have been asserted.

         Section 12.4. INDEMNIFICATION PROCEDURE FOR THIRD PARTY CLAIMS. Except
as otherwise provided herein, in the event of the initiation of any legal
proceeding against an Indemnitee by a third party, the Indemnitor shall have the
right after the receipt of notice, at its option and at its own expense, to be
represented by counsel (which counsel shall be reasonably satisfactory to the
Indemnitee) and to defend against, negotiate, settle or otherwise deal with any
proceeding, claim, or demand which relates to any damage Indemnified against
hereunder, provided, however, (i) that the Indemnitor exercises such option in
writing within 30 days of receipt of notice; and (ii) that the Indemnitee may
participate in any such proceeding with counsel of its choice and at
Indemnitor's expense. The parties hereto agree to cooperate fully with each
other in connection with the defense, negotiation or settlement of any such
legal proceeding, claim or demand. To the extent the Indemnitor elects not to
defend such proceeding, claim or demand, and the Indemnitee defends against or
otherwise deals with any such proceeding, claim or demand, the Indemnitee may
retain counsel (reasonably satisfactory to Indemnitor) at the expense of the
Indemnitor and control the defense of and settlement of such proceeding;
provided, that the Indemnitor shall nevertheless indemnify the Indemnitee for
the full amount of the damages relating to such proceeding, claim or demand and


                                       28
<PAGE>

provided, further, that the Indemnitee shall give the Indemnitor twenty (20)
days written notice prior to entering into any such settlement and shall not
settle any such claim without the consent of the Indemnitor, which consent shall
not be unreasonably withheld and which consent shall be deemed to have been
granted if the Indemnitor fails to respond to the Indemnitee's properly noticed
request for such consent. If the Indemnitee shall settle any such proceeding
without the consent or deemed consent of the Indemnitor, the Indemnitee shall
thereafter have no claim against the Indemnitor under this Article 12 with
respect to any damages occasioned by such settlement, unless it is found or
otherwise determined that Indemnitor unreasonably withheld its consent to such
settlement.

                                   ARTICLE 13
                                   TERMINATION

         Section 13.1. BREACHES AND DEFAULTS; OPPORTUNITY TO CURE. Prior to the
exercise by a party of any termination rights afforded under this Agreement, if
either party (the "NON-BREACHING PARTY") believes the other (the "BREACHING
PARTY") to be in breach hereunder, the Non-Breaching Party shall provide the
Breaching Party with written notice specifying in reasonable detail the nature
of such breach, whereupon if such breach is curable the Breaching Party shall
have ten (10) calendar days from the receipt of such notice to cure such breach
to the reasonable satisfaction of the Non-Breaching Party; PROVIDED, HOWEVER,
that the cure period for a breach shall in no event extend beyond the Outside
Date. If the breach is not cured within such time period, then the Non-Breaching
Party shall be entitled to terminate this Agreement if the breach is such that
the condition set forth in Section 10.1 or 11.1, as applicable, shall not be
satisfied (as provided in Section 13.2). This right of termination shall be in
addition to, and not in lieu of, any rights of the Non-Breaching Party under
Article 12 of this Agreement. Upon any termination with respect to which
Purchaser is a Non-Breaching Party, among other equitable and legal rights and
remedies available to purchaser, Seller shall cause the Purchase Price Deposit
to be promptly returned to Purchaser.

         Section 13.2. TERMINATION. This Agreement may be terminated and the
transactions contemplated herein may be abandoned, by written notice given to
the other party hereto, at any time prior to the Closing:

                  (a) by mutual written consent of Seller and Purchaser;

                  (b) by Seller or Purchaser if (i) the Bankruptcy Court enters
an Order approving the sale of the Purchased Assets to a third-party purchaser
following the hearing on the Sale Order, provided that Purchaser's right to
terminate this Agreement pursuant to this clause (b)(i) is subject to the
"back-up bid" provisions of Section 3.1(e) above, or (ii) the Sale Order is for
any reason (other than a breach or default hereunder by the party seeking to
terminate) not entered on or before the Outside Sale Order Date;

                  (c) subject to the right to cure set forth in Section 13.1 at
any time prior to the Closing Date by Purchaser if Seller alters, amends or
breaches any of the covenants in Section 9.1, is in breach of any material
covenant, representation, undertaking or warranty, or if it appears that a
condition set forth in Article 10 is impossible (other than through the failure
of Purchaser to comply with its obligations under this Agreement) to satisfy and
Purchaser has not waived such condition in writing on or before the Closing
Date;


                                       29
<PAGE>

                  (d) subject to the right to cure set forth in Section 13.1, at
any time prior to the Closing Date by Seller if Purchaser is in breach of any
material covenant, representation or warranty or if it appears that a condition
set forth in Article 11 is impossible (other than through the failure of Seller
to comply with their obligations under this Agreement) to satisfy and Seller has
not waived such condition in writing on or before the Closing Date; by Seller,
if, as of any date, Purchaser shall have breached any of its representations,
warranties or covenants such that the condition set forth in Section 11.1 shall
not be satisfied as of such date;

                  (e) by Purchaser if Seller refuses to close for any reason
whatsoever, other than a breach or default by Purchaser of Purchaser's
obligations under this Agreement; or

                  (f) by Seller or Purchaser if the Closing shall not have
occurred on or before the Outside Date, unless the failure to have the Closing
shall be due to the failure of the party seeking to terminate this Agreement to
perform in any material respect its obligations under this Agreement required to
be performed by it at or prior to the Closing.

         Upon entry of the Sale Order, the mutual termination right set forth in
Section 13.2(b) above shall cease.

                                   ARTICLE 14
                                  BROKERS' FEES

         Each party represents and warrants to the other that it shall be solely
responsible for the payment of any fee or commission due to any broker or finder
it has engaged with respect to this transaction (which includes, in Seller's
case, SSG Capital Advisors, L.P., Seller's investment banker, Cushman &
Wakefield and Studley) and the other party hereto shall be indemnified for any
liability with respect thereto.

                                   ARTICLE 15
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

         Section 15.1. ADDITIONAL INSTRUMENTS OF TRANSFER. From time to time
after the Closing, each party shall, if requested by another party, make,
execute and deliver such additional assignments, bills of sale, deeds and other
instruments and documents, as may be reasonably necessary or proper to carry out
the specific provisions of this Agreement, including, without limitation,
transfer to Purchaser of all of Seller's right, title and interest in and to the
Purchased Assets and any right, title or interest that Seller may have in any
asset used or held for use in Business, other than an Excluded Asset.

         Section 15.2. NOTICES. All notices and other communications required or
permitted to be given hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have
been duly given if delivered personally, sent by telecopier, recognized
overnight delivery service or registered or certified mail, return receipt

and costs, including the fees of any attorney retained by it, incurred in
connection with the preparation of this Agreement and the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby. In the event either party shall bring any

interpretation of this Agreement or any Transaction Document, the prevailing

party all court costs reasonable costs and expenses of such action, including,
without limitation, attorneys' fees.

hereby irrevocably consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court, or if, and only if, the Bankruptcy Case has been closed, the courts of
the State of California. Seller and Purchaser each irrevocably consents to
service of process out of the aforementioned courts and waives any objection

written, and constitutes the entire agreement and understanding between the

application thereof to any person or circumstance shall be invalid or
unenforceable to any extent, the remainder of this Agreement and the application
of such provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected
thereby and shall be enforced to the greatest extent permitted by law, but only
as long as the continued validity, legality and enforceability of such provision
or application does not materially (a) alter the terms of this Agreement, (b)
diminish the benefits of this Agreement or (c) increase the burdens of this
Agreement, for any person.

         Section 15.11. SECTION HEADINGS. The section headings contained in this

phrase "and/or," (b) "including" has the inclusive meaning frequently identified
with the phrase "including, but not limited to" and (c) references to "hereof,"
"hereunder" or "herein" or words of similar import relate to this Agreement.

a period of two (2) years following the Closing (or until the closing of the
Bankruptcy Case, if the Bankruptcy Case is closed sooner): (i) Purchaser shall

Seller and its respective professionals (collectively, "PERMITTED ACCESS
PARTIES") reasonable access to the financial and other books and records
relating to the Purchased Assets or the Business, which access shall include
(xx) the right of such Permitted Access Parties to copy, at such Permitted

                                  SCHEDULE 7.8

                              Financial Statements
                              --------------------


Due to uncertainty surrounding bankruptcy issues or past practices, the
following financial statement transactions may not have been recorded in
accordance with GAAP:

         1.       For fiscal year 2005, consolidated base rent expense is being
                  recorded at an estimated 30% savings over original contract
                  terms, which is our best estimate of total consolidated
                  savings. While on a consolidated basis rent is materially
                  correct, on an individual store basis the savings may
                  fluctuate, in some cases, significantly up or down. For the
                  six months ended September 2004, the consolidated variance
                  between actual payments and the estimated expense is less than
                  $10K, or .2%. Upon final execution of all the new leases, the
                  rent expense per store will be adjusted to the actual expense.

                  Additionally, GAAP rent adjustment relating to the original
                  lease terms has been suspended. As of September, the
                  consolidated liability (deferred income) is approximately
                  $1.8M.

         2.       Marketing costs are expensed evenly throughout the year based
                  on the annual spending plan and are reconciled at year-end to
                  actual expenses. Marketing spending plans are reviewed
                  quarterly and the standard expense entry is adjusted if the
                  spending plan is materially different from the original plan.
                  At the end of September, marketing expenses were lower than
                  actual cash outlay by approximately $450K; therefore, there is
                  a prepayment of this amount recorded on the balance sheet.

         3.       Interest expense and amortization of loan origination fees
                  relating to notes payable have not been recorded since the
                  bankruptcy filing.

         4.       Barter transactions for game play are not recorded.
