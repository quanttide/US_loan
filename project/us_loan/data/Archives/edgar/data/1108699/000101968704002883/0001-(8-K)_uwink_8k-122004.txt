Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operation

Item 1.01.  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On Monday December 13, 2005, the registrant prepared and submitted an
Asset Purchase Agreement ("APA") dated December 10, 2004 by and between Sega
Gameworks LLC, as debtor and debtor in possession under Case No. LA 04-15404-BB
in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central District of California,
Los Angeles Division ("the Court") and the registrant. This APA was prepared in
contemplation of an auction to be held on December 15, 2004 to sell the assets
of Sega Gameworks ("the Sega Assets") in accordance with Section 363 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The APA contains a purchase price for the assets of Sega
Gameworks in an amount equal to Six Million One Hundred Fifty Thousand Dollars
($6,150,000). Concurrent with the submission of the APA, the registrant placed
an earnest money deposit equal to ten percent (10%) of the purchase price into a
segregated trust account maintained by the counsel of Sega Gameworks in an
amount equal to six hundred fifteen thousand dollars ($615,000).

         In order to finance the possible acquisition of the Sega Assets by the
registrant, the registrant agreed to and accepted a Commitment Letter dated
December 13, 2004 from Mellon HBV Alternative Strategies, LLC ("Mellon HBV").
The transactions contemplated by the Commitment Letter are expressly subject to
the consummation of the acquisition of the Sega Assets by the registrant. Upon
the terms and subject to the conditions contained in the Commitment Letter,
Mellon HBV agreed to provide a revolving credit facility for Four Million
Dollars ($4,000,000) at an interest rate of LIBOR plus 600 basis points for
thirty six months. The revolving credit facility will be secured by
substantially all of the assets of the registrant.

         Mellon HBV also agreed to provide between Six Million and Eight Million
Dollars ($6,000,000-8,000,000) of equity financing. Fifty percent of the equity
investment will be made in shares of a newly-created class of Series A
Convertible Preferred Stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.66 per
share. Fifty percent of the equity investment will be made in shares of common
stock of the Company at a purchase price of $1.18 per share. Additionally, a
five year warrant shall be issued providing for the purchase of 631,118
additional shares of Common Stock at an exercise price of $0.36 per share (the
"Warrant"). The Warrant shall not be exercisable until the first anniversary of
the closing of the purchase of the assets of Sega Gameworks. After giving effect
to the transactions contemplated hereby, the Series A Preferred and Common Stock
to be acquired by Mellon HBV shall constitute 45% (determined on an "as
converted basis") of the outstanding voting capital stock of the Company on a
fully-diluted basis (assuming an aggregate investment of $6,000,000).

         In connection with the agreement and acceptance by the registrant of
the Commitment Letter, the registrant issued a Promissory Note with a face value
of Four Hundred Five Thousand Dollars ($405,000) with an interest rate equal to
six percent (6%) per annum to Mellon HBV related to the earnest money deposit
referred to above. Principal and any accrued but unpaid interest under this Note
shall be due and payable as follows: $100,000 of the principal shall be due and
payable on December 20, 2004, and the remaining principal and any accrued but
unpaid interest under this Note shall be due and payable upon the termination of
the Commitment Letter in accordance with its terms.

         On Wednesday December 15, 2004 the registrant participated in the
auction of the Sega Assets. In spite of being the highest bidder at the auction
by in excess of $1.2 million, the counsel for the creditor judged the bid of the
registrant to be an inferior bid and deemed SS Entertainment USA, a subsidiary
of Sega Corporation, to be the winning bidder. Sega Corporation is a large
creditor and a joint venture partner of Sega Gameworks. The registrant has been
deemed to be the back-up bidder pursuant to a sales procedure order of the
Court. The registrant is obligated to purchase the assets as the back-up bidder
for a period of 30 days from the date of a sale hearing by the Court which is
scheduled to take place on January 6, 2005.

         In the event that SS Entertainment USA fails to complete the purchase
of the Sega assets Gameworks, the registrant would become the prevailing party
in the auction and purchase the assets at the last bid qualified by the
auctioneer. The last bid qualified by the auctioneer was Seven Million Eight
Hundred Twenty Five Thousand Dollars ($7,825,000).

         The registrant reserved its right to contest the outcome. The
registrant has consulted counsel regarding the filing of an opposition motion to
vacate the sale proceeding and reopen the auction.
