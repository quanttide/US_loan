     RE: Commitment Letter for a Revolving Credit Facility and Equity Investment
         -----------------------------------------------------------------------


Mr. Bushnell:

         uWink, Inc. ("you" or the "Company") has advised Mellon HBV Alternative
Strategies LLC ("us" or "Mellon HBV") that the Company will make a bid (the
"Initial Bid") on the date hereof of $6,150,000 to purchase substantially all of
the assets of Sega Gameworks LLC (the "Target Assets"), a Delaware limited
liability company (the "Debtor"), as debtor and debtor in possession under Case
No. LA 04-15404-BB in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Central
District of California, Los Angeles Division (the "Bankruptcy Court"), pursuant
to a sale commenced under Section 363 of the Bankruptcy Code. You have further
advised us that you will deposit $615,000 of earnest money (the "Earnest Money
Deposit") with SSG Capital Advisors, L.P., the financial advisor to the Debtor
(the "Advisor"), and that as a result of the Initial Bid and the Earnest Money
Deposit, you will be deemed a "Qualified Bidder" as defined in the order of the
Bankruptcy Court entered on November 24, 2004 (the "Order"). You have further
advised us that you may increase the Initial Bid up to ten million dollars (the
"Auction Bid Amount") at your discretion at the auction to be held on December
15, 2004 by the Advisor (the "Auction"). You have further advised us that the
Company would like to obtain a revolving credit facility for four million
dollars (the "Loan") and sell shares of preferred stock and common stock of the
Company and warrants to purchase additional shares of common stock of the
Company (together, the "Equity Securities") for an aggregate purchase price of
between six million dollars and eight million dollars (the final amount to be
based on the Auction Bid Amount) to finance the purchase of the Target Assets,
on the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in Annex A and Annex B
attached hereto. We are pleased to inform you that we are willing to agree to
provide you with the Loan and purchase the Equity Securities upon the terms and
conditions set forth in this Commitment Letter, including Annex A and Annex B
attached hereto.

         Accordingly, the parties hereto agree as follows:

         1. COMMITMENTS. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth
in this Commitment Letter and Annex A attached hereto, you hereby agree to issue
to us the Equity Securities, and we hereby agree to purchase the Equity
Securities from you. Upon the terms and subject to the conditions set forth in
this Commitment Letter and Annex B attached hereto, you hereby agree to accept
the Loan from us, and we hereby agree to provide the Loan to you.

                                        2

         Prior to the provision of the Loan and the sale and issuance of the
Equity Securities, Mellon HBV and the Company will enter into definitive
documents consistent with the terms set forth in this Commitment Letter,
including Annex A and Annex B attached hereto, and having other standard market
terms comparable to the terms of similar documents executed in connection with
similar offerings of equity securities and revolving credit facilities, modified
as appropriate to reflect the terms of the transactions contemplated hereby, in
form and substance satisfactory to Mellon HBV and the Company.

         Our commitment to make the Loan to you and purchase the Equity
Securities under this Commitment Letter is subject to the satisfaction of the
conditions set forth in Annex A and Annex B attached hereto. It is currently
expected that the Company will attend the Auction and use its best efforts to
obtain the Target Assets on terms that meet the parameters set forth herein. It
is further expected that in the event the Company is the "Successful Bidder" (as
defined in the Order) following the Auction, the Company will use its best
efforts to (i) consummate the purchase of the Target Assets on commercially
reasonable terms on or before February 15, 2005, and (ii) take all actions
necessary or advisable in connection therewith (including obtaining all
requisite consents and approvals and making all necessary regulatory filings).

         2. ASSIGNMENT OF COMMITMENT. Mellon HBV, in its sole discretion, may
assign its rights and obligations under this Commitment Letter to Allen &
Company and/or one or more of its affiliates.

         3. NOTICE. The Company will promptly notify Mellon HBV of any material
fact or circumstance that could reasonably be expected to keep the Company from
satisfying any one or more of the conditions set forth in Annex A or Annex B
attached hereto.

         4. TERMINATION. Mellon HBV may terminate its commitments hereunder
pursuant to any one or more of the following: (i) mutual agreement of the
parties; (ii) the Company is not the "Successful Bidder" or the "Back-Up Bidder"
(as defined in the Order) at the Auction; (iii) the Company fails to consummate
the purchase of the Target Assets on or before February 15, 2005; (iv) willful
breach of the terms of the Commitment Letter by the Company or a failure on the
part of the Company to use commercially reasonable efforts to satisfy all
conditions set forth herein or in Annex A or Annex B attached hereto; (v) it
becomes apparent in Mellon HBV's reasonable judgment that the Company will be
unable to satisfy one or more of the conditions set forth herein or in Annex A
or B attached hereto on or before February 15, 2005; and (vi) Mellon HBV is not
satisfied, in its sole discretion, with its business and legal due diligence
review of the Company and the acquisition of the Target Assets (the "Due
Diligence Out"). Upon any termination of this Commitment Letter, the obligations
of the parties hereunder shall terminate, except for the obligations of the
Company in the manner contemplated under the headings "Fees, Costs and
Expenses," "Confidentiality," and "Promissory Note."

         5. FEES, COSTS AND EXPENSES. Upon execution and delivery of this
Commitment Letter by the Company, regardless of whether the transactions
contemplated hereby are ultimately consummated, Mellon HBV shall be entitled to
reimbursement of reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred in
connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, including fees of legal
counsel, financial advisers, and industry consultant(s). This provision shall
survive termination of this Commitment Letter.

         6. REPRESENTATIONS. Mellon HBV has entered into this Commitment Letter
relying upon (A) publicly available information relating to the Company that has
been prepared by or on behalf of the Company, including (i) Company information
included in the reports the Company files with the Securities and Exchange
Commission and available on the Edgar system; and (ii) information available on
the Company's web site (collectively, the "Information"). The Company hereby
represents that all Information, other than any projections, which has been or
is hereafter made available to us by the Company in connection with the
transactions contemplated hereby, was or will be, at the time such Information
was or is made available, complete and correct in all material respects and did
not or will not, at the time such Information was or will be made available,
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a material fact
necessary to make the statements contained therein not materially misleading in
light of the circumstances under which such statements were or will be made.

         7. CONFIDENTIALITY. This Commitment Letter, including Annex A and Annex
B attached hereto shall be confidential in all respects and the Company shall be
prohibited from disclosing the same to any third party, provided, that this
Commitment Letter, including Annex A and Annex B attached hereto, may be
provided to the Advisor in connection with the Auction and as required to be
filed by the Securities Exchange Commission, provided that a copy of such filing
and any related press releases shall be approved in advance by Mellon HBV.

         8. PROMISSORY NOTE. Simultaneously with the execution and delivery
hereof, we will provide you with a loan of $405,000 to assist the Company in
making the Earnest Money Deposit, such loan to be evidenced by a demand
promissory note (the "Promissory Note"). In the event that the Company is the
"Successful Bidder" following the Auction and the transactions contemplated
hereby are not ultimately consummated as a result of Mellon HBV's exercise of
the Due Diligence Out, the principle amount of the Promissory Note shall be
reduced by $305,000 and such amount shall be forgiven. Any other principle and
interest due under the Promissory Note shall be subject to the terms thereof.

         9. EXCLUSIVITY. In consideration of the time, resources and expenses
incurred and expected to be incurred by Mellon HBV in connection with the
transactions contemplated by this Commitment Letter, and as an inducement to
Mellon HBV to commit such time, resources and expenses, until the termination
hereof, the Company hereby covenants and agrees that it shall not, and shall not
authorize any of its officers, directors, stockholders, agents and
representatives to, enter into any discussions or negotiations with, or solicit
or provide any written information to, or accept any proposal or otherwise
commit to, or take any other action with a view to entering, or enter into or
consummate, with any third party other than the Mellon HBV, any transaction
involving the financing, recapitalization or sale of the Company or any other
transaction that would render impracticable the transactions contemplated
hereby. Any current negotiations or discussions shall have been terminated
immediately prior to execution and delivery hereof.

         10. GOVERNING LAW. This Commitment Letter shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York, without regard
to its conflict of laws principles.

attached hereto, and the Promissory Note contain the entire agreement between
