<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;2.01 Completion of Acquisition or Disposition of Assets.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December 23, 2004, Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc. (&#147;SBS&#148;) completed the acquisition
contemplated by the merger agreement dated as of October&nbsp;5, 2004 with Infinity Media Corporation
(&#147;Infinity&#148;), Infinity Broadcasting Corporation of San Francisco (&#147;Infinity SF&#148;) and SBS Bay Area,
LLC, a wholly-owned subsidiary of SBS (&#147;SBS Bay Area&#148;). As a result of the merger, SBS has
acquired the Federal Communications Commission (&#147;FCC&#148;) license of Infinity SF for KRZZ-FM, serving
the San Francisco, California market and certain related assets.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the closing, SBS issued to Infinity (i)&nbsp;an aggregate of 380,000 shares of Series&nbsp;C
convertible preferred stock (the &#147;Series&nbsp;C preferred stock&#148;), which are convertible into shares of
the Class&nbsp;A common stock of SBS; and (ii)&nbsp;a warrant to purchase an additional 190,000 shares of the
Series&nbsp;C preferred stock at an exercise price of $300 per share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Series&nbsp;C preferred stock of SBS issued as a result of the consummation of the merger were
issued pursuant to the terms and conditions of a certificate of designation. Upon conversion, each
share of Series&nbsp;C preferred stock held by a stockholder will convert into twenty fully paid and
non-assessable shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, which shares will be exempt from registration
requirements of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Securities Act&#148;), as a transaction not
involving a public offering. The shares of Series&nbsp;C preferred stock issued at the closing of the
merger are convertible into 7,600,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, subject to adjustment, and
the Series&nbsp;C preferred stock issuable upon exercise of the warrant are convertible into an
additional 3,800,000 shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock, subject to adjustment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is no material relationship, other than in respect of the merger transaction and other
related agreements, between SBS and SBS Bay Area, on the one hand, and Infinity and Infinity SF or
any of their affiliates, or any director or officer of Infinity or Infinity SF, or any associate of
any such director or officer, on the other hand.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The above summary description of the merger transaction does not purport to be complete and is
qualified in its entirety by reference to the merger agreement, which was filed as Exhibit&nbsp;10.1 to
the Current Report on Form 8-K filed by SBS on October&nbsp;8, 2004 and is incorporated by reference
into this report. The certificate of designation and warrant governing the Series&nbsp;C preferred
stock are attached hereto as exhibits 4.1 and 4.2, respectively.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Registration Rights Agreement</I>




<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The shares of Class&nbsp;A common stock issuable upon conversion of the Series&nbsp;C preferred stock will be restricted securities,
including those shares issuable upon exercise of the warrant, and the
holder thereof may not sell, transfer or otherwise dispose of such shares without registration
under the Securities Act or an exemption therefrom. In connection with the closing of the merger
transaction, SBS also entered into a registration rights agreement with Infinity, pursuant to
which, following a period of one year (or earlier if SBS takes certain actions),

Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) providing for the registration for resale of the Class&nbsp;A common
stock issuable upon conversion of the Series&nbsp;C preferred stock. Under the terms of the
registration rights agreement, SBS has also agreed to grant &#147;piggyback&#148; registration rights to
Infinity for registered offerings which include the sale of shares by Ra&#250;l Alarc&#243;n, Jr.
Additionally, the registration rights agreement stipulates that SBS will indemnify Infinity against

                  holders of such Class A Common Stock as and after such time.

                  Stock held by the Holders shall convert into twenty fully paid

                  of shares subject to adjustment pursuant to Section 6(g)
                  below), on the later of (A) the date specified in a written
                  notice delivered to the Company stating that such Holder
                  desires to convert shares of Series C Preferred Stock then
                  outstanding (the "Conversion Notice"), which date must be at
                  least five trading days following delivery of the Conversion

                  Holder desires to convert, all in accordance with Section
                  6(b)(ii) below.

            (ii)  In order to convert shares of Series C Preferred Stock into
                  Class A Common Stock pursuant to paragraph 6(b)(i) above, the
                  Holders shall:

                        such of the Holders shares of Series C Preferred Stock
                        to be converted, duly endorsed in blank or accompanied
                        by proper instruments of transfer, at the principal
                        office of the Company or any transfer agent for the
                        Series C Preferred Stock, and

                  (2)   shall give the Conversion Notice to the Company at such
                        office of the election to convert the same and shall

                        office to the Holders or their respective transferee,
                        certificates for the number of whole shares of Class A
                        Common Stock to which such Holders shall be entitled.
                        The Conversion Notice shall be substantially in the form
                        attached hereto as Exhibit B.

      (c)   Effect of Conversion. Upon the conversion of the Series C Preferred
            Stock pursuant to this Section 6, the shares of Series C Preferred
            Stock shall not be transferred on the books of the Company or be
            deemed to be outstanding for any purpose whatsoever and shall
            constitute only the right to receive such number of shares of Class
            A Common Stock as may be issuable on an as converted basis upon such
            conversion upon compliance with the requirements of this Section 6;
            provided, however, that the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock as
            of any record date for the payment of all declared but unpaid
            dividends, if any, on any shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall
            be paid, out of any assets at the time legally available therefor,
            upon conversion of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock into
            shares of Class A Common Stock, but shall not be paid any amounts in
            respect of the Class A Common Stock into which it has been or will
            be converted.

      (d)   Fractions of Shares. No fractional shares of Class A Common Stock
            shall be issued by the Company. In lieu thereof, the Company shall
            pay in cash the fair market value of such fractional share as
            determined in good faith by the Board of Directors. Such conversion
            shall be deemed to have been made as of the date of the Conversion
            Notice and such surrender of the Series C Preferred Stock to be
            converted, and the person or persons entitled to receive the Class A
            Common Stock issuable upon such conversion

                                        7

<PAGE>

            shall be treated for all purposes as the record holder or holders of
            such Class A Common Stock on said date.

      (e)   Adjustments. If the Company at any time (i) subdivides the
            outstanding Common Stock or (ii) issues a stock dividend on its
            outstanding Common Stock, the number of shares of Class A Common
            Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock
            immediately prior to such subdivision or the issuance of such stock
            dividend shall be proportionately increased by the same ratio as the
            subdivision or dividend. If the Company at any time combines its
            outstanding Common Stock, the number of shares of Class A Common
            Stock issuable upon conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock
            immediately prior to such combination shall be proportionately
            decreased by the same ratio as the combination. All such adjustments
            described herein shall be effective at the close of business on the
            date of such subdivision, stock dividend or combination, as the case
            may be.

      (f)   Reorganization. In case of any capital reorganization (other than in
            connection with a merger or other reorganization in which the
            Company is not the continuing or surviving entity) or any
            reclassification of the Common Stock, the Series C Preferred Stock
            shall thereafter be convertible into that number of shares of stock
            or other securities or property to which a holder of the number of
            shares of Class A Common Stock deliverable upon conversion of the
            Series C Preferred Stock immediately prior to such reorganization or
            recapitalization would have been entitled upon such reorganization
            or reclassification. In any such case, appropriate adjustment (as
            determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in
            the application of the provisions herein set forth with respect to
            the rights, preferences and powers thereafter of the Holders of
            Series C Preferred Stock, such that the provisions set forth herein
            shall thereafter be applicable, as nearly as reasonably may be, in
            relation to any share of stock or other property thereafter
            deliverable upon the conversion.

      (g)   Authorized Shares. The Company shall at all times reserve and keep
            available, out of its authorized but unissued Class A Common Stock,
            solely for the purpose of effecting the conversion of Series C
            Preferred Stock, the full number of shares of Class A Common Stock
            deliverable from time to time upon the conversion of all shares of
            Series C Preferred Stock from time to time outstanding. The Company
            shall from time to time (subject to obtaining necessary Board of
            Directors and stockholder approvals), in accordance with the laws of
            the State of Delaware, increase the authorized amount of its Class A
            Common Stock if at any time the authorized number of shares of Class
            A Common Stock remaining unissued shall not be sufficient to permit
            the conversion of all of the shares of Series C Preferred Stock at
            the time outstanding.

                  consent of stockholders or, if no record date is established,
                  at the date such vote is taken or any consent of stockholders
                  solicited, and shall have voting rights and powers equal to
                  the voting rights and powers of the Class A Common Stock on an
                  as-converted basis on all matters brought before the
                  stockholders of the Company.

            (ii)  The Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to
                  notice of any stockholders' meeting in accordance with the
                  Company's by-laws and applicable law and shall vote together
                  with holders of the Common Stock as a single class upon any
                  and all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders, except
                  those matters required by law or this Certificate of
                  Designation to be submitted to a class vote.

            (iii) Notwithstanding the foregoing, any Holder of the shares of the
                  Series C Preferred Stock may deliver to the Company a notice
                  requesting termination of the voting rights provided in
                  Section 6(a)(i) and (ii) of this Certificate of Designation,
                  except voting rights on those matters required by law or this
                  Certificate of Designation to be submitted to a class vote.
                  Immediately following receipt of such notice, the Holders of
                  shares of Series C Preferred Stock shall have no voting
                  rights, except as required by Delaware law and as hereinafter
                  provided.

      (b)   Approval of Certain Corporate Actions. Without the prior approval of
            the Holders, an amendment to the Certificate of Incorporation or
            this Certificate of Designation may not:

            (i)   amend this Certificate of Designation;

            (ii)  alter or change the voting rights or powers of the Series C
                  Preferred Stock or reduce the number of shares of Series C
                  Preferred Stock whose holders must approve any such amendment;

            (iii) adversely affect the preferences, powers or rights of the
                  Holders of Series C Preferred Stock;

            (iv)  increase or decrease the number of authorized shares of the
                  Company designated as Series C Preferred Stock; or

            (v)   amend Section 5.4 of the Certificate of Incorporation.

      (c)   Limitation on Lines of Business. So long as the Holders of Series C
            Preferred Stock beneficially own the Minimum Investment, the Company
            shall not, without the prior approval of the Holders, enter into or
            conduct any business, either directly or through any Subsidiary,
            except for Permitted Businesses.

8.    PREEMPTIVE RIGHTS

      (a)   Preemptive Right. Each Holder of the shares of Series C Preferred
            Stock shall have the right to purchase its pro rata share (as set
            forth below) of Equity Securities (the

                                        9

<PAGE>

            "Preemptive Offer") which the Company may, from time to time,
            propose to sell and issue (subject to such requirements and
            restrictions imposed by the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, and
            state securities laws and to the actual issuance of the Equity
            Securities) after the Issue Date, other than Excluded Issuances. For
            purposes of this Section 8(a), the Holders pro rata share shall be
            the amount of such Equity Securities obtained by applying the
            following ratio against the total number of such Equity Securities
            to be offered by the Company: (i) the number of shares of the Common
            Stock (including all shares of Common Stock issued or issuable upon
            conversion of the Series C Preferred Stock or the exercise of
            outstanding Equity Securities held by the Holders, including the
            Series C Preferred Stock issued pursuant to the Warrant) of which
            the Holder is deemed to be a holder immediately prior to the
            issuance of such Equity Securities, to (ii) the total number of
            shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding (including all shares
            of Common Stock issued or issuable upon conversion of the Series C
            Preferred Stock or the exercise of outstanding Equity Securities
            held by the Holders, including the Series C Preferred Stock issued
            pursuant to the Warrant) immediately prior to the issuance of the
            Equity Securities, determined on a fully diluted basis after giving
            effect to the exercise in full of then outstanding options and
            warrants and the conversion of all securities convertible into
            shares of Common Stock.

      (b)   Notice of Preemptive Offer. In the event the Company proposes to
            undertake an issuance of Equity Securities, it shall give the
            Holders of Series C Preferred Stock written notice of its intention,
            describing the type of Equity Securities and the price and the terms
            upon which the Company proposes to issue the same. The Preemptive
            Offer shall by its terms remain open and irrevocable for a period of
            five Business Days from the date it is received from the Company
            (the "Preemptive Offer Period").

      (c)   Preemptive Offer Acceptance. The Holders of Series C Preferred Stock
            shall have the option, exercisable at any time during the Preemptive
            Offer Period by delivering written notice to the Company (a
            "Preemptive Offer Acceptance Notice"), to purchase its pro rata
            share of Equity Securities. The Company shall notify the Holders
            within five days following the expiration of the Preemptive Offer
            Period of the number or amount of the Holders pro rata share of
            Equity Securities it has subscribed to purchase.

      (d)   Offer of Refused Equity Securities. If the Preemptive Offer
            Acceptance Notice is not given by the Holders of Series C Preferred
            Stock for all of their pro rata share of Equity Securities, the
            Company shall have 180 days from the expiration of the Preemptive
            Offer Period to sell all or any part of such Holders pro rata share
            of Equity Securities as to which the Preemptive Offer Acceptances
            Notice has not been given by the Holders (the "Refused Equity
            Securities") to any other Persons upon the terms and conditions
            including price, which are no more favorable, in the aggregate, to
            such other Persons or less favorable to the Company than those set
            forth in the Preemptive Offer.

      (e)   Closing. Upon the closing of the sale to such other Persons of all
            the Equity Securities, the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock shall
            purchase from the Company, and the Company shall sell to the
            Holders, the pro rata share of Equity Securities with respect to
            which the Preemptive Offer Acceptance Notice was delivered by the
            Holders, at the same terms specified in the Preemptive Offer.

      (f)   Emergency Funding. If the Company determines in good faith that the
            delay occasioned by complying with the procedures contemplated by
            this Section 8 would be prejudicial to the Company or its financial
            condition or business and operations, then the Company

                                       10

<PAGE>

            may before delivering the Preemptive Offer or after delivering the
            Preemptive Offer (but before observing the time periods and other
            procedures set forth in this Section 8), issue or sell all of the
            Equity Securities. If the Company elects to issue Equity Securities
            under this Section 8 before it delivers a Preemptive Offer, then the
            Company shall deliver the Preemptive Offer to the Holders of Series
            C Preferred Stock to which it has not so issued or sold Equity
            Securities (the "Excluded Group") no later than five Business Days
            after the date on which such Equity Securities are issued or sold to
            the Holders. If the Excluded Group delivers a Preemptive Offer
            Acceptance Notice within 10 Business Days and the Company has issued
            or sold the Equity Securities to a Person but not to the Holders,
            then the Company shall issue or sell such number of pro rata shares
            of Equity Securities as the participating members of the Excluded
            Group would have been entitled had the Preemptive Offer been made
            and accepted by such member of the Excluded Group in accordance with
            Sections 8(a) through (d) as promptly as practicable, but in no
            event later than five Business Days following the date of delivery
            of the Preemptive Offer Acceptance Notice, at the same price, and on
            the same terms and conditions as the issuance and sale occurred.

      (g)   Expiration. The rights granted under this Section 8 to the Holders
            of Series C Preferred Stock shall expire upon such time as the
            Holders of Series C Preferred Stock no longer beneficially own the
            Minimum Investment.

9.    CERTAIN COVENANTS

      (a)   Merger, Consolidation, or Sale of Assets. If the Company (i) merges
            or consolidates with or into another corporation or limited
            liability company in which the Company is not the surviving entity
            and by which the shares of the Company's capital stock outstanding
            immediately prior to the merger are converted by virtue of the
            merger into other property, whether in the form of securities, cash,
            or otherwise or (ii) sells or transfers all or substantially all of
            the Company's properties and assets to any other Person, then, a
            provision shall be made so that, upon the basis and the terms and in
            the manner provided in this Certificate of Designation, the Holders
            of Series C Preferred Stock shall be entitled to receive the stock
            or other securities, cash or property which the Holders would have
            been entitled to receive upon such consummation if the Holders had
            converted the shares of Series C Preferred Stock for such shares of
            Class A Common Stock immediately prior thereto. If the per share
            consideration payable to the Holders in connection with any such
            event is in a form other than cash or marketable securities, then
            the value of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by
            the Board of Directors. In all events, appropriate adjustment (as
            determined in good faith by the Board of Directors) shall be made in
            the application of the provisions of this Certificate of Designation
            such that the Holders rights and interest in this Certificate of
            Designation shall be applicable after such event, to the greatest
            extent possible, in relation to any shares or other property
            deliverable after that event.

      (b)   Transactions With Affiliates. Without the prior approval of the
            Holders, the Company shall not, and shall not permit any of its
            Subsidiaries to, make any payment to, or sell, lease, transfer or
            otherwise dispose of any of its properties or assets to, or purchase
            any property or assets from, or enter into or make or amend any
            transaction, contract, agreement, understanding, loan, advance or
            guarantee with, or for the benefit of, any Affiliate (each of the
            foregoing, an "Affiliate Transaction"), unless (i) such Affiliate
            Transaction is on terms that are no less favorable to the Company or
            such Subsidiary than those that would have been obtained in a
            comparable transaction by the Company or such

                                       11

<PAGE>

            Subsidiary with an unrelated Person (ii) with respect to any
            Affiliate Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions
            involving aggregate consideration in excess of $2.5 million, such
            Affiliate Transaction or series of Affiliated Transactions has been
            approved by a majority of the members of the Board of Directors that
            are disinterested as to such Affiliate Transaction or series of
            Affiliated Transactions and (iii) with respect to any Affiliate
            Transaction or series of related Affiliate Transactions involving
            aggregate consideration in excess of $10.0 million, an opinion as to
            the fairness to the Company of such Affiliate Transaction or series
            of Affiliated Transactions from a financial point of view issued by
            an accounting, appraisal or investment banking firm of national
            standing; provided that (1) any transaction approved by the Board of
            Directors, with an officer or director of the Company or of any of
            its Subsidiaries in his or her capacity as an officer or director
            entered into in the ordinary course of business; (2) transactions
            between or among the Company and/or its Subsidiaries; (3) payment of
            reasonable directors fees to the Board of Directors and of its
            Subsidiaries; (4) fees and compensation paid to, and indemnity
            provided on behalf of, officers, directors or employees of the
            Company or any of its Subsidiaries, as determined in good faith by
            the Board of Directors of the Company or of any such Subsidiary, to
            the extent the same are reasonable and customary; and (5) agreements
            in effect on the Issue Date and any modification thereto or any
            transaction contemplated thereby (including pursuant to any
            modification thereto) in any replacement agreement therefor so long
            as such modification or replacement is not more disadvantageous to
            the Company in any material respect than the original agreement as
            in effect on the Issue Date, in each case, shall not be deemed to be
            Affiliate Transactions.

      (c)   Reports. Whether or not required by the rules and regulations of the
            SEC, so long as any shares of Series C Preferred Stock are
            outstanding, the Company shall make available to the Holders, upon
            request, (i) all quarterly and annual financial information that
            would be required to be contained in a filing with the SEC on Forms
            10-Q and 10-K if the Company were required to file such Forms,
            including a "Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial
            Condition and Results of Operations" that describes the financial
            condition and results of operations of the Company and its
            consolidated Subsidiaries (showing in reasonable detail, either on
            the face of the financial statements or in the footnotes thereto and
            in Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and
            Results of Operations, the financial condition and results of
            operations of the Company and its Subsidiaries separate from the
            financial information and results of operations of the Subsidiaries
            of the Company) and, with respect to the annual information only, a
            report thereon by the Company certified independent accountants and
            (ii) all current reports that would be required to be filed with the
            SEC on Form 8-K if the Company was required to file such reports, in
            each case within the time periods set forth in the SEC's rules and
            regulations. For purpose of this provision, posting such reports on
            EDGAR or on the Company's website shall constitute making such
            reports available to the Holders. The Company also agrees to provide
            the Holders with such additional information as the Holders may from
            time to time reasonably request.

      (d)   Events of Default. The Company agrees that, so long as the Holders
            of Series C Preferred Stock beneficially own the Minimum Investment,
            the Company shall furnish to the Holders, as soon as possible and
            in any event within five Business Days of obtaining knowledge
            thereof, an officer's certificate specifying the nature and period
            of existence of such condition or event, or specifying the notice
            given or action taken by such holder or Person and the nature of
            such claimed violation, default, event or condition, and what action
            the Company has taken, is taking and proposes to take with respect
            to notice:

                                       12

<PAGE>

            (i)   of any condition or event that constitutes an event of default
                  under the instruments governing the Company's outstanding debt
                  with a principal amount in excess of $50,000,000;

            (ii)  that any Person has given any notice to the Company or any of
                  its Subsidiaries or taken any other action with respect to a
                  claimed default or event or condition that would be required
                  to be disclosed in a current report filed by the Company with
                  the SEC on Form 8-K (Items 1, 2, 4 and 5 of such Form as in
                  effect on the date hereof); or

            (iii) of any condition or event which constitutes a Material Adverse
                  Effect.

      (e)   No Poison Pills. Without the prior approval of the Holders, the
            Company shall not, so long as the Holders of Series C Preferred
            Stock beneficially own the Minimum Investment, create or adopt any
            shareholders rights plan or "poison pill", amend any of its
            organizational documents, or take any similar action that would
            prohibit or materially impede or materially delay the ability of the
            Holders and their Affiliates to acquire additional shares of Capital
            Stock, or to dispose of or sell such Capital Stock, in any manner
            permitted by this Certificate of Designation, the Warrant and the
            Stockholders Agreement; provided that, for avoidance of doubt, the
            foregoing shall not restrict the Company from (a) entering into loan
            agreements that contain customary covenants, including provisions
            permitting acceleration of the related indebtedness upon a change of
            control and (b) issuing debt securities or preferred stock that
            contain customary covenants, including change of control provisions.

      (f)   Limitation on Issuance of Series C Preferred Stock. Without the
            prior approval of the Holders, the Company shall not issue any
            shares of Series C Preferred Stock to any Person other than the
            Infinity Media Corporation, a Delaware corporation, and its
            Affiliates.

10.   AMENDMENT.

            Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the DGCL, subject to
      Section 9(a), neither this Certificate of Designation nor the Certificate
      of Incorporation shall be amended, altered or repealed (by merger,
      consolidation or otherwise) in any manner that would alter or change the
      powers, preferences or special rights of the Series C Preferred Stock so
      as to affect the Holders thereof adversely without the affirmative vote of
      the Holders of Series C Preferred Stock voting separately as a class.

11.   EXCLUSION OF OTHER RIGHTS.

            Except as may otherwise be required by law, the shares of Series C
      Preferred Stock shall not have any voting powers, preferences and
      relative, participating, optional or other special rights, other than
      those specifically set forth in this Certificate of Designation (as such
      Certificate of Designation may be amended from time to time in accordance
      with the terms hereof) and in the Certificate of Incorporation.

12.   HEADINGS OF SECTIONS.

            The headings of the various sections and subsections hereof are for
      convenience of reference only and shall not affect the interpretation of
      any of the provisions hereof.

                                       OF

                        SPANISH BROADCASTING SYSTEM, INC.

                          VOID AFTER DECEMBER 23, 2008

      THIS IS TO CERTIFY THAT, for value received, Infinity Media Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Holder") is entitled, subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein, to purchase from Spanish Broadcasting System, Inc.
(the "Company") an aggregate of up to 190,000 shares (the "Warrant Shares") of
fully paid, nonassessable shares of the Company's Series C Preferred Stock, par
value $0.01 per share (the "Series C Preferred Stock"). The number, character
and Exercise Price (defined below) of such shares of Series C Preferred Stock
are subject to adjustment as provided herein. The term "Warrant" as used herein
shall include this Warrant and any warrants delivered in substitution,
replacement or exchange therefor as provided herein. The term "Common Stock" as
used herein shall mean Class A common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, Class
B common stock, par value $0.0001 per share, and all other stock of any class or
classes (however designated) of the Company, the holders of which have the
right, without limitation as to amount, either to all or to a share of the
balance of current dividends and liquidating dividends after the payment of
dividends and distributions on any shares entitled to preference.

      1. TERM OF WARRANT. Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein,
this Warrant shall be exercisable, in whole or in part in two equal increments
of 95,000 Warrant Shares each, during the term commencing on the date hereof and
ending at 5:00 p.m., prevailing

                                       1

<PAGE>
local time in New York, New York, on December 23, 2008, (the "Expiration Date").
If not exercised prior to the Expiration Date, this Warrant and all rights
granted under this Warrant shall expire and lapse.

      2. EXERCISE PRICE. The price at which this Warrant may be exercised shall
be $300.00 per share of Series C Preferred Stock, as adjusted from time to time
pursuant to Section 9 hereof (the "Exercise Price").

      3. EXERCISE OF WARRANT.

            i. The purchase right represented by this Warrant shall be
exercisable by the Holder, either in whole or in one of two parts of 95,000
Warrant Shares each at any time prior to the Expiration Date upon (i) the
surrender and presentment of this Warrant accompanied by a duly completed and
executed notice of exercise in the form of Exhibit A attached hereto (the
"Exercise Notice") at the principal office of the Company (listed as the
Company's address in Section 15 herein) or such other office or agency as the
Company may designate by notice pursuant to Section 15 herein, and (ii) payment
of the aggregate Exercise Price equal to the number of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock being purchased upon exercise of this Warrant multiplied by the
Exercise Price (the "Aggregate Exercise Price") in cash, by certified or
official bank check payable to the order of the Company, or by wire transfer to
an account in a bank designated for such purpose by the Company.

            ii. This Warrant shall be deemed to have been exercised immediately
prior to the close of business on the date of its surrender for exercise and
payment as provided above, and the person entitled to receive the shares of
Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon such exercise shall be treated for all
purposes as the holder of record of such shares as of the close of business on
such date. As promptly as practicable on or after such date, the Company shall
issue and deliver to the person entitled to receive the same, a certificate for
the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon such exercise. If
such certificate shall be registered in a name other than the name of the
Holder, then funds sufficient to pay all stock transfer taxes which shall be
payable upon the issuance of such certificate shall be paid by the Holder at the
time of exercise of this Warrant and the Company shall not be required to issue
or deliver any certificate until such tax or other charge has been paid by the
Holder.

      4. NO FRACTIONAL SHARES OR SCRIP. No fractional shares or scrip
representing fractional shares shall be issued upon the exercise of this
Warrant. In the event that an adjustment in the number of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant made pursuant to this
Section 4 hereof results in a number of shares issuable upon the exercise which
includes a fraction, at the Holder's election, this Warrant may be exercised for
the next larger whole number of shares or the Company shall make a cash payment
equal to that fraction multiplied by the current market value of that share.

                                       2

      5. REPLACEMENT OF WARRANT. On receipt of evidence reasonably satisfactory
to the Company of the loss, theft, destruction or mutilation of this Warrant
and, in the case of loss, theft or destruction, on delivery of an indemnity
agreement reasonably satisfactory in form and substance to the Company or, in
the case of mutilation, on surrender and cancellation of this Warrant, the
Company shall execute and deliver, in lieu of this Warrant, a new warrant of
like tenor and equal amount.

      6. NO RIGHTS AS STOCKHOLDER. This Warrant shall not entitle the Holder to
any rights as a stockholder of the Company.

      7. WARRANT REGISTER. The Company shall maintain a register (the "Warrant
Register") containing the name and address of the Holder. The Company may treat
the Holder as shown on the Warrant Register as the absolute owner of this
Warrant for all purposes and shall not be affected by any notice to the
contrary.

      8. RESERVATION OF STOCK. The Company covenants and agrees that during the
term that this Warrant is exercisable:

            (a) All shares of Series C Preferred Stock that are issued upon the
exercise of this Warrant shall, upon issuance, be validly issued, not subject to
any preemptive rights, and be free from all taxes, liens, security interests,
charges, and other encumbrances with respect to the issuance thereof, other than
(i) taxes in respect of any transfer occurring contemporaneously with such
issue, (ii) an encumbrance under applicable Federal securities laws or state
"Blue Sky" laws, and (iii) an encumbrance created by the terms of this Warrant.

            (b) The Company shall at all times have authorized and reserved, and
shall keep available and free from preemptive rights, a sufficient number of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock to provide for the exercise of the rights
represented by this Warrant and Class A Common Stock to provide for conversion
of the Series C Preferred Stock.

            (c) The Company shall not, by amendment of its Certificate of
Incorporation or through any reorganization, transfer of assets, spin-off,
consolidation, merger, dissolution, issue or sale of securities or any other
action or inaction, seek to avoid the observance or performance of any of the
terms of this Warrant, and shall at all times in good faith assist in performing
and giving effect to the terms hereof and in the taking of all such actions as
may be necessary or appropriate in order to protect the rights of the Holder
against dilution or other impairment.

      9. ADJUSTMENTS. The Exercise Price and the number and type of shares
purchasable hereunder are subject to adjustment from time to time as follows:

            (a) Adjustment for Change in Capital Stock. If the Company:

                                       3

<PAGE>

                  (i)   pays a dividend or makes a distribution on its Common
                        Stock, in either case in shares of its Common Stock;

                  (ii)  subdivides its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
                        greater number of shares;

                  (iii) combines its outstanding shares of Common Stock into a
                        smaller number of shares;

                  (iv)  makes a distribution on its Common Stock in shares of
                        its capital stock other than Common Stock; or

                  (v)   issues by reclassification of its Common Stock any
                        shares of its capital stock.

then the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise
of this Warrant immediately prior to such action shall be proportionately
adjusted so that the Holder of this Warrant thereafter exercised shall receive
the aggregate number and kind of shares of capital stock of the Company which he
would have owned immediately following such action if the Warrant had been
exercised immediately prior to such action.

            The adjustment shall become effective immediately after the record
date in the case of a dividend or distribution and immediately after the
effective date in the case of a subdivision, combination or reclassification.

            Such adjustment shall be made successively whenever any event listed
above shall occur.

            (b) Adjustment for Rights Issue.

            If the Company distributes any rights, options or warrants to all
holders of its Common Stock entitling them to purchase shares of Common Stock at
a price per share less than the current market price per share on the record
date for determining holders entitled to the distribution of rights, options or
warrants, the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon the
exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:

                             O + A
                N' =  N x -------------
                          O + (A x P/M)

      where:

      N' =  the adjusted number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable
            upon the exercise of this Warrant.

      N  =  the current number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable
            upon the exercise of this Warrant.

                                       4

<PAGE>

      O  =  the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the record date.

      A  =  the number of additional shares of Common Stock offered.

      P  =  the purchase price per share of the additional shares of Common
            Stock offered.

      M  =  the current market price per share of Common Stock on the record
            date.

            The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such rights,
options or warrants are issued and shall become effective immediately after the
record date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the
rights, options or warrants. If at the end of the period during which such
rights, options or warrants are exercisable, not all rights, options or warrants
shall have been exercised, the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock
issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be immediately readjusted to
what it would have been if "N" in the above formula had been the number of
shares actually issued at the end of the period.

            (c) Adjustment for Other Distributions. If the Company distributes
to all holders of its Common Stock any of its assets (excluding cash
distributions for which there will be no adjustment under this Section 9(c)) or
debt or other securities or any rights, options or warrants to purchase the
assets or debt or other securities of the Company, the number of shares of
Common Stock issuable upon exercise of each Warrant shall be adjusted in
accordance with the formula:

                             M
                  N'= N  x -----
                           M - F

      where:

      N' = the adjusted number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise
      of each Warrant.

      N = the current number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon exercise of
      each Warrant.

      M = the current market price per share of Common Stock on the record date
      mentioned below.

      F = the fair market value on the record date of the assets, securities,
      rights, options or warrants distributable to one share of Common Stock
      after taking into account, in the case of any rights, options or warrants,
      the consideration required to be paid upon exercise thereof. The Board
      shall reasonably determine the fair market value in good faith and such
      determination shall be conclusive.

                                       5

<PAGE>

            The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such
distribution is made and shall become effective immediately after the record
date for the determination of stockholders entitled to receive the distribution.

            This Section 9(c) does not apply to rights, options or warrants
referred to in Section 9(b). If any adjustment is made pursuant to this Section
9(c) as a result of the issuance of rights, options or warrants and at the end
of the period during which any such rights, options or warrants are exercisable,
not all such rights, options or warrants shall have been exercised, the Warrant
shall be immediately readjusted as if "F" in the above formula was the fair
market value described in the definition of "F" on the record date of the assets
or securities actually distributed upon exercise of such rights, options or
warrants divided by the number of shares of Common Stock outstanding on the
record date. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
9(c), if "M-F" in the above formula is less than $1.00, the Company may elect
to, and if "M-F" is a negative number, the Company shall, in lieu of the
adjustment otherwise required by this Section 9(c), distribute to the Holder of
the Warrant, upon exercise thereof, the assets, securities, rights, options or
warrants (or the proceeds thereof) which would have been distributed to the
Holder had such Warrant been exercised immediately prior to the record date for
such distribution.

            (d) Adjustment for Common Stock Issue. If the Company issues shares
of Common Stock for a consideration per share less than the current market price
per share on the date the Company fixes the offering price of such additional
shares, the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon the
exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted in accordance with the formula:

                              A
                  N'= N x  -------
                           O + P/M

            where:

      N'=   the adjusted number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable
            upon the exercise of this Warrant.

      N =   the current number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable
            upon the exercise of this Warrant.

      O =   the number of fully diluted shares outstanding immediately prior to
            the issuance of such additional shares.

      P =   the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such
            additional shares.

      M =   the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such
            additional shares.

                                       6

<PAGE>

      A =   the number of fully diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding
            immediately after the issuance of such additional shares.

            The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance
is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance.

      This Section 9(d) does not apply to:

            (i)   any of the transactions described in Sections 9(b) and 9(c);

            (ii)  the exercise of this Warrant, or the conversion or exchange of
                  other securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock,
                  or the issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of rights,
                  options or warrants issued to the holders of Common Stock;

            (iii) Common Stock (and options exercisable therefor) issued to the
                  Company's employees, officers, directors, consultants or
                  advisors (whether or not still in such capacity on the date of
                  exercise) under bona fide employee benefit plans or stock
                  option plans adopted by the board of directors (the "Board")
                  of the Company and approved by the holders of Common Stock
                  when required by law, if such Common Stock would otherwise be
                  covered by this Section 9(d);

            (iv)  Common Stock issued in a bona fide public offering; and

            (v)   Common Stock issued to the seller of a business or substantial
                  assets to the Company or any of its direct or indirect
                  subsidiaries.

            (e) Adjustment for Convertible Securities Issue. If the Company
issues any securities convertible into or exchangeable for Common Stock (other
than securities issued in transactions described in Sections 9(b) and 9(c)) for
a consideration per share of Common Stock initially deliverable upon conversion
or exchange of such securities less than the current market price per share on
the date of issuance of such securities, the number of shares of Series C
Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant shall be adjusted in
accordance with this formula:

                           O + D
                  N'= N x -------
                          O + P/M

            where:

      N'=   the adjusted number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable
            upon the exercise of this Warrant.

                                       7

<PAGE>

      N =   the current number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable
            upon the exercise of this Warrant.

      O =   the number of fully diluted shares of Common Stock outstanding
            immediately prior to the issuance of such securities.

      P =   the aggregate consideration received for the issuance of such
            securities.

      M =   the current market price per share on the date of issuance of such
            securities.

      D =   the maximum number of shares of Common Stock deliverable upon
            conversion or in exchange for such securities at the initial
            conversion or exchange rate.

            The adjustment shall be made successively whenever any such issuance
is made, and shall become effective immediately after such issuance.

            If all of the Common Stock deliverable upon conversion or exchange
of such securities have not been issued when such securities are no longer
outstanding, then the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon
the exercise of this Warrant shall promptly be readjusted to what it would have
been had the adjustment upon the issuance of such securities been made on the
basis of the actual number of shares of Common Stock issued upon conversion or
exchange of such securities.

            This Section 9(e) does not apply to:

            (i)   any of the transactions described in Sections 9(b),

            (ii)  convertible securities issued in a bona fide public offering,

            (iii) the exercise of this Warrant, or the conversion or exchange of
                  other securities convertible or exchangeable for Common Stock,
                  or the issuance of Common Stock upon the exercise of rights,
                  options or warrants issued to the holders of Common Stock,

            (iv)  Common Stock (and options exercisable therefor) issued to the
                  Company's employees, officers, directors, consultants or
                  advisors (whether or not still in such capacity on the date of
                  exercise) under bona fide employee benefit plans or stock
                  option plans adopted by the Board and approved by the holders
                  of Common Stock when required by law, if such Common Stock
                  would otherwise be covered by this Section 9(e),

            (v)   Common Stock issued in a bona fide public offering, and

                                       8

<PAGE>

            (vi)  Common Stock issued to the seller of a business or substantial
                  assets to the Company or any of its direct or indirect
                  subsidiaries.

            (f) Current Market Price. In Sections 9(b), (c), (d) and (e), the
current market price per share of Common Stock on any date is the lower of: (i)
the closing price on the trading date prior to the event; or (ii) the average of
the closing prices of the Common Stock for 20 consecutive trading days
commencing 30 trading days before the date in question.

            (g) Consideration Received. For purposes of any computation
respecting consideration received pursuant to Sections 9(b), (c), (d) and (e),
the following shall apply:

            (i)   in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for
                  cash, the consideration shall be the gross proceeds to the
                  Company from such issuance, which shall not include any
                  deductions for any commissions, discounts, other expenses
                  incurred by the Company in connection therewith or amounts
                  paid or payable for accrued interest or accrued dividends;

            (ii)  in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for a
                  consideration in whole or in part other than cash or, subject
                  to clause (iii) below, securities, the consideration other
                  than cash shall be deemed to be the fair market value thereof
                  as determined in good faith by the Board (irrespective of the
                  accounting treatment thereof), whose determination shall be
                  conclusive;

            (iii) in the case of the issuance of shares of Common Stock for a
                  consideration in whole or in part consisting of securities,
                  the value of any securities shall be deemed to be: (x) if
                  traded on a securities exchange or through the Nasdaq National
                  Market, the average of the closing prices of the securities on
                  such quotation system over the 30-day period ending three days
                  preceding the day in question, (y) if actively traded
                  over-the-counter, the average of the closing bid or sale
                  prices (whichever is applicable) over the 30-day period ending
                  three days preceding the day in question and (z) if there is
                  no active public market, the fair market value thereof,
                  determined as provided in clause (B) above; and

            (iv)  in the case of the issuance of securities convertible into,
                  exercisable for or exchangeable for shares of Common Stock,
                  the aggregate consideration received therefor shall be deemed
                  to be the consideration received by the Company for the
                  issuance of such securities plus the additional minimum
                  consideration, if any, to be received by the Company upon the
                  conversion, exercise or exchange thereof for the maximum
                  number of shares used to calculate the adjustment (the
                  consideration in each case to be determined

<PAGE>

                  in the same manner as provided in clauses (i) through (iii) of
                  this Section 9(g)).

            (h)   When De Minimis Adjustment May Be Deferred.

            No adjustment in the number of shares of Series C Preferred Stock
issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant need be made unless the adjustment
would require an increase or decrease of at least 2% in such number. Any
adjustments that are not made shall be carried forward and taken into account in
any subsequent adjustment.

            All calculations under this Section 9 shall be made to the nearest
cent or to the nearest 1/100th of a share, as the case may be.

            (i) When No Adjustment Required. No adjustment need be made for a
transaction referred to in Sections 9(b), (c), (d) or (e) if the Holder is given
the opportunity to participate, without requiring this Warrant to be exercised,
in the transaction on a basis and with notice that the Board reasonably
determines to be fair and appropriate in light of the basis and notice on which
holders of Common Stock participate in the transaction.

            To the extent this Warrant becomes convertible into cash, no
adjustment need be made thereafter as to the amount of cash into which this
Warrant is exercisable. Interest will not accrue on the cash.

            (j) Merger, Sale of Assets, Reorganization, Reclassification. If
during the period that this Warrant remains outstanding and unexpired, there
shall be (i) a merger or consolidation of the Company with or into another
corporation in which the Company is not the surviving entity and by which the
shares of the Company's capital stock outstanding immediately prior to the
merger are converted by virtue of the merger into other property, whether in the
form of securities, cash, or otherwise, (ii) a sale or transfer of all or
substantially all of the Company's properties and assets to any other person, or
(iii) a capital reorganization or reclassification of the Class A Common Stock
(other than a combination or subdivision of shares otherwise provided for
herein), then, lawful provision shall be made so that, upon the basis and the
terms and in the manner provided in this Warrant, the Holder, upon the exercise
hereof at any time after the consummation of such event, shall be entitled to
purchase, in lieu of the shares of Class A Common Stock for which this Warrant
could have been exercised immediately prior to such consummation, the stock or
other securities, cash or property which the Holder would have been entitled to
receive upon such consummation if the Holder had exercised this Warrant for such
shares of Class A Common Stock immediately prior thereto, subject to adjustment
as nearly equivalent as possible to the adjustments provided for in this Section
9. If the per share consideration payable to the Holder in connection with any
such event is in a form other than cash or marketable securities, then the value
of such consideration shall be determined in good faith by the Company's Board
of Directors. In all events, appropriate adjustment (as determined in good faith
by the Company's Board of Directors) shall be made in the application of the
provisions of this Warrant such that the Holder's rights and interest in this
Warrant shall be

                                       10

<PAGE>

applicable after such event, to the greatest extent possible, in relation to any
shares or other property deliverable after that event upon exercise of this
Warrant.

      If this Section 9(j) applies, Sections 9(a), (b), (c), (d) and (e) do not
apply.

            (k) When Issuance or Payment May Be Deferred. In any case in which
this Section 9 shall require that an adjustment in the number of shares of
Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant be made
effective as of a record date for a specified Event, the Company may elect to
defer the occurrence of the adjustment until the occurrence of such underlying
event that requires the adjustment.

            (l) Adjustment in Exercise Price.

            Upon each Event that provides for an adjustment of the number of
shares of Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon the exercise of this Warrant
pursuant to this Section 9, this Warrant if outstanding prior to the making of
the adjustment shall thereafter have an adjusted Exercise Price (calculated to
the nearest ten millionth) obtained from the following formula:

                            N
                  E'=  E x ---
                            N'

            where:

            E' =  the adjusted Exercise Price.

            E  =  the Exercise Price prior to adjustment.

            N' =  the adjusted number of Series C Preferred Stock issuable
                  upon the exercise of this Warrant by payment of the adjusted
                  Exercise Price.

            N  =  the number of Series C Preferred Stock previously issuable
                  upon the exercise of this Warrant by payment of the Exercise
                  Price prior to adjustment.

            Following any adjustment to the Exercise Price pursuant to this
Section 9, the amount payable, when adjusted and together with any consideration
allocated to the issuance of this Warrant, shall never be less than the Series C
Preferred Stock par value at the time of such adjustment. Such adjustment shall
be made successively whenever any Event listed above shall occur. The Company
hereby agrees with the Holder that it shall not increase the par value of the
Common Stock above its current par value of $0.0001 per share.

      10. CERTIFICATES OF ADJUSTMENTS; NOTICES.

                              require an adjustment in the number of shares of
                              Series C Preferred Stock issuable upon the
                              exercise of this Warrant or Exercise Price
                              pursuant to Sections 9(a), (b), (c), (d) or (e)

                              9(i);

then, and in each such case, the Company shall mail or cause to be mailed to the
Holder a notice specifying, as the case may be, (A) the date on which a record
is to be taken for the purpose of such dividend, and stating the amount and
character of such dividend, or (b) the date on which such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or

entitled to exchange their shares of Series C Preferred Stock (or such other
stock or securities at the time receivable upon exercise of this Warrant), for
securities or other property deliverable upon such reorganization,
reclassification, consolidation, merger, conveyance, dissolution, liquidation or
winding-up. Such notice shall be mailed at least 15 days prior to the date

                               Registration Rights

            3.1   Demand Registration. Subject to Section 3.2, if the
Shareholder notifies the Company in writing, which notice may not be delivered
prior to one year after the date hereof (the "Shareholder Request"), that it
wishes to offer or cause to be offered in a registered public offering the
number of Registrable Securities set forth in the Shareholder Request (a "Demand
Registration"), the Company agrees promptly within 60 days after receipt of the
Shareholder Request to prepare and file a registration statement on Form S-1,
S-2 or S-3, or any successor form under the Securities Act with the Commission
to register under the Securities Act all Registrable Securities requested to be
registered by the Shareholder, and to use its reasonable best efforts to have
such registration statement declared effective as promptly as practicable and
such efforts shall include the Company using all best efforts and taking every
action within its control to have such registration statement declared effective
within 150 days after receipt of the properly given Shareholder Request), as
would permit or facilitate the sale and distribution of the Registrable
Securities. So long as any Registrable Securities remain held by the Shareholder
and
                                        4

<PAGE>
the Shareholder is entitled to require a Demand Registration hereunder, the
Company shall use its reasonable best efforts to use Form S-3 or a successor
form thereof to effect the registration required hereunder. The Company shall
not be required to effect more than three (3) Demand Registrations pursuant to
this Section 3.1.

            3.2   Acceleration of Demand Registration. If at any time prior to
the first anniversary of the date of this Agreement the Company enters into a
definitive agreement with a third party to sell any radio stations that the
Company controls in the New York City or Miami markets, then the Shareholder
shall have the right to make a Demand Registration without regard to the
one-year period set forth in this first sentence of Section 3.1.

            3.3   Priority on Demand Registrations. If a Demand Registration is
an underwritten offering and the managing underwriters advise the Company in
writing that in their opinion the number of Registrable Securities exceeds the
number of Registrable Securities and other securities, if any, which can be sold
therein without adversely affecting the marketability of the offering, the
Company will include in such registration prior to the inclusion of any
securities which are not Registrable Securities the maximum number of
Registrable Securities requested to be included which in the opinion of such
underwriters can be sold without adversely affecting the marketability of the
offering. No holder of any Company security for which the Company has granted
registration rights (other than the Shareholder) shall have the right to
participate in any registration made by the Company pursuant to a Demand
Registration.

            3.4   Completion of Demand Registrations. Notwithstanding any other
provision of this Agreement to the contrary, a Demand Registration pursuant to
Section 3.1 shall not be deemed to have been effected (and, therefore, not
requested for purposes of the number of Demand Registrations), (i) unless it has
become effective, (ii) if after it has become effective such registration is
interfered with by any stop order, injunction or other order or requirement of
the Commission or other governmental agency or court for any reason other than a
misrepresentation or an omission by the Shareholder and, as a result thereof,
the Registrable Securities requested to be registered cannot be completely
distributed in accordance with the plan of distribution set forth in the related
registration statement or (iii) if the conditions to closing specified in any
purchase agreement or underwriting agreement entered into in connection with
such registration are not satisfied or waived other than by reason of some act
or omission by the Shareholder.

            3.5   Limitation on Registration Requirement. (a) The Company will
not be obligated to effect any Demand Registration within six (6) months after
the effective date of (i) a prior Demand Registration or (ii) a registration in
which the Shareholder was able to fully exercise their piggyback rights pursuant
to Section 3.6 without any reduction in the number of Registrable Securities
requested to be registered.

                  (b)   The Company shall have the right to postpone for up to
75 days the filing or the effectiveness of a registration statement for a Demand
Registration required pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof if the Board of Directors
of the Company determines in good faith (and the Company so certifies to the
Shareholder) that the filing of such registration statement would require the
disclosure of non-public material information the disclosure of which would have
a material adverse effect on the Company or would otherwise adversely affect (i)
any
                                        5

<PAGE>
proposal or plan by the Company or any of its Subsidiaries to engage in any
financing transaction, public offering of securities, acquisition of assets
(other than in the ordinary course of business) or any merger, consolidation,
tender offer or similar transaction, or (ii) any material corporate development;
provided, however, that the Company may not exercise its right to so delay a
registration pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof more than once in any twelve (12)
month period.

                  (c)   The Company shall not be obligated or required to effect
any registration pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof during the period commencing on
the date falling 90 days prior to the Company's estimated date of filing of, and
ending on the date 90 days following the effective date of, any underwritten
registration of Company common stock initiated by the Company, for the account
of the Company, if the Shareholder Request shall have been received by the
Company after the Company shall have advised the Shareholder of Registrable
Securities that the Company is contemplating commencing an underwritten
registration initiated by the Company on a particular date; provided, however,
that the Company will use reasonable efforts to cause any such registration to
be filed and to become effective as expeditiously as shall be reasonably
possible and that in no event shall the period during which the Company is not
required to effect registration under this Section 3.5(c) be longer than an
aggregate of 180 days within any twelve (12) month period.

            3.6   Piggyback Registrations. Whenever the Company proposes to
register any securities beneficially owned by Raul Alarcon, Jr. ("Alarcon")
under the Securities Act (including secondary registrations on behalf of
Alarcon's securities other than pursuant to a Demand Registration) and the
registration form to be used may be used for the registration of Registrable
Securities (a "Piggyback Registration"), the Company will give prompt written
notice to the Shareholder of its intention to effect such a registration and
will include in such registration all Registrable Securities with respect to
which the Company has received written requests (including the intended method
of distribution of Registrable Securities by the Shareholder) for inclusion
therein within fifteen (15) days after the receipt of the Company's notice.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, the piggyback registration
rights provided under this Section 3.6 shall not be available in connection with
registrations by the Company for its own account (i) on Form S-8 or any
successor form thereto, (ii) filed solely in connection with a dividend
reinvestment plan or employee benefit plan covering officers or directors of the
Company or its Affiliates, or (iii) on Form S-4 or any successor form thereto,
in connection with a merger, acquisition, exchange offer or similar corporate
transaction.

            3.7   Expenses of Piggyback Registrations. The Company will pay all
Registration Expenses of a Piggyback Registration, whether or not it becomes
effective.

            3.8   Priority on Piggyback Registrations. If a Piggyback
Registration is an underwritten secondary registration on behalf of Alarcon, and
the managing underwriters advise the Company in writing that in their opinion
the number of securities requested to be included in such registration exceeds
the number which can be sold in such offering without adversely affecting the
marketability of the offering (including the price per share), the Company will
include in such registration (i) FIRST, the securities the Company proposes to
sell for its own account, if any; (ii) SECOND, the securities the Company
proposes to sell on behalf of Alarcon; (iii) THIRD, the Registrable Securities
requested by the Shareholder to be included in such
                                        6

<PAGE>
registration; and (iii) FOURTH, other securities requested to be included in
such registration. No registration of Registrable Securities effected under
Section 3.6 shall relieve the Company of its obligation to effect
registration(s) of Registrable Securities pursuant to Section 3.1.

            3.9   Registration Procedures. If and whenever the Company is
required by the provisions of this Article III to effect a registration of the
Registrable Securities under the Securities Act, the Company will as promptly as
practicable but in any event within the time periods provided in this Agreement:

                  (a)   prepare and file with the Commission a registration
statement with respect to such Registrable Securities and use its reasonable
best efforts to cause such registration statement to become and remain effective
for the period of time required for the disposition of all such Registrable
Securities covered by the registration statement by the Shareholder;

                  (b)   prepare and file with the Commission all such amendments
and supplements to such registration statement and the prospectus used in
connection therewith as may be necessary to keep such registration statement
effective and to comply with the provisions of the Securities Act with respect
to the disposition of all Registrable Securities registered under such
registration statement until the earlier of (i) such time as all of such
Registrable Securities have been disposed of in accordance with the intended
methods of disposition set forth in such registration statement and (ii) two
years after such registration statement becomes effective, provided that such
period shall be extended by the number of days for which the Shareholder is
unable to make sales of Registrable Securities as a result of an event of the
type described in Section 3.9(i);

                  (c)   furnish to the Shareholder and to each duly authorized
underwriter of the Shareholder such number of conformed copies of such
registration statement and of each such amendment and supplement thereto (in
each case including all exhibits), authorized copies of the prospectus,
including copies of any preliminary prospectus, and of each such amendment or
supplement thereto, in conformity with the requirements of the Securities Act,
and such other documents as the Shareholder or underwriter may reasonably
request in order to facilitate the sale or other disposition of the Registrable
Securities registered under such registration statement;

                  (d)   use its reasonable best efforts to register or qualify
such Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement under such
securities or blue sky laws of such jurisdictions as the Shareholder or any
underwriter shall request, and do any and all other acts and things which may be
necessary under such securities or blue sky laws to enable the Shareholder to
consummate the sale or other disposition in such jurisdictions of the
Registrable Securities to be sold by the Shareholder, except that the Company
shall not for any such purpose be required to qualify to do business in any
jurisdiction wherein it is not qualified or to file any general consent to
service of process in any such jurisdiction;

                  (e)   before filing the registration statement or prospectus
or any amendments or supplements thereto or any other documents related thereto,
furnish to counsel selected by the Shareholder of Registrable Securities
included in such registration statement

                                        7

<PAGE>

copies of all such documents proposed to be filed, all of which shall be subject
to the reasonable approval of such counsel;

                  (f)   furnish, at the request of the Shareholder, (i) to the
underwriters, on the date(s) reasonably requested by such underwriters, an
opinion of the independent counsel representing the Company for the purposes of
such registration addressed to such underwriters and to such seller, in such
form and content as the underwriters and such seller may reasonably request, or
(ii) if such Registrable Securities are not being sold through underwriters,
then to the sellers, on the date that the registration statement with respect to
such Registrable Securities becomes effective, an opinion, dated such date, of
the independent counsel representing the Company for the purposes of such
registration in such form and content as such seller may reasonably request; and
in the case of clauses (i) and (ii) above, a letter dated such date, from the
independent certified public accountants of the Company addressed to the
underwriters, if any, and if such Registrable Securities are not being sold
through underwriters, then to the sellers and, if such accountants refuse to
deliver such letter to such sellers, then to the Company, stating that they are
independent certified public accountants within the meaning of the Securities
Act and that, in the opinion of such accountants, the financial statements and
other financial data of the Company included in the registration statement or
the prospectus, or any amendment or supplement thereto, comply as to form in all
material respects with the applicable accounting requirements of the Securities
Act and covering such other matters as are customarily covered in accountant's
"comfort" letters;

                  (g)   enter into customary agreements (including an
underwriting agreement in customary form) and take such other actions as are
reasonably required in order to expedite or facilitate the disposition of such
Registrable Securities;

                  (h)   provide and cause to be maintained a transfer agent and
registrar for all Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement
from and after a date not later than the effective date of such registration
statement;

                  (i)   promptly notify the Shareholder of Registrable
Securities included in such registration statement, (i) at any time when a
prospectus relating thereto is required to be delivered under the Securities
Act, of the happening of any event as a result of which the prospectus included
in such registration statement, as then in effect, includes an untrue statement
of a material fact or omits to state a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or incomplete
in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, (ii) of the
issuance by the Commission or any state securities authority of any stop order
suspending the effectiveness of a registration statement or the initiation or
proceedings for that purpose and (iii) of any request by the Commission or any
other regulatory body or other body having jurisdiction for any amendment of or
supplement to any registration statement or other document relating to such
offering, and in each such case, promptly prepare, file with the Commission as
required, and furnish to the Shareholder a reasonable number of copies of a
supplement to or an amendment to such prospectus and registration statement as
may be necessary so that, as thereafter delivered to purchasers of such
Registrable Securities, such prospectus shall not include an untrue statement of
a material fact or omit to state a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or incomplete in
light of the circumstances under which they were made;

                                        8

<PAGE>

                  (j)   use its commercially reasonable efforts to list all
Registrable Securities covered by such registration statement on any securities
exchange on which the shares of Class A Common Stock are then listed; and

                  (k)   otherwise use its commercially reasonable efforts to
comply with all applicable rules and regulations of the Commission, and make
available to its security holders, as soon as reasonably practicable, but not
later than 18 months after the effective date of the registration statement, an
earnings statement covering the period of at least twelve (12) months beginning
with the first full calendar month after the effective date of such registration
statement, which earnings statement shall satisfy the provisions of Section
11(a) of the Securities Act.

            3.10  Expenses. (a) All expenses incurred in effecting the
registrations provided for in this Article III (excluding Selling Expenses),
including without limitation all registration and filing fees (including all
expenses incident to filing with the NASD Regulation, Inc. and any securities
exchange), printing expenses, fees and disbursements of counsel for the Company,
fees of the Company's independent auditors and accountants, expenses of any
audits incident to or required by any such registration and expenses of
complying with the securities or blue sky laws of any jurisdictions pursuant to
subsection 3.9(d) hereof, underwriters (excluding discounts and commissions,
which shall be borne by the seller(s) of securities) and other Persons retained
by the Company (all such expenses being herein called "Registration Expenses"),
will be borne as provided in this Agreement, except that the Company will, in
any event, pay its internal expenses (including, without limitation, all
salaries and expenses of its officers and employees performing legal or
accounting duties), the expense of any annual audit or quarterly review, the
expense of any liability insurance and the expenses and fees for listing the
securities to be registered on each securities exchange on which similar
securities issued by the Company are then listed or on the NASD automated
quotation system (on the National Market System if the Company so qualifies).
The Company shall have no obligation to pay any transfer taxes associated with
the disposition of Registrable Securities by a holder thereof.

                  (b)   In connection with the first Demand Registration, the
Company will pay all Registration Expenses, whether or not it becomes effective,
and will reimburse the Shareholder for the reasonable fees and disbursements of
one counsel to the Shareholder in connection with the Demand Registration;
provided, however, that the Company shall not be required to pay for any
expenses of any Demand Registration proceeding begun pursuant to Section 3.1 if
the Demand Registration request is subsequently withdrawn at the request of the
Shareholder, in which case the Shareholder shall bear all such expenses, and,
provided further, that if at the time of such withdrawal, the Shareholder has
learned of a material adverse change in the condition, business, or prospects of
the Company from that known to such Shareholder at the time of its request and
has withdrawn the request with reasonable promptness, then the Shareholder shall
not be required to pay any of such expenses and shall retain their rights
pursuant to Section 3.10.

                  (c)   In connection with the second and third Demand
Registrations, the Shareholder will pay all Registration Expenses, whether or
not the registration statement becomes effective, and the Shareholder will
reimburse the Company for the reasonable fees and disbursements of the Company's
regular outside corporate counsel for performance of the

                                        9

<PAGE>

normal and customary functions of counsel in connection with the second and
third Demand Registrations.

                  (d)   All Selling Expenses in connection with each Demand
Registration shall be borne by the Shareholder.

            3.11  Time Limitations; Termination of Rights. Notwithstanding the
foregoing provisions of this Article III, the rights to registration shall
terminate as to any particular Registrable Securities when (i) such Registrable
Securities shall have been effectively registered under the Securities Act and
sold by the Shareholder thereof in accordance with such registration, (ii) such
Registrable Securities shall have been sold in compliance with Rule 144
promulgated under the Securities Act, or (iii) written opinions from counsel
reasonably acceptable to the Company and the holder of such Registrable
Securities, to the effect that such Registrable Securities may be sold without
registration under the Securities Act or applicable state law and without
restriction as to the volume and timing of such sales, shall have been received
from either counsel to the Company or counsel to the Shareholder; provided, that
so long as any Registrable Securities are held by the Shareholder, the
Shareholder shall be entitled to one (1) Demand Registration to be used to
effect an underwritten offering of such number of Registrable Securities as the
Shareholder may request; provided further that the Shareholder shall pay all
Registration Expenses in connection with such Demand Registration.

            3.12  Compliance with Rule 144. At the request of the Shareholder of
Registrable Securities proposing to sell Registrable Securities in compliance
with Rule 144 promulgated under the Securities Act, assuming that at such time
the provisions of such Rule are applicable to the Shareholder and, in the event
the Shareholder is or could be deemed to be an "affiliate" of the Company within
the meaning of the Securities Act, and the Company is then required to file
reports under Section 13 or 15(d) of the Exchange Act, (a) the Company shall
forthwith furnish to the Shareholder a written statement as to its compliance
with the filing requirements of the Commission as set forth in such Rule, as
such Rule may be amended from time to time, and (b) the Company shall use its
best efforts and take every action within its control to make such additional
filings of reports with the Commission as will enable the Shareholder to make
sales of Registrable Securities pursuant to such Rule. At all times during which
this Agreement is effective, the Company shall use its best efforts and take
every action within its control to file with the Commission and, if applicable,
The Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. ("Nasdaq"), in a timely manner, all reports and
other documents required to be filed by the Company, (i) with the Commission
pursuant to the Exchange Act, and (ii) with Nasdaq pursuant to its rules and
regulations.

            3.13  Company's Indemnification. In the case of each offering of
Registrable Securities, the Company hereby agrees to indemnify and hold harmless
the Shareholder, each Person, if any, who controls the Shareholder within the
meaning of Section 15 of the Securities Act and each other Person (including
each underwriter and each Person who controls such underwriter) who participates
in the offering of Registrable Securities, against any losses, claims, damages
or liabilities, joint or several, to which the Shareholder, controlling person
or participating person may become subject under the Securities Act or
otherwise, against any and all losses, claims, damages or liabilities (or
proceedings in respect thereof) that arise out of or are based upon any untrue
statement or alleged untrue statement of any material fact contained in

                                       10

<PAGE>
any registration statement under which the Registrable Securities are registered
under the Securities Act, in any preliminary prospectus or final prospectus
contained therein, or in any amendment or supplement thereto, or document
incorporated by reference therein or arise out of or are based upon the omission
or alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated
therein or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, and will
reimburse the Shareholder, the controlling person and participating person for
any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred in connection with investigating
or defending any such loss, claim, damage, liability or proceeding; provided,
however, that the Company will not be liable in any case to the Shareholder, the
controlling Person or participating Person to the extent that any loss, claim,
damage or liability results from any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission made in such registration statement,
preliminary or final prospectus or amendment or supplement in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by an instrument
duly executed by the Shareholder or any other person who participates as an
underwriter in the offering or sale of such securities, in either case,
specifically stating that it is for use in the preparation thereof or
controlling or participating person, as the case may be, specifically stating
that it is for use in the preparation of such document. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Shareholder disposing of Registrable Securities or any such
underwriter or controlling person and shall survive the transfer of such
securities by the Shareholder and the expiration or termination of this
Agreement.

            3.14  Indemnification by the Shareholder. (a) In the case of each
offering of Registrable Securities, the Shareholder agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless (in the same manner as set forth in Section 3.13 above) the Company,
each Person referred to in clause (1), (2) or (3) of Section 11(a) of the
Securities Act (except if such Person is also a selling shareholder under such
registration) in respect of the registration statement, and each other Person,
if any, who controls the Company within the meaning of Section 15 the Securities
Act (except if such Person is also a selling shareholder under such
registration), with respect to any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement
of any material fact contained in the registration statement under which the
Registrable Securities are registered under the Securities Act, in any
preliminary prospectus or final prospectus contained therein or in any amendment
or supplement thereto, or that arises out of or is based upon the omission or
alleged omission to state therein a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading, which, in each case,
is made in or omitted from the registration statement, preliminary or final
prospectus or amendment or supplement in reliance upon and in conformity with
written information furnished to the Company by an instrument duly executed by
the Shareholder specifically for use in the preparation thereof; provided,
however, that the indemnification obligations of the Shareholder shall be
limited to the net proceeds received by the Shareholder from the sale of
Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration. Such indemnity shall
remain in full force and effect regardless of any investigation made by or on
behalf of the Company or any person indemnified by virtue of this Section 3.14
and shall survive the transfer of such securities by the Shareholder and the
expiration or termination of this Agreement. In the case of an offering made
pursuant to this Agreement with respect to which the Company has designated the
lead or managing underwriters (or the Company is offering securities directly,
without an underwriter), this indemnity does not apply to any loss, claim,
damage or liability arising out of or related to any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement or omission or alleged omission in any preliminary prospectus
or offering memorandum if a copy
                                       11

<PAGE>
of a final prospectus or offering memorandum was not sent or given by or on
behalf of any underwriter (or the Company, as the case may be) to such Person
asserting such loss, claim, damage or liability at or prior to the written
confirmation of the sale of the Registrable Securities as required by the
Securities Act and such untrue statement or omission has been corrected in such
final prospectus or offering memorandum.

            3.15  Contribution. If the indemnification provided for in Section
3.13 or 3.14 from the indemnifying party is unavailable to an indemnified party
hereunder, or is insufficient to hold harmless an indemnified party, in respect
of any losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses referred to therein,
then the indemnifying party, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party,
shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a
result of such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses in such
proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the indemnifying
party and indemnified parties in connection with the actions which resulted in
such losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses, as well as any other
relevant equitable considerations. The relative fault of such indemnifying party
and indemnified parties shall be determined by reference to, among other things,
whether any action in question, including any untrue statement or alleged untrue
statement of a material fact or omission or alleged omission to state a material
fact, has been made by, or relates to information supplied by, such indemnifying
party or indemnified parties, and the parties' relative intent, knowledge,
access to information and opportunity to correct or prevent such untrue
statement or omission, provided that the maximum amount of the Shareholder's
contribution shall be limited to the net proceeds received by the Shareholder
from the sale of Registrable Securities pursuant to such registration. The
amount paid or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages, liabilities and expenses referred to above shall be deemed to
include any legal or other fees or expenses reasonably incurred by such party in
connection with any investigation or proceeding.

            The parties hereto agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contribution pursuant to this Section 3.15 were determined by pro rata
allocation or by any other method of allocation which does not take account of
the equitable considerations referred to in the immediately preceding paragraph.
No Person guilty of fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section
11(f) of the Securities Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any
indemnifying party who was not guilty of such fraudulent misrepresentation.

            3.16  Notification of and Participation in Actions. Promptly after
receipt by an indemnified party under this Article III of oral or written notice
of a claim or the commencement of any proceeding against it, such indemnified
party shall, if a claim in respect thereof is to be made against an indemnifying
party under such Article, give written notice to the indemnifying party of the
commencement thereof, but the failure so to notify the indemnifying party shall
not relieve it of any liability that it may have to any indemnified party except
to the extent the indemnifying party demonstrates that the defense of such
action is prejudiced thereby. In case any such proceeding shall be brought
against an indemnified party and it shall give notice to the indemnifying party
of the commencement thereof, the indemnifying party shall be entitled to
participate therein and, to the extent that it shall wish (unless the
indemnifying party is also a party to such proceeding and the indemnified party
determines in good faith that joint representation would be inappropriate) to
assume the defense thereof with counsel reasonably satisfactory to such
indemnified party and, after notice from the indemnifying party to such

                                       12

<PAGE>
indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall not be liable to such indemnified party under such
Article for any fees of other counsel or any other expenses with respect to the
defense of such proceeding, in each case, subsequently incurred by such
indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof. If an indemnifying
party assumes the defense of such proceeding, (a) no compromise or settlement
thereof may be effected by the indemnifying party without the indemnified
party's reasonable consent unless (i) there is no finding or admission of any
violation of law or any violation of the rights of any Person and no effect on
any other claims that may be made against the indemnified party and (ii) the
sole relief provided is monetary damages that are paid in full by the
indemnifying party, and (b) the indemnifying party shall have no liability with
respect to any compromise or settlement thereof effected without its consent,
which shall not be unreasonably withheld. If notice is given to an indemnifying
party of the commencement of any proceeding and it does not, within fifteen (15)
business days after the indemnified party's notice is given, give notice to the
indemnified party of its election to assume the defense thereof, the
indemnifying party shall be bound by any determination made in such action or
any compromise or settlement thereof effected by the indemnified party.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an indemnified party determines in good faith
that there is a reasonable probability that a proceeding may adversely affect it
or its affiliates other than as a result of monetary damages, such indemnified
party may, by notice to the indemnifying party, assume the exclusive right to
defend, compromise or settle such proceeding, but the indemnifying party shall
not be bound by any determination of a proceeding so defended or any compromise
or settlement thereof effected without its consent (which shall not be
unreasonably withheld). All indemnification obligations of the parties hereto
shall survive any termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 3.13 hereof.

            3.17  Furnish Information. It shall be a condition precedent to the
obligations of the Company to take any action pursuant to Article III that the
Shareholder requesting registration of Registrable Securities furnish to the
Company such information regarding them, the Registrable Securities held by them
and the intended method of disposition of such securities as the Company shall
reasonably request and as shall be required in connection with the action to be
taken by the Company. In the event that the registration under Article III
involves an underwritten offering, the Company agrees to provide such
information to the underwriters as they may reasonably request in connection
with their due diligence procedures.

            3.18  Transfer of Registration Right. The Shareholder may transfer
all or any portion of the registration rights granted under Article III to an
Affiliate in respect of Registrable Securities owned by the Shareholder at the
time of the transfer (each such Affiliate that receives such Registrable
Securities being referred to herein as a "Transferee"). Any transfer of
registration rights pursuant to this Section 3.18 shall be effective upon the
receipt by the Company of (i) written notice from the Shareholder stating the
name and address of such Transferee and identifying the number of Registrable
Securities with respect to which rights under this Agreement are being
transferred and the nature of the rights so transferred and (ii) a written
agreement from such Transferee to be bound by the terms of this Article III and
Sections 4.2, 4.4, 4.6 and 4.7 of this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                                  Miscellaneous

            4.1   No Inconsistent Agreements. The Company will not, at any time
after the effective date of this Agreement, enter into, and is not now a party
to or otherwise bound by, any agreement or contract (whether written or oral)
with respect to any of its securities which is inconsistent in any respect with
the registration rights granted by the Company pursuant to this Agreement.

            4.2   Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire
agreement of the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof and
supersedes all prior agreements and undertakings, both written and oral, between
the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof.

            4.3   Notices. Notices and other communications provided for herein
shall be in writing and shall be given in the manner and with the effect
provided in the Merger Agreement. Such notices and communications shall be
addressed if to the Shareholder of Registrable Securities, to its address as
shown on the transfer records of the Company, unless the Shareholder shall
notify the Company that notices and communications should be sent to a different
address (or facsimile number), in which case notices and communications shall be
sent to the address (or such facsimile number) specified by the Shareholder.

            4.4   Waivers; Amendments. No failure or delay of the Shareholder of
Registrable Securities in exercising any power or right hereunder shall operate
as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of any such right
or power, or any abandonment or discontinuance of steps to enforce such a right
or power, preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the exercise of any
other right or power. The rights and remedies of the Shareholder are cumulative
and not exclusive of any rights or remedies which it would otherwise have. The
provisions of this Agreement may be amended, modified or waived only by an
agreement in writing and any such waiver shall be effective only in the specific
instance and for the purpose for which given. Notwithstanding the foregoing, no
amendment, modification or waiver of any provision of this Agreement shall be
effective against the Shareholder of Registrable Securities unless (a) agreed to
in writing by the Shareholder or (b) agreed to in writing by the Shareholder's
predecessor in interest and notation thereof is set forth on the certificate
evidencing the Shareholder's Registrable Securities as the case may be. No
notice or demand on the Company in any case shall entitle the Company to any
other or further notice or demand in similar or other circumstances.

            4.5   Specific Performance. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that irreparable damage would occur in the event that any of the provisions of
this Agreement were not performed in accordance with their specific terms or
were otherwise breached. Accordingly, it is agreed that they shall be entitled
to an injunction or injunctions to prevent breaches of the provisions of this
Agreement and to enforce specifically the terms and provision hereof in any
court of competent jurisdiction in the United States or any state thereof, in
addition to any other remedy to which they may be entitled at law or equity.

            4.6   Governing Law. This Agreement shall be governed by and
construed in accordance with the laws of the State of New York. Each of the
parties hereto agrees that any dispute relating to or arising from this
Agreement or the transactions contemplated hereby may be resolved in the courts
of the State of New York sitting in the County of New York or the United States
District Court for the Southern District of New York and the appellate courts
having jurisdiction of appeals in such courts. In that context, and without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, each of the parties hereby irrevocably
and unconditionally:

                  (a)   submits for itself and its property in any legal suit,
action or proceeding relating to this Agreement or any transaction contemplated
hereby, or for recognition and enforcement of any judgment in respect thereof,
to the nonexclusive jurisdiction of the courts of the State of New York sitting
in the County of New York or the United States District Court for the Southern
District of New York and appellate courts having jurisdiction of appeals in such
courts, and each of the parties hereto irrevocably and unconditionally agrees
that all claims in respect of any such suit, action, or proceeding may be heard
and determined in such New York State court or, to the extent permitted by law,
in such federal court;

                  (b)   consents that any such suit, action or proceeding may be
brought in such courts and waives any objection that it may now or hereafter
have to the venue or jurisdiction of any such action or proceeding in such court
or that such action or proceeding was brought in an inconvenient forum and
agrees not to plead or claim the same;

                  (c)   agrees that service of process in any such action or
proceeding may be effected by mailing a copy thereof by registered or certified
mail (or any substantially similar form of mail), postage prepaid, to such party
as provided in Section 4.3 hereof; and

                  (d)   agrees that nothing herein shall affect the right to
effect service of process in any other manner permitted by New York law.

            4.7   Successors and Assigns. This Agreement shall be binding upon,
and shall inure to the benefit of, the parties hereto and their respective
successors and assigns. Nothing contained in this Agreement, express or implied,
is intended to confer upon any other person or entity any benefits, rights or
remedies.

            4.8   Severability. In case any one or more of the provisions
contained in this Agreement shall be invalid, illegal or unenforceable in any
respect, the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions
contained herein and therein shall not in any way be affected or impaired
thereby. The parties shall endeavor in good faith negotiations to replace the
invalid, illegal or unenforceable provisions with valid provisions the economic
effect of which comes as close as possible to that of the invalid, illegal or
unenforceable provisions.

            4.9   Section Headings. The section headings used herein are for
convenience of reference only, are not part of this Agreement and are not to

executed in two or more counterparts, all of which shall be considered one and
the same agreement, and shall become effective when one or more counterparts
have been signed by each of the parties and delivered (by facsimile or
otherwise) to the other parties, it being understood that all parties need not
sign the same counterpart. Any counterpart or other signature hereupon delivered
by facsimile shall be deemed for all purposes as constituting good and valid
execution and delivery of this Agreement by such party.

            4.12  Descriptive Headings. The descriptive headings of this
Agreement are inserted for convenience only and do not constitute a part of this
Agreement.

            4.13  Further Agreements. The parties agree that they will execute
any further instruments and perform any acts that may become necessary or
desirable to carry out this Agreement.
