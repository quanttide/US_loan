The Employer, in its discretion, may make Discretionary Employer Contributions to the extent determined by the Employer prior to the beginning of the Plan Year for which the Discretionary Employer Contribution is to be made. The amount of any Discretionary Employer Contribution for a Plan Year shall be communicated to all Eligible Employees prior to March 15 of such Plan Year. The Employer, in its discretion, may increase or decrease the rate of Discretionary Employer Contributions (or eliminate Discretionary Employer Contributions) from year to year by advising Eligible Employees prior to the first day of the applicable Plan Year. Such Employer Contribution (a) shall be treated as deferred amounts under Article 7; and, (b) shall be allocated among the Eligible Employees on the basis determined by the Employer. </P>
<P>ARTICLE 6.&nbsp;&nbsp;FORFEITABILITY</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Vesting for Deferrals of Compensation</U>. Except as provided in&nbsp;this Article, all amounts credited to an Eligible Employee's Account that relate to Compensation which the Eligible Employee elected to defer under the Plan pursuant to Article 4 and that relate to Discretionary Employer Contributions deferred under the Plan pursuant to Section 5.1 are fully vested and nonforfeitable.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Accounts of Eligible Employees</U>. The Accounts of Eligible Employees and any earnings thereon, shall be held separate and apart from other funds of the Company and shall be used exclusively for the uses and purposes of the Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, and/or general creditors of the Company, as the case may be, as herein set forth. The Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries shall have no preferred claim on, or any beneficial ownership interest in, any assets contained in their Accounts. Any rights created under the Plan shall be mere unsecured contractual rights of the Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, against the Company. Any assets held in Eligible Employees Accounts will be subject to the claims of the Company's general creditors under federal and state law in the event of Insolvency, as defi
ned herein. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 6.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Responsibility Regarding Payments When Company is Insolvent</U>.</P>
<P>(a.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Employer shall cease payment of benefits to the Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, if the Company is Insolvent. The Company shall be considered "Insolvent" for purposes of this Plan if (i) the Company is unable to pay its debts as they become due, or (ii) the Company is subject to a pending proceeding as a debtor under the United States Bankruptcy Code.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">8</P>
<P>(b.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At all times during the continuance of this Plan the assets and income of Eligible Employees Accounts shall be subject to claims of general creditors of the Company</P>
<P>under federal and state law and the Committees' responsibility regarding a determination of Insolvency and payment of benefits shall be governed by the following procedures:</P><DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>
<DIR>

<P>(i)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Board of Directors and the Chief Executive Officer of the Company shall have the duty to inform the Committee in writing of the Company's Insolvency. If a person claiming to be a creditor of the Company alleges in writing to the Committee that the Company has become Insolvent, the Committee shall determine whether the Company is Insolvent and, pending such determination, the Committee shall discontinue payment of benefits to the Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be.</P>
<P>(ii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless the Committee shall have actual knowledge of the Company's Insolvency or have written notice from the Company or a person claiming to be a creditor alleging in writing, that the Company is Insolvent, the Committee shall have no duty to inquire whether the Company is Insolvent. The Committee may, in all events, rely on such evidence concerning the Company's solvency as may be furnished to the Committee and that provides the Committee with a reasonable basis for making a determination concerning the Company's solvency.</P>
<P>(iii)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If, at any time, the Committee has determined that the Company is Insolvent, the Committee shall discontinue payments to Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, and shall hold the assets of the Eligible Employees Accounts for the benefit of the Company's general creditors. Nothing in this Plan shall in any way diminish any rights of the Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, to pursue their rights as general creditors of the Company with respect to benefits due under this Plan or otherwise.</P>
<P>(iv)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Committee shall resume payment of benefits to the Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, only after the Committee has determined that the Company is not Insolvent (or is no longer Insolvent).</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Provided that there are sufficient assets, if the Committee discontinues the </P>
<P>payment of benefits from the Eligible Employees Accounts and subsequently resumes such payments, the first payment following such discontinuance shall include the aggregate amount of all payments due to the Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, under the terms of the Plan for the period of such discontinuance, less the aggregate amount of any payments made to Eligible Employees and/or their beneficiaries, as the case may be, by the Company in lieu of the payments provided hereunder during any period of discontinuance. </P>

<P>ARTICLE 7.&nbsp;&nbsp;STATUS OF DEFERRED AMOUNTS</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Account</U>. The Employer shall establish an Account for each Eligible Employee, with sub-accounts for deferrals of Compensation and Employer Contributions for which a Deferral Election has been made. The Eligible Employee's Deferred Compensation for a Plan Year shall be credited to the Account of the Eligible Employee, in the case of deferrals of Compensation, on the last day of the calendar month in which it otherwise would have been payable to the Eligible Employee if he or she had not made the Deferral Election, or in the case of Employer Discretionary Contributions, no later than March 15 of the Plan Year. </P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Report of Account Balance</U>. The Committee shall advise each Eligible Employee of the balance in his or her Account including each sub-account on a quarterly basis on dates to be determined by the Committee.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 7.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Treatment under Other Employee Benefit Plans</U>. It is intended that the amounts deferred by an Eligible Employee under Article 4 and Article 5 shall at the earliest time permitted by applicable law be included in determining benefits under any pay-related employee benefit plans of the Employer, as well as under any tax-qualified retirement plans (to the extent permitted in such plans), except to the extent that such inclusion in any such pay-related or tax-qualified plan would adversely affect the tax-favored status of that plan.</P>
<P>ARTICLE 8.&nbsp;&nbsp;DISTRIBUTIONS</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8.1&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Timing of Distributions</U>.

The definition of "change in control" as set forth in this subsection shall be modified to the extent required so that such definition shall comply with the definition of "change in control" set forth in final regulations issued under Section 409A of the Code. </P>
<P>(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the termination of the Eligible Employee's employment with the Employer for any reason; or</P>
<P>(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;the Eligible Employee's death.</P></DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>
</DIR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8.2&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Form of Distributions</U>. An Eligible Employee shall designate on his or her Deferral Election Form, the form of the Distribution to be made to such Eligible Employee and/or his or her beneficiary. Such designation may not be changed once it has been made. With respect to the commencement date for the payment of any distribution under this Plan, the date specified in the Deferral Election Form filed with the Committee shall control except that in the event a distribution is to be made due to the separation of the Eligible Employee from service with the Employer, as set forth under Section 8.1(b) no distribution may commence until the beginning of the 7<SUP>th</SUP> month from the date of such separation.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Designation of Beneficiary</U>. Each Eligible Employee must designate at least one individual or other entity as a beneficiary of the Eligible Employee's account balance in the event of the Eligible Employee's death. The Eligible Employee may also designate one or more contingent beneficiaries. These designations must be made on a properly completed and executed beneficiary designation form and must be filed with the Committee. This form may be changed at any time and from time to time by the Committee. If a designated beneficiary does not survive the Eligible Employee, then the beneficiary shall be the Eligible Employee's estate.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8.4&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Claims Procedure</U>. The Committee shall in writing notify any Eligible Employee or beneficiary whose claim for benefits under the Plan has been denied, either wholly or in part, setting forth the specific reasons for the denial in a manner calculated to be understood by the Eligible Employee or beneficiary. The notice shall be furnished to the Eligible Employee or beneficiary within 60 days of the denial and shall provide that, within 60 days after receiving the notice, the Eligible Employee or beneficiary may apply to the Committee for a full and fair review of the decision denying the claim. All decisions on review shall be final.</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8.5&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Excise Tax</U>. To the extent any payment under the Plan would be subject to the tax (the "Excise Tax") imposed by Section 4999 of the Code (or any similar tax that may hereafter be imposed) because it would constitute an "excess parachute payment" as defined in Section 280G(b) of the Code, the amount of the payment shall be reduced by such amount as shall be necessary to avoid the imposition of the Excise Tax.</P>
<P ALIGN="CENTER">11</P>
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Section 8.6&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Emergency Withdrawals From the Plan</U>.</P>
<P>(a.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Notification of Committee</U>. If a participating Eligible Employee suffers an unforeseeable Emergency and wishes to receive an Emergency Withdrawal from the Plan, the participating Eligible Employee shall notify the Committee in writing of the occurrence of the Unforeseeable Emergency. The participating Eligible Employee shall provide a description of the Unforeseeable Emergency and a description of his or her assets (including an indication of the extent to which the liquidation of each asset would cause a severe financial hardship, if applicable). The participating Eligible Employee shall also indicate whether he or she will be reimbursed or compensated by insurance or otherwise.</P>
<P>(b.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Committee Determination</U>. Within ninety (90) days after the Committee's receipt of a notification pursuant to Section 8.6(a.), the Committee shall determine, in its sole discretion, whether the participating Eligible Employee has suffered an Unforeseeable Emergency and, if so, the amount, if any, to be distributed to the Eligible Employee as an Emergency Withdrawal as a result of such Unforeseeable Emergency. An Emergency Withdrawal may not exceed the amount necessary to satisfy such Emergency (plus an amount to pay taxes reasonably anticipated as a result of the distribution). An Emergency Withdrawal may not be made to the extent that the Eligible Employee's severe financial hardship resulting from the Unforeseeable Emergency is or may be relieved (i) through reimbursement or compensation by insurance or otherwise, (ii) by liquidation of the Eligible Employee's assets, to the extent liquidation of such assets would not itself cause severe financial hardship, or (ii
i) by cessation of Contributions under this Plan as may be approved by the Committee, in its sole discretion.</P>
<P>(c. )&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Effect of Emergency Withdrawals</U>. The Accrued Balance in a participating Eligible Employees Account shall be reduced by the amount of any Emergency Withdrawals distributed to the participating Eligible Employee. The Committee, in its sole discretion, shall determine which of the participating Eligible Employees sub-accounts shall be so reduced. In making such determination, the Committee may, but is not required to, take into account the participating Eligible Employees preferences as to which of the participating Eligible Employees sub-accounts should be reduced.</P>
<P>(d.)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<U>Unforeseeable Emergency</U>. For purposes of this Plan, an Unforeseeable Emergency means a severe financial hardship to the Eligible Employee resulting from an illness or an accident to the Eligible Employee, his or her spouse, or his or her dependent (as defined in Section 152(a) of the Code), loss of the Eligible Employee's property due to casualty or other similar extraordinary and unforeseeable circumstances arising as a result of events beyond the control of the Eligible Employee.</P>

Depending upon the timing of the withholding requirement, the Employer may withhold such taxes from other Compensation payable to the Eligible Employee.</P>

(the "Company") considers the maintenance of a vital management group to be essential to protecting and enhancing the best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Company's board of directors recognizes your importance to the success of the Company and that you serve without an employment contract and has determined that appropriate steps should be taken: (a) to reinforce and encourage<STRIKE>-</STRIKE>your continued attention and dedication <STRIKE>-</STRIKE>to your assigned duties without distraction in the face of the potentially disturbing circumstances arising from the possibility of a change in control of the Company; and (b) to dispel any concerns that you may have about taking an active part in the defense against an inappropriate attempt to bring about a change in control of the Company.</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I want to confirm our agreement concerning the benefits which the Company will provide to you in the event your employment with the Company is terminated subsequent to a change in control of the Company, as follows:</P>
<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Employment.

Except as specifically changed by this agreement, all terms and conditions of your current employment agreement with the Company shall remain in full force.</P>
