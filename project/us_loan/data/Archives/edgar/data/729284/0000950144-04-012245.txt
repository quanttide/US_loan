<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;2.02 Results of Operations and Financial Condition.</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;7, 2004, McRae Industries, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) announced that it was conducting a
review of its previously reported financial statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 as a
result of clerical errors in the calculation of inventory discovered
by management at the Company&#146;s
military boot unit, that the Company&#146;s previously reported financial statements for the fiscal year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 should no longer be relied upon pending the outcome of the review and that
following the completion of the review the Company would amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for
the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission to
restate its previously reported fiscal 2004 financial statements. In this announcement, the
Company also disclosed that the Company did not expect to be able to file its Form 10-Q for the
first quarter of fiscal 2005, which was due on December&nbsp;14, 2004, until it completed its review of
the accounting for inventory in the financial statements for fiscal 2004, and that as a result, the
Company expected to file a Form 12b-25 Notification of Late Filing with respect to such Form 10-Q.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Taking into account the
extended filing deadline, the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October&nbsp;30, 2004 is due
today. However, because the Company and its independent accountants have not yet concluded their
review, as a result of which the Company has not yet been able to file a Form 10-K/A to amend its
financial statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, the Company is not yet in a position
to file the Form 10-Q. As soon as practicable following the completion of the review which is
expected no later than December 23, 2004, the Company will amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 to reflect the restatement and file the Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended October&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;20, 2004 and
although the Company&#146;s review is continuing, the Company
announced the results of its preliminary review of its inventory at July&nbsp;31, 2004. The results of this review
and the Company&#146;s consolidated net revenues from continuing
operations and consolidated net earnings from continuing operations for the first fiscal
quarter of 2005, which are dependent in part on the amount of the
Company&#146;s adjusted fiscal 2004&nbsp;year-end
inventory as determined based on the completion of the Company&#146;s preliminary review, are
described in a press release from the Company which is attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 and
incorporated herein by reference.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>MCRAE INDUSTRIES, INC. ANNOUNCES COMPLETION OF PRELIMINARY REVIEW<BR>
OF ITS INVENTORY AS OF JULY 31, 2004 AND DELAY IN FILING OF<BR>
FORM 10-Q FOR THE FIRST 2005 FISCAL QUARTER</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mount Gilead, N.C. &#150; December&nbsp;20, 2004. McRae Industries, Inc. (MRI.A and MRI.B on the
American Stock Exchange) announced today that it has completed its preliminary review of its
inventory at July&nbsp;31, 2004, the last day of the company&#146;s 2004 fiscal year. The company previously
announced that it was conducting a review of its previously reported financial statements for the
fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 as a result of clerical errors in the calculation of inventory
discovered by management at the company&#146;s military boot unit, that the company&#146;s previously
reported financial statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 should no longer be relied
upon pending the outcome of the review and that following the completion of the review the company
would amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 previously filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to restate its previously reported fiscal 2004
financial statements. In this announcement, the company also disclosed that the company
did not expect to be able to file its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005, which was due
on December&nbsp;14, 2004, until it completed its review of the accounting for inventory in the
financial statements for fiscal 2004, and that as a result, the company expected to file a Form
12b-25 Notification of Late Filing with respect to such Form 10-Q.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Taking into account the extension of the filing deadline afforded the company under Rule&nbsp;12b-25
based on the filing of the Form 12b-25, the Form 10-Q for the quarter ended October&nbsp;30, 2004 is due
today. However, because the company and its independent accountants have not yet concluded their
review, as a result of which the company has not yet been able to file a Form 10-K/A to amend its
financial statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, the company is not yet in a position
to file the Form 10-Q. As soon as practicable following the completion of the review which is
expected no later than December 23, 2004, the company will amend its Annual Report on Form 10-K
for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 to reflect the restatement and file the Form 10-Q
for the quarter ended October&nbsp;30, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Although the company&#146;s review is continuing, the company&#146;s preliminary review indicates that its
inventory was overstated and the related cost of revenues was understated by approximately
$929,000 for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 as compared to
an understatement of $1,044,000 previously announced based on the
company&#146;s preliminary assessment. As a result, the
company currently expects net earnings from continuing operations will be
approximately $3,206,000 for
the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, as opposed to net earnings from continuing operations of
$3,740,000 as previously reported in the company&#146;s
Form&nbsp;10-K filed on October&nbsp;29, 2004 and as compared to net
earnings from continuing operations of $3,128,000 previously
announced based on the company&#146;s preliminary assessment. The company&#146;s review is not yet completed, and revisions to the
amount could arise as a result of the ongoing review.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Based in part on the adjusted amount of the company&#146;s fiscal 2004&nbsp;year-end inventory as determined by the
company based the completion of its preliminary review, the
company&#146;s consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for
the first quarter of fiscal 2005 amounted to $20,434,000, compared to consolidated net revenues
from continuing operations of $16,023,000 reported for the first
quarter of fiscal 2004 and its

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">consolidated net earnings
from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 were

The company&#146;s review of its fiscal 2004&nbsp;year-end inventory is not yet complete and these results
are subject to change in the event that the continuing review by the company and its independent
auditors should reveal a need to make any additional adjustments.

differ materially from those projected, estimated, assumed or anticipated in any such
forward-looking statements include: the results of the ongoing review, the impact of the expected

review and anticipated restatement.
