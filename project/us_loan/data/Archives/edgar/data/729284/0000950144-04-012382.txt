<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On December&nbsp;23, 2004, McRae Industries, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) announced that it had completed its
previously announced review of its financial statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004,
had amended its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 previously filed
with the Securities and Exchange Commission to restate its fiscal 2004 financial statements and had
filed its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005. As previously disclosed, the review and
restatement were necessitated by the discovery of clerical errors in the calculation of inventory
at the Company&#146;s military boot unit.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The results of this review and the Company&#146;s results from continuing operations for the first
fiscal quarter of 2005 are described in a press release from the Company which is attached hereto
as Exhibit&nbsp;99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>MCRAE INDUSTRIES, INC. ANNOUNCES COMPLETION OF REVIEW OF<BR>
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED JULY 31, 2004 AND<BR>
EARNINGS REPORT FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005<BR>
ENDED OCTOBER 30, 2004</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Mount Gilead, N.C. &#150; December&nbsp;23, 2004. McRae Industries, Inc. (MRI.A and MRI.B on the
American Stock Exchange) announced today that it had completed its review of its financial
statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 and had amended its Annual Report on
Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 previously filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission to restate its fiscal 2004 financial statements. The company previously announced that
it was conducting a review of its previously reported financial statements for the fiscal year
ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 as a result of clerical errors in the calculation of inventory discovered by
management at the company&#146;s military boot unit, that the company&#146;s previously reported financial
statements for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 should no longer be relied upon pending the
outcome of the review and that following the completion of the review the company would amend its
Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 to restate its previously
reported fiscal 2004 financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Consistent with the preliminary review results announced by the company on December&nbsp;20, 2004, the
company&#146;s completed review indicates that its inventory was overstated and the related cost of
revenues was understated by approximately $929,000 for the fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004. As a
result, the company&#146;s net earnings from continuing operations were approximately $3,206,000 for the
fiscal year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004, as opposed to net earnings from continuing operations of
$3,740,000 as previously reported in the company&#146;s Form 10-K filed on October&nbsp;29, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The company further announced that it had filed its Form 10-Q for the first quarter of fiscal 2005
which had been delayed pending completion of the review of its financial statements for the fiscal
year ended July&nbsp;31, 2004 and the filing of the Form 10-K/A to restate the Company&#146;s previously
reported fiscal 2004 financial statements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The company reported consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the first quarter of
fiscal 2005 of $20,434,000, an increase of 27.5% over consolidated net revenues from continuing
operations of $16,023,000 reported for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. Consolidated net earnings
from continuing operations for the first quarter of 2005 amounted to $807,000, or $.29 per share,
compared to consolidated net earnings from continuing operations of $823,000, or $.29 per share for
the first quarter of fiscal 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">On September&nbsp;9, 2004, the company entered into a definitive agreement under which it sold
substantially all the assets of its McRae Office Solutions, Inc. subsidiary to Connected Office
Products, Inc. (COPI). COPI is a subsidiary of TOPAC U.S.A., Inc., which is headquartered in
Irvine, California, and operates a network of wholly owned subsidiaries involved in the sales,

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">service, and distribution of office products. Under the terms of the Asset Purchase Agreement, COPI
purchased substantially all of the assets of McRae Office Solutions, Inc. for $11,000,000 subject
to adjustment based on the net book value of the acquired assets as of August&nbsp;28, 2004. Based on
the company&#146;s post-closing calculation of the net book value of the acquired assets, the company
expects an approximately $206,000 reduction in the purchase price. The purchaser is in the process
of reviewing the calculation of this adjustment and it is subject to change depending on the
parties&#146; final agreement on the amount of the adjustment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Based in part on the company&#146;s current estimate of the purchase price adjustment, net earnings from
discontinued operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 amounted to $1,906,000, or $.69 per
share, as compared to a net loss from discontinued operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2004
of $261,000, or $.09 per share.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated net revenues from continuing operations for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 totaled
$20.4&nbsp;million as compared to $16.0&nbsp;million for the first quarter of fiscal 2004. This increase in
net revenues was primarily attributable to the continued high demand for military combat boots for
the U.S. Government and improved sales in the bar code and western and work boot business.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Consolidated gross profit from continuing operations for fiscal 2005 increased to $4.6&nbsp;million over
the $4.0&nbsp;million reported in fiscal 2004. This growth in gross profit was primarily the result of
higher net revenues and higher margins on imported western and work boots.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Selling, general and administrative expenses from continuing operations increased from $2.4&nbsp;million
for the first quarter of fiscal 2004 to $3.1&nbsp;million for the first quarter of fiscal 2005 primarily
as a result of higher sales commissions, group health insurance costs, and professional fees
associated primarily with compliance costs incurred to assess and improve the company&#146;s internal
control over financial reporting as required by Section&nbsp;404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 and
related SEC rules.
