<PAGE>


         This TRUST AGREEMENT, dated as of November 1, 2004 (the "Agreement"),
is by and among STRUCTURED ASSET SECURITIES CORPORATION, a Delaware corporation,
as depositor (the "Depositor"), AURORA LOAN SERVICES INC., as master servicer
(the "Master Servicer"), and Citibank, N.A., as trustee (the "Trustee").

                              PRELIMINARY STATEMENT

         The Depositor has acquired the Mortgage Loans from Lehman Brothers
Holdings Inc. (the "Seller") and at the Closing Date is the owner of the
Mortgage Loans and the other property being conveyed by it to the Trustee for
inclusion in the Trust Fund. On the Closing Date, the Depositor will acquire the
Certificates from the Trust Fund, as consideration for its transfer to the Trust
Fund of the Mortgage Loans and the other property constituting the Trust Fund.
The Depositor has duly authorized the execution and delivery of this Agreement
to provide for the conveyance to the Trustee of the Mortgage Loans and the other
property constituting the Trust Fund. All covenants and agreements made by the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee herein with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and the other property constituting the Trust Fund are for the
benefit of the Holders from time to time of the Certificates. The Depositor and
the Master Servicer are entering into this Agreement, and the Trustee is
accepting the Trust Fund created hereby, for good and valuable consideration,
the receipt and sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged.

         As provided herein, the Trustee shall elect that the Trust Fund
(exclusive of amounts payable in respect of the Class E and Class P
Certificates) be treated for federal income tax purposes as comprising three
real estate mortgage investment conduits (each a "REMIC" or, in the alternative,
REMIC 1, REMIC 2 and REMIC 3, (REMIC 3 also being referred to herein as the
"Upper Tier REMIC")). As is described in Section 10.01 hereof, the Trust Fund
will also be treated for federal income tax purposes as including three grantor
trusts. Each Certificate, other than the Class A2, Class A3, Class E, Class P
and Class R Certificates, and each of the Class A2 REMIC Interest and Class A3
REMIC Interest represents a regular interest in the Upper Tier REMIC for
purposes of the REMIC Provisions. The Class R Certificate represents ownership
of the sole class of residual interest in each of REMIC 1, REMIC 2 and REMIC 3
for purposes of the REMIC Provisions. The Upper Tier REMIC shall hold as assets
the several classes of uncertificated REMIC 2 Regular Interests. Each REMIC 2
Regular Interest is hereby designated as a regular interest in REMIC 2. REMIC 2
shall hold as assets the several classes of uncertificated REMIC 1 Regular
Interests. Each REMIC 1 Regular Interest is hereby designated as a regular
interest in REMIC 1. REMIC 1 shall hold as assets all property of the Trust Fund
other than the REMIC 1 Interests, the REMIC 2 Interests, the REMIC 3 Interests
and the grantor trusts described in Section 10.01 herein.

R Certificate.

         All payments of principal and interest at the Net Mortgage Rate on each
of the Mortgage Loans (exclusive of amounts payable in respect of the Class E
and Class P Certificates) received from the Mortgage Loans shall be paid to the
REMIC 1 Regular Interests until the principal balance of all such interests have
been reduced to zero and any losses allocated to such interests have been
reimbursed. Any excess amounts shall be distributed to the Class LT1-R Interest.

                  On each Distribution Date, each REMIC 1 Regular Interest that
has a class of Corresponding Certificates shall be allocated payments of
scheduled principal, prepayments, loss reimbursements, increases in principal
amounts pursuant to the proviso in the definition of "Certificate Principal
Amount", losses and shortfalls in the same amounts as such items are allocated
to such class of Corresponding Certificates.

         Further,

         (i) if, on any Distribution Date, a principal payment or loss
allocation reduces the Certificate Principal Amount of the Class A1 Certificates
without a corresponding accrual and increase in the Certificate Principal Amount
of the Class A3 Certificates, then an amount equal



                                       2

to 50% of such principal payment or loss allocation shall be deemed paid or
allocated to each of the Class LT1-A1 Interest and the Class LT1-Z Interest in
reduction of their principal amounts;

         (ii) if, on any Distribution Date, a principal payment reduces the
Certificate Principal Amount of the Class A1 Certificates and is accompanied by
a corresponding accrual and increase in the Certificate Principal Amount of the
Class A3 Certificates, then (x) an amount equal to 50% of such principal payment
shall be deemed paid to the Class LT1-A1 Interest in reduction of its principal
amount and (y) an amount equal to 50% of such payment shall accrue and be added
to the principal amount of the Class LT1-Z Interest;

         (iii) if, on any Distribution Date, a principal payment or loss
allocation reduces the Certificate Principal Amount of the Class A2 Certificates

payment or loss allocation shall be deemed paid or allocated to each of the
Class LT1-A2 Interest and the Class LT1-Z Interest in reduction of their
principal amounts;

         (iv) if, on any Distribution Date, a principal payment reduces the
Certificate Principal Amount of the Class A2 Certificates and is accompanied by
a corresponding accrual and increase in the Certificate Principal Amount of the
Class A3 Certificates, then (x) an amount equal to 50% of such principal payment
shall be deemed paid to the Class LT1-A2 Interest in reduction of its principal
amount and (y) an amount equal to 50% of such payment shall accrue and be added
to the principal amount of the Class LT1-Z Interest;

         (v) if, on any Distribution Date, a principal payment reduces the
Certificate Principal Amount of the Class A3 Certificates, then an amount equal
to such principal payment shall be deemed paid to the Class LT1-Z Interest in
reduction of its principal amount;

         (vi) if, on any Distribution Date, the Class A1 Certificates receive
amounts in respect of unreimbursed of losses, the Class LT1-A1 Interest and the
Class LT1-Z Interest shall each be deemed to receive 50% of such amounts;

         (vii) if, on any Distribution Date, the Class A2 Certificates receive
amounts in respect of unreimbursed of losses, the Class LT1-A2 Interest and the
Class LT1-Z Interest shall each be deemed to receive 50% of such amounts;

         (viii) if, on any Distribution Date, the Class A3 Certificates receive
amounts in respect of unreimbursed of losses, the Class LT1-Z Interest shall be
deemed to receive 100% of such amounts;

         (ix) if, on any Distribution Date, the Certificate Principal Amount of
the Class A1 Certificates is increased as a result of the proviso in the
definition of Certificate Principal Amount, then the principal amount of each of
the Class LT1-A1 Interest and the Class LT1-Z Interest shall be increased by an
amount equal to 50% of the amount of such increase in the Certificate Principal
Amount of the Class A1 Certificates;

         (x) if, on any Distribution Date, the Certificate Principal Amount of
the Class A2 Certificates is increased as a result of the proviso in the
definition of Certificate Principal

Class LT1-Z Interest shall be increased by an amount equal to 50% of the amount
of such increase in the Certificate Principal Amount of the Class A2
Certificates; and

         (xi) if, on any Distribution Date, the Certificate Principal Amount of

- ---------------------------

         (1) For any Distribution Date on or prior to the First Auction
Distribution Date, the interest rate for the Class LT2-A1 Interest shall be a
per annum rate equal to the Net WAC for such Distribution Date minus 1.03%
(provided, however, that such interest rate shall be subject to a floor of 3.83%
per annum); and for each Distribution Date after the First Auction Distribution
Date, the interest rate for the Class LT2-A1 Interest shall be a per annum rate
equal to 3.83%.

         (2) For any Distribution Date on or prior to the First Auction
Distribution Date, the interest rate for the Class LT2-A2 Interest shall be a
per annum rate equal to the Net WAC for such Distribution Date; and for each
Distribution Date after the First Auction Distribution Date, the interest rate
for the Class LT2-A1 Interest shall be a per annum rate equal to the lesser of
(i) 3.83% and (ii) the Net WAC for such Distribution Date.

         (3) For any Distribution Date, the Class LT2-A3 Interest shall accrue
interest at a rate equal to the Class A3 REMIC Interest Rate for such
Distribution Date on a notional amount equal to the aggregate principal balances
of the Class LT1-A1 Interest, the Class LT1-A2 Interest and the Class LT1-Z
Interest immediately prior to such Distribution Date. For federal income



                                       4

tax purposes, the Class LT2-A3 Interest shall represent the right to a
"specified portion" (within the meaning of the REMIC Provisions) of the interest
on the Class LT1-A1 Interest, the Class LT1-A2 Interest and the Class LT1-Z
Interest.

         (4) For any Distribution Date, the interest rate for each of the Class
LT2-1R Interest, the Class LT2-B1 Interest, the Class LT2-B2 Interest, the Class
LT2-B3 Interest, the Class LT2-B4 Interest, the Class LT2-B5 Interest and the
Class LT2-B6 Interest shall be a per annum rate equal to the Net WAC for such
Distribution Date.

         (5) The Class LT2-R Interest shall represent the sole class of residual
interest in REMIC 2. The Class LT2-R Interest will not have a principal amount
or an interest rate. The Class LT2-R Interest shall be represented by the Class
R Certificate.

         All payments received on the REMIC 1 Regular Interests shall be paid to
the REMIC 2 Regular Interests until the principal balance of all such interests
have been reduced to zero and any losses allocated to such interests have been
reimbursed. Any excess amounts shall be distributed to the Class LT2-R Interest.

                  On each Distribution Date, each REMIC 2 Regular Interest shall
be allocated payments of scheduled principal, prepayments, loss reimbursements,
increases in principal amounts pursuant to the proviso in the definition of
"Certificate Principal Amount" and losses in the same amounts as such items are
allocated to its class of Corresponding Certificates. The principal amount of
the Class LT2-A3 Interest shall be increased for accrued but unpaid interest in
the same amount that the principal amount of the Class A3 Certificates is
increased for accrued but unpaid interest. If, on any Distribution Date, the
Class A1 or Class A2 Certificates receive a payment in respect of principal out
of interest accrued on but unpaid to the Class A3 Certificates, then the Class
LT2-A1 Interest or Class LT2-A2 Interest, as the case may be, shall be allocated
a payment of an equal amount in respect of principal out of interest accrued on
but unpaid to the Class LT3-A3 Interest.

- ---------------------------

(1)  For any Distribution Date, the Certificate Interest Rate on the Class A1
     Certificates shall be a per annum rate equal to the interest rate specified
     above.

(2)  The Certificate Interest Rate on the Class A2 Certificates for each
     Distribution Date on or prior to the First Auction Distribution Date shall
     be a per annum rate equal to interest rate specified above subject to a
     maximum rate equal to the Available Funds Cap for such Distribution Date.
     Following the First Auction Distribution Date and if the Minimum Call Price
     is not received, the Certificate Interest Rate for the Class A2
     Certificates for each Distribution Date thereafter will be an annual rate
     equal to 5.36% subject to a maximum rate equal to the Available Funds Cap.
     Following the First Auction Distribution Date and if the Minimum Call Price
     is received, the Certificate Interest Rate for the Class A2 Certificates
     will be a per annum rate equal to the Net WAC for each succeeding
     Distribution Date. See Section 10.01 hereof for the characterization of the
     Class A2 Certificates for federal income tax purposes.

(3)  For any Distribution Date, the Class A3 Certificates will be entitled to an
     amount equal to the greater of (1) $0.00 and (2)(A) the amount of interest
     accruing during the related Due Period at a per annum rate equal to the Net
     WAC on the Mortgage Loans (exclusive of any interest accruing on the
     Mortgage Loans payable to the Subordinate Certificates) less (B) the total
     interest accrued for the related Accrual Period on the Class R, Class A1,
     Class A2 and Class AIO Certificates. However, such interest distribution
     amounts will be paid to the Class A1 and Class A2 Certificates as described
     herein. The Class Principal Amount of the Class A3 Certificates will be
     increased on each Distribution Date by an amount equal to the interest
     accrued on the Class A3 Certificates for such Distribution Date to the
     extent such interest was distributed as principal as described in the
     preceding sentence. Following the Distribution Date on which the Minimum
     Call Price is received and after the Class Principal Amount of the Class A2
     Certificates has been reduced to zero, amounts otherwise distributable to
     the Class A3 Certificates shall be distributed to the Class A2 Certificates
     until the Class Principal Amount of the Class A3 Certificates has been
     reduced to zero. See Section 10.01 hereof for the characterization of the
     Class A3 Certificates for federal income tax purposes.

(4)  The Class AIO Certificates will bear interest each Distribution Date on or
     prior to the First Auction Distribution Date at an annual rate equal to the
     greater of (i) 0.00% per annum and (ii) the excess of (a) the Net WAC over
     (b) the Class A2 Certificate Interest Rate. Beginning with the Distribution
     Date following the First Auction Distribution Date, the Class AIO
     Certificates will not be entitled to distributions of any kind. The Class
     Notional Amount of the Class AIO Certificates for each Distribution Date up
     to and including the First Auction Distribution Date shall equal the Class
     Principal Amount of the Class A1 and Class A2 Certificates immediately
     prior to such Distribution Date. Following the First Auction Distribution
     Date, the Class AIO Certificates shall



                                       6
<PAGE>

     have a Class Notional Amount of zero. For federal income tax purposes, the
     Class AIO Certificates shall represent the right to the interest accrued on
     each of the Class LT2-A1 Interest and the Class LT2-A2 Interest in excess
     of the interest accrued thereon at 4.86% per annum.

(5)  For any Distribution Date, the Class R, Class B1, Class B2, Class B3, Class
     B4, Class B5 and Class B6 Certificates shall bear interest at a per annum
     rate equal to the Net WAC.

(6)  For any Distribution Date, the Class E Certificates will be entitled to
     receive a portion of excess interest equal to 0.25% per annum generated by
     any Employee Mortgage Loan if the related borrower ceases to be an employee
     of the Underwriter or its affiliates.

(7)  The Class P Certificates will be entitled to receive the Class P
     Distributable Amount on each Distribution Date.

         As of the Cut-off Date, the Mortgage Loans had an aggregate Scheduled
Principal Balance of $322,668,769.23.

                            ISSUANCE OF CERTIFICATES

               Section 2.01.     Creation and Declaration of Trust Fund;
                                 Conveyance of Mortgage Loans.

         (a) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Depositor does hereby transfer, assign, set over, deposit with and otherwise
convey to the Trustee, without recourse, subject to Sections 2.02, 2.04, 2.05
and 2.06, in trust, all the right, title and interest of the Depositor in and to
the Mortgage Loans. Such conveyance includes, without limitation, the



                                       40

right to all distributions of principal and interest received on or with respect
to the Mortgage Loans on and after the Cut-off Date (other than payments of
principal and interest due on or before such date) and all such payments due
after such date but received prior to such date and intended by the related
Mortgagors to be applied after such date, together with all of the Depositor's
right, title and interest in and to the Collection Account and all amounts from
time to time credited to and the proceeds of the Collection Account, the
Certificate Account and all amounts from time to time credited to and the
proceeds of the Certificate Account, any Escrow Account established pursuant to
Section 9.06 hereof and all amounts from time to time credited to and the
proceeds of any such Escrow Account, any REO Property and the proceeds thereof,
the Depositor's rights under any Insurance Policies related to the Mortgage
Loans, and the Depositor's security interest in any collateral pledged to secure
the Mortgage Loans, including the Mortgaged Properties and any Additional
Collateral, and any proceeds of the foregoing, to have and to hold, in trust;
and the Trustee declares that, subject to the review provided for in Section
2.02, it (or a Custodian on its behalf) has received and shall hold the Trust
Fund, as trustee, in trust, for the benefit and use of the Holders of the
Certificates and for the purposes and subject to the terms and conditions set
forth in this Agreement, and, concurrently with such receipt, has caused to be
executed, authenticated and delivered to or upon the order of the Depositor, in
exchange for the Trust Fund, Certificates in the authorized denominations
evidencing the entire ownership of the Trust Fund.

         Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Depositor does hereby assign to the Trustee all of its rights and interest under
the Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement including all rights of the Seller under the
Servicing Agreements and Transfer Agreements to the extent assigned under such
Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement. The Trustee hereby accepts such assignment, and
shall be entitled to exercise all rights of the Depositor under the Mortgage
Loan Sale Agreement as if, for such purpose, it were the Depositor. The
foregoing sale, transfer, assignment, set-over, deposit and conveyance does not
and is not intended to result in creation or assumption by the Trustee of any
obligation of the Depositor, the Seller, or any other Person in connection with
the Mortgage Loans or any other agreement or instrument relating thereto except
as specifically set forth herein.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the Trust
Fund shall not obtain title to or beneficial ownership of any Additional
Collateral as a result of or in lieu of the disposition thereof or otherwise.

         (b) In connection with such transfer and assignment, the Depositor does
hereby deliver and deposit with, or cause to be delivered to and deposited with,
the Trustee, and/or any custodian acting on the Trustee's behalf, if applicable,
the following documents or instruments with respect to each Mortgage Loan (each
a "Mortgage File") so transferred and assigned:

              (i) with respect to each Mortgage Loan, the original Mortgage Note
         endorsed without recourse in proper form to the order of the Trustee,
         as shown in Exhibit B-4, or in blank (in each case, with all necessary
         intervening endorsements as applicable);

              (ii) the original of any guarantee, security agreement or pledge
         agreement executed in connection with the Mortgage Note, assigned to
         the Trustee;


                                       41
<PAGE>

              (iii) with respect to each Mortgage Loan other than a Cooperative
         Loan, the original recorded Mortgage with evidence of recording
         indicated thereon and the original recorded power of attorney, if the
         Mortgage was executed pursuant to a power of attorney, with evidence of
         recording thereon or, if such Mortgage or power of attorney has been
         submitted for recording but has not been returned from the applicable
         public recording office, has been lost or is not otherwise available, a
         copy of such Mortgage or power of attorney, as the case may be,
         certified to be a true and complete copy of the original submitted for
         recording. If, in connection with any Mortgage Loan, the Depositor
         cannot deliver the Mortgage with evidence of recording thereon on or
         prior to the Closing Date because of a delay caused by the public
         recording office where such Mortgage has been delivered for recordation
         or because such Mortgage has been lost, the Depositor shall deliver or
         cause to be delivered to the Trustee (or its custodian), in the case of
         a delay due to recording, a true copy of such Mortgage, pending
         delivery of the original thereof, together with an Officer's
         Certificate of the Depositor certifying that the copy of such Mortgage
         delivered to the Trustee (or its custodian) is a true copy and that the
         original of such Mortgage has been forwarded to the public recording
         office, or, in the case of a Mortgage that has been lost, a copy
         thereof (certified as provided for under the laws of the appropriate
         jurisdiction) and a written Opinion of Counsel acceptable to the
         Trustee and the Depositor that an original recorded Mortgage is not
         required to enforce the Trustee's interest in the Mortgage Loan;

              (iv) the original of each assumption, modification or substitution
         agreement, if any, relating to the Mortgage Loans, or, as to any
         assumption, modification or substitution agreement which cannot be
         delivered on or prior to the Closing Date because of a delay caused by
         the public recording office where such assumption, modification or
         substitution agreement has been delivered for recordation, a photocopy
         of such assumption, modification or substitution agreement, pending
         delivery of the original thereof, together with an Officer's
         Certificate of the Depositor certifying that the copy of such
         assumption, modification or substitution agreement delivered to the
         Trustee (or its custodian) is a true copy and that the original of such
         agreement has been forwarded to the public recording office;

              (v) with respect to each Non-MERS Mortgage Loan other than a
         Cooperative Loan, the original Assignment of Mortgage for each Mortgage
         Loan;

              (vi) if applicable, such original intervening assignments of the
         Mortgage, notice of transfer or equivalent instrument (each, an
         "Intervening Assignment"), as may be necessary to show a complete chain
         of assignment from the originator, or, in the case of an Intervening
         Assignment that has been lost, a written Opinion of Counsel acceptable
         to the Depositor that such original Intervening Assignment is not
         required to enforce the Trustee's interest in the Mortgage Loans;

              (vii) the original Primary Mortgage Insurance Policy or
         certificate, if private mortgage guaranty insurance is required;

              (viii) with respect to each Mortgage Loan other than a Cooperative
         Loan, the original mortgagee title insurance policy or attorney's
         opinion of title and abstract of title;



                                       42
<PAGE>

              (ix) the original of any security agreement, chattel mortgage or
         equivalent executed in connection with the Mortgage or as to any
         security agreement, chattel mortgage or their equivalent that cannot be
         delivered on or prior to the Closing Date because of a delay caused by
         the public recording office where such document has been delivered for
         recordation, a photocopy of such document, pending delivery of the
         original thereof, together with an Officer's Certificate of the
         Depositor certifying that the copy of such security agreement, chattel
         mortgage or their equivalent delivered to the Trustee (or its
         custodian) is a true copy and that the original of such document has
         been forwarded to the public recording office;

              (x) with respect to any Cooperative Loan, the Cooperative Loan
         Documents;

              (xi) in connection with any pledge of Additional Collateral, the
         original additional collateral pledge and security agreement executed
         in connection therewith, assigned to the Trustee; and

              (xii) with respect to any manufactured housing contract, any
         related manufactured housing sales contract, installment loan agreement
         or participation interest.

         The parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the form of endorsement
attached hereto as Exhibit B-4 is intended to effect the transfer to the
Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, of the Mortgage Notes and
the Mortgages.

         (c) (i) Assignments of Mortgage with respect to each Non-MERS Mortgage
Loan other than a Cooperative Loan shall be recorded; provided, however, that
such Assignments of Mortgage need not be recorded if, in the Opinion of Counsel
(which must be from Independent counsel) (which Opinion of Counsel may be in the
form of a memorandum of law) acceptable to the Trustee and the Rating Agencies,
recording in such states is not required to protect the Trustee's interest in
the related Non-MERS Mortgage Loans. Subject to the preceding sentence, as soon
as practicable after the Closing Date (but in no event more than 3 months
thereafter except to the extent delays are caused by the applicable recording
office), the Trustee, at the expense of the Depositor and with the cooperation
of the applicable Servicer, shall cause to be properly recorded by such Servicer
in each public recording office where the related Mortgages are recorded each
Assignment of Mortgage referred to in subsection (b)(v) above with respect to
each Non-MERS Mortgage Loan. With respect to each Cooperative Loan, the Trustee,
at the expense of the Depositor and with the cooperation of the applicable
Servicer, shall cause such Servicer to take such actions as are necessary under
applicable law in order to perfect the interest of the Trustee in the related
Mortgaged Property.

              (ii) With respect to each MERS Mortgage Loan, the applicable
         Servicer, at the expense of the Depositor and with the cooperation of
         the Trustee, shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the
         Trustee to be clearly identified as the owner of each such Mortgage
         Loan on the records of MERS for purposes of the system of recording
         transfers of beneficial ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS.

         (d) In instances where a Title Insurance Policy is required to be
delivered to the Trustee, or to the applicable Custodian on behalf of the
Trustee, under clause (b)(viii) above and is not so



                                       43
<PAGE>

delivered, the Depositor will provide a copy of such Title Insurance Policy to
the Trustee, or to the applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, as
promptly as practicable after the execution and delivery hereof, but in any case
within 180 days of the Closing Date.

         (e) For Mortgage Loans (if any) that have been prepaid in full after
the Cut-off Date and prior to the Closing Date, the Depositor, in lieu of
delivering the above documents, herewith delivers to the Trustee, or to the
applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, an Officer's Certificate which
shall include a statement to the effect that all amounts received in connection
with such prepayment that are required to be deposited in the applicable
Collection Account pursuant to Section 4.01 have been so deposited. All original
documents that are not delivered to the Trustee or the applicable Custodian on
behalf of the Trustee shall be held by the Master Servicer or the applicable
Servicer in trust for the benefit of the Trustee and the Certificateholders.

               Section 2.02.     Acceptance of Trust Fund by Trustee: Review of
                                 Documentation for Trust Fund.

         (a) The Trustee, or the applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee,
by execution and delivery hereof, acknowledges receipt by it or a Custodian on
behalf of the Trustee, of the Mortgage Files pertaining to the Mortgage Loans
listed on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, subject to review thereof by the Trustee,
or by the applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, under this Section
2.02. The Trustee, or the applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, will
execute and deliver to the Trustee, the Depositor and the Master Servicer on the
Closing Date an Initial Certification in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit B-1
(or in the form annexed to the applicable Custodial Agreement as Exhibit B-1, as
applicable).

         (b) Within 45 days after the Closing Date, the Trustee or the
applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee will, on behalf of the Trustee and
for the benefit of Holders of the Certificates, review each Mortgage File to
ascertain that all required documents set forth in Section 2.01 have been
received and appear on their face to contain the requisite signatures by or on
behalf of the respective parties thereto, and shall deliver to the Trustee, the
Depositor and the Master Servicer an Interim Certification in the form annexed
hereto as Exhibit B-2 (or in the form annexed to the applicable Custodial
Agreement as Exhibit B-2, as applicable) to the effect that, as to each Mortgage
Loan listed in the Mortgage Loan Schedule (other than any Mortgage Loan prepaid
in full or any Mortgage Loan specifically identified in such certification as
not covered by such certification), (i) all of the applicable documents
specified in Section 2.01(b) are in its possession and (ii) such documents have
been reviewed by it and appear to relate to such Mortgage Loan. The Trustee, or
the applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, shall make sure that the
documents are executed and endorsed, but shall be under no duty or obligation to
inspect, review or examine any such documents, instruments, certificates or
other papers to determine that the same are valid, binding, legally effective,
properly endorsed, genuine, enforceable or appropriate for the represented
purpose or that they have actually been recorded or are in recordable form or
that they are other than what they purport to be on their face. Neither the
Trustee nor any Custodian shall have any responsibility for verifying the
genuineness or the legal effectiveness of or authority for any signatures of or
on behalf of any party or endorser.


                                       44
<PAGE>


         (c) If in the course of the review described in paragraph (b) above the
Trustee or the applicable Custodian discovers any document or documents
constituting a part of a Mortgage File that is missing, does not appear regular
on its face (i.e., is mutilated, damaged, defaced, torn or otherwise physically
altered) or appears to be unrelated to the Mortgage Loans identified in the
Mortgage Loan Schedule (each, a "Material Defect"), the Trustee, or the
applicable Custodian on behalf of the Trustee, shall promptly identify the
Mortgage Loan to which such Material Defect relates in the Interim Certification
delivered to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee. Within 90 days
of its receipt of such notice, the Transferor, or if the Transferor does not do
so, the Depositor shall be required to cure such Material Defect (and, in such
event, the Depositor shall provide the Trustee with an Officer's Certificate
confirming that such cure has been effected). If the applicable Transferor or
the Depositor, as applicable, does not so cure such Material Defect, it shall,
if a loss has been incurred with respect to such Mortgage Loan that would, if
such Mortgage Loan were not purchased from the Trust Fund, constitute a Realized
Loss, and such loss is attributable to the failure of the applicable Transferor
or the Depositor to cure such Material Defect, repurchase the related Mortgage
Loan from the Trust Fund at the Purchase Price. A loss shall be deemed to be
attributable to the failure of the applicable Transferor or the Depositor to
cure a Material Defect if, as determined by the Depositor, upon mutual agreement
with the Master Servicer acting in good faith, absent such Material Defect, such
loss would not have been incurred. Within the two-year period following the
Closing Date, the Depositor may, in lieu of repurchasing a Mortgage Loan
pursuant to this Section 2.02, substitute for such Mortgage Loan a Qualifying
Substitute Mortgage Loan subject to the provisions of Section 2.05. The failure
of the Trustee or the applicable Custodian to give the notice contemplated
herein within 45 days after the Closing Date shall not affect or relieve the
Depositor of its obligation to repurchase any Mortgage Loan pursuant to this
Section 2.02 or any other Section of this Agreement requiring the repurchase of
Mortgage Loans from the Trust Fund.

         (d) Within 180 days following the Closing Date, the Trustee, or the
applicable Custodian, shall deliver to the Trustee, the Depositor and the Master
Servicer a Final Certification substantially in the form annexed hereto as
Exhibit B-3 (or in the form annexed to the applicable Custodial Agreement as
Exhibit B-3, as applicable) evidencing the completeness of the Mortgage Files in
its possession or control, with any exceptions noted thereto.

         (e) Nothing in this Agreement shall be construed to constitute an
assumption by the Trust Fund, the Trustee or the Certificateholders of any
unsatisfied duty, claim or other liability on any Mortgage Loan or to any
Mortgagor.

         (f) Each of the parties hereto acknowledges that the Custodian shall
perform the applicable review of the Mortgage Loans and respective
certifications thereof as provided in this Section 2.02.

         (g) The Depositor and the Trustee acknowledge and agree that it is not
intended that any Mortgage Loan be included in the Trust Fund that is a
"High-Cost Home Loan" as defined in the New Jersey Home Ownership Act effective
November 27, 2003 or the New Mexico Home Protection Act effective January 1,
2004.

         (a) The Depositor hereby represents and warrants to the Trustee, for
the benefit of Certificateholders, and to the Master Servicer, as of the Closing
Date or such other date as is specified, that:

              (i) the Depositor is a corporation duly organized, validly
         existing and in good standing under the laws governing its creation and
         existence and has full corporate power and authority to own its
         property, to carry on its business as presently conducted, to enter
         into and perform its obligations under this Agreement, and to create
         the trust pursuant hereto;

              (ii) the execution and delivery by the Depositor of this Agreement
         have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part
         of the Depositor; neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
         nor the consummation of the transactions herein contemplated, nor
         compliance with the provisions hereof, will conflict with or result in
         a breach of, or constitute a default under, any of the provisions of
         any law, governmental rule, regulation, judgment, decree or order
         binding on the Depositor or its properties or the certificate of
         incorporation or bylaws of the Depositor;

              (iii) the execution, delivery and performance by the Depositor of
         this Agreement and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
         hereby do not require the consent or approval of, the giving of notice
         to, the registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect
         of, any state, federal or other governmental authority or agency,
         except such as has been obtained, given, effected or taken prior to the
         date hereof;

              (iv) this Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the
         Depositor and, assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by
         the Trustee and the Master Servicer, constitutes a valid and binding
         obligation of the Depositor enforceable against it in accordance with
         its terms except as such enforceability may be subject to (A)
         applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws and other similar laws
         affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors generally and (B)
         general principles of equity regardless of whether such enforcement is
         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law;

              (v) there are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
         knowledge of the Depositor, threatened or likely to be asserted against
         or affecting the Depositor, before or by any court, administrative
         agency, arbitrator or governmental body (A) with respect to any of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement or (B) with respect to any
         other matter which in the judgment of the Depositor will be determined
         adversely to the Depositor and will if determined adversely to the
         Depositor materially and adversely affect it or its business, assets,
         operations or condition, financial or otherwise, or adversely affect
         its ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement; and

              (vi) immediately prior to the transfer and assignment of the
         Mortgage Loans to the Trustee, the Depositor was the sole owner of
         record and holder of each Mortgage Loan, and the Depositor had good and
         marketable title thereto, and had full right to



                                       46
<PAGE>

         transfer and sell each Mortgage Loan to the Trustee free and clear,
         subject only to (1) liens of current real property taxes and
         assessments not yet due and payable and, if the related Mortgaged
         Property is a condominium unit, any lien for common charges permitted
         by statute, (2) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way,
         easements and other matters of public record as of the date of
         recording of such Mortgage acceptable to mortgage lending institutions
         in the area in which the related Mortgaged Property is located and
         specifically referred to in the lender's Title Insurance Policy or
         attorney's opinion of title and abstract of title delivered to the
         originator of such Mortgage Loan, and (3) such other matters to which
         like properties are commonly subject which do not, individually or in
         the aggregate, materially interfere with the benefits of the security
         intended to be provided by the Mortgage, of any encumbrance, equity,
         participation interest, lien, pledge, charge, claim or security
         interest, and had full right and authority, subject to no interest or
         participation of, or agreement with, any other party, to sell and
         assign each Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Agreement.

         (b) The representations and warranties of each Transferor with respect
to the related Mortgage Loans in the applicable Transfer Agreement, which have
been assigned to the Trustee hereunder, were made as of the date specified in
the applicable Transfer Agreement (or underlying agreement, if such Transfer
Agreement is in the form of an assignment of a prior agreement). To the extent
that any fact, condition or event with respect to a Mortgage Loan constitutes a
breach of both (i) a representation or warranty of the applicable Transferor
under the applicable Transfer Agreement and (ii) a representation or warranty of
Lehman Holdings under the Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement, the only right or remedy
of the Trustee or of any Certificateholder shall be the Trustee's right to
enforce the obligations of the applicable Transferor under any applicable
representation or warranty made by it. The Trustee acknowledges that Lehman
Holdings shall have no obligation or liability with respect to any breach of a
representation or warranty made by it with respect to the Mortgage Loans if the
fact, condition or event constituting such breach also constitutes a breach of a
representation or warranty made by the applicable Transferor in the applicable
Transfer Agreement, without regard to whether such Transferor fulfills its
contractual obligations in respect of such representation or warranty. The
Trustee further acknowledges that the Depositor shall have no obligation or
liability with respect to any breach of any representation or warranty with
respect to the Mortgage Loans (except as set forth in Section 2.03(a)(vi)) under
any circumstances.

               Section 2.04.     Discovery of Breach.

         It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties (i)
of the Depositor set forth in Section 2.03 hereof, (ii) of Lehman Holdings set
forth in the Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement and assigned to the Trustee by the
Depositor hereunder and (iii) of each Transferor, assigned by Lehman Holdings to
the Depositor pursuant to the Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement and assigned to the
Trustee by the Depositor hereunder, shall each survive delivery of the Mortgage
Files and the Assignment of Mortgage of each Mortgage Loan to the Trustee and
shall continue throughout the term of this Agreement. Upon discovery by any of
the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee of a breach of any of such
representations and warranties that adversely and materially affects the value
of the related Mortgage Loan, the party discovering such breach shall give
prompt written notice to the other parties. Within 90 days of the



                                       47

discovery of a breach of any representation or warranty given or assigned to the
Trustee by the Depositor, any Transferor or Lehman Holdings, the Depositor, such
Transferor or Lehman Holdings shall either (a) cure such breach in all material
respects, (b) repurchase such Mortgage Loan or any property acquired in respect
thereof from the Trustee at the Purchase Price or (c) within the two year period
following the Closing Date, substitute a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan for
the affected Mortgage Loan. In the event of the discovery of a breach of any
representation and warranty of any Transferor assigned to the Trustee, the
Trustee shall enforce its rights under the applicable Transfer Agreement and the
Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement for the benefit of the Certificateholders. As
provided in the Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement, if any Transferor substitutes for
a Mortgage Loan for which there is a breach of any representations and
warranties in the related Transfer Agreement which adversely and materially
affects the value of such Mortgage Loan and such substitute mortgage loan is not
a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, under the terms of the Mortgage Loan Sale
Agreement, Lehman Holdings will, in exchange for such substitute mortgage loan,
either (i) provide the applicable Purchase Price for the affected Mortgage Loan
or (ii) within two years of the Closing Date, substitute such affected Mortgage
Loan with a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan.

               Section 2.05.     Repurchase, Purchase or Substitution of
                                 Mortgage Loans.

         (a) With respect to any Mortgage Loan repurchased by the Depositor
pursuant to this Agreement, by Lehman Holdings pursuant to the Mortgage Loan
Sale Agreement or by any Transferor pursuant to the applicable Transfer
Agreement, the principal portion of the funds received by the Trustee in respect
of such repurchase of a Mortgage Loan will be considered a Principal Prepayment
and shall be deposited in the Collection Account. The Trustee, upon receipt of
the full amount of the Purchase Price for a Deleted Mortgage Loan, or upon its
receipt of notification from the applicable Custodian that it has received the
Mortgage File for a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan substituted for a
Deleted Mortgage Loan (and any applicable Substitution Amount), shall release or
cause to be released and reassigned to the Depositor, Lehman Holdings or the
applicable Transferor, as applicable, the related Mortgage File for the Deleted
Mortgage Loan and shall execute and deliver such instruments of transfer or
assignment, in each case without recourse, representation or warranty, as shall
be necessary to vest in such party or its designee or assignee title to any
Deleted Mortgage Loan released pursuant hereto, free and clear of all security
interests, liens and other encumbrances created by this Agreement, which
instruments shall be prepared by the applicable Servicer or the Trustee (or its
custodian), and the Trustee shall have no further responsibility with respect to
the Mortgage File relating to such Deleted Mortgage Loan. The Seller indemnifies
and holds the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Depositor and each Certificateholder
harmless against any and all taxes, claims, losses, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other
costs, fees and expenses that the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Depositor and any
Certificateholder may sustain in connection with any actions of the Seller
relating to a repurchase of a Mortgage Loan other than in compliance with the
terms of this Section 2.05 and the Mortgage Loan Sale Agreement, to the extent
that any such action causes (i) any federal or state tax to be imposed on the
Trust Fund, including without limitation, any federal tax imposed on "prohibited
transactions" under Section 860F(a) of the Code, or (ii) any REMIC created
hereunder to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificate is
outstanding.


                                       48
<PAGE>

         (b) With respect to each Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan to be
delivered to the Trustee (or its custodian) pursuant to the terms of this
Article II in exchange for a Deleted Mortgage Loan: (i) the Depositor, the
applicable Transferor or Lehman Holdings must deliver to the Trustee (or its
custodian) the Mortgage File for the Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan
containing the documents set forth in Section 2.01(b) along with a written
certification certifying as to the delivery of such Mortgage File and containing
the granting language set forth in Section 2.01(a); and (ii) the Depositor will
be deemed to have made, with respect to such Qualifying Substitute Mortgage
Loan, each of the representations and warranties made by it with respect to the
related Deleted Mortgage Loan. As soon as practicable after the delivery of any
Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan hereunder, the Trustee, at the expense of
the Depositor and at the direction and with the cooperation of the applicable
Servicer, shall, with respect to a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan that is a
Non-MERS Mortgage Loan, cause the Assignment of Mortgage to be recorded by such
Servicer if required pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(i), or the Servicer shall, with
respect to a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan that is a MERS Mortgage Loan,
cause to be taken such actions as are necessary to cause the Trustee to be
clearly identified as the owner of each such Mortgage Loan on the records of
MERS if required pursuant to Section 2.01(c)(ii).

         (c) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the right to
substitute Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Article II shall be subject to the
additional limitations that no substitution of a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage
Loan for a Deleted Mortgage Loan shall be made unless the Trustee has received
an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to make the
substitution) that, under current law, such substitution will not (A) affect
adversely the status of any REMIC established hereunder as a REMIC, or of the
related "regular interests" as "regular interests" in any such REMIC, or (B)
cause any such REMIC to engage in a prohibited transaction or prohibited
contribution pursuant to the REMIC Provisions.

               Section 2.06.     Grant Clause.

         (a) It is intended that the conveyance of the Depositor's right, title
and interest in and to property constituting the Trust Fund pursuant to this
Agreement shall constitute, and shall be construed as, a sale of such property
and not a grant of a security interest to secure a loan. However, if such
conveyance is deemed to be in respect of a loan, it is intended that: (1) the
rights and obligations of the parties shall be established pursuant to the terms
of this Agreement; (2) the Depositor hereby grants to the Trustee for the
benefit of the Holders of the Certificates a first priority security interest to
secure repayment of an obligation in an amount equal to the aggregate Class
Principal Amount of the Certificates in all of the Depositor's right, title and
interest in, to and under, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, the Trust
Fund and all proceeds of any and all property constituting the Trust Fund to
secure payment of the Certificates; and (3) this Agreement shall constitute a
security agreement under applicable law. If such conveyance is deemed to be in
respect of a loan and the Trust created by this Agreement terminates prior to
the satisfaction of the claims of any Person holding any Certificate, the
security interest created hereby shall continue in full force and effect and the
Trustee shall be deemed to be the collateral agent for the benefit of such
Person, and all proceeds shall be distributed as herein provided.



                                       49
<PAGE>

         (b) The Depositor shall, to the extent consistent with this Agreement,
take such reasonable actions as may be necessary to ensure that, if this
Agreement were deemed to create a security interest in the Mortgage Loans and
the other property described above, such security interest would be deemed to be
a perfected security interest of first priority under applicable law and will be
maintained as such throughout the term of this Agreement. The Depositor will, at
its own expense, make all initial filings on or about the Closing Date and shall
forward a copy of such filing or filings to the Trustee. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Depositor shall prepare and forward for filing,
or shall cause to be forwarded for filing, at the expense of the Depositor, all
filings necessary to maintain the effectiveness of any original filings
necessary under the relevant UCC to perfect the Trustee's security interest in
or lien on the Mortgage Loans, including without limitation (x) continuation
statements, and (y) such other statements as may be occasioned by (1) any change
of name of the Seller, the Depositor or the Trustee, (2) any change of location
of the jurisdiction of organization of the Seller or the Depositor, (3) any
transfer of any interest of the Seller or the Depositor in any Mortgage Loan or
(4) any change under the relevant UCC or other applicable laws. Neither the
Seller nor the Depositor shall organize under the law of any jurisdiction other
than the State under which each is organized as of the Closing Date (whether
changing its jurisdiction of organization or organizing under an additional
jurisdiction) without giving 30 days prior written notice of such action to its
transferee, including the Trustee. Before effecting such change, the Seller or
the Depositor proposing to change its jurisdiction of organization shall prepare
and file in the appropriate filing office any financing statements or other
statements necessary to continue the perfection of the interests of its
transferees, including the Trustee, in the Mortgage Loans. In connection with
the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, each of the Seller and the
Depositor authorizes its transferee to file in any filing office any initial
financing statements, any amendments to financing statements, any continuation
statements, or any other statements or filings described in this paragraph (b).

                                  ARTICLE III

                                THE CERTIFICATES

               Section 3.01.     The Certificates.

         (a) The Certificates shall be issuable in registered form only and
shall be securities governed by Article 8 of the New York Uniform Commercial
Code. The Book-Entry Certificates will be evidenced by one or more certificates,
beneficial ownership of which will be held in the dollar denominations in
Certificate Principal Amount or Notional Principal Amount, as applicable, or in
the Percentage Interests, specified herein. Each Class of Book-Entry
Certificates shall be issued in the minimum denominations in Certificate
Principal Amount (or Notional Amount) or Percentage Interest specified in the
Preliminary Statement hereto and in integral multiples of $1 or 5% (in the case
of Certificates issued in Percentage Interests) in excess thereof. Each Class of
Non-Book Entry Certificates other than the Residual Certificate shall be issued
in definitive, fully registered form in the minimum denominations in Certificate
Principal Amount (or Notional Amount) specified in the Preliminary Statement
hereto and in integral multiples of $1 in excess thereof. The Residual
Certificate shall be issued as a single Certificate and maintained in
definitive, fully registered form in a minimum denomination equal to $100. The
Class P Certificates shall be maintained in definitive, fully registered form
and shall be issued in a minimum denomination equal to 10% of the Percentage
Interest of such Class. The Class E Certificates shall be issued as a single
Certificate and maintained in definitive, fully registered form in a minimum
denomination equal



                                       50
<PAGE>

to 100% of the Percentage Interest of each such Class. The Certificates may be
issued in the form of typewritten certificates. One Certificate of each Class of
Certificates other than any Class of Residual Certificates may be issued in any
denomination in excess of the minimum denomination.

         (b) The Certificates shall be executed by manual or facsimile signature
on behalf of the Trustee by an authorized officer. Each Certificate shall, on
original issue, be authenticated by the Trustee upon the order of the Depositor
upon receipt by the Trustee (or the Custodian on its behalf) of the Mortgage
Files described in Section 2.01. No Certificate shall be entitled to any benefit
under this Agreement, or be valid for any purpose, unless there appears on such
Certificate a certificate of authentication substantially in the form provided
for herein, executed by an authorized officer of the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent, if any, by manual signature, and such certification upon
any Certificate shall be conclusive evidence, and the only evidence, that such
Certificate has been duly authenticated and delivered hereunder. All
Certificates shall be dated the date of their authentication. At any time and
from time to time after the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Depositor may deliver Certificates executed by the Depositor to the Trustee or
the Authenticating Agent for authentication and the Trustee or the
Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver such Certificates as in this
Agreement provided and not otherwise.

         (c) The Class A3, Class B4, Class B5 or Class B6 Certificates offered
and sold in reliance on the exemption from registration under Rule 144A shall be
issued initially in the form of one or more permanent global Certificates in
definitive, fully registered form without interest coupons with the applicable
legends set forth in Exhibit A added to the forms of such Certificates (each, a
"Restricted Global Security"), which, in the case of the Class A3, Class B4,
Class B5 and Class B6 Certificates, shall be deposited on behalf of the
subscribers for such Certificates represented thereby with the Trustee, as
custodian for DTC and registered in the name of a nominee of DTC, duly executed
and authenticated by the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate
principal amounts of the Restricted Global Securities may from time to time be
increased or decreased by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee or DTC
or its nominee, as the case may be, as hereinafter provided.

         The Class A3, Class B4, Class B5 or Class B6 Certificates sold in
offshore transactions in reliance on Regulation S shall be issued initially in
the form of one or more permanent global Certificates in definitive, fully
registered form without interest coupons with the applicable legends set forth
in Exhibit A hereto added to the forms of such Certificates (each, a "Regulation
S Global Security"), which, in the case of the Class A3, Class B4, Class B5 and
Class B6 Certificates, shall be deposited on behalf of the subscribers for such
Certificates represented thereby with the Trustee, as custodian for DTC and
registered in the name of a nominee of DTC, duly executed and authenticated by
the Trustee as hereinafter provided. The aggregate principal amounts of the
Regulation S Global Securities may from time to time be increased or decreased
by adjustments made on the records of the Trustee or DTC or its nominee, as the
case may be, as hereinafter provided.


                                       51
<PAGE>

         The Class A3, Class B4, Class B5 or Class B6 Certificates sold to an
"accredited investor" under Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the Act shall
be issued initially in the form of one or more Definitive Certificates.

               Section 3.02.     Registration.

         The Trustee is hereby appointed, and hereby accepts its appointment as,
Certificate Registrar in respect of the Certificates and shall maintain books
for the registration and for the transfer of Certificates (the "Certificate
Register"). The Trustee may appoint a bank or trust company to act as
Certificate Registrar. A registration book shall be maintained for the
Certificates collectively. The Certificate Registrar may resign or be discharged
or removed and a new successor may be appointed in accordance with the
procedures and requirements set forth in Sections 6.06 and 6.07 hereof with
respect to the resignation, discharge or removal of the Trustee and the
appointment of a successor trustee. The Certificate Registrar may appoint, by a
written instrument delivered to the Holders and the Master Servicer, any bank or
trust company to act as co-registrar under such conditions as the Certificate
Registrar may prescribe; provided, however, that the Certificate Registrar shall
not be relieved of any of its duties or responsibilities hereunder by reason of
such appointment.

               Section 3.03.     Transfer and Exchange of Certificates.

         (a) A Certificate (other than Book-Entry Certificates which shall be
subject to Section 3.09 hereof) may be transferred by the Holder thereof only
upon presentation and surrender of such Certificate at the office of the
Certificate Registrar duly endorsed or accompanied by an assignment duly
executed by such Holder or his duly authorized attorney in such form as shall be
satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar. Upon the transfer of any Certificate
in accordance with the preceding sentence, the Trustee shall execute, and the
Trustee or any Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver to the
transferee, one or more new Certificates of the same Class and evidencing, in
the aggregate, the same aggregate Certificate Principal Amount as the
Certificate being transferred. No service charge shall be made to a
Certificateholder for any registration of transfer of Certificates, but the
Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax
or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any registration
of transfer of Certificates.

         (b) A Certificate may be exchanged by the Holder thereof for any number
of new Certificates of the same Class, in authorized denominations, representing
in the aggregate the same Certificate Principal Amount as the Certificate
surrendered, upon surrender of the Certificate to be exchanged at the office of
the Certificate Registrar duly endorsed or accompanied by a written instrument
of transfer duly executed by such Holder or his duly authorized attorney in such
form as is satisfactory to the Certificate Registrar. Certificates delivered
upon any such exchange will evidence the same obligations, and will be entitled
to the same rights and privileges, as the Certificates surrendered. No service
charge shall be made to a Certificateholder for any exchange of Certificates,
but the Certificate Registrar may require payment of a sum sufficient to cover
any tax or governmental charge that may be imposed in connection with any
exchange of Certificates. Whenever any Certificates are so surrendered for
exchange, the Trustee shall execute, and the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent
shall



                                       52
<PAGE>

authenticate, date and deliver the Certificates which the Certificateholder
making the exchange is entitled to receive.

         (c) By acceptance of a Restricted Certificate or a Regulation S Global
Security, whether upon original issuance or subsequent transfer, each Holder of
such a Certificate acknowledges the restrictions on the transfer of such
Certificate set forth thereon and agrees that it will transfer such a
Certificate only as provided herein. In addition, each Holder of a Regulation S
Global Security shall be deemed to have represented and warranted to the
Trustee, the Certificate Registrar and any of their respective successors that:
(i) such Person (A) if the offer or sale was made to it prior to the expiration
of the 40-day distribution compliance period within the meaning of Regulation S,
is not a U.S. person within the meaning of Regulation S and (B) was, at the time
the buy order was originated, outside the United States and (ii) such Person
understands that such Certificates have not been registered under the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended (the "Act"), and that (x) until the expiration of the
40-day distribution compliance period (within the meaning of Regulation S), no
offer, sale, pledge or other transfer of such Certificates or any interest
therein shall be made in the United States or to or for the account or benefit
of a U.S. person (each as defined in Regulation S), (y) if in the future it
decides to offer, resell, pledge or otherwise transfer such Certificates, such
Certificates may be offered, resold, pledged or otherwise transferred only (A)
to a person which the seller reasonably believes is a "qualified institutional
buyer" (a "QIB") as defined in Rule 144A under the Act, that is purchasing such
Certificates for its own account or for the account of a qualified institutional
buyer to which notice is given that the transfer is being made in reliance on
Rule 144A or (B) in an offshore transaction (as defined in Regulation S) in
compliance with the provisions of Regulation S, in each case in compliance with
the requirements of this Agreement; and it will notify such transferee of the
transfer restrictions specified in this Section.

         The following restrictions shall apply with respect to the transfer and
registration of transfer of a Restricted Certificate to a transferee that takes
delivery in the form of a Definitive Certificate:

              (i) The Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of a
         Restricted Certificate if the requested transfer is (x) to the
         Depositor or the Placement Agent or to an affiliate (as defined in Rule
         405 under the Act) of the Depositor or the Placement Agent or (y) being
         made to a QIB by a transferor that has provided the Trustee with a
         certificate in the form of Exhibit F hereto; and

              (ii) The Certificate Registrar shall register the transfer of a
         Restricted Certificate if the requested transfer is being made to an
         "accredited investor" under Rule 501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) under the
         Act by a transferor who furnishes to the Trustee a letter of the
         transferee substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto.

         (d) No transfer of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate in the form of a
Definitive Certificate shall be made to any Person or shall be effective unless
the Trustee has received (A) a certificate substantially in the form of Exhibit
H hereto (or Exhibit D-1, in the case of a Residual Certificate) from such
transferee or (B) an Opinion of Counsel reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee
to the effect that the purchase and holding of such a Certificate will not
constitute or result in prohibited transactions under Title I of ERISA or
Section 4975 of the Code and will not



                                       53
<PAGE>

subject the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Depositor to any obligation in
addition to those undertaken in the Agreement; provided, however, that the
Trustee will not require such certificate or opinion in the event that, as a
result of a change of law or otherwise, the Trustee receives an Opinion of
Counsel to the effect that the purchase and holding of an ERISA-Restricted
Certificate by a Plan or a Person that is purchasing or holding such a
Certificate with the assets of a Plan will not constitute or result in a
prohibited transaction under Title I of ERISA or Section 4975 of the Code. Each
Transferee of an ERISA-Restricted Certificate that is a Book-Entry Certificate
shall be deemed to have made the representations set forth in Exhibit H. The
preparation and delivery of the certificate and opinions referred to above shall
not be an expense of the Trust Fund, the Trustee, the Master Servicer or the
Depositor.

         Notwithstanding the foregoing, no opinion or certificate shall be
required for the initial issuance of the ERISA-Restricted Certificates. The
Trustee shall have no obligation to monitor transfers of Book-Entry Certificates
that are ERISA-Restricted Certificates and shall have no liability for transfers
of such Certificates in violation of the transfer restrictions. The Trustee
shall be under no liability to any Person for any registration of transfer of
any ERISA-Restricted Certificate that is in fact not permitted by this Section
3.03(d) or for making any payments due on such Certificate to the Holder thereof
or taking any other action with respect to such Holder under the provisions of
this Agreement so long as the transfer was registered by the Trustee in
accordance with the foregoing requirements. The Trustee shall be entitled, but
not obligated, to recover from any Holder of any ERISA-Restricted Certificate
that was in fact a Plan or a Person acting on behalf of a Plan any payments made
on such ERISA-Restricted Certificate at and after either such time. Any such
payments so recovered by the Trustee shall be paid and delivered by the Trustee
to the last preceding Holder of such Certificate that is not such a Plan or
Person acting on behalf of a Plan.

         (e) As a condition of the registration of transfer or exchange of any
Certificate, the Certificate Registrar may require the certified taxpayer
identification number of the owner of the Certificate and the payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge imposed in connection
therewith; provided, however, that the Certificate Registrar shall have no
obligation to require such payment or to determine whether or not any such tax
or charge may be applicable. No service charge shall be made to the
Certificateholder for any registration, transfer or exchange of Certificate.

         (f) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, no
Residual Certificate may be owned, pledged or transferred, directly or
indirectly, by or to (i) a Disqualified Organization or (ii) an individual,
corporation or partnership or other person unless, in the case of clause (ii),
such person is (A) not a Non-U.S. Person or (B) is a Non-U.S. Person that holds
a Residual Certificate in connection with the conduct of a trade or business
within the United States and has furnished the transferor and the Trustee with
an effective Internal Revenue Service Form W-8ECI or successor form at the time
and in the manner required by the Code (any such person who is not covered by
clause (A) or (B) above is referred to herein as a "Non-permitted Foreign
Holder").

         Prior to and as a condition of the registration of any transfer, sale
or other disposition of a Residual Certificate, the proposed transferee shall
deliver to the Trustee an affidavit in



                                       54
<PAGE>

substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-1 representing and
warranting, among other things, that such transferee is neither a Disqualified
Organization, an agent or nominee acting on behalf of a Disqualified
Organization, nor a Non-permitted Foreign Holder (any such transferee, a
"Permitted Transferee") and the proposed transferor shall deliver to the Trustee
an affidavit in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit D-2. In
addition, the Trustee may (but shall have no obligation to) require, prior to
and as a condition of any such transfer, the delivery by the proposed transferee
of an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to the Depositor and the Trustee
satisfactory in form and substance to the Depositor, that such proposed
transferee or, if the proposed transferee is an agent or nominee, the proposed
beneficial owner, is not a Disqualified Organization, agent or nominee thereof,
or Non-permitted Foreign Holder. Notwithstanding the registration in the
Certificate Register of any transfer, sale, or other disposition of a Residual
Certificate to a Disqualified Organization, an agent or nominee thereof, or
Non-permitted Foreign Holder, such registration shall be deemed to be of no
legal force or effect whatsoever and such Disqualified Organization, agent or
nominee thereof, or Non-permitted Foreign Holder shall not be deemed to be a
Certificateholder for any purpose hereunder, including, but not limited to, the
receipt of distributions on such Residual Certificate. The Trustee shall not be
under any liability to any person for any registration or transfer of a Residual
Certificate to a Disqualified Organization, agent or nominee thereof, or
Non-permitted Foreign Holder or for the maturity of any payments due on such
Residual Certificate to the Holder thereof or for taking any other action with
respect to such Holder under the provisions of the Agreement, so long as the
transfer was effected in accordance with this Section 3.03(f), unless the
Trustee shall have actual knowledge at the time of such transfer or the time of
such payment or other action that the transferee is a Disqualified Organization,
agent or nominee thereof, or Non-permitted Foreign Holder. The Trustee shall be
entitled to recover from any Holder of a Residual Certificate that was a
Disqualified Organization, agent or nominee thereof, or Non-permitted Foreign
Holder at the time it became a Holder or any subsequent time it became a
Disqualified Organization, agent or nominee thereof, or Non-permitted Foreign
Holder, all payments made on such Residual Certificate at and after either such
times (and all costs and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees,
incurred in connection therewith). Any payment (not including any such costs and
expenses) so recovered by the Trustee shall be paid and delivered to the last
preceding Holder of such Residual Certificate.

         If any purported transferee shall become a registered Holder of a
Residual Certificate in violation of the provisions of this Section 3.03(f),
then upon receipt of written notice to the Trustee that the registration of
transfer of such Residual Certificate was not in fact permitted by this Section
3.03(f), the last preceding Permitted Transferee shall be restored to all rights
as Holder thereof retroactive to the date of such registration of transfer of
such Residual Certificate. The Trustee shall be under no liability to any Person
for any registration of transfer of a Residual Certificate that is in fact not
permitted by this Section 3.03(f), for making any payment due on such
Certificate to the registered Holder thereof or for taking any other action with
respect to such Holder under the provisions of this Agreement so long as the
transfer was registered upon receipt of the affidavit described in the preceding
paragraph of this Section 3.03(f).

         (g) Each Holder of a Residual Certificate, by such Holder's acceptance
thereof, shall be deemed for all purposes to have consented to the provisions of
this section.



                                       55
<PAGE>

         (h) Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary herein, so long as a
Global Security representing any of the Class B4, Class B5 or Class B6
Certificates remains outstanding and is held by or on behalf of DTC, transfers
of a Global Security representing any such Certificates, in whole or in part,
shall only be made in accordance with Section 3.01 and this Section 3.03(h).

                   (A) Subject to clauses (B) and (C) of this Section 3.03(h),
              transfers of a Global Security representing any of the Class B4,
              Class B5 or Class B6 Certificates shall be limited to transfers of
              such Global Security, in whole or in part, to nominees of DTC or
              to a successor of DTC or such successor's nominee.

                   (B) Restricted Global Security to Regulation S Global
              Security. If a holder of a beneficial interest in a Restricted
              Global Security deposited with or on behalf of DTC wishes at any
              time to exchange its interest in such Restricted Global Security
              for an interest in a Regulation S Global Security, or to transfer
              its interest in such Restricted Global Security to a Person who
              wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an interest in a
              Regulation S Global Security, such holder, provided such holder is
              not a U.S. person, may, subject to the rules and procedures of
              DTC, exchange or cause the exchange of such interest for an
              equivalent beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global
              Security. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Certificate Registrar,
              of (I) instructions from DTC directing the Trustee, as Certificate
              Registrar, to cause to be credited a beneficial interest in a
              Regulation S Global Security in an amount equal to the beneficial
              interest in such Restricted Global Security to be exchanged but
              not less than the minimum denomination applicable to such holder's
              Certificates held through a Regulation S Global Security, (II) a
              written order given in accordance with DTC's procedures containing
              information regarding the participant account of DTC and, in the
              case of a transfer pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation
              S, the Euroclear or Clearstream account to be credited with such
              increase and (III) a certificate in the form of Exhibit N-1 hereto
              given by the holder of such beneficial interest stating that the
              exchange or transfer of such interest has been made in compliance
              with the transfer restrictions applicable to the Regulation S
              Global Securities, including that the holder is not a U.S. person,
              and pursuant to and in accordance with Regulation S, the Trustee,
              as Certificate Registrar, shall reduce the principal amount of the
              Restricted Global Security and increase the principal amount of
              the Regulation S Global Security by the aggregate principal amount
              of the beneficial interest in the Restricted Global Security to be
              exchanged, and shall instruct Euroclear or Clearstream, as
              applicable, concurrently with such reduction, to credit or cause
              to be credited to the account of the Person specified in such
              instructions a beneficial interest in the Regulation S Global
              Security equal to the reduction in the principal amount of the
              Restricted Global Security.

                   (C) Regulation S Global Security to Restricted Global
              Security. If a holder of a beneficial interest in a Regulation S
              Global Security deposited with or on behalf of DTC wishes at any
              time to transfer its interest in such Regulation S Global Security
              to a Person who wishes to take delivery thereof in the form of an
              interest in a Restricted Global Security, such holder may, subject
              to the rules and


                                       56
<PAGE>

              procedures DTC, exchange or cause the exchange of such interest
              for an equivalent beneficial interest in a Restricted Global
              Security. Upon receipt by the Trustee, as Certificate Registrar,
              of (I) instructions from DTC directing the Trustee, as Certificate
              Registrar, to cause to be credited a beneficial interest in a
              Restricted Global Security in an amount equal to the beneficial
              interest in such Regulation S Global Security to be exchanged but
              not less than the minimum denomination applicable to such holder's
              Certificates held through a Restricted Global Security, to be
              exchanged, such instructions to contain information regarding the
              participant account with DTC to be credited with such increase,
              and (II) a certificate in the form of Exhibit N-2 hereto given by
              the holder of such beneficial interest and stating, among other
              things, that the Person transferring such interest in such
              Regulation S Global Security reasonably believes that the Person
              acquiring such interest in a Restricted Global Security is a QIB,
              is obtaining such beneficial interest in a transaction meeting the
              requirements of Rule 144A and in accordance with any applicable
              securities laws of any State of the United States or any other
              jurisdiction, then the Trustee, as Certificate Registrar, will
              reduce the principal amount of the Regulation S Global Security
              and increase the principal amount of the Restricted Global
              Security by the aggregate principal amount of the beneficial
              interest in the Regulation S Global Security to be transferred and
              the Trustee, as Certificate Registrar, shall instruct DTC,
              concurrently with such reduction, to credit or cause to be
              credited to the account of the Person specified in such
              instructions a beneficial interest in the Restricted Global
              Security equal to the reduction in the principal amount of the
              Regulation S Global Security.

                   (D) Other Exchanges. In the event that a Global Security is
              exchanged for Certificates in definitive registered form without
              interest coupons, pursuant to Section 3.09(c) hereof, such
              Certificates may be exchanged for one another only in accordance
              with such procedures as are substantially consistent with the
              provisions above (including certification requirements intended to
              insure that such transfers comply with Rule 144A, comply with Rule
              501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) or are to non-U.S. persons in
              compliance with Regulation S under the Act, as the case may be),
              and as may be from time to time adopted by the Trustee.

                   (E) Restrictions on U.S. Transfers. Transfers of interests in
              a Regulation S Global Security to U.S. persons (as defined in
              Regulation S) shall be limited to transfers made pursuant to the
              provisions of Section 3.03(h)(C).

               Section 3.04.     Cancellation of Certificates.

         Any Certificate surrendered for registration of transfer or exchange
shall be cancelled and retained in accordance with normal retention policies
with respect to cancelled certificates maintained by the Trustee or the
Certificate Registrar.

               Section 3.05.     Replacement of Certificates.

         If (i) any Certificate is mutilated and is surrendered to the Trustee
or any Authenticating Agent or (ii) the Trustee or any Authenticating Agent
receives evidence to its satisfaction of the destruction, loss or theft of any
Certificate, and there is delivered to the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent
such security or indemnity as may be required by them to save each of them
harmless, then, in the absence of notice to the Depositor and any Authenticating
Agent that such destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate has been acquired by a
bona fide purchaser, the Trustee shall execute and the Trustee or any
Authenticating Agent shall authenticate and deliver, in exchange for or in lieu
of any such mutilated, destroyed, lost or stolen Certificate, a new Certificate
of like tenor and Certificate Principal Amount. Upon the issuance of any new
Certificate under this Section 3.05, the Trustee and Authenticating Agent may
require the payment of a sum sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental
charge that may be imposed in relation thereto and any other expenses (including
the fees and expenses of the Trustee or the Authenticating Agent) connected
therewith. Any replacement Certificate issued pursuant to this Section 3.05
shall constitute complete and indefeasible evidence of ownership in the
applicable Trust Fund, as if originally issued, whether or not the lost, stolen
or destroyed Certificate shall be found at any time.

               Section 3.06.     Persons Deemed Owners.

         Subject to the provisions of Section 3.09 with respect to Book-Entry
Certificates, the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate
Registrar and any agent of any of them may treat the Person in whose name any
Certificate is registered upon the books of the Certificate Registrar as the
owner of such Certificate for the purpose of receiving distributions pursuant to
Sections 5.01 and 5.02 and for all other purposes whatsoever, and none of the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee, the Certificate Registrar or any
agent of any of them shall be affected by notice to the contrary.

               Section 3.07.     Temporary Certificates.

         (a) Pending the preparation of definitive Certificates, upon the order
of the Depositor, the Trustee shall execute and shall authenticate and deliver
temporary Certificates that are printed, lithographed, typewritten, mimeographed
or otherwise produced, in any authorized denomination, substantially of the
tenor of the definitive Certificates in lieu of which they are issued and with
such variations as the authorized officers executing such Certificates may
determine, as evidenced by their execution of such Certificates.

         (b) If temporary Certificates are issued, the Depositor will cause
definitive Certificates to be prepared without unreasonable delay. After the
preparation of definitive Certificates, the temporary Certificates shall be
exchangeable for definitive Certificates upon surrender of the temporary
Certificates at the office or agency of the Trustee without charge to the
Holder. Upon surrender for cancellation of any one or more temporary
Certificates, the Trustee shall execute and authenticate and deliver in exchange
therefor a like aggregate Certificate Principal Amount of definitive
Certificates of the same Class in the authorized denominations. Until so
exchanged, the temporary Certificates shall in all respects be entitled to the
same benefits under this Agreement as definitive Certificates of the same Class.

               Section 3.08.     Appointment of Paying Agent.

         The Trustee may appoint a Paying Agent (which may be the Trustee) for
the purpose of making distributions to Certificateholders hereunder. The Trustee
shall cause such Paying Agent (if other than the Trustee) to execute and deliver
to the Trustee an instrument in which such Paying Agent shall agree with the
Trustee that such Paying Agent will hold all sums held by it for the payment to
Certificateholders in an Eligible Account in trust for the benefit of the
Certificateholders entitled thereto until such sums shall be paid to the
Certificateholders. All funds remitted by the Trustee to any such Paying Agent
for the purpose of making distributions shall be paid to Certificateholders on
each Distribution Date and any amounts not so paid shall be returned on such
Distribution Date to the Trustee. If the Paying Agent is not the Trustee, the
Trustee shall cause to be remitted to the Paying Agent on or before the Business
Day prior to each Distribution Date, by wire transfer in immediately available
funds, the funds to be distributed on such Distribution Date. Any Paying Agent
shall be either a bank or trust company or otherwise authorized under law to
exercise corporate trust powers.

               Section 3.09.     Book-Entry Certificates.

              (i) Each Class of Book-Entry Certificates, upon original issuance,
         shall be issued in the form of one or more typewritten Certificates
         representing the Book-Entry Certificates, to be delivered to The
         Depository Trust Company, or its custodian, the initial Clearing
         Agency, by, or on behalf of, the Depositor. The Book-Entry Certificates
         shall initially be registered on the Certificate Register in the name
         of the nominee of the Clearing Agency, and no Certificate Owner will
         receive a definitive certificate representing such Certificate Owner's
         interest in the Book-Entry Certificates, except as provided in Section
         3.09(c). Unless Definitive Certificates have been issued to Certificate
         Owners of Book-Entry Certificates pursuant to Section 3.09(c):

              (ii) the provisions of this Section 3.09 shall be in full force
         and effect;

              (iii) the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Paying Agent, the
         Certificate Registrar and the Trustee may deal with the Clearing Agency
         for all purposes (including the making of distributions on the
         Book-Entry Certificates) as the authorized representatives of the
         Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency shall be responsible for
         crediting the amount of such distributions to the accounts of such
         Persons entitled thereto, in accordance with the Clearing Agency's
         normal procedures;

              (iv) to the extent that the provisions of this Section 3.09
         conflict with any other provisions of this Agreement, the provisions of
         this Section 3.09 shall control; and

              (v) the rights of Certificate Owners shall be exercised only
         through the Clearing Agency and the Clearing Agency Participants and
         shall be limited to those established by law and agreements between
         such Certificate Owners and the Clearing Agency and/or the Clearing
         Agency Participants. Unless and until Definitive Certificates are
         issued pursuant to Section 3.09(c), the initial Clearing Agency will
         make book-entry transfers among the Clearing Agency Participants and
         receive and transmit distributions



                                       59
<PAGE>

         of principal of and interest on the Book-Entry Certificates to such
         Clearing Agency Participants.

         (b) Whenever notice or other communication to the Certificateholders is
required under this Agreement, unless and until Definitive Certificates shall
have been issued to Certificate Owners pursuant to Section 3.09(c), the Trustee
shall give all such notices and communications specified herein to be given to
Holders of the Book-Entry Certificates to the Clearing Agency.

         (c) If (i) (A) the Depositor advises the Trustee in writing that the
Clearing Agency is no longer willing or able to discharge properly its
responsibilities with respect to the Book-Entry Certificates, and (B) the
Depositor is unable to locate a qualified successor or (ii) after the occurrence
of an Event of Default, Certificate Owners representing beneficial interests
aggregating not less than 50% of the Class Principal Amount of a Class of
Book-Entry Certificates identified as such to the Trustee by an Officer's
Certificate from the Clearing Agency advise the Trustee and the Clearing Agency
through the Clearing Agency Participants in writing that the continuation of a
book-entry system through the Clearing Agency is no longer in the best interests
of the Certificate Owners of a Class of Book-Entry Certificates, the Trustee
shall notify or cause the Certificate Registrar to notify the Clearing Agency to
effect notification to all Certificate Owners, through the Clearing Agency, of
the occurrence of any such event and of the availability of Definitive
Certificates to Certificate Owners requesting the same. Upon surrender to the
Trustee of the Book-Entry Certificates by the Clearing Agency, accompanied by
registration instructions from the Clearing Agency for registration, the Trustee
shall issue the Definitive Certificates. Neither the Transferor nor the Trustee
shall be liable for any delay in delivery of such instructions and may
conclusively rely on, and shall be protected in relying on, such instructions.
Upon the issuance of Definitive Certificates all references herein to
obligations imposed upon or to be performed by the Clearing Agency shall be
deemed to be imposed upon and performed by the Trustee, to the extent
applicable, with respect to such Definitive Certificates and the Trustee shall
recognize the holders of the Definitive Certificates as Certificateholders
hereunder.

                                   ARTICLE IV

               Section 4.01.     Collection Account.

         (a) On the Closing Date, the Master Servicer shall open and shall
thereafter maintain a segregated account held in trust (the "Collection

the benefit of the Holders of Structured Asset Securities Corporation Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-22." The Collection Account shall relate
solely to the Certificates issued by the Trust Fund hereunder, and funds in such
Collection Account shall not be commingled with any other monies.

         (b) The Collection Account shall be an Eligible Account. If an existing
Collection Account ceases to be an Eligible Account, the Master Servicer shall
establish a new Collection Account that is an Eligible Account within 30 days

new Collection Account.


                                       60
<PAGE>

         (c) The Master Servicer shall give to the Trustee prior written notice
of the name and address of the depository institution at which the Collection
Account is maintained and the account number of such Collection Account. On each
Deposit Date, the entire amount on deposit in the Collection Account (subject to
permitted withdrawals set forth in Section 4.02), excluding any amounts that are
not included in the Available Distribution Amount for such Distribution Date
(other than amounts due or reimbursable to the Trustee pursuant to this
Agreement), shall be remitted to the Trustee for deposit into the Certificate
Account by wire transfer in immediately available funds. The Master Servicer, at
its option and with prior notice to the Trustee, may choose to make daily
remittances from the Collection Account to the Trustee for deposit into the
Certificate Account.

         (d) The Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited into the
Collection Account, no later than the Business Day following the Closing Date,

Cut-off Date and received by the Master Servicer on or before the Closing Date.
Thereafter, the Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited in the
Collection Account on the applicable Remittance Date the following amounts
received or payments made by it (other than in respect of principal of and
interest on the Mortgage Loans due on or before the Cut-Off Date):

              (i) all payments on account of principal, including Principal
         Prepayments, late collections and any Prepayment Penalty Amounts with
         respect to those Mortgage Loans for which the Seller owns the servicing
         rights, as indicated in the Mortgage Loan Schedule, on the Mortgage
         Loans;

              (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
         (other than payments due prior to the Cut-off Date), net of the
         applicable Servicing Fee and Master Servicing Fee with respect to each
         such Mortgage Loan, but only to the extent of the amount permitted to
         be withdrawn or withheld from the Collection Account in accordance with
         Sections 5.04 and 9.21;

              (iii) any unscheduled payment or other recovery with respect to a
         Mortgage Loan not otherwise specified in this paragraph (d), including
         any Subsequent Recovery, all Net Liquidation Proceeds with respect to
         the Mortgage Loans and REO Property, and all amounts received in
         connection with the operation of any REO Property, net of any unpaid
         Servicing Fees and Master Servicing Fees with respect to such Mortgage
         Loans, but only to the extent of the amount permitted to be withdrawn
         or withheld from the Collection Account in accordance with Sections
         5.04 and 9.21; provided that if the applicable Servicer is also the
         Retained Interest Holder with respect to any Mortgage Loan, payments on
         account of interest on the Mortgage Loans as to which such Servicer is
         the Retained Interest Holder may also be made net of the related
         Retained Interest with respect to each such Mortgage Loan.

              (iv) all Insurance Proceeds;

              (v) all Advances made by the Master Servicer or any Servicer
         pursuant to Section 5.04 or the applicable Servicing Agreement; and



                                       61
<PAGE>

              (vi) all proceeds of any Mortgage Loan purchased by any Person and
         any Substitution Amounts related to any Qualifying Substitute Mortgage
         Loan.

         (e) Funds in the Collection Account may be invested in Eligible
Investments (selected by and at the written direction of the Master Servicer)
which shall mature not later than the earlier of (a) the Deposit Date or (b) the
day on which the funds in such Collection Account are required to be remitted to
the Trustee for deposit into the Certificate Account, and any such Eligible
Investment shall not be sold or disposed of prior to its maturity. All such
Eligible Investments shall be made in the name of the Master Servicer in trust
for the benefit of the Trustee and Holders of the Structured Asset Securities
Corporation Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-22. All income and
gain realized from any such investment shall be for the benefit of the Master
Servicer as additional compensation and shall be subject to its withdrawal on
order from time to time, and shall not be part of the Trust Fund. The amount of
any losses incurred in respect of any such investments shall be deposited in the
Collection Account by the Master Servicer out of its own funds, without any
right of reimbursement therefor, immediately as realized. The foregoing
requirements for deposit in the Collection Account are exclusive, it being
understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
payments of interest on funds in the Collection Account and payments in the
nature of late payment charges or assumption fees and Prepayment Penalty Amounts
with respect to those Mortgage Loans for which the Seller does not own the
servicing rights (as indicated in the Mortgage Loan Schedule), need not be
deposited by the Master Servicer in the Collection Account and may be retained
by the Master Servicer or the applicable Servicer as additional servicing
compensation. If the Master Servicer deposits in the Collection Account any
amount not required to be deposited therein, it may at any time withdraw such
amount from the Collection Account.

               Section 4.02.     Application of Funds in the Collection Account.

         The Master Servicer may, from time to time, make, or cause to be made,
withdrawals from the Collection Account for the following purposes:

              (i) to reimburse itself or any Servicer for Advances made by it or
         by such Servicer pursuant to Section 5.04 or the applicable Servicing
         Agreement; provided, however, that the Master Servicer's right to
         reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause is limited to amounts
         received on or in respect of particular Mortgage Loans (including, for
         this purpose, Liquidation Proceeds and amounts representing Insurance
         Proceeds with respect to the property subject to the related Mortgage)
         which represent late recoveries (net of the applicable Servicing Fee
         and the Master Servicing Fee) of payments of principal or interest
         respecting which any such Advance was made; provided, further, that
         following the final liquidation of a Mortgage Loan, the Master Servicer
         may reimburse itself for previously unreimbursed Advances in excess of
         Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds with respect to such
         Mortgage Loans from any funds in the Collection Account, it being
         understood, in the case of any such reimbursement, that the Master
         Servicer's or Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the rights of
         the Certificateholders;

              (ii) to reimburse itself or any Servicer for any previously
         unreimbursed Advances or Servicing Advances made by it or by such
         Servicer that it or such Servicer



                                       62

         determines in good faith will not be recoverable from amounts
         representing late recoveries of payments of principal or interest
         respecting the particular Mortgage Loan as to which such Advance or
         Servicing Advance was made or from Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance
         Proceeds with respect to such Mortgage Loan, it being understood, in
         the case of any such reimbursement, that such Master Servicer's or
         Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the
         Certificateholders;

              (iii) to reimburse itself or any Servicer from Liquidation
         Proceeds for Liquidation Expenses and for amounts expended by it
         pursuant to Sections 9.20 and 9.22(a) or the applicable Servicing
         Agreement in good faith in connection with the restoration of damaged
         property and, to the extent that Liquidation Proceeds after such
         reimbursement exceed the unpaid principal balance of the related
         Mortgage Loan, together with accrued and unpaid interest thereon at the
         applicable Mortgage Rate less the applicable Servicing Fee and the
         Master Servicing Fee for such Mortgage Loan to the Due Date next
         succeeding the date of its receipt of such Liquidation Proceeds, to pay
         to itself out of such excess the amount of any unpaid assumption fees,
         late payment charges or other Mortgagor charges on the related Mortgage
         Loan and to retain any excess remaining thereafter as additional
         servicing compensation, it being understood, in the case of any such
         reimbursement or payment, that such Master Servicer's or Servicer's
         right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the Certificateholders;

              (iv) to reimburse itself or any Servicer for expenses incurred by
         and recoverable by or reimbursable to it or such Servicer pursuant to
         Section 9.04, 9.05, 9.06, 9.16 or 9.22(a) or pursuant to the applicable
         Servicing Agreement, and to reimburse itself for any expenses
         reimbursable to it pursuant to Section 10.01(c);

              (v) to pay to the applicable Person, with respect to each Mortgage
         Loan or REO Property acquired in respect thereof that has been
         repurchased by such Person pursuant to this Agreement, all amounts
         received thereon and not distributed on the date on which the related
         repurchase was effected;

              (vi) subject to Section 5.05, to pay to itself income earned on
         the investment of funds deposited in the Collection Account;

              (vii) to make payments to the Trustee for deposit into the
         Certificate Account in the amounts and in the manner provided for in
         Section 4.01(c);

              (viii) to make distributions of any Retained Interest to the
         Retained Interest Holder on each Distribution Date (other than any
         Retained Interest not deposited into the Collection Account in
         accordance with Section 4.01(d)(iii));

              (ix) to make payment to itself, the Trustee and others pursuant to
         any provision of this Agreement;

              (x) to withdraw funds deposited in error in the Collection

              (xii) to reimburse a successor Master Servicer (solely in its
         capacity as successor Master Servicer), for any fee or advance
         occasioned by a termination of the Master Servicer, and the assumption
         of such duties by the Trustee or a successor Master Servicer appointed
         by the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.14, in each case to the extent not
         reimbursed by the terminated Master Servicer, it being understood, in
         the case of any such reimbursement or payment, that the right of the
         Master Servicer or the Trustee thereto shall be prior to the rights of
         the Certificateholders; and

              (xiii) to reimburse any Servicer for such amounts as are due
         thereto under the applicable Servicing Agreement and have not been
         retained by or paid to such Servicer to the extent provided in such
         Servicing Agreement.

         If provided in the related Servicing Agreement, each Servicer shall be
entitled to retain as additional servicing compensation any Prepayment Interest
Excess (to the extent not offset by Prepayment Interest Shortfalls).

         In the event that the Master Servicer fails on any Deposit Date to
remit to the Trustee any amounts required to be so remitted to the Trustee
pursuant to subclause (vii) on such date, the Master Servicer shall pay the
Trustee, for the account of the Trustee, interest calculated at the "prime rate"
(as published in the "Money Rates" section of The Wall Street Journal) on such
amounts not timely remitted for the period from and including that Deposit Date
to but not including the related Distribution Date.

         In connection with withdrawals pursuant to subclauses (i), (iii) and
(v) above, the Master Servicer's or Servicer's entitlement thereto is limited to
collections or other recoveries on the related Mortgage Loan, except as provided
herein. The Master Servicer shall therefore keep and maintain a separate
accounting for each Mortgage Loan it master services for the purpose of
justifying any withdrawal from the Collection Account it maintains pursuant to
subclauses (i), (iii) and (v) above.

               Section 4.03.     Reports to Certificateholders.

         (a) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall prepare (based solely

         such Realized Losses, and the remaining Special Hazard Loss Amount,
         Fraud Loss Amount and Bankruptcy Loss Amount;

              (viii) the amount of the Master Servicing Fees and Servicing Fees

         In the case of information furnished pursuant to subclauses (i), (ii)
and (vii) above, the amounts shall be expressed as a dollar amount per $1,000 of
original principal amount of Certificates.

         The Trustee will make such report and additional loan level information
(and, at its option, any additional files provided by the Master Servicer
containing the same information in an alternative format) available each month
to the Certificateholders and the Rating Agencies via the Trustee's internet
website. The Trustee's internet website shall initially be located at
www.sf.citidirect.com. Such parties that are unable to use the website are
entitled to have a paper copy mailed to them via first class mail upon request.
The Trustee shall have the right to change the way such statements are
distributed in order to make such distribution more convenient and/or more
accessible to the above-parties and the Trustee shall provide timely and
adequate notification to all above-parties regarding any such changes.

         The foregoing information and reports shall be prepared and determined
by the Trustee based solely on Mortgage Loan data provided to the Trustee by the
Master Servicer (in a format agreed to by the Trustee and the Master Servicer)
no later than 12:00 p.m.(noon) Eastern Time four Business Days prior to the
Distribution Date. In preparing or furnishing Mortgage Loan data to the Trustee,
the Master Servicer shall be entitled to rely conclusively on the accuracy of
the information or data regarding the Mortgage Loans and the related REO
Property that has been provided to the Master Servicer by each Servicer, and the
Master Servicer shall not be obligated to verify, recompute, reconcile or
recalculate any such information or data. The Trustee shall be entitled to
conclusively rely on the Mortgage Loan data provided by the Master Servicer and
shall have no liability for any errors in such Mortgage Loan data.

         (b) Upon the reasonable advance written request of any
Certificateholder that is a savings and loan, bank or insurance company, which
request, if received by the Trustee, will be promptly forwarded to the Master
Servicer, the Master Servicer shall provide, or cause to be provided, (or, to
the extent that such information or documentation is not required to be provided
by a Servicer under the applicable Servicing Agreement, shall use reasonable
efforts to obtain such information and documentation from such Servicer, and
provide) to such Certificateholder such reports and access to information and
documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans as such Certificateholder may
reasonably deem necessary to comply with applicable regulations of the Office of
Thrift Supervision or its successor or other regulatory authorities with respect
to investment in the Certificates; provided, however, that the Master Servicer
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by such Certificateholder for such Master
Servicer's actual expenses incurred in providing such reports and access.

         (c) Within 90 days, or such shorter period as may be required by
statute or regulation, after the end of each calendar year, the Trustee shall
make available to each Person who at any time during the calendar year was a
Certificateholder of record, a report summarizing the items provided to
Certificateholders pursuant to Section 4.03(a) on an annual basis as may be
required to enable such Holders to prepare their federal income tax returns.
Such information shall include the amount of original issue discount accrued on
each Class of Certificates and information regarding the expenses of the Trust
Fund. The Trustee shall be deemed to have satisfied this requirement if it
forwards such information in any other format permitted by the Code. The Master
Servicer shall provide the Trustee with such information as is necessary for the
Trustee to prepare such reports.

               Section 4.04.     Certificate Account.

         (a) The Trustee shall establish and maintain in its name, as trustee, a
trust account (the "Certificate Account"), to be held in trust for the benefit
of the Certificateholders until disbursed pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement. The Certificate Account shall be an Eligible Account. If the existing
Certificate Account ceases to be an Eligible Account, the Trustee shall
establish a new Certificate Account that is an Eligible Account within 20
Business Days and transfer all funds on deposit in such existing Certificate
Account into such new Certificate Account. The Certificate Account shall relate
solely to the Certificates issued hereunder and funds in the Certificate Account
shall be held separate and apart from and shall not be commingled with any other
monies including, without limitation, other monies of the Trustee held under
this Agreement.

         (b) The Trustee shall cause to be deposited into the Certificate
Account on the day on which, or, if such day is not a Business Day, the Business
Day immediately following the day on which, any monies are remitted by the
Master Servicer to the Trustee, all such amounts. The Trustee shall make
withdrawals from the Certificate Account only for the following purposes:

              (i) to withdraw amounts deposited in the Certificate Account in
         error;

              (ii) to pay itself any investment income earned with respect to
         funds in the Certificate Account invested in Eligible Investments as
         set forth in subsection (c) below, and to make payments to itself prior
         to making distributions pursuant to Section 5.02 for



                                       67
<PAGE>

         any expenses or other indemnification owing to the Trustee and others
         pursuant to any provision of this Agreement or the Custodial Agreements
         (to the extent payment of such expenses or other indemnification
         constitutes "unanticipated expenses" within the meaning of Treasury
         Regulation Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii));

              (iii) to make payments of the Master Servicing Fee (to the extent
         not already withheld or withdrawn from the Collection Account by the
         Master Servicer) to the Master Servicer;

              (iv) to make distributions to the Certificateholders pursuant to
         Article V; and

              (v) to clear and terminate the Certificate Account pursuant to
         Section 7.02.

         (c) The Trustee may invest, or cause to be invested, funds held in the
Certificate Account, which funds, if invested, shall be invested in Eligible
Investments (which may be obligations of the Trustee described in paragraph
(viii) of the definition thereof). All such investments must be payable on
demand or mature no later than the next Distribution Date, and shall not be sold
or disposed of prior to their maturity. All such Eligible Investments will be
made in the name of the Trustee (in its capacity as such) or its nominee. All
income and gain realized from any such investment shall be compensation for the
Trustee and shall be subject to its withdrawal on order from time to time. The
amount of any losses incurred in respect of any such investments shall be paid
by the Trustee for deposit in the Certificate Account out of its own funds,
without any right of reimbursement therefor, immediately as realized. Funds held
in the Certificate Account that are not invested shall be held in cash.

                                   ARTICLE V

                    DISTRIBUTIONS TO HOLDERS OF CERTIFICATES

               Section 5.01.     Distributions Generally.

         (a) Subject to Section 7.01 respecting the final distribution on the
Certificates, on each Distribution Date the Trustee or the Paying Agent shall
make distributions in accordance with this Article V. Such distributions shall
be made by wire transfer in immediately available funds to the account specified
by each Certificateholder or, if no such account is specified by a
Certificateholder, by check to such Certificateholder's address as it appears on
the Certificate Register of the Certificate Registrar; provided, however, that
the final distribution in respect of any Certificate shall be made only upon
presentation and surrender of such Certificate at the applicable Corporate Trust
Office. Distributions on Book-Entry Certificates shall be made by wire transfer.
Notwithstanding such final distribution of principal of any of the Certificates,
each Residual Certificate will remain outstanding until the termination of each
REMIC created hereunder and the payment in full of all other amounts due with
respect to the Residual Certificate and at such time such final payment in
retirement of any Residual Certificate will be made only upon presentation and
surrender of such Certificate at the Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee. If
any payment required to be made on the Certificates is to be made on a day that
is not a Business Day, then such payment will be made on the next succeeding
Business Day.


                                       68

         (b) All distributions or allocations made with respect to
Certificateholders within each Class on each Distribution Date shall be
allocated among the outstanding Certificates in such Class equally in proportion
to their respective initial Certificate Principal Amounts (or initial Notional
Amounts).

         (a) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee (or the Paying Agent on

Holders of record of each Class of Certificates, in the following order of
priority:

              (i) to each Class of Senior Certificates, the Accrued Certificate
         Interest thereon for such Distribution Date, as reduced, in each case,
         by such Class's allocable share of any Net Prepayment Interest

         shortfall in available amounts shall be allocated among the Classes of
         Senior Certificates in proportion to the amount of Accrued Certificate
         Interest (as so reduced) that would otherwise be distributable thereon;
         (2) that on any Distribution Date, if the Class A1 or Class A2
         Certificates are still outstanding after all other payments in
         reduction of their Class Principal Amounts on such Distribution Date,
         then amounts otherwise distributable to the Class A3 Certificates shall
         be paid as principal sequentially to the Class A1 and Class A2
         Certificates, in that order, in reduction of their respective Class
         Principal Amounts until the Class Principal Amount of each such Class
         has been reduced to zero; and (3) that following the Distribution Date
         on which the Minimum Call Price is received, if the Class Principal
         Amounts of Class A1 and Class A2 Certificates have been reduced to
         zero, then amounts otherwise distributable to the Class A3 Certificates
         shall be paid to the Class A2 Certificates until the Class Principal
         Amount of the Class A3 Certificates has been reduced to zero;

              (ii) to each Class of Senior Certificates, any Interest Shortfall
         for such Distribution Date; provided, however, that (1) any shortfall
         in available amounts shall be allocated among the Classes of Senior
         Certificates in proportion to the amount of such interest (as so
         reduced) that would otherwise be distributable thereon; (2) that on any
         Distribution Date, if the Class A1 or Class A2 Certificates are still
         outstanding after all other payments in reduction of their Class
         Principal Amounts on such Distribution Date, then amounts otherwise
         distributable to the Class A3 Certificates shall be paid as principal
         sequentially to the Class A1 and Class A2 Certificates, in that order,
         in reduction of their respective Class Principal Amounts until the
         Class Principal Amount of each such Class has been reduced to zero; and
         (3) that following the Distribution Date on which the Minimum Call
         Price is received, if the Class Principal Amounts of the Class A1 and
         Class A2 Certificates have been reduced to zero, then amounts otherwise
         distributable to the Class A3 Certificates shall be paid to the Class
         A2 Certificates until the Class Principal Amount of the Class A3
         Certificates has been reduced to zero;

              (iii) to payment of the Senior Principal Distribution Amount,
         sequentially, to the Class R Certificate, the Class A1 Certificates,
         the Class A2 Certificates and Class A3 Certificates, in that order, in
         reduction of their respective Class Principal Amounts, until

<PAGE>

         the Class Principal Amount of each such Class has been reduced to zero;
         provided, however, that following the Distribution Date on which the
         Minimum Call Price is received, if the Class Principal Amounts of Class
         A1 and Class A2 Certificates have been reduced to zero, then the Senior
         Principal Distribution Amount otherwise payable to the Class A3
         Certificates shall be paid to the Class A2 Certificates in reduction of
         the Class Principal Amount of the Class A3 Certificates until the Class

              such Distribution Date, except as provided in Section 5.02(c),
              until the Class Principal Amount thereof has been reduced to zero;

                   (P) to the Class B6 Certificates, the Accrued Certificate
              Interest thereon for such Distribution Date, as reduced by such

              for such Distribution Date;

                   (Q) to the Class B6 Certificates, any Interest Shortfall for

                   (R) to the Class B6 Certificates, in reduction of the Class
              Principal Amount thereof, such Class's Subordinate Class
              Percentage of the Subordinate Principal Distribution Amount for
              such Distribution Date, except as provided in Section 5.02(c),
              until the Class Principal Amount thereof has been reduced to zero.

         (b) Net Prepayment Interest Shortfalls shall be allocated among the
Senior Certificates and the Subordinate Certificates pro rata based on the
Accrued Certificate Interest otherwise distributable thereon.

         (c) If on any Distribution Date the Credit Support Percentage for the
Class B1 Certificates is less than the Original Credit Support Percentage for
such Class, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02(a),
no distribution of amounts described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition
of Subordinate Principal Distribution Amount will be made in respect of the
Class B2, Class B3, Class B4, Class B5 or Class B6 Certificates on such
Distribution Date. If on any Distribution Date the Credit Support Percentage for
the Class B2 Certificates is less than the Original Credit Support Percentage
for such Class, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
5.02(a), no distribution of amounts described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the
definition of Subordinate Principal Distribution Amount will be made in respect
of the Class B3, Class B4, Class B5 or Class B6 Certificates on such
Distribution Date. If on any Distribution Date the Credit Support Percentage for
the Class B3 Certificates is less than the Original Credit Support Percentage
for such Class, then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section
5.02(a), no distribution of amounts described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the
definition of Subordinate Principal Distribution Amount will be made in respect
of the Class B4, Class B5 or Class B6 Certificates on such Distribution Date. If
on any Distribution Date the Credit Support Percentage for the Class B4
Certificates is less than the Original Credit Support Percentage for such Class,
then, notwithstanding anything to the contrary in Section 5.02(a), no
distribution of amounts described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of
Subordinate Principal Distribution Amount will be made in respect of the Class
B5 or Class B6 Certificates on such Distribution Date. If on any Distribution
Date the Credit Support Percentage for the Class B5 Certificates is less than
the Original Credit Support Percentage for such Class, then, notwithstanding
anything to the contrary in Section 5.02(a), no distribution of amounts
described in clauses (ii) and (iii) of the definition of Subordinate Principal
Distribution Amount will be made in respect of the Class B6 Certificates on such
Distribution Date.

         Any amount not distributed in respect of any Class on any Distribution
Date pursuant to the immediately preceding paragraph shall be allocated among
the remaining Classes of Subordinate Certificates in proportion to their
respective Class Principal Amounts.

         (d) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall distribute to the
Holder of the Class R Certificate any amounts remaining in the REMIC for such
Distribution Date after application of all amounts described in paragraph (a) of
this Section 5.02. Any distributions pursuant to this paragraph (d) shall not
reduce the Class Principal Amount of the Class R Certificate.

         (e) On each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall distribute the Class P
Distributable Amount for such date to the Holder of the Class P Certificates and
the Class E Distributable Amount for such date to the Holders of the Class E

               Section 5.03.     Allocation of Realized Losses.

         (a) On any Distribution Date, the principal portion of each Realized

                           first, to the Class B6 Certificates, in reduction of
                  their Class Principal Amount, until the Class Principal Amount
                  thereof has been reduced to zero;


                                       72
<PAGE>

                           second, to the Class B5 Certificates, in reduction of
                  their Class Principal Amount, until the Class Principal Amount
                  thereof has been reduced to zero;

                           third, to the Class B4 Certificates, in reduction of
                  their Class Principal Amount, until the Class Principal Amount
                  thereof has been reduced to zero;

                           fourth, to the Class B3 Certificates, in reduction of
                  their Class Principal Amount, until the Class Principal Amount
                  thereof has been reduced to zero;

                           fifth, to the Class B2 Certificates, in reduction of
                  their Class Principal Amount, until the Class Principal Amount
                  thereof has been reduced to zero;

                           sixth, to the Class B1 Certificates, in reduction of
                  their Class Principal Amount, until the Class Principal Amount
                  thereof has been reduced to zero; and

                           seventh, to the Senior Certificates, pro rata, in
                  accordance with their respective Class Principal Amounts.

         (b) With respect to any Distribution Date, the principal portion of any
Excess Loss in respect of a Mortgage Loan shall be allocated, pro rata, to the
Subordinate Certificates and the Senior Certificates on the basis of their
respective Class Principal Amounts.

         (c) Any Realized Losses allocated to a Class of Certificates pursuant
to Section 5.03(a) or (b) shall be allocated among the Certificates of such
Class in proportion to their respective Certificate Principal Amounts. Any
allocation of Realized Losses pursuant to this paragraph (c) shall be
accomplished by reducing the Certificate Principal Amounts of the related
Certificates on the related Distribution Date in accordance with Section
5.03(d).

         (d) Realized Losses allocated in accordance with this Section 5.03
shall be allocated on the Distribution Date in the month following the month in
which such loss was incurred and, in the case of the principal portion thereof,
after giving effect to distributions made on such Distribution Date.

         (e) On each Distribution Date, the Subordinate Certificate Writedown
Amount for such date shall effect a corresponding reduction in the Class
Principal Amount of the lowest ranking Class of outstanding Subordinate
Certificates, which reduction shall occur on such Distribution Date after giving
effect to distributions made on such Distribution Date.

               Section 5.04.    Advances by the Master Servicer and the Trustee.

         (a) Advances shall be made in respect of each Deposit Date as provided
herein. If, on any Determination Date, the Master Servicer determines that any
Scheduled Payments due during the related Due Period (other than Balloon
Payments) have not been received, the Master Servicer shall, or cause the
applicable Servicer to, advance such amount, less an amount, if any, to be set
forth in an Officer's Certificate to be delivered to the Trustee on such
Determination Date, which if advanced the Master Servicer or the applicable
Servicer has determined would not be recoverable from amounts received with
respect to such Mortgage Loan, including late



                                       73
<PAGE>

payments, Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds or otherwise. If the Master
Servicer determines that an Advance is required, it shall on the Deposit Date
immediately following such Determination Date either (i) remit to the Trustee
from its own funds (or funds advanced by the applicable Servicer) for deposit in
the Certificate Account immediately available funds in an amount equal to such
Advance, (ii) cause to be made an appropriate entry in the records of the
Collection Account that funds in such account being held for future distribution
or withdrawal have been, as permitted by this Section 5.04, used by the Master
Servicer to make such Advance, and remit such immediately available funds to the
Trustee for deposit in the Certificate Account or (iii) make Advances in the
form of any combination of clauses (i) and (ii) aggregating the amount of such
Advance. Any funds being held in the Collection Account for future distribution
to Certificateholders and so used shall be replaced by the Master Servicer from
its own funds by remittance to the Trustee for deposit in the Certificate
Account on or before any future Deposit Date to the extent that funds in the
Certificate Account on such Deposit Date shall be less than payments to
Certificateholders required to be made on the related Distribution Date. The
Trustee shall be entitled to conclusively rely upon any determination by the
Master Servicer that an Advance, if made, would constitute a non-recoverable
advance. The Master Servicer and each Servicer shall be entitled to be
reimbursed from the Collection Account for all Advances made by it as provided
in Section 4.02.

         (b) In the event that the Master Servicer fails for any reason to make
an Advance required to be made pursuant to this Section 5.04, the Trustee,
solely in its capacity as successor Master Servicer pursuant to Section 6.14,
shall, on or before the related Distribution Date, deposit in the Certificate
Account an amount equal to the excess of (a) Advances required to be made by the
Master Servicer that would have been deposited in such Certificate Account over
(b) the amount of any Advance made by the Master Servicer and Servicers with
respect to such Distribution Date; provided, however, that the Trustee shall be
required to make such Advance only if it is not prohibited by law from doing so
and it has determined that such Advance would be recoverable from amounts to be
received with respect to such Mortgage Loan, including late payments,
Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, or otherwise. The Trustee shall be
entitled to be reimbursed from the Certificate Account for Advances made by it
pursuant to this Section 5.04 as if it were the Master Servicer.

               Section 5.05.     Compensating Interest Payments.

         The Master Servicer shall not be responsible for making any
Compensating Interest Payments not made by the Servicers. Any Compensating
Interest Payments made by the Servicers shall be a component of the Available
Distribution Amount.

               Section 5.06. [RESERVED]

         Section 5.07. Duties of the Auction Administrator. (a) During the five
(5) Business Days prior to the Distribution Date occurring on the First Auction
Distribution Date, the Auction Administrator will use its reasonable efforts to
solicit at least three bids from third-party investors for the purchase of the
Callable Certificates from the Holders thereof for an amount not less than the
Minimum Call Price. If one or more bids to purchase the Callable Certificates at
the Minimum Call Price is not received by the Auction Administrator for the
First Auction Distribution Date, this process will be repeated on each
successive Auction Distribution Date



                                       74
<PAGE>

until one or more bids to purchase the Callable Certificates at the Minimum Call
Price is received by the Auction Administrator. The Auction Administrator may
consult with agents to identify at least three prospective bidders for this
solicitation.

         (b) Within two (2) Business Days after the Auction Administrator has
received at least one bid to purchase the Callable Certificates equal to at
least the Minimum Call Price (but in no event later than the Business Day prior
to the related Auction Distribution Date), the Auction Administrator shall
notify the Holders of the Callable Certificates that they will be required to
tender their Certificates for purchase by the auction winner on the applicable
Auction Distribution Date. On the applicable Auction Distribution Date, (i) the
Callable Certificates will be deemed to be tendered and surrendered for purchase
and the Auction Administrator shall instruct the Depository to transfer the
ownership of the Callable Certificates to the auction winner and (ii) the Class
A3 Certificates shall also be tendered and surrendered to the Trustee. The
Trustee shall continue to calculate any amounts payable to the Class A3
Certificates and shall distribute such amounts in accordance with Section 5.10.
In the event that multiple bids are received by the Auction Administrator, the
highest cash bidder shall be deemed the auction winner. In the event that there
is only one bid equal to or greater than the Minimum Call Price then that bidder
shall be the auction winner.

         Section 5.08. Rights of the Auction Administrator. The Auction
Administrator will be reimbursed for the costs and expenses of the auction and
sale, together with the costs and expenses of the Auction Administrator and its
agents, from the cash proceeds of the auction and distribute the remainder of
such proceeds to the Holders of the Callable Certificates and the Holders of the
Class A3 Certificates as described in Sections 5.09 and 5.10, respectively.

         Section 5.09. Callable Certificateholders. Holders of the Callable
Certificates will receive the cash proceeds from the auction sale (less the
amount paid to the Auction Administrator pursuant to Section 5.08 and less the
amounts paid to the Holders of the Class A3 Certificates pursuant to Section
5.10) on the Auction Distribution Date following the date that the Minimum Call
Price is received by the Auction Administrator. The Holder of each Callable
Certificate hereby agrees to tender its Certificate to the Trustee upon receipt
of such amount and acknowledges that the Trustee shall cause the Depository to
terminate its ownership interest at that time. If such Certificate is not then
held in book-entry form, the Holder of such Certificate hereby agrees to
surrender such Certificate to the Trustee for registration of transfer on the
applicable Auction Distribution Date to the auction winner and acknowledges that
the Trustee shall terminate its ownership interest at that time. If the Holder
of such Certificate does not surrender such Certificate to the Trustee on the
applicable Auction Distribution Date for any reason, such Certificate shall be
deemed to be tendered and surrendered for registration of transfer to the
Trustee and the Trustee shall sign, countersign and deliver in the name of the
auction winner a new Certificate of a like Class and aggregated fractional
undivided interest, but bearing a different number. The Minimum Call Price due
to the holders of cancelled, but not surrendered, Certificates shall be paid
only upon surrender of the Certificates, without any accrued interest on such
par price from the applicable Auction Distribution Date.

         The auction shall not diminish or otherwise affect the amounts of
principal and interest due to the Callable Certificates on the Distribution Date
on which such Auction Distribution Date occurs.

         Section 5.10. Rights of the Class A3 Certificateholders. If the amount
received by the Auction Administrator in the auction is greater than the Minimum
Call Price, such excess will be paid to the Holders of the Class A3 Certificates
on the Distribution Date occurring in the month of the auction. Following the
Distribution Date on which the Minimum Call Price is received and after the
Class Principal Amounts of the Class A1 and Class A2 Certificates have been
reduced to zero, the Class A2 Certificates shall receive all amounts of interest
and principal otherwise payable to the Class A3 Certificates until the Class
Principal Amount of the Class A3 Certificates has been reduced to zero. The
Class AIO Certificates will not be entitled to distributions of any kind
following the First Auction Distribution Date.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            CONCERNING THE TRUSTEE;
                                EVENTS OF DEFAULT

               Section 6.01.     Duties of Trustee.

         (a) The Trustee, except during the continuance of an Event of Default
(of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual knowledge),
undertakes to perform such duties and only such duties as are specifically set
forth in this Agreement. Any permissive right of the Trustee provided for in
this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty of the Trustee. If an Event of
Default (of which a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have actual
knowledge) has occurred and has not otherwise been cured or waived, the Trustee
shall exercise such of the rights and powers vested in it by this Agreement and
use the same degree of care and skill in their exercise as a prudent Person
would exercise or use under the circumstances in the conduct of such Person's
own affairs unless the Trustee is acting as Master Servicer, in which case it
shall use the same degree of care and skill as the Master Servicer hereunder.

         (b) The Trustee, upon receipt of all resolutions, certificates,
statements, opinions, reports, documents, orders or other instruments furnished
to the Trustee which are specifically required to be furnished pursuant to any
provision of this Agreement, shall examine them to determine whether they are in
the form required by this Agreement; provided, however, that the Trustee shall
not be responsible for the accuracy or content of any such resolution,
certificate, statement, opinion, report, document, order or other instrument
furnished by the Master Servicer to the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement, and
the Trustee shall not be required to recalculate or verify any numerical
information furnished to the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement.

         (c) The Trustee shall not have any liability arising out of or in
connection with this Agreement, except for its negligence or willful misconduct.
Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the Trustee shall
not be liable for special, indirect or consequential losses or damages of any
kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits). No provision of
this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the Trustee from liability for its
own negligent action, its own negligent failure to act or its own willful
misconduct; provided, however, that:

              (i) The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any
         action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in
         accordance with the consent or direction of Holders of Certificates as
         provided in Section 6.18 hereof;

              (ii) For all purposes under this Agreement, the Trustee shall not
         be deemed to have notice of any Event of Default (other than resulting
         from a failure by the Master Servicer (i) to remit funds (or to make
         Advances) or (ii) to furnish information to the Trustee when required
         to do so) unless a Responsible Officer of the Trustee has actual
         knowledge thereof or unless written notice of any event which is in
         fact such a default is received by the Trustee at the applicable
         Corporate Trust Office, and such notice references the Holders of the
         Certificates and this Agreement; and



                                       77
<PAGE>

              (iii) With respect to amounts that would be treated as
         "unanticipated expenses" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations
         Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii) if paid or reimbursed by the REMICs
         hereunder, no provision of this Agreement shall require the Trustee to
         expend or risk its own funds or otherwise incur any financial liability
         in the performance of any of its duties hereunder, or in the exercise
         of any of its rights or powers, if it shall have reasonable grounds for
         believing that repayment of such funds or adequate indemnity against
         such risk or liability is not reasonably assured to it, and none of the
         provisions contained in this Agreement shall in any event require the
         Trustee to perform, or be responsible for the manner of performance of,
         any of the obligations of the Master Servicer under this Agreement
         except during such time, if any, as the Trustee shall be the successor
         to, and be vested with the rights, duties, powers and privileges of,
         the Master Servicer in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.

         (d) The Trustee shall have no duty hereunder with respect to any
complaint, claim, demand, notice or other document it may receive or which may
be alleged to have been delivered to or served upon it by the parties as a
consequence of the assignment of any Mortgage Loan hereunder; provided, however,
that the Trustee promptly shall remit to the Master Servicer upon receipt any
such complaint, claim, demand, notice or other document (i) which is delivered
to the applicable Corporate Trust Office of the Trustee, (ii) of which a
Responsible Officer has actual knowledge, and (iii) which contains information
sufficient to permit the Trustee to make a determination that the real property
to which such document relates is a Mortgaged Property.

         (e) The Trustee shall not be personally liable with respect to any
action taken, suffered or omitted to be taken by it in good faith in accordance
with the direction of Certificateholders of any Class holding Certificates which
evidence, as to such Class, Percentage Interests aggregating not less than 25%
as to the time, method and place of conducting any proceeding for any remedy
available to the Trustee or exercising any trust or power conferred upon the
Trustee under this Agreement.

         (f) The Trustee shall not be held liable by reason of any insufficiency
in any account (except the Certificate Account) held by or on behalf of the
Trustee resulting from any investment loss on any Eligible Investment included
therein (except to the extent that the Trustee is the obligor and has defaulted
thereon).

         (g) Except as otherwise provided herein, the Trustee shall not have any
duty (A) to see to any recording, filing, or depositing of this Agreement or any
agreement referred to herein or any financing statement or continuation
statement evidencing a security interest, or to see to the maintenance of any
such recording or filing or depositing or to any re-recording, re-filing or
re-depositing of any thereof, (B) to see to any insurance, (C) to see to the
payment or discharge of any tax, assessment, or other governmental charge or any
lien or encumbrance of any kind owing with respect to, assessed or levied
against, any part of the Trust Fund other than from funds available in the
Collection Account or the Certificate Account, or (D) to confirm or verify the
contents of any reports or certificates of any Servicer, the Master Servicer or
Depositor delivered to the Trustee pursuant to this Agreement believed by the
Trustee to be genuine and to have been signed or presented by the proper party
or parties.



                                       78
<PAGE>

         (h) The Trustee shall not be liable in its individual capacity for an
error of judgment made in good faith by a Responsible Officer or other officers
of the Trustee unless it shall be proved that the Trustee was negligent in
ascertaining the pertinent facts.

         (i) Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, the
Trustee shall not be liable for special, indirect or consequential losses or
damages of any kind whatsoever (including, but not limited to, lost profits),
even if the Trustee has been advised of the likelihood of such loss or damage
and regardless of the form of action.

               Section 6.02.     Certain Matters Affecting the Trustee.

         Except as otherwise provided in Section 6.01:

                   (i) The Trustee may request, and may rely and shall be
              protected in acting or refraining from acting upon any resolution,
              Officer's Certificate, certificate of auditors, Opinion of Counsel
              or any other certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report,
              notice, request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or
              document believed by it to be genuine and to have been signed or
              presented by the proper party or parties;

                   (ii) The Trustee may consult with counsel and any advice of
              its counsel or Opinion of Counsel shall be full and complete
              authorization and protection in respect of any action taken or
              suffered or omitted by it hereunder in good faith and in
              accordance with such advice or Opinion of Counsel;

                   (iii) The Trustee shall not be personally liable for any
              action taken, suffered or omitted by it in good faith and
              reasonably believed by it to be authorized or within the
              discretion or rights or powers conferred upon it by this
              Agreement;

                   (iv) Unless an Event of Default shall have occurred and be
              continuing, the Trustee shall not be bound to make any
              investigation into the facts or matters stated in any resolution,
              certificate, statement, instrument, opinion, report, notice,
              request, consent, order, approval, bond or other paper or document
              (provided the same appears regular on its face), unless requested
              in writing to do so by Holders of at least a majority in Class
              Principal Amount (or Class Notional Amount) of each Class of
              Certificates; provided, however, that, if the payment within a
              reasonable time to the Trustee of the costs, expenses or
              liabilities likely to be incurred by it in the making of such
              investigation is, in the opinion of the Trustee, not reasonably
              assured to the Trustee by the security afforded to it by the terms
              of this Agreement, the Trustee may require reasonable indemnity
              against such expense or liability or payment of such estimated
              expenses as a condition to proceeding. The reasonable expense
              thereof shall be paid by the Holders requesting such
              investigation;

                   (v) The Trustee may execute any of the trusts or powers
              hereunder or perform any duties hereunder either directly or by or
              through agents, custodians, or attorneys, which agents, custodians
              or attorneys shall have any and all of the rights, powers, duties
              and obligations of the Trustee conferred on them by such
              appointment; provided that the Trustee shall continue to be
              responsible for its duties and obligations hereunder to the



                                       79
<PAGE>

              extent provided herein; and provided, further, that the Trustee
              shall not be responsible for any misconduct or negligence on the
              part of any such agent or attorney appointed with due care by the
              Trustee;

                   (vi) The Trustee shall not be under any obligation to
              exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this
              Agreement or to institute, conduct or defend any litigation
              hereunder or in relation hereto, in each case at the request,
              order or direction of any of the Certificateholders pursuant to
              the provisions of this Agreement, unless such Certificateholders
              shall have offered to the Trustee reasonable security or indemnity
              against the costs, expenses and liabilities which may be incurred
              therein or thereby;

                   (vii) The right of the Trustee to perform any discretionary
              act enumerated in this Agreement shall not be construed as a duty,
              and the Trustee shall not be answerable for other than its
              negligence or willful misconduct in the performance of such act;
              and

                   (viii) The Trustee shall not be required to give any bond or

         The Trustee makes no representations as to the validity or sufficiency
of this Agreement, or of the Certificates (other than the certificate of
authentication on the Certificates) or of any Mortgage Loan, or related document
save that the Trustee represents that, assuming due execution and delivery by
the other parties hereto, this Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
delivered by it and constitutes its valid and binding obligation, enforceable
against it in accordance with its terms except that such enforceability may be
subject to (A) applicable bankruptcy and insolvency laws and other similar laws
affecting the enforcement of the rights of creditors generally, and (B) general
principles of equity regardless of whether such enforcement is considered in a

of the assignment of the Mortgage Loans to the Trust Fund by the Depositor or
for the use or application of any funds deposited into the Collection Account,
the Certificate Account, any Escrow Account or any other fund or account

or to otherwise perfect or maintain the perfection of any security interest or
lien granted to it hereunder or to record this Agreement.

               Section 6.05.     Eligibility Requirements for Trustee.

         The Trustee hereunder shall at all times be (i) an institution insured
by the FDIC and (ii) a corporation or national banking association, organized

examination by federal or state authority. If such corporation or national
banking association publishes reports of condition at least annually, pursuant
to law or to the requirements of the aforesaid supervising or examining
authority, then, for the purposes of this Section, the combined capital and
surplus of such corporation or national banking association shall be deemed to

condition so published. In case at any time the Trustee shall cease to be
eligible in accordance with provisions of this Section, the Trustee shall resign
immediately in the manner and with the effect specified in Section 6.06.

               Section 6.06.     Resignation and Removal of Trustee.

         (a) The Trustee may at any time resign and be discharged from the trust
hereby created by giving written notice thereof to the Depositor and the Master
Servicer. Upon receiving such notice of resignation, the Depositor will promptly
appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, one copy of which instrument
shall be delivered to the resigning Trustee, one copy to the successor trustee
and one copy to the Master Servicer. If no successor trustee shall have been so
appointed and shall have accepted appointment within 30 days after the giving of
such notice of resignation, the resigning Trustee may petition any court of
competent jurisdiction for the appointment of a successor trustee.

         (b) If at any time (i) the Trustee shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6.05 and shall fail to resign after
written request therefor by the Depositor, (ii) the Trustee shall become
incapable of acting, or shall be adjudged a bankrupt or insolvent, or a receiver
of the Trustee or of its property shall be appointed, or any public officer
shall take charge or control of the Trustee or of its property or affairs for
the purpose of rehabilitation, conservation or liquidation, (iii) a tax is
imposed or threatened with respect to the Trust Fund by any state in which the
Trustee or the Trust Fund held by the Trustee is located, or (iv) the continued
use of the Trustee would result in a downgrading of the rating by the Rating
Agencies of any Class of Certificates with a rating, then the Depositor shall
remove the Trustee and appoint a successor trustee by written instrument, one
copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Trustee so removed, one copy
to the successor trustee and one copy to the Master Servicer.

         (c) The Holders of more than 50% of the Class Principal Amount (or
Class Notional Amount) of each Class of Certificates may at any time upon 30
days' written notice to the Trustee and the Depositor remove the Trustee by such
written instrument, signed by such Holders or their attorney-in-fact duly
authorized, one copy of which instrument shall be delivered to the Depositor,
one copy to the Trustee so removed and one copy to the Master Servicer; the
Depositor shall thereupon use its best efforts to appoint a mutually acceptable
successor trustee in accordance with this Section.

         (a) Any successor trustee appointed as provided in Section 6.06 shall
execute, acknowledge and deliver to the Depositor, the Master Servicer and to
its predecessor trustee an instrument accepting such appointment hereunder, and
thereupon the resignation or removal of the predecessor trustee shall become
effective and such successor trustee, without any further act, deed or
conveyance, shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties and
obligations of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if originally
named as trustee. The predecessor trustee (or its custodian) shall deliver to
the successor trustee (or assign to the successor trustee its interest under
each Custodial Agreement, to the extent permitted thereunder) all Mortgage Files
and documents and statements related to each Mortgage Files held by it
hereunder, and shall duly assign, transfer, deliver and pay over to the
successor trustee the entire Trust Fund, together with all necessary instruments
of transfer and assignment or other documents properly executed necessary to
effect such transfer and such of the record or copies thereof maintained by the
predecessor trustee in the administration hereof as may be requested by the
successor trustee and shall thereupon be discharged from all duties and
responsibilities under this Agreement. In addition, the Master Servicer and the
predecessor trustee shall execute and deliver such other instruments and do such
other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and certainly vest and
confirm in the successor trustee all such rights, powers, duties and
obligations.

         (b) No successor trustee shall accept appointment as provided in this
Section unless at the time of such appointment such successor trustee shall be
eligible under the provisions of Section 6.05.

         (c) Upon acceptance by a successor trustee of appointment as provided

to the corporate trust business of the Trustee, shall be the successor to the
Trustee hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, provided that such Person shall be eligible under the
provisions of Section 6.05.

               Section 6.09.     Appointment of Co-Trustee, Separate Trustee or
                                 Custodian.

         (a) Notwithstanding any other provisions hereof, at any time, the
Trustee, the Depositor or the Certificateholders evidencing more than 50% of the
Class Principal Amount (or Class Notional Amount) of each Class of Certificates
shall each have the power from time to time to appoint one or more Persons to
act either as co-trustees jointly with the Trustee, or as separate trustees, or
as custodians, for the purpose of holding title to, foreclosing or otherwise
taking action with respect to any Mortgage Loan outside the state where the
Trustee has its principal place of business where such separate trustee or
co-trustee is necessary or advisable (or the Trustee has been advised by the
Master Servicer that such separate trustee or co-trustee is necessary or
advisable) under the laws of any state in which a property securing a Mortgage
Loan is located or for the purpose of otherwise conforming to any legal
requirement, restriction or condition in any state in which a property securing
a Mortgage Loan is located or in any state in which any portion of the Trust
Fund is located. The separate Trustees, co-trustees, or custodians so appointed
shall be trustees or custodians for the benefit of all the Certificateholders
and shall have such powers, rights and remedies as shall be specified in the
instrument of appointment; provided, however, that no such appointment shall, or
shall be deemed to, constitute the appointee an agent of the Trustee. The
obligation of the Trustee to make Advances pursuant to Section 5.04 and 6.14
hereof shall not be affected or assigned by the appointment of a co-trustee.

         (b) Every separate trustee, co-trustee, and custodian shall, to the
extent permitted by law, be appointed and act subject to the following
provisions and conditions:

              (i) all powers, duties, obligations and rights conferred upon the
         Trustee in respect of the receipt, custody and payment of moneys shall
         be exercised solely by the Trustee;

              (ii) all other rights, powers, duties and obligations conferred or
         imposed upon the Trustee shall be conferred or imposed upon and
         exercised or performed by the Trustee and such separate trustee,
         co-trustee, or custodian jointly, except to the extent that under any
         law of any jurisdiction in which any particular act or acts are to be
         performed the Trustee shall be incompetent or unqualified to perform
         such act or acts, in which event such rights, powers, duties and
         obligations, including the holding of title to the Trust Fund or any
         portion thereof in any such jurisdiction, shall be exercised and
         performed by such separate trustee, co-trustee, or custodian; (iii) no
         trustee or custodian hereunder shall be personally liable by reason of
         any act or omission of any other trustee or custodian hereunder; and

              (iv) the Trustee or the Certificateholders evidencing more than
         50% of the Aggregate Voting Interests of the Certificates may at any
         time accept the resignation of or remove any separate trustee,
         co-trustee or custodian, so appointed by it or them, if such
         resignation or removal does not violate the other terms of this
         Agreement.

         (c) Any notice, request or other writing given to the Trustee shall be
deemed to have been given to each of the then separate trustees and co-trustees,
as effectively as if given to each



                                       83
<PAGE>

of them. Every instrument appointing any separate trustee, co-trustee or
custodian shall refer to this Agreement and the conditions of this Article VI.
Each separate trustee and co-trustee, upon its acceptance of the trusts
conferred, shall be vested with the estates or property specified in its
instrument of appointment, either jointly with the Trustee or separately, as may
be provided therein, subject to all the provisions of this Agreement,
specifically including every provision of this Agreement relating to the conduct
of, affecting the liability of, or affording protection to, the Trustee. Every
such instrument shall be filed with the Trustee.

         (d) Any separate trustee, co-trustee or custodian may, at any time,
constitute the Trustee its agent or attorney-in-fact with full power and
authority, to the extent not prohibited by law, to do any lawful act under or in
respect of this Agreement on its behalf and in its name. The Trustee shall not
be responsible for any action or inaction of any separate trustee, co-trustee or
custodian. If any separate trustee, co-trustee or custodian shall die, become
incapable of acting, resign or be removed, all of its estates, properties,
rights, remedies and trusts shall vest in and be exercised by the Trustee, to
the extent permitted by law, without the appointment of a new or successor
trustee.

         (e) No separate trustee, co-trustee or custodian hereunder shall be
required to meet the terms of eligibility as a successor trustee under Section
6.05 hereunder and no notice to Certificateholders of the appointment shall be
required under Section 6.07 hereof.

         (f) The Trustee agrees to instruct the co-trustees, if any, to the
extent necessary to fulfill the Trustee's obligations hereunder.

         (g) The Trust Fund shall pay the reasonable compensation of the
co-trustees to the extent, and in accordance with the standards, specified in
Section 6.12 hereof (which compensation shall not reduce any compensation
payable to the Trustee under such Section).

               Section 6.10.     Authenticating Agents.

         (a) The Trustee may appoint one or more Authenticating Agents which
shall be authorized to act on behalf of the Trustee in authenticating
Certificates. Wherever reference is made in this Agreement to the authentication
of Certificates by the Trustee or the Trustee's certificate of authentication,
such reference shall be deemed to include authentication on behalf of the
Trustee by an Authenticating Agent and a certificate of authentication executed
on behalf of the Trustee by an Authenticating Agent. Each Authenticating Agent
must be a corporation organized and doing business under the laws of the United
States of America or of any state, having a combined capital and surplus of at
least $15,000,000, authorized under such laws to do a trust business and subject
to supervision or examination by federal or state authorities.

         (b) Any Person into which any Authenticating Agent may be merged or
converted or with which it may be consolidated, or any Person resulting from any
merger, conversion or consolidation to which any Authenticating Agent shall be a
party, or any Person succeeding to the corporate agency business of any
Authenticating Agent, shall continue to be the Authenticating Agent without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of the Trustee
or the Authenticating Agent.



                                       84
<PAGE>

         (c) Any Authenticating Agent may at any time resign by giving at least
30 days' advance written notice of resignation to the Trustee and the Depositor.
The Trustee may at any time terminate the agency of any Authenticating Agent by
giving written notice of termination to such Authenticating Agent and the
Depositor. Upon receiving a notice of resignation or upon such a termination, or
in case at any time any Authenticating Agent shall cease to be eligible in
accordance with the provisions of this Section 6.10, the Trustee may appoint a
successor Authenticating Agent, shall give written notice of such appointment to
the Depositor and shall mail notice of such appointment to all Holders of
Certificates. Any successor Authenticating Agent upon acceptance of its
appointment hereunder shall become vested with all the rights, powers, duties
and responsibilities of its predecessor hereunder, with like effect as if
originally named as Authenticating Agent. No successor Authenticating Agent
shall be appointed unless eligible under the provisions of this Section 6.10. No
Authenticating Agent shall have responsibility or liability for any action taken
by it as such at the direction of the Trustee. Any Authenticating Agent shall be
entitled to reasonable compensation for its services and, if paid by the
Trustee, it shall be a reimbursable expense to the extent provided in Section
6.12.

               Section 6.11.     Indemnification of Trustee.

         The Trustee and its respective directors, officers, employees and
agents shall be entitled to indemnification from the Trust Fund for any loss,
liability or expense incurred in connection with any legal proceeding or
incurred without negligence or willful misconduct on their part, arising out of,
or in connection with, the acceptance or administration of the trusts created
hereunder or in connection with the performance of the Trustee's duties
hereunder or under any Servicing Agreement or Custodial Agreement, including any
applicable fees and expenses payable pursuant to Section 6.12 and the costs and
expenses of defending themselves against any claim in connection with the
exercise or performance of any of their powers or duties hereunder, provided
that:

              (i) with respect to any such claim, the Trustee shall have given
         the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Holders written notice
         thereof promptly after the Trustee shall have knowledge thereof;
         provided that failure to so notify shall not relieve the Trust Fund of
         the obligation to indemnify the Trustee; however, any reasonable delay
         by the Trustee to provide written notice to the Depositor, the Master
         Servicer and the Holders promptly after the Trustee shall have obtained
         knowledge of a claim shall not relieve the Trust Fund of the obligation
         to indemnify the Trustee under this Section 6.11;

              (ii) while maintaining control over its own defense, the Trustee
         shall cooperate and consult fully with the Depositor in preparing such
         defense;

              (iii) notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Section
         6.11, the Trust Fund shall not be liable for settlement of any such
         claim by the Trustee entered into without the prior consent of the
         Depositor, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld; and

              (iv) any such loss, liability or expense indemnified by the Trust
         Fund must constitute an "unanticipated expense" within the meaning of
         Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii).



                                       85
<PAGE>

        The provisions of this Section 6.11 shall survive any termination of
this Agreement and the resignation or removal of the Trustee and shall be
construed to include, but not be limited to any loss, liability or expense under
any environmental law.

               Section 6.12.     Compensation of the Trustee.

         The Trustee shall be entitled to (i) receive, and is authorized to pay
to itself the amount of income or gain earned from the investment of funds in
the Certificate Account and (ii) reimbursement of all reasonable expenses,
disbursements and advances incurred or made by the Trustee in accordance with
this Agreement (including fees and expenses of its counsel and all persons not
regularly in its employment), except for any expenses, disbursements and
advances that either (i) arise from its negligence, bad faith or willful
misconduct or (ii) do not constitute "unanticipated expenses" within the meaning
of Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii). The Custodians shall be
compensated as separately agreed with the Depositor (or its affiliates).

               Section 6.13.     Collection of Monies.

         Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, the Trustee
may demand payment or delivery of, and shall receive and collect, all money and
other property payable to or receivable by the Trustee pursuant to this
Agreement. The Trustee shall hold all such money and property received by it as
part of the Trust Fund and shall distribute it as provided in this Agreement. If
the Trustee shall not have timely received amounts to be remitted with respect
to the Mortgage Loans from the Master Servicer, the Trustee shall request the
Master Servicer to make such distribution as promptly as practicable or legally
permitted. If the Trustee shall subsequently receive any such amount, it may
withdraw such request.

               Section 6.14.     Events of Default; Trustee To Act; Appointment

law, so long as any such Event of Default shall not have been remedied within
any period of time prescribed by this Section 6.14, the Trustee, by notice in
writing to the Master Servicer may, and shall, if so directed by
Certificateholders evidencing more than 50% of the Class Principal Amount (or
Class Notional Amount) of each Class of Certificates, terminate all of the
rights and obligations of the Master Servicer hereunder and in and to the
Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof. If an Event of Default described in
clause (x) of this Section 6.14 shall occur, then, in each and every case,
subject to applicable law, so long as such Event of Default shall not have been
remedied within the time period prescribed by clause (x) of this Section 6.14,
the Trustee, by notice in writing to the Master Servicer, shall promptly
terminate all of the rights and obligations of the Master Servicer hereunder and
in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof. On or after the receipt
by the Master Servicer of such written notice, all authority and power of the
Master Servicer, and only in its capacity as Master Servicer under this
Agreement, whether with respect to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass
to and be vested in the Trustee and the Trustee is hereby authorized and
empowered to execute and deliver, on behalf of the defaulting Master Servicer as
attorney-in-fact or otherwise, any and all documents and other instruments, and
to do or accomplish all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
the purposes of such notice of termination, whether to complete the transfer and
endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents or
otherwise. The defaulting Master Servicer agrees to cooperate with the Trustee
in effecting the termination of the defaulting Master Servicer's
responsibilities and rights hereunder as Master Servicer including, without
limitation, notifying Servicers of the assignment of the master servicing
function and providing the Trustee or its designee all documents and records in
electronic or other form reasonably requested by it to enable the Trustee or its
designee to assume the defaulting Master Servicer's functions hereunder and the
transfer to the Trustee for administration by it of all amounts which shall at
the time be or should have been deposited by the defaulting Master Servicer in
the Collection Account maintained by such defaulting Master Servicer and any
other account or fund maintained with respect to the Certificates or thereafter
received with respect to the Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer being
terminated shall bear all costs of a master servicing transfer, including but
not limited to those of the Trustee reasonably allocable to specific employees
and overhead, legal fees and expenses, accounting and financial consulting fees
and expenses, and costs of amending the Agreement, if necessary. The Trustee
shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the Master Servicer (or by the Trust
Fund, if the Master Servicer is unable to fulfill its obligations hereunder) for
all costs associated with the transfer of servicing from the predecessor Master
Servicer, including, without limitation, any costs or expenses associated with
the complete transfer of all servicing data and the completion, correction or
manipulation of such servicing



                                       88
<PAGE>

data as may be required by the Trustee to correct any errors or insufficiencies
in the servicing data or otherwise to enable the Trustee to master service the
Mortgage Loans properly and effectively. If the terminated Master Servicer does
not pay such reimbursement within thirty (30) days of its receipt of an invoice
therefor, such reimbursement shall be an expense of the Trust and the Trustee
shall be entitled to withdraw such reimbursement from amounts on deposit in the
Certificate Account pursuant to Section 4.04; provided that the terminated
Master Servicer shall reimburse the Trust for any such expense incurred by the
Trust Fund.

         Notwithstanding the termination of its activities as Master Servicer,
each terminated Master Servicer shall continue to be entitled to reimbursement
to the extent provided in Section 4.02(i), (ii), (iii), (iv), (v), (vi), (viii),
(ix) and (x) to the extent such reimbursement relates to the period prior to
such Master Servicer's termination.

         If any Event of Default shall occur of which a Responsible Officer of
the Trustee has actual knowledge, the Trustee shall promptly notify the Rating
Agencies of the nature and extent of such Event of Default. The Trustee shall
immediately give written notice to the Master Servicer upon such Master
Servicer's failure to remit funds to it by 12:00 p.m. (New York time) on the
Deposit Date.

         (b) Within 90 days of the Master Servicer receiving a notice of
termination from the Trustee pursuant to Section 6.14(a) or the Trustee
receiving the resignation of the Master Servicer evidenced by an Opinion of
Counsel pursuant to Section 9.28 the Trustee, unless another master servicer
shall have been appointed, shall be the successor in all respects to the Master
Servicer in its capacity as such under this Agreement and the transactions set
forth or provided for herein and shall have all the rights and powers and be
subject to all the responsibilities, duties and liabilities relating thereto and
arising thereafter placed on the Master Servicer hereunder, including the
obligation to make Advances; provided, however, that any failure to perform such
duties or responsibilities caused by the Master Servicer's or the Trustee's
failure to provide information required by this Agreement shall not be
considered a default by the Trustee hereunder. In addition, the Trustee shall
have no responsibility for any act or omission of the Master Servicer prior to
the issuance of any notice of termination within a period not to exceed 90 days
after the issuance of any notice of termination pursuant to Section 6.14(a) or
Section 9.28 and shall have no liability relating to the representations and
warranties of the Master Servicer set forth in Section 9.14. In the Trustee's
capacity as such successor, the Trustee shall have the same limitations on
liability herein granted to the Master Servicer. As compensation therefor, the
Trustee shall be entitled to receive all compensation payable to the Master
Servicer under this Agreement, including the Master Servicing Fee.

         (c) Notwithstanding the above, the Trustee may, if it shall be
unwilling to continue to so act, or shall, if it is unable to so act, appoint a
successor Master Servicer or petition a court of competent jurisdiction to
appoint, any established housing and home finance institution servicer, master
servicer, servicing or mortgage servicing institution having a net worth of not
less than $15,000,000 and meeting such other standards for a successor master
servicer as are set forth in this Agreement, as the successor to such Master
Servicer in the assumption of all of the responsibilities, duties or liabilities
of a master servicer, like the Master Servicer. Any entity designated by the
Trustee as a successor master servicer may be an Affiliate of the Trustee,



                                       89
<PAGE>

provided, however, that, unless such Affiliate meets the net worth requirements
and other standards set forth herein for a successor master servicer or the
Trustee, in its individual capacity shall agree, at the time of such
designation, to be and remain liable to the Trust Fund for such Affiliate's
actions and omissions in performing its duties hereunder. In connection with
such appointment and assumption, the Trustee may make such arrangements for the
compensation of such successor out of payments on Mortgage Loans as it and such
successor shall agree; provided, however, that no such compensation shall be in
excess of that permitted to the Master Servicer hereunder. The Trustee and such
successor shall take such actions, consistent with this Agreement, as shall be
necessary to effectuate any such succession and may make other arrangements with
respect to the servicing to be conducted hereunder which are not inconsistent
herewith. The Master Servicer shall cooperate with the Trustee, and any
successor master servicer in effecting the termination of the Master Servicer's
responsibilities and rights hereunder including, without limitation, notifying
Mortgagors of the assignment of the master servicing functions and providing the
Trustee and successor master servicer, as applicable, all documents and records
in electronic or other form reasonably requested by it to enable it to assume
the Master Servicer's functions hereunder and the transfer to the Trustee or
such successor master servicer, as applicable, all amounts which shall at the
time be or should have been deposited by the Master Servicer in the Collection
Account and any other account or fund maintained with respect to the
Certificates or thereafter be received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.
Neither the Trustee nor any other successor master servicer shall be deemed to
be in default hereunder by reason of any failure to make, or any delay in
making, any distribution hereunder or any portion thereof caused by (i) the
failure of the Master Servicer to deliver, or any delay in delivering, cash,
documents or records to it, (ii) the failure of the Master Servicer to cooperate
as required by this Agreement, (iii) the failure of the Master Servicer to
deliver the Mortgage Loan data to the Trustee as required by this Agreement or
(iv) restrictions imposed by any regulatory authority having jurisdiction over
the Master Servicer.

               Section 6.15.     Additional Remedies of Trustee Upon Event of
                                 Default.

         During the continuance of any Event of Default, so long as such Event
of Default shall not have been remedied, the Trustee, in addition to the rights
specified in Section 6.14, shall have the right, in its own name and as trustee
of an express trust, to take all actions now or hereafter existing at law, in
equity or by statute to enforce its rights and remedies and to protect the
interests, and enforce the rights and remedies, of the Certificateholders
(including the institution and prosecution of all judicial, administrative and
other proceedings and the filings of proofs of claim and debt in connection
therewith). Except as otherwise expressly provided in this Agreement, no remedy
provided for by this Agreement shall be exclusive of any other remedy, and each
and every remedy shall be cumulative and in addition to any other remedy, and no
delay or omission to exercise any right or remedy shall impair any such right or
remedy or shall be deemed to be a waiver of any Event of Default.

               Section 6.16.     Waiver of Defaults.

         35% or more of the Aggregate Voting Interests of Certificateholders may
waive any default or Event of Default by the Master Servicer in the performance
of its obligations hereunder, except that a default in the making of any
required deposit to the Certificate Account



                                       90
<PAGE>

that would result in a failure of the Trustee to make any required payment of
principal of or interest on the Certificates may only be waived with the consent
of 100% of the affected Certificateholders. Upon any such waiver of a past
default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default arising
therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of this
Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent or other default or
impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.

               Section 6.17.     Notification to Holders.

         Upon termination of the Master Servicer or appointment of a successor
to the Master Servicer, in each case as provided herein, the Trustee shall
promptly mail notice thereof by first class mail to the Certificateholders at
their respective addresses appearing on the Certificate Register. The Trustee
shall also, within 45 days after the occurrence of any Event of Default known to
a Responsible Officer of the Trustee, give written notice thereof to the
Certificateholders, unless such Event of Default shall have been cured or waived
prior to the issuance of such notice and within such 45-day period.

               Section 6.18.     Directions by Certificateholders and Duties of
                                 Trustee During Event of Default.

         Subject to the provisions of Section 8.01 hereof, during the
continuance of any Event of Default, Holders of Certificates evidencing not less
than 25% of the Class Principal Amount (or Class Notional Amount) of each Class
of Certificates may direct the time, method and place of conducting any
proceeding for any remedy available to the Trustee, or exercising any trust or
power conferred upon the Trustee, under this Agreement; provided, however, that
the Trustee shall be under no obligation to pursue any such remedy, or to
exercise any of the trusts or powers vested in it by this Agreement (including,
without limitation, (i) the conducting or defending of any administrative action
or litigation hereunder or in relation hereto and (ii) the terminating of the
Master Servicer or any successor master servicer from its rights and duties as
master servicer hereunder) at the request, order or direction of any of the
Certificateholders, unless such Certificateholders shall have offered to the
Trustee reasonable security or indemnity against the cost, expenses and
liabilities which may be incurred therein or thereby; and, provided, further,
that, subject to the provisions of Section 8.01, the Trustee shall have the
right to decline to follow any such direction if the Trustee, in accordance with
an Opinion of Counsel, determines that the action or proceeding so directed may
not lawfully be taken or if the Trustee in good faith determines that the action
or proceeding so directed would involve it in personal liability or be unjustly
prejudicial to the non-assenting Certificateholders.

               Section 6.19.     Action Upon Certain Failures of the Master
                                 Servicer and Upon Event of Default.

         In the event that a Responsible Officer of the Trustee shall have
actual knowledge of any action or inaction of the Master Servicer that would
become an Event of Default upon the Master Servicer's failure to remedy the same
after notice, the Trustee shall give notice thereof to the Master Servicer. For
all purposes of this Agreement, in the absence of actual knowledge by a
Responsible Officer of the Trustee, the Trustee shall not be deemed to have
knowledge of any



                                       91
<PAGE>

failure of the Master Servicer or any other Event of Default unless notified in
writing by the Depositor, the Master Servicer or a Certificateholder.

               Section 6.20.     Preparation of Tax Returns and Other Reports.

         (a) The Depositor shall prepare or cause to be prepared the initial
current report on Form 8-K. Thereafter, within 10 days (or, if applicable,
within such shorter period of time as is required under the rules of the U.S.
Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission") as in effect from time to
time (the "Rules")) following each Distribution Date, the Trustee shall, in
accordance with industry standards and the Rules, prepare and file with the
Commission via the Electronic Data Gathering and Retrieval System (EDGAR), a
Form 8-K (or such other form as is prescribed by the Rules) that includes (i) a
copy of the statement to the Certificateholders for such Distribution Date and
(ii) such other information as is required by the Rules and available to the
Trustee in a format compatible with Edgar filing requirements. Prior to January
30 in the first year as to which it has received prior instructions from the
Depositor to do so, the Trustee shall, in accordance with industry standards,
prepare and file a Form 15 Suspension Notification with respect to the Trust
Fund, if applicable. If so directed by the Depositor, the Trustee shall, at
monthly intervals or such other less frequent intervals as are specified by the
Depositor, file with the Commission via EDGAR pursuant to Rule 424 under the Act
(provided that such documents or other information (other than the statement to
Certificateholders) are furnished by the Depositor to the Trustee in a format
compatible with Edgar filing requirements) a prospectus supplement prepared by
the Depositor that includes (i) a cover page in the form provided by the
Depositor, (ii) a copy of the statement to the Certificateholders for the most
recent Distribution Date, and (iii) such other information as is provided by the
Depositor. Prior to March 30, 2005 and, unless and until a Form 15 Suspension
Notification shall have been filed, on or prior to March 30 of each year
thereafter, the Trustee shall file (but will not execute) a Form 10-K, in
substance conforming to industry standards and complying with the Rules, with
respect to the Trust Fund. The Form 10-K shall include the certification
required pursuant to Rule 13a-14 under the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934,
as amended (the "Form 10-K Certification") signed by an appropriate party or
parties (which Form 10-K Certification the Trustee shall not be required to
prepare or sign) and such other information as is required by the Rules. The
Trustee shall promptly send copies of each periodic report filed on Form 8-K or
other applicable form, each annual report on Form 10-K, and each Form 15
Suspension Notification, together in each case with the acceptance confirmation
receipt from EDGAR, to McKee Nelson LLP and to the Depositor (i) by e-mail to
the e-mail addresses provided in writing by each of McKee Nelson LLP and the
Depositor, respectively and (ii) to McKee Nelson LLP at 1919 M Street, N.W.,
Washington, D.C. 20036, and to the Depositor at the address specified in Section
11.07, in each case to the attention of a designated contact specified by each
of McKee Nelson LLP and the Depositor, respectively. The Trustee shall have no
liability for any delay in filing the Form 10-K or Form 10-K Certification due
to the failure of any party to sign such Form 10-K or Form 10-K Certification.
The Depositor hereby grants to the Trustee a limited power of attorney to
execute and file each Form 8-K (or other applicable form for filing of periodic
reports) and, if applicable, each prospectus supplement to be filed pursuant to
Rule 424, on behalf of the Depositor. Such power of attorney shall continue
until either the earlier of (i) receipt by the Trustee from the Depositor of
written termination of such power of attorney or (ii) the termination of the
Trust Fund. The Depositor agrees to promptly furnish to the Trustee, from time
to time upon request,



                                       92
<PAGE>

such further information, reports, and financial statements within its control
related to this Agreement and the Mortgage Loans as the Trustee reasonably deems
appropriate to prepare and file all necessary reports with the Commission. The
Trustee shall have no responsibility to file any items other than those
specified in this Section 6.20(a).

         (b) If so requested, the Trustee shall sign a certification (in the
form attached hereto as Exhibit M) for the benefit of the Person(s) signing the
Form 10-K Certification regarding certain aspects of such Form 10-K
Certification (provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be required to
undertake an analysis of, and shall have no responsibility for, any financial
information, accountant's report, certification or other matter contained
therein, except for computations performed by the Trustee and reflected in
distribution reports), which certification shall be delivered to such Person(s)
not later than five Business Days prior to the date on which the Form 10-K is
required to be filed with the Commission.

         (c) If so requested, the Master Servicer shall sign a certification for
the benefit of the Person(s) signing the Form 10-K Certification regarding
certain aspects of such Form 10-K Certification (provided, however, that the
Master Servicer shall not be required to undertake an analysis of the
accountant's report attached as an exhibit to the Form 10-K).

         (d) Each person (including their officers or directors) that signs any
Form 10-K Certification shall be entitled to indemnification from the Trust Fund
for any liability or expense incurred by it in connection with such
certification, other than any liability or expense attributable to such Person's
own bad faith, negligence or willful misconduct. The provisions of this
subsection shall survive any termination of this Agreement and the resignation
or removal of such Person.

               Section 6.21.     Reporting Requirements of the Commission.

         The Trustee and the Master Servicer shall reasonably cooperate with the
Depositor and its counsel to enter into such amendments or modifications to the
Agreement as may be necessary to comply with the Rules and any interpretation
thereof by the staff of the Commission, subject to the provisions of Section
11.03 hereof.


                                  ARTICLE VII

                            PURCHASE AND TERMINATION
                                OF THE TRUST FUND

               Section 7.01.     Termination of Trust Fund Upon Repurchase or
                                 Liquidation of All Mortgage Loans.

         (a) The respective obligations and responsibilities of the Trustee and
the Master Servicer created hereby (other than the obligation of the Trustee to
make payments to Certificateholders as set forth in Section 7.02, the obligation
of the Master Servicer to make a final remittance to the Trustee for deposit
into the Certificate Account pursuant to Section 4.01 and the obligations of the
Master Servicer to the Trustee pursuant to Sections 9.10 and 9.14), shall
terminate on the



                                       93
<PAGE>

earlier of (i) the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan
remaining in the Trust Fund and the disposition of all REO Property and (ii) the
sale of the property held by the Trust Fund in accordance with Section 7.01(b);
provided, however, that in no event shall the Trust Fund created hereby continue
beyond the expiration of 21 years from the death of the last survivor of the
descendants of Joseph P. Kennedy, the late Ambassador of the United States to
the Court of St. James's, living on the date hereof or beyond the Latest
Possible Maturity Date. Any termination of the Trust Fund shall be carried out
in such a manner so that the termination of each REMIC included therein shall
qualify as a "qualified liquidation" under the REMIC Provisions.

On any Distribution Date occurring after the date on which the aggregate
Scheduled Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans is less than 10% of the
Cut-off Date Aggregate Principal Balance, the Master Servicer, with the prior
written consent of the Seller (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld), may, upon written direction to the Trustee (delivered no later than
30 days prior to the anticipated sale date), cause (i) the Trustee to sell (or
arrange for the sale of) the assets of the Trust Fund and (ii) each REMIC
included in the Trust Fund to adopt a plan of complete liquidation pursuant to
Section 7.03(a)(i) hereof to sell all of its property. The property of the Trust
Fund shall be sold at a price (the "Termination Price") equal to the sum of :
(i) 100% of the unpaid principal balance of each Mortgage Loan on the day of
such purchase plus interest accrued thereon at the applicable Mortgage Rate with
respect to any Mortgage Loan to the Due Date in the Due Period immediately
preceding such Distribution Date, (ii) the fair market value of any REO Property
and any other property held by the Trust Fund, such fair market value to be
determined by an appraiser or appraisers appointed by the Master Servicer and
reasonably acceptable to the Trustee (reduced, in the case of REO Property, by
(1) reasonably anticipated disposition costs and (2) any amount by which fair
market value as so reduced exceeds the outstanding principal balance of the
related Mortgage Loan) and (iii) any unreimbursed Servicing Advances with
respect to each Mortgage Loan. The Master Servicer, each Servicer (or the
Trustee, if applicable) shall be reimbursed from the Termination Price for any
Mortgage Loan or related REO Property for any Advances made or other amounts
advanced with respect to the Mortgage Loans that are reimbursable to the Master
Servicer, the Trustee or the Trustee under this Agreement or the related
Servicing Agreement (or the Trustee hereunder), together with any accrued and
unpaid compensation due to the Master Servicer hereunder or the Servicers
thereunder, and the Trustee shall be entitled to be reimbursed from the
Termination Price for any related amounts owed to the Trustee to the extent
payable under Section 6.11 hereof. The Trustee shall distribute the assets of
the Trust Fund on the Distribution Date on which the repurchase occurred.

               Section 7.02.     Procedure Upon Termination of Trust Fund.

         (a) Notice of any termination pursuant to the provisions of Section
7.01, specifying the Distribution Date upon which the final distribution shall
be made, shall be given promptly by the Trustee by first class mail to
Certificateholders mailed (x) no later than five Business Days after the Trustee
has received notice from the Master Servicer of its intent to exercise its right
to cause the termination of the Trust Fund pursuant to Section 7.01(b) or (y)
upon the final payment or other liquidation of the last Mortgage Loan or REO
Property in the Trust Fund. Such notice shall specify (A) the Distribution Date
upon which final distribution on the Certificates of all



                                       94
<PAGE>

amounts required to be distributed to Certificateholders pursuant to Section
5.02 will be made upon presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the
Corporate Trust Office, and (B) that the Record Date otherwise applicable to
such Distribution Date is not applicable, distribution being made only upon
presentation and surrender of the Certificates at the office or agency of the
Trustee therein specified. The Trustee shall give such notice to the Master
Servicer and the Certificate Registrar at the time such notice is given to
Holders of the Certificates. Upon any such termination, the duties of the
Certificate Registrar with respect to the Certificates shall terminate and the
Trustee shall terminate, or request the Master Servicer to terminate, the
Collection Account it maintains, the Certificate Account and any other account
or fund maintained with respect to the Certificates, subject to the Trustee's
obligation hereunder to hold all amounts payable to Certificateholders in trust
without interest pending such payment.

         (b) In the event that all of the Holders do not surrender their
Certificates for cancellation within three months after the time specified in
the above-mentioned written notice, the Trustee shall give a second written
notice to the remaining Certificateholders to surrender their Certificates for
cancellation and receive the final distribution with respect thereto. If within
one year after the second notice any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee may take appropriate steps to contact
the remaining Certificateholders concerning surrender of such Certificates, and
the cost thereof shall be paid out of the amounts distributable to such Holders.
If within two years after the second notice any Certificates shall not have been
surrendered for cancellation, the Trustee shall, subject to applicable state law
relating to escheatment, hold all amounts distributable to such Holders for the
benefit of such Holders. No interest shall accrue on any amount held by the
Trustee and not distributed to a Certificateholder due to such
Certificateholder's failure to surrender its Certificate(s) for payment of the
final distribution thereon in accordance with this Section.

         (c) Any reasonable expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection with
any termination or liquidation of the Trust Fund shall be reimbursed from
proceeds received from the liquidation of the Trust Fund to the extent such
expenses constitute "unanticipated expenses" within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii)

               Section 7.03.     Additional Trust Fund Termination Requirements.

         (a) Any termination of the Trust Fund shall be effected in accordance
with the following additional requirements, unless the Trustee seeks (at the
request of the Master Servicer), and subsequently receives, an Opinion of
Counsel (at the expense of the Master Servicer), addressed to the Trustee to the
effect that the failure of the Trust Fund to comply with the requirements of
this Section 7.03 will not (i) result in the imposition of taxes on any REMIC
under the REMIC Provisions or (ii) cause any REMIC established hereunder to fail
to qualify as a REMIC at any time that any Certificates are outstanding:

              (i) The Trustee shall sell all of the assets of the Trust Fund for
         cash and, within 90 days of such sale, shall distribute the proceeds of
         such sale to the Certificateholders in complete liquidation of the
         Trust Fund and each REMIC created hereunder; and



                                       95
<PAGE>

              (ii) The Trustee shall attach a statement to the final Federal
         income tax return for each REMIC created hereunder stating that
         pursuant to Treasury Regulation ss. 1.860F-1, the first day of the
         90-day liquidation period for each such REMIC was the date on which the
         Trustee sold the assets of the Trust Fund.

         (b) By its acceptance of a Residual Certificate, each Holder thereof
hereby (i) authorizes the Trustee to take the action described in paragraph (a)
above and (ii) agrees to take such other action as may be necessary to
facilitate liquidation of each REMIC created under this Agreement, which
authorization shall be binding upon all successor Residual Certificateholders.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                          RIGHTS OF CERTIFICATEHOLDERS

               Section 8.01.     Limitation on Rights of Holders.

         (a) The death or incapacity of any Certificateholder shall not operate
to terminate this Agreement or this Trust Fund, nor entitle such
Certificateholder's legal representatives or heirs to claim an accounting or
take any action or proceeding in any court for a partition or winding up of this
Trust Fund, nor otherwise affect the rights, obligations and liabilities of the
parties hereto or any of them. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no
Certificateholder, solely by virtue of its status as a Certificateholder, shall
have any right to vote or in any manner otherwise control the Master Servicer or
the operation and management of the Trust Fund, or the obligations of the
parties hereto, nor shall anything herein set forth, or contained in the terms
of the Certificates, be construed so as to constitute the Certificateholders
from time to time as partners or members of an association, nor shall any
Certificateholder be under any liability to any third person by reason of any
action taken by the parties to this Agreement pursuant to any provision hereof.

         (b) No Certificateholder, solely by virtue of its status as
Certificateholder, shall have any right by virtue or by availing of any
provision of this Agreement to institute any suit, action or proceeding in
equity or at law upon or under or with respect to this Agreement, unless such
Holder previously shall have given to the Trustee a written notice of an Event
of Default and of the continuance thereof, as hereinbefore provided, and unless
also the Holders of Certificates evidencing not less than 25% of the Class
Principal Amount (or Class Notional Amount) of Certificates of each Class shall
have made written request upon the Trustee to institute such action, suit or
proceeding in its own name as Trustee hereunder and shall have offered to the
Trustee such reasonable indemnity as it may require against the cost, expenses
and liabilities to be incurred therein or thereby, and the Trustee, for sixty
days after its receipt of such notice, request and offer of indemnity, shall
have neglected or refused to institute any such action, suit or proceeding and
no direction inconsistent with such written request has been given such Trustee
during such sixty-day period by such Certificateholders; it being understood and
intended, and being expressly covenanted by each Certificateholder with every
other Certificateholder and the Trustee, that no one or more Holders of
Certificates shall have any right in any manner whatever by virtue or by
availing of any provision of this Agreement to affect, disturb or prejudice the
rights of the Holders of any other of such Certificates, or to obtain or seek to
obtain priority over or preference to any other such Holder, or to enforce any
right under



                                       96

this Agreement, except in the manner herein provided and for the benefit of all
Certificateholders. For the protection and enforcement of the provisions of this
Section, each and every Certificateholder and the Trustee shall be entitled to
such relief as can be given either at law or in equity.

               Section 8.02.     Access to List of Holders.

         (a) If the Trustee is not acting as Certificate Registrar, the
Certificate Registrar shall furnish or cause to be furnished to the Trustee,
within fifteen days after receipt by the Certificate Registrar of a request by
the Trustee in writing, a list, in such form as the Trustee may reasonably
require, of the names and addresses of the Certificateholders of each Class as
of the most recent Record Date.

         (b) If three or more Holders or Certificate Owners (hereinafter
referred to as "Applicants") apply in writing to the Trustee, and such
application states that the Applicants desire to communicate with other Holders
with respect to their rights under this Agreement or under the Certificates and
is accompanied by a copy of the communication which such Applicants propose to
transmit, then the Trustee shall, within five Business Days after the receipt of
such application, afford such Applicants reasonable access during the normal
business hours of the Trustee to the most recent list of Certificateholders held
by the Trustee or shall, as an alternative, send, at the Applicants' expense,
the written communication proffered by the Applicants to all Certificateholders
at their addresses as they appear in the Certificate Register.

         (c) Every Holder or Certificate Owner, if the Holder is a Clearing
Agency, by receiving and holding a Certificate, agrees with the Depositor, the
Master Servicer, the Certificate Registrar and the Trustee that neither the
Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Certificate Registrar nor the Trustee shall
be held accountable by reason of the disclosure of any such information as to
the names and addresses of the Certificateholders hereunder, regardless of the
source from which such information was derived.

               Section 8.03.     Acts of Holders of Certificates.

         (a) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action provided by this Agreement to be given or taken by
Holders or Certificate Owner, if the Holder is a Clearing Agency, may be
embodied in and evidenced by one or more instruments of substantially similar
tenor signed by such Holders in person or by agent duly appointed in writing;
and, except as herein otherwise expressly provided, such action shall become
effective when such instrument or instruments are delivered to the Trustee and,
where expressly required herein, to the Master Servicer. Such instrument or
instruments (as the action embodies therein and evidenced thereby) are herein
sometimes referred to as an "Act" of the Holders signing such instrument or
instruments. Proof of execution of any such instrument or of a writing
appointing any such agents shall be sufficient for any purpose of this Agreement
and conclusive in favor of the Trustee and Master Servicer, if made in the
manner provided in this Section. Each of the Trustee and the Master Servicer
shall promptly notify the others of receipt of any such instrument by it, and
shall promptly forward a copy of such instrument to the others.



                                       97
<PAGE>

         (b) The fact and date of the execution by any Person of any such
instrument or writing may be proved by the affidavit of a witness of such
execution or by the certificate of any notary public or other officer authorized
by law to take acknowledgments or deeds, certifying that the individual signing
such instrument or writing acknowledged to him the execution thereof. Whenever
such execution is by an officer of a corporation or a member of a partnership on
behalf of such corporation or partnership, such certificate or affidavit shall
also constitute sufficient proof of his authority. The fact and date of the
execution of any such instrument or writing, or the authority of the individual
executing the same, may also be proved in any other manner which the Trustee
deems sufficient.

         (c) The ownership of Certificates (whether or not such Certificates
shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notation of ownership or other writing
thereon made by anyone other than the Trustee) shall be proved by the
Certificate Register, and neither the Trustee, the Master Servicer, nor the
Depositor shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

         (d) Any request, demand, authorization, direction, notice, consent,
waiver or other action by the Holder of any Certificate shall bind every future
Holder of the same Certificate and the Holder of every Certificate issued upon
the registration of transfer thereof or in exchange therefor or in lieu thereof,
in respect of anything done, omitted or suffered to be done by the Trustee or
the Master Servicer in reliance thereon, whether or not notation of such action
is made upon such Certificate.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                 ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS
                             BY THE MASTER SERVICER

               Section 9.01.     Duties of the Master Servicer.

         The Certificateholders, by their purchase and acceptance of the
Certificates, appoint Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master Servicer. For and on
behalf of the Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificateholders, the Master
Servicer shall master service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the provisions of the Servicing Agreements.

               Section 9.02.     Master Servicer Fidelity Bond and Master
                                 Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy.

         (a) The Master Servicer, at its expense, shall maintain in effect a
Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy, affording coverage
with respect to all directors, officers, employees and other Persons acting on
such Master Servicer's behalf, and covering errors and omissions in the
performance of the Master Servicer's obligations hereunder. The Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy and the Fidelity Bond shall be in such form and
amount that would meet the requirements of FNMA or FHLMC if it were the
purchaser of the Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer shall (i) require each
Servicer to maintain an Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy and a Fidelity
Bond in accordance with the provisions of the applicable Servicing Agreement,
(ii) cause each Servicer to provide to the Master Servicer certificates



                                       98
<PAGE>

evidencing that such policy and bond is in effect and to furnish to the Master
Servicer any notice of cancellation, non-renewal or modification of the policy
or bond received by it, as and to the extent provided in the applicable
Servicing Agreement, and (iii) furnish copies of the certificates and notices
referred to in clause (ii) to the Trustee upon its request. The Fidelity Bond
and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy may be obtained and maintained in
blanket form.

         (b) The Master Servicer shall promptly report to the Trustee any
material changes that may occur in the Master Servicer Fidelity Bond or the
Master Servicer Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy and shall furnish to the
Trustee, on request, certificates evidencing that such bond and insurance policy
are in full force and effect. The Master Servicer shall promptly report to the
Trustee all cases of embezzlement or fraud, if such events involve funds
relating to the Mortgage Loans. The total losses, regardless of whether claims
are filed with the applicable insurer or surety, shall be disclosed in such
reports together with the amount of such losses covered by insurance. If a bond
or insurance claim report is filed with any of such bonding companies or
insurers, the Master Servicer shall promptly furnish a copy of such report to
the Trustee. Any amounts relating to the Mortgage Loans collected by the Master
Servicer under any such bond or policy shall be promptly remitted by the Master
Servicer to the Trustee for deposit into the Certificate Account. Any amounts
relating to the Mortgage Loans collected by any Servicer under any such bond or
policy shall be remitted to the Master Servicer to the extent provided in the
applicable Servicing Agreement.

               Section 9.03.     Master Servicer's Financial Statements and
                                 Related Information.

         For each year this Agreement is in effect, the Master Servicer shall
submit to the Trustee, each Rating Agency and the Depositor a copy of its annual
unaudited financial statements on or prior to the last day of February of each
year, commencing on February 28, 2005. Such financial statements shall include a
balance sheet, income statement, statement of retained earnings, statement of
additional paid-in capital, statement of changes in financial position and all
related notes and schedules and shall be in comparative form, certified by a
nationally recognized firm of Independent Accountants to the effect that such
statements were examined and prepared in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles applied on a basis consistent with that of the preceding
year.

               Section 9.04.     Power to Act; Procedures.

         (a) The Master Servicer shall master service the Mortgage Loans and
shall have full power and authority, subject to the REMIC Provisions and the
provisions of Article X hereof, and each Servicer shall have full power and
authority (to the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement) to do
any and all things that it may deem necessary or desirable in connection with
the servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans, including but not
limited to the power and authority (i) to execute and deliver, on behalf of the
Certificateholders and the Trustee, customary consents or waivers and other
instruments and documents, (ii) to consent to transfers of any Mortgaged
Property and assumptions of the Mortgage Notes and related Mortgages, (iii) to
collect any Insurance Proceeds and Liquidation Proceeds, and (iv) to effectuate
foreclosure or other conversion of the ownership of the Mortgaged Property
securing any Mortgage Loan, in each case, in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement and the



                                       99
<PAGE>

applicable Servicing Agreement, as applicable; provided that the Master Servicer
shall not take, or knowingly permit any Servicer to take, any action that is
inconsistent with or prejudices the interests of the Trust Fund, the Trustee or
the Certificateholders in any Mortgage Loan or the rights and interests of the
Depositor, the Trustee and the Certificateholders under this Agreement. The
Master Servicer further is authorized and empowered by the Trustee, on behalf of
the Certificateholders and the Trustee, in its own name or in the name of any
Servicer, when the Master Servicer or a Servicer, as the case may be, believes
it is appropriate in its best judgment to register any Mortgage Loan with MERS,
or cause the removal from the registration of any Mortgage Loan on the MERS
system, to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders or any of them, any and all instruments of assignment and
other comparable instruments with respect to such assignment or re-recording of
a Mortgage in the name of MERS, solely as nominee for the Trustee and its
successors and assigns. The Master Servicer shall represent and protect the
interests of the Trust Fund in the same manner as it protects its own interests
in mortgage loans in its own portfolio in any claim, proceeding or litigation
regarding a Mortgage Loan and shall not make or knowingly permit any Servicer to
make any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan that
would cause any REMIC formed hereby to fail to qualify as a REMIC or result in
the imposition of any tax under Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Master Servicer in its own
name or in the name of a Servicer, and each Servicer, to the extent such
authority is delegated to such Servicer by the Master Servicer under the
applicable Servicing Agreement, is hereby authorized and empowered by the
Trustee when the Master Servicer or applicable Servicer, as the case may be,
believes it appropriate in its best judgment and in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices and the applicable Servicing Agreement, to execute and
deliver, on behalf of itself and the Certificateholders, the Trustee or any of
them, any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or
full release or discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to
the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. The Trustee
shall execute, upon request, any powers of attorney furnished to it by the
Master Servicer empowering the Master Servicer or any Servicer to execute and
deliver instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full
release or discharge, and to foreclose upon or otherwise liquidate Mortgaged
Property, and to appeal, prosecute or defend in any court action relating to the
Mortgage Loans or the Mortgaged Property, in accordance with the applicable
Servicing Agreement and this Agreement, and the Trustee shall execute and
deliver such other documents, as the Master Servicer may request, necessary or
appropriate to enable the Master Servicer to master service the Mortgage Loans
and carry out its duties hereunder and to allow each Servicer to service the
Mortgage Loans, in each case in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices
(and the Trustee shall have no liability for misuse of any such powers of
attorney by the Master Servicer or any Servicer). If the Master Servicer or the
Trustee has been advised that it is likely that the laws of the state in which
action is to be taken prohibit such action if taken in the name of the Trustee
or that the Trustee would be adversely affected under the "doing business" or
tax laws of such state if such action is taken in its name, then upon request of
the Trustee, the Master Servicer shall join with the Trustee in the appointment
of a co-trustee pursuant to Section 6.09 hereof. In the performance of its
duties hereunder, the Master Servicer shall be an independent contractor and
shall not, except in those instances where it is taking action in the name of
the Trustee, be deemed to be the agent of the Trustee.

         (b) In master servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the
Master Servicer shall employ procedures and exercise the same care that it
customarily employs and exercises in master servicing and administering loans
for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted Servicing Practices
where such practices do not conflict with this Agreement. Consistent with the
foregoing, the Master Servicer may, and may permit any Servicer to, in its
discretion (i) waive any late payment charge or any prepayment charge or penalty
interest in connection with the prepayment of a Mortgage Loan and (ii) extend
the due dates for payments due on a Mortgage Note for a period not greater than
120 days; provided, however, that the maturity of any Mortgage Loan shall not be
extended past the date on which the final payment is due on the latest maturing
Mortgage Loan as of the Cut-off Date. In the event of any extension described in
clause (ii) above, the Master Servicer shall make or cause to be made Advances
on the related Mortgage Loan in accordance with the provisions of Section 5.04
on the basis of the amortization schedule of such Mortgage Loan without
modification thereof by reason of such extension. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary in this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not make or knowingly
permit any modification, waiver or amendment of any material term of any
Mortgage Loan unless: (1) such Mortgage Loan is in default or default by the
related Mortgagor is, in the reasonable judgment of the Master Servicer or the
applicable Servicer, reasonably foreseeable, (2) in the case of a waiver of a
Prepayment Premium if (a) such Mortgage Loan is in default or default by the
related Mortgagor is reasonably foreseeable, and such waiver would maximize
recovery of total proceeds taking into account the value of such Prepayment
Premium and the related Mortgage Loan or (b) if the prepayment is not the result
of a refinance by the Servicer or any of its affiliates and (i) such Mortgage
Loan is in default or default by the related Mortgagor is, in the reasonable
judgment of the Master Servicer or the applicable Servicer, reasonably
foreseeable, and such waiver would maximize recovery of total proceeds taking
into account the value of such Prepayment Premium and the related Mortgage Loan
or (ii) the collection of the Prepayment Premium would be in violation of
applicable laws or (iii) the collection of such Prepayment Premium would be
considered "predatory" pursuant to written guidance published or issued by any
applicable federal, state or local regulatory authority acting in its official
capacity and having jurisdiction over such matters, and (3) the Master Servicer
shall have provided or caused to be provided to the Trustee an Opinion of
Counsel (which opinion shall, if provided by the Master Servicer, be an expense
reimbursed, to the extent it is an unanticipated expense within the meaning of
Treasury Regulation Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii), from the Collection Account
pursuant to Section 4.02(v)) in writing to the effect that such modification,
waiver or amendment would not cause an Adverse REMIC Event; provided, in no
event shall an Opinion of Counsel be required for the waiver of a Prepayment
Premium under clause (2) above. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, the
Master Servicer shall not without the Trustee's written consent: (i) initiate
any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's name without
indicating the Master Servicer's representative capacity or (ii) take any action
with the intent to cause, and which actually does cause, the Trustee to be
registered to do business in any state.

               Section 9.05.     Servicing Agreements Between the Master
                                 Servicer and Servicers; Enforcement of
                                 Servicers' Obligations.

         (a) Each Servicing Agreement requires the applicable Servicer to
service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions thereof. References
in this Agreement to actions taken



                                      101
<PAGE>

or to be taken by the Master Servicer include such actions taken or to be taken
by a Servicer pursuant to a Servicing Agreement. Any fees, costs and expenses
and other amounts payable to such Servicers shall be deducted from amounts
remitted to the Master Servicer by the applicable Servicer (to the extent
permitted by the applicable Servicing Agreement) and shall not be an obligation
of the Trust Fund, the Trustee or the Master Servicer.

         (b) The Master Servicer shall not be required to (i) take any action
with respect to the servicing of any Mortgage Loan that the related Servicer is
not required to take under the related Servicing Agreement and (ii) cause a
Servicer to take any action or refrain from taking any action if the related
Servicing Agreement does not require the Servicer to take such action or refrain
from taking such action; in both cases notwithstanding any provision of this
Agreement that requires the Master Servicer to take such action or cause the
Servicer to take such action.

         (c) The Master Servicer, for the benefit of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders, shall enforce the obligations of each Servicer under the
related Servicing Agreement, and shall use its reasonable best efforts to
enforce the obligations of each Servicer under the related Servicing Agreement
and shall, upon its obtaining actual knowledge of the failure of a Servicer to
perform its obligations in accordance with the related Servicing Agreement, to
the extent that the non-performance of any such obligations would have a
material adverse effect on a Mortgage Loan, the Trust Fund or
Certificateholders, terminate the rights and obligations of such Servicer
thereunder to the extent and in the manner permitted by the related Servicing
Agreement and either act as servicer of the related Mortgage Loans or enter into
a Servicing Agreement with a successor Servicer. Such enforcement, including,
without limitation, the legal prosecution of claims, termination of Servicing
Agreements and the pursuit of other appropriate remedies, shall be in such form
and carried out to such an extent and at such time as the Master Servicer, in
its good faith business judgment, would require were it the owner of the related
Mortgage Loans. The Master Servicer shall pay the costs of such enforcement at
its own expense, and shall be reimbursed therefor initially only (i) from a
general recovery resulting from such enforcement only to the extent, if any,
that such recovery exceeds all amounts due in respect of the related Mortgage
Loans or (ii) from a specific recovery of costs, expenses or attorneys' fees
against the party against whom such enforcement is directed, and then, to the
extent that such amounts are insufficient to reimburse the Master Servicer for
the costs of such enforcement or (iii) from the Collection Account.

         (d) The Master Servicer shall be entitled to conclusively rely on any
certifications or other information provided by the Servicers under the terms of
the applicable Servicing Agreement, in its preparation of any certifications,
filings or reports, in accordance with the terms hereof or as may be required by
applicable law or regulation.

               Section 9.06.     Collection of Taxes, Assessments and Similar
                                 Items.

         (a) To the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement, the
Master Servicer shall cause each Servicer to establish and maintain one or more
custodial accounts at a depository institution (which may be a depository
institution with which the Master Servicer or any Servicer establishes accounts
in the ordinary course of its servicing activities), the accounts of which are
insured to the maximum extent permitted by the FDIC (each, an "Escrow Account")
and shall deposit therein any collections of amounts received with respect to
amounts due for



                                      102
<PAGE>

taxes, assessments, water rates, Standard Hazard Insurance Policy premiums or
any comparable items for the account of the Mortgagors. Withdrawals from any
Escrow Account may be made (to the extent amounts have been escrowed for such
purpose) only in accordance with the applicable Servicing Agreement. Each
Servicer shall be entitled to all investment income not required to be paid to
Mortgagors on any Escrow Account maintained by such Servicer. The Master
Servicer shall make (or cause to be made) to the extent provided in the
applicable Servicing Agreement advances to the extent necessary in order to
effect timely payment of taxes, water rates, assessments, Standard Hazard
Insurance Policy premiums or comparable items in connection with the related
Mortgage Loan (to the extent that the Mortgagor is required, but fails, to pay
such items), provided that it has determined that the funds so advanced are
recoverable from escrow payments, reimbursement pursuant to Section 4.02(v) or
otherwise.

         (b) Costs incurred by the Master Servicer or by Servicers in effecting
the timely payment of taxes and assessments on the properties subject to the
Mortgage Loans may be added to the amount owing under the related Mortgage Note
where the terms of the Mortgage Note so permit; provided, however, that the
addition of any such cost shall not be taken into account for purposes of
calculating the distributions to be made to Certificateholders. Such costs, to
the extent that they are unanticipated expenses within the meaning of Treasury
Regulations Section 1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii), extraordinary costs, and not ordinary or
routine costs shall be recoverable by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section
4.02(v).

               Section 9.07.     Termination of Servicing Agreements; Successor
                                 Servicers.

         (a) The Master Servicer shall be entitled to terminate the rights and
obligations of any Servicer under the applicable Servicing Agreement in
accordance with the terms and conditions of such Servicing Agreement and without
any limitation by virtue of this Agreement; provided, however, that in the event
of termination of any Servicing Agreement by the Master Servicer or the related
Servicer, the Master Servicer shall either act as Servicer of the related
Mortgage Loans, or enter into a Servicing Agreement with a successor Servicer.

         The parties acknowledge that notwithstanding the preceding sentence,
there may be a transition period, not to exceed 90 days, in order to effect the
transfer of servicing to a successor Servicer. The Master Servicer shall be
entitled to be reimbursed from each Servicer (or by the Trust Fund, if such
Servicer is unable to fulfill its obligations hereunder) for all costs
associated with the transfer of servicing from the predecessor servicer,
including without limitation, any costs or expenses associated with the complete
transfer of all servicing data and the completion, correction or manipulation of
such servicing data, as may be required by the Master Servicer to correct any
errors or insufficiencies in the servicing data or otherwise to enable the
Master Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans properly and effectively.

         (b) If the Master Servicer acts as Servicer, it will not assume
liability for the representations and warranties of the Servicer, if any, that
it replaces. The Master Servicer shall use reasonable efforts to have the
successor Servicer assume liability for the representations and warranties made
by the terminated Servicer in respect of the related Mortgage Loans, and in the
event of any such assumption by the successor Servicer, the Trustee or the
Master Servicer, as applicable, may, in the exercise of its business judgment,
release the terminated Servicer from liability for such representations and
warranties.

<PAGE>

               Section 9.08.     Master Servicer Liable for Enforcement.

         Notwithstanding any Servicing Agreement, the Master Servicer shall
remain obligated and liable to the Trustee and the Certificateholders in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement, to the extent of its
obligations hereunder, without diminution of such obligation or liability by
virtue of such Servicing Agreements or arrangements. The Master Servicer shall
use commercially reasonable efforts to ensure that the Mortgage Loans are
serviced in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and shall use
commercially reasonable efforts to enforce the provisions of each Servicing
Agreement for the benefit of the Certificateholders. The Master Servicer shall
be entitled to enter into any agreement with the Servicers for indemnification
of the Master Servicer and nothing contained in this Agreement shall be deemed
to limit or modify such indemnification. Except as expressly set forth herein,
the Master Servicer shall have no liability for the acts or omissions of any
Servicer in the performance by such Servicer of its obligations under the
related Servicing Agreement.

               Section 9.09.     No Contractual Relationship Between Servicers
                                 and Trustee or Depositor.

         Any Servicing Agreement that may be entered into and any other
transactions or services relating to the Mortgage Loans involving a Servicer in
its capacity as such and not as an originator shall be deemed to be between such
Servicer, the related Seller and the Master Servicer, and except to the extent
expressly provided therein the Trustee and the Depositor shall not be deemed
parties thereto and shall have no claims, rights, obligations, duties or
liabilities with respect to such Servicer except as set forth in Section 9.10
hereof.

               Section 9.10.     Assumption of Servicing Agreement by Trustee.

         (a) In the event the Master Servicer shall for any reason no longer be
the Master Servicer (including by reason of any Event of Default under this
Agreement), after a period not to exceed ninety days after the issuance of any
notice of termination pursuant to Section 6.14 or Section 9.28, as applicable,
the Trustee shall, in accordance with Section 6.14, thereupon assume all of the
rights and obligations of such Master Servicer hereunder and enforce the rights
under each Servicing Agreement entered into with respect to the Mortgage Loans.
The Trustee, its designee or any successor master servicer appointed by the
Trustee shall be deemed to have assumed all of the Master Servicer's interest
herein and therein to the same extent as if such Servicing Agreement had been
assigned to the assuming party, except that the Master Servicer shall not
thereby be relieved of any liability or obligations of the Master Servicer under
such Servicing Agreement accruing prior to its replacement as Master Servicer,
and shall be liable to the Trustee, and hereby agrees to indemnify and hold
harmless the Trustee from and against all costs, damages, expenses and
liabilities (including reasonable attorneys' fees) incurred by the Trustee as a
result of such liability or obligations of the Master Servicer and in connection
with the Trustee's assumption (but not its performance, except to the extent
that costs or liability of the Trustee are created or increased as a result of
negligent or wrongful acts or omissions of the Master Servicer prior to its
replacement as Master Servicer) of the Master Servicer's obligations, duties or
responsibilities thereunder; provided that the Master Servicer shall not
indemnify or hold harmless the Trustee against negligent or willful misconduct
of the Trustee.


                                      104
<PAGE>

         (b) The Master Servicer that has been terminated shall, upon request of
the Trustee but at the expense of such Master Servicer or, at the expense of the
Trust Fund to the extent provided in this Agreement, deliver to the assuming
party all documents and records relating to each Servicing Agreement and the
related Mortgage Loans and an accounting of amounts collected and held by it and
otherwise use its best efforts to effect the orderly and efficient transfer of
each Servicing Agreement to the assuming party.

               Section 9.11.     "Due-on-Sale" Clauses; Assumption Agreements.

         (a) To the extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement, to
the extent Mortgage Loans contain enforceable due-on-sale clauses, and to the
extent that the Master Servicer has knowledge of the conveyance of a Mortgaged
Property, the Master Servicer shall use its reasonable best efforts to cause the
Servicers to enforce such clauses in accordance with the applicable Servicing
Agreement. If applicable law prohibits the enforcement of a due-on-sale clause
or such clause is otherwise not enforced in accordance with the applicable
Servicing Agreement, and, as a consequence, a Mortgage Loan is assumed, the
original Mortgagor may be released from liability in accordance with the
applicable Servicing Agreement.

         (b) The Master Servicer or the related Servicer, as the case may be,
shall be entitled to approve a request from a Mortgagor for the granting of an
easement thereon in favor of another Person or any alteration or demolition of
the related Mortgaged Property if it has determined, exercising its good faith
business judgment in the same manner as it would if it were the owner of the
related Mortgage Loan, that the security for, and the timely and full
collectability of, such Mortgage Loan would not be materially adversely affected
thereby. Any fee collected by the Master Servicer or the related Servicer for
processing such a request will be retained by the Master Servicer or such
Servicer as additional servicing compensation.

               Section 9.12.     Release of Mortgage Files.

         (a) Upon (i) becoming aware of the payment in full of any Mortgage
Loan, (ii) the receipt by the Master Servicer of a notification that payment in
full has been or will be escrowed in a manner customary for such purposes, or
(iii) in the case of a Mortgage Loan as to which the related Mortgaged Property
is located in California, receipt by the Master Servicer of notification from
the applicable Servicer that the Servicer reasonably expects that payment in
full will be received promptly, the Master Servicer will, or will cause the
applicable Servicer to, promptly notify the Trustee (or the applicable
Custodian) by a certification (which certification shall include a statement to
the effect that all amounts received or to be received in connection with such
payment that are required to be deposited in the Collection Account maintained
by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 4.01 have been or will be so
deposited) of a Servicing Officer and shall request the Trustee or the
applicable Custodian, to deliver to the applicable Servicer the related Mortgage
File. In lieu of sending a hard copy certification of a Servicing Officer, the
Master Servicer may, or may cause the Servicer to, deliver the request for
release in a mutually agreeable electronic format. To the extent that such a
request, on its face, originates from a Servicing Officer, no signature shall be
required. Upon receipt of such certification and request, the Trustee or the
applicable Custodian, shall promptly release the related Mortgage File to the
applicable Servicer and neither the Trustee nor the applicable Custodian shall
have any further responsibility with regard to such Mortgage File. The Master
Servicer is authorized, and



                                      105
<PAGE>

each Servicer, to the extent such authority is delegated to such Servicer by the
Master Servicer under the applicable Servicing Agreement, is authorized, to
give, as agent for the Trustee, as the mortgagee under the Mortgage that secured
the Mortgage Loan, an instrument of satisfaction (or assignment of mortgage
without recourse) regarding the Mortgaged Property subject to the Mortgage,
which instrument of satisfaction or assignment, as the case may be, shall be
delivered to the Person or Persons entitled thereto against receipt therefor of
such payment, it being understood and agreed that no expenses incurred in
connection with such instrument of satisfaction or assignment, as the case may
be, shall be chargeable to the Collection Account.

         (b) From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or
foreclosure of, or other legal proceedings relating to, any Mortgage Loan and in
accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices and the applicable Servicing
Agreement, the Trustee shall execute such pleadings, request for trustee's sale
or other documents as shall be prepared and furnished to the Trustee by the
Master Servicer, or by a Servicer (in form reasonably acceptable to the Trustee)
and as are necessary to the prosecution of any such proceedings. The Trustee or
the applicable Custodian, shall, upon request of the Master Servicer, or of a
Servicer, and delivery to the Trustee or the applicable Custodian, of a trust
receipt signed by a Servicing Officer substantially in the form annexed hereto
as Exhibit C or in the form annexed to the applicable Custodial Agreement as
Exhibit C, release the related Mortgage File held in its possession or control
to the Master Servicer (or the applicable Servicer). Such trust receipt shall
obligate the Master Servicer or applicable Servicer to return the Mortgage File
to the Trustee or applicable Custodian, as applicable, when the need therefor by
the Master Servicer or applicable Servicer no longer exists unless (i) the
Mortgage Loan shall be liquidated, in which case, upon receipt of a certificate
of a Servicing Officer similar to that herein above specified, the trust receipt
shall be released by the Trustee or the applicable Custodian, as applicable, to
the Master Servicer (or the applicable Servicer) or (ii) the Mortgage File has
been delivered directly or through a Servicer to an attorney, or to a public
trustee or other public official as required by law, for purposes of initiating
or pursuing legal action or other proceedings for the foreclosure of the
Mortgaged Property either judicially or non-judicially, and the Master Servicer
has delivered directly or through a Servicer to the Trustee a certificate of a
Servicing Officer certifying as to the name and address of the Person to which
such Mortgage File or such document was delivered and the purpose or purposes of
such delivery.

               Section 9.13.     Documents, Records and Funds in Possession of
                                 Master Servicer To Be Held for Trustee.

         (a) The Master Servicer shall transmit, or cause the applicable
Servicer to transmit, to the Trustee such documents and instruments coming into
the possession of the Master Servicer or such Servicer from time to time as are
required by the terms hereof to be delivered to the Trustee including notifying
the Trustee (or the applicable Custodian) in the event that any Mortgagor of any
Employee Mortgage Loan ceases to be an employee of Lehman Brothers Inc. or its
Affiliates. Any funds received by the Master Servicer or by a Servicer in
respect of any Mortgage Loan or which otherwise are collected by the Master
Servicer or by a Servicer as a Subsequent Recovery, Liquidation Proceeds or
Insurance Proceeds in respect of any Mortgage Loan shall be held for the benefit
of the Trustee and the Certificateholders subject to the Master Servicer's right
to retain or withdraw from the Collection Account the Master Servicing Fee and



                                      106
<PAGE>

other amounts provided in this Agreement, and to the right of each Servicer to
retain its Servicing Fee and other amounts as provided in the applicable
Servicing Agreement. The Master Servicer shall, and shall (to the extent
provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement) cause each Servicer to, provide
access to information and documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans to the
Trustee, its agents and accountants at any time upon reasonable request and
during normal business hours, and to Certificateholders that are savings and
loan associations, banks or insurance companies, the Office of Thrift
Supervision, the FDIC and the supervisory agents and examiners of such Office
and Corporation or examiners of any other federal or state banking or insurance
regulatory authority if so required by applicable regulations of the Office of
Thrift Supervision or other regulatory authority, such access to be afforded
without charge but only upon reasonable request in writing and during normal
business hours at the offices of the Master Servicer designated by it. In
fulfilling such a request the Master Servicer shall not be responsible for
determining the sufficiency of such information.

         (b) All Mortgage Files and funds collected or held by, or under the
control of, the Master Servicer, or any Servicer, in respect of any Mortgage
Loans, whether from the collection of principal and interest payments or from a
Subsequent Recovery, Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds, shall be held
by the Master Servicer, or by such Servicer, for and on behalf of the Trustee
and the Certificateholders and shall be and remain the sole and exclusive
property of the Trustee; provided, however, that the Master Servicer and each
Servicer shall be entitled to setoff against, and deduct from, any such funds
any amounts that are properly due and payable to the Master Servicer or such
Servicer under this Agreement or the applicable Servicing Agreement and shall be
authorized to remit such funds to the Trustee in accordance with this Agreement.

         (c) The Master Servicer hereby acknowledges that concurrently with the
execution of this Agreement, the Trustee shall own or, to the extent that a
court of competent jurisdiction shall deem the conveyance of the Mortgage Loans
from the Seller to the Depositor not to constitute a sale, the Trustee shall
have a security interest in the Mortgage Loans and in all Mortgage Files
representing such Mortgage Loans and in all funds now or hereafter held by, or
under the control of, a Servicer or the Master Servicer that are collected by
such Servicer or the Master Servicer in connection with such Mortgage Loans,
whether as scheduled installments of principal and interest or as full or
partial prepayments of principal or interest or as a Subsequent Recovery,
Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds or otherwise, and in all proceeds of
the foregoing and proceeds of proceeds (but excluding any fee or other amounts
to which such Servicer is entitled under the applicable Servicing Agreement, or
the Master Servicer or the Depositor is entitled to hereunder); and the Master
Servicer agrees that so long as the Mortgage Loans are assigned to and held by
the Trustee, all documents or instruments constituting part of the Mortgage
Files, and such funds relating to the Mortgage Loans which come into the
possession or custody of, or which are subject to the control of, the Master
Servicer or any Servicer shall be held by the Master Servicer or such Servicer
for and on behalf of the Trustee as the Trustee's agent and bailee for purposes
of perfecting the Trustee's security interest therein as provided by the
applicable Uniform Commercial Code or other laws.

         (d) The Master Servicer agrees that it shall not, and shall not
authorize any Servicer to, create, incur or subject any Mortgage Loans, or any
funds that are deposited in any custodial



                                      107
<PAGE>

account, Escrow Account or the Collection Account, or any funds that otherwise
are or may become due or payable to the Trustee, to any claim, lien, security
interest, judgment, levy, writ of attachment or other encumbrance, nor assert by
legal action or otherwise any claim or right of setoff against any Mortgage Loan
or any funds collected on, or in connection with, a Mortgage Loan.

               Section 9.14.     Representations and Warranties of the Master
                                 Servicer.

         (a) The Master Servicer hereby represents and warrants to the Depositor
and the Trustee, for the benefit of the Certificateholders, as of the Closing
Date that:

              (i) it is validly existing and in good standing under the
         jurisdiction of its formation, and as Master Servicer has full power
         and authority to transact any and all business contemplated by this
         Agreement and to execute, deliver and comply with its obligations under
         the terms of this Agreement, the execution, delivery and performance of
         which have been duly authorized by all necessary corporate action on
         the part of the Master Servicer;

              (ii) the execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Master
         Servicer and its performance and compliance with the terms of this
         Agreement will not (A) violate the Master Servicer's charter or bylaws,
         (B) violate any law or regulation or any administrative decree or order
         to which it is subject or (C) constitute a default (or an event which,
         with notice or lapse of time, or both, would constitute a default)
         under, or result in the breach of, any material contract, agreement or
         other instrument to which the Master Servicer is a party or by which it
         is bound or to which any of its assets are subject, which violation,
         default or breach would materially and adversely affect the Master
         Servicer's ability to perform its obligations under this Agreement;

              (iii) this Agreement constitutes, assuming due authorization,
         execution and delivery hereof by the other respective parties hereto, a
         legal, valid and binding obligation of the Master Servicer, enforceable
         against it in accordance with the terms hereof, except as such
         enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
         moratorium and other laws affecting the enforcement of creditors'
         rights in general, and by general equity principles (regardless of
         whether such enforcement is considered in a proceeding in equity or at
         law);

              (iv) the Master Servicer is not in default with respect to any
         order or decree of any court or any order or regulation of any federal,
         state, municipal or governmental agency to the extent that any such
         default would materially and adversely affect its performance
         hereunder;

              (v) the Master Servicer is not a party to or bound by any
         agreement or instrument or subject to any charter provision, bylaw or
         any other corporate restriction or any judgment, order, writ,
         injunction, decree, law or regulation that may materially and adversely
         affect its ability as Master Servicer to perform its obligations under
         this Agreement or that requires the consent of any third person to the
         execution of this


                                      108
<PAGE>

         Agreement or the performance by the Master Servicer of its obligations
         under this Agreement;

              (vi) no litigation is pending or, to the best of the Master
         Servicer's knowledge, threatened against the Master Servicer which
         would prohibit its entering into this Agreement or performing its
         obligations under this Agreement;

              (vii) the Master Servicer, or an affiliate thereof the primary
         business of which is the servicing of conventional residential mortgage
         loans, is an FNMA- and FHLMC approved seller/servicer;

              (viii) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court
         or governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery
         and performance by the Master Servicer of or compliance by the Master
         Servicer with this Agreement or the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement, except for such consents, approvals,
         authorizations and orders (if any) as have been obtained;

              (ix) the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
         Agreement are in the ordinary course of business of the Master
         Servicer; and

              (x) the Master Servicer has obtained an Errors and Omissions
         Insurance Policy and a Fidelity Bond in accordance with Section 9.02,
         each of which is in full force and effect, and each of which provides
         at least such coverage as is required hereunder.

         (b) It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in this Section 9.14 shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Agreement. The Master Servicer shall indemnify the Depositor and the Trustee and
hold them harmless against any loss, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and expenses resulting
from any claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or
resulting from, a breach of the Master Servicer's representations and warranties
contained in Section 9.14(a). Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the
contrary, the Master Servicer shall not be liable for special, indirect or
consequential losses or damages of any kind whatsoever (including, but not
limited to, lost profits). It is understood and agreed that the enforcement of
the obligation of the Master Servicer set forth in this Section to indemnify the
Depositor and the Trustee as provided in this Section constitutes the sole
remedy (other than as set forth in Section 6.14) of the Depositor and the
Trustee, respecting a breach of the foregoing representations and warranties.
Such indemnification shall survive any termination of the Master Servicer as
Master Servicer hereunder, and any termination of this Agreement.

         Any cause of action against the Master Servicer relating to or arising
out of the breach of any representations and warranties made in this Section
shall accrue upon discovery of such breach by any of the Depositor, the Master
Servicer or the Trustee or notice thereof by any one of such parties to the
other parties.

         (c) It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
of the Depositor set forth in Sections 2.03(a)(i) through (vi) shall survive the
execution and delivery of this Agreement. The Depositor shall indemnify the
Master Servicer and hold it harmless against any



                                      109
<PAGE>

loss, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs,
judgments, and other costs and expenses resulting from any claim, demand,
defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting from, a breach of
the Depositor's representations and warranties contained in Sections 2.03(a)(i)
through (vi) hereof. It is understood and agreed that the enforcement of the
obligation of the Depositor set forth in this Section to indemnify the Master
Servicer as provided in this Section constitutes the sole remedy of the Master
Servicer respecting a breach by the Depositor of the representations and
warranties in Sections 2.03(a)(i) through (vi) hereof.

         Any cause of action against the Depositor relating to or arising out of
the breach of the representations and warranties made in Sections 2.03(a)(i)
through (vi) hereof shall accrue upon discovery of such breach by either the
Depositor or the Master Servicer or notice thereof by any one of such parties to
the other parties.

               Section 9.15.     Closing Certificate and Opinion.

         On or before the Closing Date, the Master Servicer shall cause to be
delivered to the Depositor, the Trustee and Lehman Brothers Inc. an Opinion of
Counsel, dated the Closing Date, in form and substance reasonably satisfactory
to the Depositor and Lehman Brothers Inc., as to the due authorization,
execution and delivery of this Agreement by the Master Servicer and the
enforceability thereof.

               Section 9.16.     Standard Hazard and Flood Insurance Policies.

         For each Mortgage Loan (other than a Cooperative Loan), the Master
Servicer shall maintain, or cause to be maintained by each Servicer, standard
fire and casualty insurance and, where applicable, flood insurance, all in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the related Servicing
Agreement, as applicable. It is understood and agreed that such insurance shall
be with insurers meeting the eligibility requirements set forth in the
applicable Servicing Agreement and that no earthquake or other additional
insurance is to be required of any Mortgagor or to be maintained on property
acquired in respect of a defaulted loan, other than pursuant to such applicable
laws and regulations as shall at any time be in force and as shall require such
additional insurance.

         Pursuant to Section 4.01, any amounts collected by the Master Servicer,
or by any Servicer, under any insurance policies maintained pursuant to this
Section 9.16 (other than amounts to be applied to the restoration or repair of
the property subject to the related Mortgage or released to the Mortgagor in
accordance with the Master Servicer's or the Servicer's normal servicing
procedures and Accepted Servicing Practices) shall be deposited into the
Collection Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 4.02. Any cost
incurred by the Master Servicer or any Servicer in maintaining any such
insurance if the Mortgagor defaults in its obligation to do so shall be added to
the amount owing under the Mortgage Loan where the terms of the Mortgage Loan so
permit; provided, however, that the addition of any such cost shall not be taken
into account for purposes of calculating the distributions to be made to
Certificateholders and shall be recoverable by the Master Servicer or such
Servicer pursuant to Section 4.02(v).

<PAGE>

               Section 9.17.   Presentment of Claims and Collection of Proceeds.

         The Master Servicer shall, or shall cause each Servicer (to the extent
provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement) to, prepare and present on
behalf of the Trustee and the Certificateholders all claims under the Insurance
Policies with respect to the Mortgage Loans, and take such actions (including
the negotiation, settlement, compromise or enforcement of the insured's claim)
as shall be necessary to realize recovery under such policies. Any proceeds
disbursed to the Master Servicer (or disbursed to a Servicer and remitted to the
Master Servicer) in respect of such policies or bonds shall be promptly
deposited in the Collection Account upon receipt, except that any amounts
realized that are to be applied to the repair or restoration of the related
Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the Master
Servicer's or the Servicer's normal servicing procedures need not be so
deposited (or remitted).

               Section 9.18.     Maintenance of the Primary Mortgage Insurance
                                 Policies.

         (a) The Master Servicer shall not take, or knowingly permit any
Servicer (consistent with the applicable Servicing Agreement) to take, any
action that would result in non-coverage under any applicable Primary Mortgage
Insurance Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of such Master Servicer
or Servicer, would have been covered thereunder. To the extent that coverage is
available, the Master Servicer shall use its best reasonable efforts to keep in
force and effect, or to cause each Servicer to keep in force and effect (to the
extent that the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to maintain such
insurance), primary mortgage insurance applicable to each Mortgage Loan in
accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the related Servicing
Agreement, as applicable. The Master Servicer shall not, and shall not permit
any Servicer to, cancel or refuse to renew any such Primary Mortgage Insurance
Policy that is in effect at the date of the initial issuance of the Certificates
and is required to be kept in force hereunder except as required by applicable
law or in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement and the related
Servicing Agreement, as applicable. (b) The Master Servicer agrees to present,
or to cause each Servicer to present, on behalf of the Trustee and the
Certificateholders, claims to the insurer under any Primary Mortgage Insurance
Policies and, in this regard, to take such reasonable action as shall be
necessary to permit recovery under any Primary Mortgage Insurance Policies
respecting defaulted Mortgage Loans. Pursuant to Section 4.01, any amounts
collected by the Master Servicer or any Servicer under any Primary Mortgage
Insurance Policies shall be deposited in the Collection Account, subject to
withdrawal pursuant to Section 4.02.

               Section 9.19.     Trustee To Retain Possession of Certain
                                 Insurance Policies and Documents.

         The Trustee (or its custodian, if any, as directed by the Trustee),
shall retain possession and custody of the originals of the Primary Mortgage
Insurance Policies or certificate of insurance if applicable and any
certificates of renewal as to the foregoing as may be issued from time to time
as contemplated by this Agreement. Until all amounts distributable in respect of
the Certificates have been distributed in full and the Master Servicer otherwise
has fulfilled its obligations under this Agreement, the Trustee (or its
custodian, if any, as directed by the Trustee) shall also retain possession and
custody of each Mortgage File in accordance with and subject to



                                      111
<PAGE>

the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The Master Servicer shall promptly
deliver or cause to be delivered to the Trustee (or its custodian, if any, as
directed by the Trustee), upon the execution or receipt thereof the originals of
the Primary Mortgage Insurance Policies and any certificates of renewal thereof,
and such other documents or instruments that constitute portions of the Mortgage
File that come into the possession of the Master Servicer from time to time.

               Section 9.20.     Realization Upon Defaulted Mortgage Loans.

         The Master Servicer shall use its reasonable best efforts to, or to
cause each Servicer to, foreclose upon, repossess or otherwise comparably
convert the ownership of Mortgaged Properties securing such of the Mortgage
Loans as come into and continue in default and as to which no satisfactory
arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments, all in
accordance with the applicable Servicing Agreement. Alternatively, the Master
Servicer may take, or authorize any Servicer to take, other actions in respect
of a defaulted Mortgage Loan, which may include (i) accepting a short sale (a
payoff of the Mortgage Loan for an amount less than the total amount
contractually owed in order to facilitate a sale of the Mortgaged Property by
the Mortgagor) or permitting a short refinancing (a payoff of the Mortgage Loan
for an amount less than the total amount contractually owed in order to
facilitate refinancing transactions by the Mortgagor not involving a sale of the
Mortgaged Property), (ii) arranging for a repayment plan or (iii) agreeing to a
modification in accordance with Section 9.04. In connection with such
foreclosure or other conversion or action, the Master Servicer shall, consistent
with Section 9.18, follow such practices and procedures as it shall reasonably
determine to be in the best interests of the Trust Fund and the
Certificateholders and which shall be consistent with its customary practices in
performing its general mortgage servicing activities; provided that the Master
Servicer shall not be liable in any respect hereunder if the Master Servicer is
acting in connection with any such foreclosure or other conversion or action in
a manner that is consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. Neither the
Master Servicer, nor any Servicer, shall be required to expend its own funds or
incur other reimbursable charges in connection with any foreclosure, or
attempted foreclosure which is not completed, or toward the correction of any
default on a related senior mortgage loan, or towards the restoration of any
property unless it shall determine (i) that such restoration and/or foreclosure
will increase the proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to the
Certificateholders after reimbursement to itself for such expenses or charges
and (ii) that such expenses and charges will be recoverable to it through
Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds (as provided in Section 4.02).

               Section 9.21.     Compensation to the Master Servicer.

         The Master Servicer shall (i) be entitled, at its election, either (a)
to pay itself the Master Servicing Fee, in respect of the Mortgage Loans out of
any Mortgagor payment on account of interest prior to the deposit of such
payment in the Collection Account it maintains or (b) to withdraw from the
Collection Account the Master Servicing Fee to the extent permitted by Section
4.02. The Master Servicer shall also be entitled, at its election, either (a) to
pay itself the Master Servicing Fee in respect of each delinquent Mortgage Loan
master serviced by it out of Liquidation Proceeds in respect of such Mortgage
Loan or other recoveries with respect thereto to the extent permitted in Section
4.02 or (b) to withdraw from the Collection Account it maintains the Master
Servicing Fee in respect of each Liquidated Mortgage Loan to the extent of



                                      112
<PAGE>

such Liquidation Proceeds or other recoveries, to the extent permitted by
Section 4.02. Servicing compensation in the form of assumption fees, if any,
late payment charges, as collected, if any, or otherwise (but not including any
Prepayment Penalty Amount) shall be retained by the Master Servicer (or the
applicable Servicer) and shall not be deposited in the Collection Account. If
the Master Servicer does not retain or withdraw the Master Servicing Fee from
the Collection Account as provided herein, the Master Servicer shall be entitled
to direct the Trustee to pay the Master Servicing Fee to such Master Servicer by
withdrawal from the Certificate Account to the extent that payments have been
received with respect to the applicable Mortgage Loan. The Master Servicer shall
be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with its activities
hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement therefor except as provided
in this Agreement. Pursuant to Section 4.01(e), all income and gain realized
from any investment of funds in the Collection Account shall be for the benefit
of the Master Servicer as additional compensation. The provisions of this
Section 9.21 are subject to the provisions of Section 6.14(b).

               Section 9.22.     REO Property.

         (a) In the event the Trust Fund acquires ownership of any REO Property
in respect of any Mortgage Loan, the deed or certificate of sale shall be issued
to the Trustee, or to its nominee, on behalf of the Certificateholders. The
Master Servicer shall use its reasonable best efforts to sell, or, to the extent
provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement, cause the applicable Servicer to
sell, any REO Property as expeditiously as possible and in accordance with the
provisions of this Agreement and the related Servicing Agreement, as applicable,
but in all events within the time period, and subject to the conditions set
forth in Article X hereof. Pursuant to its efforts to sell such REO Property,
the Master Servicer shall protect and conserve, or cause the applicable Servicer
to protect and conserve, such REO Property in the manner and to such extent
required by the applicable Servicing Agreement, subject to Article X hereof.

         (b) The Master Servicer shall deposit or cause to be deposited all
funds collected and received by it, or recovered from any Servicer, in
connection with the operation of any REO Property in the Collection Account.

         (c) The Master Servicer and the applicable Servicer, upon the final
disposition of any REO Property, shall be entitled to reimbursement for any
related unreimbursed Advances as well as any unpaid Master Servicing Fees or
Servicing Fees from Liquidation Proceeds received in connection with the final
disposition of such REO Property; provided, that (without limitation of any
other right of reimbursement that the Master Servicer or any Servicer shall have
hereunder) any such unreimbursed Advances as well as any unpaid Master Servicing
Fees or Servicing Fees may be reimbursed or paid, as the case may be, prior to
final disposition, out of any net rental income or other net amounts derived
from such REO Property.

         (d) The Liquidation Proceeds from the final disposition of the REO
Property, net of any payment to the Master Servicer and the applicable Servicer
as provided above, shall be deposited in the Collection Account on or prior to
the Determination Date in the month following receipt thereof and be remitted by
wire transfer in immediately available funds to the Trustee for deposit into the
Certificate Account on the next succeeding Deposit Date.

by a Servicing Officer, setting forth the status of the Collection Account
maintained by the Master Servicer as of the close of business on the related

distribution has not been made by the Master Servicer, specifying the nature and
status thereof) and showing, for the period covered by such statement, the
aggregate of deposits into and withdrawals from the Collection Account
maintained by the Master Servicer. Copies of such statement shall be provided by
the Master Servicer to the Depositor, Attention: Contract Finance, and, upon
request, any Certificateholders (or by the Trustee at the Master Servicer's
expense if the Master Servicer shall fail to provide such copies (unless (i) the
Master Servicer shall have failed to provide the Trustee with such statement or
(ii) the Trustee shall be unaware of the Master Servicer's failure to provide
such statement)).

         (b) Not later than two Business Days following each Distribution Date,
the Master Servicer shall deliver to the Person designated by the Depositor, in
a format consistent with other electronic loan level reporting supplied by the
Master Servicer in connection with similar transactions, "loan level"
information with respect to the Mortgage Loans as of the related Determination
Date (including information on any Net Prepayment Interest Shortfalls), to the
extent that such information has been provided to the Master Servicer by the
Servicers or by the Depositor.

         (c) All information, reports and statements prepared by the Master
Servicer under this Agreement shall be based on information supplied to the
Master Servicer by the Servicers without independent verification thereof and
the Master Servicer shall be entitled to rely on such information.

         (d) The Master Servicer shall provide the Trustee with such information
as the Trustee may reasonably request in connection with its responsibilities
under Section 10.01 hereof provided that such information is in the possession
of the Master Servicer.

               Section 9.25.     Annual Officer's Certificate as to Compliance.

         (a) The Master Servicer shall deliver to the Trustee and the Rating
Agencies no later than five (5) Business Days after March 15th of each year,
commencing in March 2005, an Officer's Certificate, certifying that with respect
to the period ending on the immediately preceding December 31; (i) such
Servicing Officer has reviewed the activities of such Master Servicer during the
preceding calendar year or portion thereof and its performance under this
Agreement; (ii) to the best of such Servicing Officer's knowledge, based on such
review, such Master Servicer has performed and fulfilled its duties,
responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement in all material respects
throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any
such duties, responsibilities or obligations, specifying each such default known
to such Servicing Officer and the nature and status thereof, (iii) nothing has
come to the attention



                                      114
<PAGE>

of such Servicing Officer to lead such Servicing Officer to believe that any
Servicer has failed to perform any of its duties, responsibilities and
obligations under its Servicing Agreement in all material respects throughout
such year, or, if there has been a material default in the performance or
fulfillment of any such duties, responsibilities or obligations, specifying each
such default known to such Servicing Officer and the nature and status thereof,
(iv) the Master Servicer has received from each Servicer such Servicer's annual
certificate of compliance and a copy of such Servicer's annual audit report, in
each case to the extent required under the applicable Servicing Agreement, or,
if any such certificate or report has not been received by the Master Servicer,
the Master Servicer is using its best reasonable efforts to obtain such
certificate or report; and (v) such other additional items as may be required by
applicable law or regulation.

         (b) Copies of such statements shall be provided to any
Certificateholder upon request, by the Master Servicer or by the Trustee at the
Master Servicer's expense if the Master Servicer failed to provide such copies
(unless (i) the Master Servicer shall have failed to provide the Trustee with
such statement or (ii) the Trustee shall be unaware of the Master Servicer's
failure to provide such statement).

               Section 9.26.   Annual Independent Accountants' Servicing Report.

         If the Master Servicer has, during the course of any fiscal year,
directly serviced any of the Mortgage Loans, then the Master Servicer at its
expense shall cause a nationally recognized firm of independent certified public
accountants to furnish a statement to the Trustee, the Rating Agencies and the
Depositor on or before the last day of February of each year, commencing on
February 28, 2005, to the effect that, with respect to the most recently ended
fiscal year, such firm has examined certain records and documents relating to
the Master Servicer's performance of its servicing obligations under this
Agreement and pooling and servicing and trust agreements in material respects
similar to this Agreement and to each other and that, on the basis of such
examination conducted substantially in compliance with the audit program for
mortgages serviced for FHLMC or the Uniform Single Attestation Program for
Mortgage Bankers or such other attestation program as may be required by
applicable law or regulation, such firm is of the opinion that the Master
Servicer's activities have been conducted in compliance with this Agreement, or
that such examination has disclosed no material items of noncompliance except
for (i) such exceptions as such firm believes to be immaterial, (ii) such other
exceptions as are set forth in such statement and (iii) such exceptions that the
Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers or the Audit Program for
Mortgages Serviced by FHLMC requires it to report. Copies of such statements
shall be provided to any Certificateholder upon request by the Master Servicer,
or by the Trustee at the expense of the Master Servicer if the Master Servicer
shall fail to provide such copies. If such report discloses exceptions that are
material, the Master Servicer shall advise the Trustee whether such exceptions
have been or are susceptible of cure, and will take prompt action to do so.

         To the extent that the Master Servicer receives an Annual Independent
Accountant's Servicing Report from any Servicer, the Master Servicer shall
forward a copy of such report to the Trustee. If the report is not received from
the Servicer, the Trustee may request that the Master Servicer contact the
applicable Servicer to obtain such report. Neither the Master Servicer nor the
Trustee will be liable for the failure of a Servicer to provide such report.

               Section 9.27.     Merger or Consolidation.

         Any Person into which the Master Servicer may be merged or
consolidated, or any Person resulting from any merger, conversion, other change
in form or consolidation to which the Master Servicer shall be a party, or any
Person succeeding to the business of the Master Servicer, shall be the successor
to the Master Servicer hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper
or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to
the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that the successor or resulting
Person to the Master Servicer shall be a Person that shall be qualified and
approved to service mortgage loans for FNMA or FHLMC and shall have a net worth
of not less than $15,000,000.

               Section 9.28.     Resignation of Master Servicer.

         Except as otherwise provided in Sections 9.27 and 9.29 hereof, the
Master Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed
on it unless it determines that the Master Servicer's duties hereunder are no
longer permissible under applicable law or are in material conflict by reason of
applicable law with any other activities carried on by it and cannot be cured.
Any such determination permitting the resignation of the Master Servicer shall
be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel that shall be Independent to such effect
delivered to the Trustee. In the event such determination of ineligibility of
the Master Servicer to continue in the capacity of master servicer is made by
the Master Servicer or the Trustee, no such resignation shall become effective
until a period of time not to exceed 90 days after the Trustee receives written
notice thereof from the Master Servicer and until the Trustee shall have
assumed, or a successor master servicer shall have been appointed by the Trustee
and until such successor shall have assumed, the Master Servicer's
responsibilities and obligations under this Agreement. Notice of such
resignation shall be given promptly by the Master Servicer to the Depositor and
the Trustee.

               Section 9.29.     Assignment or Delegation of Duties by the
                                 Master Servicer.

         Except as expressly provided herein, the Master Servicer shall not
assign or transfer any of its rights, benefits or privileges hereunder to any
other Person, or delegate to or subcontract with, or authorize or appoint any
other Person to perform any of the duties, covenants or obligations to be
performed by the Master Servicer hereunder; provided, however, that the Master
Servicer shall have the right without the prior written consent of the Trustee,
the Depositor or the Rating Agencies to delegate or assign to or subcontract
with or authorize or appoint an Affiliate of the Master Servicer to perform and
carry out any duties, covenants or obligations to be performed and carried out
by the Master Servicer hereunder. In no case, however, shall any such
delegation, subcontracting or assignment to an Affiliate of the Master Servicer
relieve the Master Servicer of any liability hereunder. Notice of such permitted
assignment shall be given promptly by the Master Servicer to the Depositor and
the Trustee. If, pursuant to any provision hereof, the duties of the Master
Servicer are transferred to a successor master servicer, the entire amount of
the Master Servicing Fees and other compensation payable to the Master Servicer
pursuant hereto, including amounts payable to or permitted to be retained



                                      116
<PAGE>

or withdrawn by the Master Servicer pursuant to Section 9.21 hereof, shall
thereafter be payable to such successor master servicer.

               Section 9.30.     Limitation on Liability of the Master Servicer
                                 and Others.

         (a) The Master Servicer undertakes to perform such duties and only such
duties as are specifically set forth in this Agreement.

         (b) No provision of this Agreement shall be construed to relieve the
Master Servicer from liability for its own negligent action, its own negligent
failure to act or its own willful misconduct; provided, however, that the duties
and obligations of the Master Servicer shall be determined solely by the express
provisions of this Agreement, the Master Servicer shall not be liable except for
the performance of such duties and obligations as are specifically set forth in
this Agreement; no implied covenants or obligations shall be read into this
Agreement against the Master Servicer and, in absence of bad faith on the part
of the Master Servicer, the Master Servicer may conclusively rely, as to the
truth of the statements and the correctness of the opinions expressed therein,
upon any certificates or opinions furnished to the Master Servicer and
conforming to the requirements of this Agreement.

         (c) None of the Master Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor or any of
the directors, officers, employees or agents of any of them shall be under any
liability to the Trustee or the Certificateholders for any action taken or for
refraining from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this
Agreement, or for errors in judgment; provided, however, that this provision
shall not protect the Master Servicer, the Seller or the Depositor or any such
person against any liability that would otherwise be imposed by reason of
willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in its performance of its duties or
by reason of reckless disregard for its obligations and duties under this
Agreement. The Master Servicer, the Seller and the Depositor and any director,
officer, employee or agent of any of them shall be entitled to indemnification
by the Trust Fund and will be held harmless against any loss, liability or
expense incurred in connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement
or the Certificates other than any loss, liability or expense incurred by reason
of willful misfeasance, bad faith or negligence in the performance of his or its
duties hereunder or by reason of reckless disregard of his or its obligations
and duties hereunder. The Master Servicer, the Seller and the Depositor and any
director, officer, employee or agent of any of them may rely in good faith on
any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any
Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Master Servicer shall be
under no obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action that is
not incidental to its duties to master service the Mortgage Loans in accordance
with this Agreement and that in its opinion may involve it in any expenses or
liability; provided, however, that the Master Servicer may in its sole
discretion undertake any such action that it may deem necessary or desirable in
respect to this Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereto and
the interests of the Certificateholders hereunder. In such event, the legal
expenses and costs of such action and any liability resulting therefrom shall be
expenses, costs and liabilities of the Trust Fund and the Master Servicer shall
be entitled to be reimbursed therefor out of the Collection Account it maintains
as provided by Section 4.02.

               Section 9.31.     Indemnification; Third-Party Claims.

         The Master Servicer agrees to indemnify the Depositor and the Trustee,
and hold them harmless against any and all claims, losses, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs,
liability, fees and expenses that the Depositor and the Trustee may sustain as a
result of the failure of the Master Servicer to perform its duties and master
service the Mortgage Loans in compliance with the terms of this Agreement. The
Depositor and the Trustee shall immediately notify the Master Servicer if a
claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage
Loans entitling the Depositor or the Trustee to indemnification hereunder,
whereupon the Master Servicer shall assume the defense of any such claim and pay
all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay,
discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it or
them in respect of such claim.

                                   ARTICLE X

                              REMIC ADMINISTRATION

               Section 10.01.    REMIC and Grantor Trust Administration.

         (a) As set forth in the Preliminary Statement hereto, REMIC status
shall be elected in accordance with the REMIC Provisions with respect to each of
REMIC 1, REMIC 2 and the Upper Tier REMIC. The Trustee shall make such elections
on Forms 1066 or other appropriate federal tax or information return for the
taxable year ending on the last day of the calendar year in which the
Certificates are issued. For the purposes of such elections, each of the REMIC 1
Regular Interests is hereby designated as a regular interest in REMIC 1. Each of
the REMIC 2 Regular Interests is hereby designated as a regular interest in
REMIC 2. Each of the REMIC 3 Regular Interests is hereby designated as a regular
interest in the Upper Tier REMIC. The Class LT1-R Interest is hereby designated
as the sole residual interest in REMIC 1. The Class LT2-R Interest is hereby
designated as the sole residual interest in REMIC 2. The REMIC 3 Residual
Interest is hereby designated as the sole residual interest in the Upper Tier
REMIC. The Class R Certificate evidences ownership of the Class LT1-R Interest ,
the Class LT2-R Interest and the REMIC 3 Residual Interest.

         It is the intention of the parties hereto that the segregated pool
of assets consisting of amounts payable in respect of the Class P Certificates
constitute a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. The Trustee, by its
execution and delivery hereof, acknowledges the assignment to it of the Grantor
Trust I Assets and declares that it holds and will hold such assets in trust for
the exclusive use and benefit of all present and future Holders of the Class P
Certificates. The rights of Holders of the Class P Certificates to receive
distributions from the proceeds of the Grantor Trust I Assets and all ownership
interests of such Holders in and to such distributions, shall be as set forth in
this Agreement.

         It is the intention of the parties hereto that the segregated pool
of assets consisting of amounts payable in respect of the Class E Certificates
constitute a grantor trust for federal income tax purposes. The Trustee, by its
execution and delivery hereof, acknowledges the assignment to it of the amounts
payable in respect of the Class E Certificates and declares that it



                                      118
<PAGE>

holds and will hold such assets in trust for the exclusive use and benefit of
all present and future Holders of the Class E Certificates. The rights of
Holders of the Class E Certificates to receive distributions from the proceeds
of the assets of the grantor trust described in this paragraph and all ownership
interests of such Holders in and to such distributions, shall be as set forth in
this Agreement.

         (b) The Closing Date is hereby designated as the "Startup Day" of
each REMIC within the meaning of section 860G(a)(9) of the Code. The latest
possible maturity date for purposes of Treasury Regulation 1.860G-1(a)(4) is the
"Latest Possible Maturity Date".

         (c) The Trustee shall pay any and all tax related expenses (not
including taxes) of each REMIC and each Grantor Trust, including but not limited
to any professional fees or expenses related to audits or any administrative or
judicial proceedings with respect to such REMIC or such Grantor Trust that
involve the Internal Revenue Service or state tax authorities, but only to the
extent that (i) such expenses are ordinary or routine expenses, including
expenses of a routine audit but not expenses of litigation (except as described
in (ii)); or (ii) such expenses or liabilities (including taxes and penalties)
are attributable to the negligence or willful misconduct of the Trustee in
fulfilling its duties hereunder (including its duties as tax return preparer).
The Trustee shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Certificate Account of
the expenses to the extent (x) provided in clause (i) above and (y) in the case
of expenses relating to a REMIC provided for hereunder, such expenses are
"unanticipated expenses" within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section
1.860G-1(b)(3)(ii).

         (d) The Trustee shall prepare, sign and file, all of each REMIC's
federal and state tax and information returns as such REMIC's direct
representative. The Trustee shall prepare, sign and file all of the tax returns
in respect of each Grantor Trust. The Trustee shall comply with such requirement
by filing Form 1041. The expenses of preparing and filing such returns shall be
borne by the Trustee. If any Disqualified Organization acquires any Ownership
Interest in a Residual Certificate, then the Trustee will upon request provide
to the Internal Revenue Service, and to the persons specified in Sections
860E(e)(3) and (6) of the Code, such information as required in Section
860D(a)(6)(B) of the Code needed to compute the tax imposed under Section
860E(e) of the Code on transfers of residual interests to disqualified
organizations. The expenses of providing such information shall be borne by such
persons specified in Sections 860E(e)(3) and (6) of the Code.

         (e) The Trustee or its designee shall perform on behalf of each
REMIC and each Grantor Trust all reporting and other tax compliance duties that
are the responsibility of such REMIC or such Grantor Trust under the Code, the
REMIC Provisions, or other compliance guidance issued by the Internal Revenue
Service or any state or local taxing authority. Among its other duties, if
required by the Code, the REMIC Provisions, or other such guidance, the Trustee
shall provide (i) to the Treasury or other governmental authority such
information as is necessary for the application of any tax relating to the
transfer of a Residual Certificate to any disqualified person or organization
and (ii) to the Certificateholders such information or reports as are required
by the Code or REMIC Provisions.



                                      119
<PAGE>

         (f) To the extent within their control, the Trustee, the Master
Servicer and the Holders of Certificates shall take any action or cause any
REMIC hereunder to take any action necessary to create to the extent expressly
specified herein or maintain the status of such REMIC as a REMIC under the REMIC
Provisions and shall assist each other as necessary to create or maintain such
status. None of the Trustee, the Master Servicer nor the Holder of any Residual
Certificate shall knowingly take any action, cause any REMIC to take any action
or fail to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the REMIC
Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the
status of any such REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax
upon any such REMIC (including but not limited to the tax on prohibited
transactions as defined in Code Section 860F(a)(2) and the tax on prohibited
contributions set forth on Section 860G(d) of the Code) (either such event, an
"Adverse REMIC Event") unless the Trustee and the Master Servicer have received
an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action)
to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger such status or
result in the imposition of such a tax. In addition, prior to taking any action
with respect to any such REMIC or the assets therein, or causing any such REMIC
to take any action, which is not expressly permitted under the terms of this
Agreement, any Holder of a Residual Certificate will consult with the Trustee
and the Master Servicer, or their respective designees, in writing, with respect
to whether such action could cause an Adverse REMIC Event to occur with respect
to such REMIC, and no such Person shall take any such action or cause such REMIC
to take any such action as to which the Trustee or the Master Servicer has
advised it in writing that an Adverse REMIC Event could occur.

         (g) The Trustee shall prepare or cause to be prepared on behalf of
the Trust Fund, based upon information calculated in accordance with this
Agreement pursuant to instructions given by the Depositor, the Trustee shall
sign and file federal tax returns and appropriate state income tax returns and
such other returns as may be required by applicable law relating to the Trust
Fund, and shall file any other documents to the extent required by applicable
state tax law (to the extent such documents are in the Trustee's possession).
The Trustee shall forward copies to the Depositor of all such returns and Form
1099 supplemental tax information and such other information within the control
of the Trustee as the Depositor may reasonably request in writing. The Trustee
shall forward to each Certificateholder such forms and furnish such information
within the control of the Trustee as are required by the Code and the REMIC
Provisions to be furnished to them, and will prepare and furnish to each
Certificateholder Form 1099 (supplemental tax information) (or otherwise furnish
information within the control of the Trustee) to the extent required by
applicable law. The Master Servicer will indemnify the Trustee for any liability
of or assessment against the Trustee resulting from any error in any of such tax
or information returns directly resulting from errors in the information
provided by such Master Servicer.

         (h) The Trustee shall prepare and file with the Internal Revenue
Service ("IRS"), on behalf of each of REMIC 1, REMIC 2 and the Upper Tier REMIC,
an application on IRS Form SS-4. The Trustee, upon receipt from the IRS of the
Notice of Taxpayer Identification Number Assigned for each REMIC, shall promptly
forward copies of such notices to the Master Servicer and the Depositor. The
Trustee will file an IRS Form 8811 for the REMICs created hereunder. The Trustee
shall sign such forms referred to in this Section 10.01(h) as may be required
under applicable law.



                                      120
<PAGE>

         (i) Each Holder of a Residual Certificate shall pay when due any
and all taxes imposed on the related REMIC by federal or state governmental
authorities. To the extent that such Trust taxes are not paid by a Residual
Certificateholder, the Trustee shall pay any remaining REMIC taxes out of
current or future amounts otherwise distributable to the Holder of the Residual
Certificate in such REMIC or, if no such amounts are available, out of other
amounts held in the Collection Account, and shall reduce amounts otherwise
payable to holders of regular interests in such REMIC, as the case may be.

         (j) The Trustee shall, for federal income tax purposes, maintain
books and records with respect to each REMIC on a calendar year and on an
accrual basis.

         (k) No additional contributions of assets shall be made to any
REMIC, except as expressly provided in this Agreement with respect to Qualifying
Substitute Mortgage Loans.

         (l) Neither the Trustee nor the Master Servicer shall enter into
any arrangement by which any REMIC will receive a fee or other compensation for
services.

         (m) Upon the request of any Rating Agency, the Trustee shall
deliver to such Rating Agency an Officer's Certificate stating the Trustee's
compliance with the provisions of this Section 10.01.

         (n) It is intended that the rights of the Class A2 Certificates to
receive payments in respect of Excess Interest shall be treated as a right in
interest rate cap contracts written by the Class A3 Certificateholders in favor
of the holders of the Class A2 Certificates and such shall be accounted for as
property held separate and apart from the Class A2 REMIC Interest held by the
holders of the Class A2 Certificates. This provision is intended to satisfy the
requirements of Treasury Regulations Section 1.860G-2(i) for the treatment of
property rights coupled with REMIC interests to be separately respected and
shall be interpreted consistently with such regulation. The Holders of the Class
A2 Certificates agree, by their acceptance of such Certificates, that they will
take tax reporting positions that allocate no more than a nominal value to the
right to receive payments in respect of Excess Interest. The Holders of the
Class A3 Certificates agree, by their acceptance of such Certificates, to take
tax reporting positions consistent with allocations by the Holders of the Class
A2 Certificates of no more than a nominal value to the right to receive payments
in respect of Excess Interest. For information reporting purposes, it will be
assumed that such rights have no value. To the extent that the Class A2
Certificates receive payments of Excess Interest, such amounts will be treated
for federal income tax purposes as distributed by the Upper Tier REMIC to the
Class A3 Certificates pro rata and then paid to the Class A2 Certificates
pursuant to the interest cap agreement. Each holder or beneficial owner of a
Class A2 or Class A3 Certificate, by virtue of its acquisition of such
Certificate or a beneficial interest in such Certificate, agrees to adopt tax
reporting positions consistent with the characterization of payments made to the
Class A2 Certificates in respect of Excess Interest as payments in respect of
interest rate cap agreements written by the holders of the Class A3
Certificates.

         (o) The parties intend that the portion of the Trust Fund
consisting of the Class A3 REMIC Interest and the obligation of the holders of
the Class A3 Certificates to pay amounts of Excess Interest to the holders of
the Class A2 Certificates shall be treated as a



                                      121
<PAGE>

"grantor trust" under the Code up to and including the Distribution Date in the
month in which the Minimum Call Price is received, and the provisions hereof
shall be interpreted consistently with this intention. In furtherance of such
intention, the Trustee shall (i) furnish or cause to be furnished to the holders
of the Class A3 Certificates information regarding their allocable share, if
any, of the income with respect to such grantor trust, (ii) file or cause to be
filed with the Internal Revenue Service Form 1041 (together with any necessary
attachments) and such other forms as may be applicable and (iii) comply with
such information reporting obligations with respect to payments from such
grantor trust as may be applicable under the Code.

         (p) It is intended that, for federal income tax purposes, (i) the
initial holders of the Class A2 Certificates will be treated as having granted
(in exchange for a nominal premium), for the benefit of the holders of the Class
A3 Certificates, an option to acquire the Class A2 Certificates at a price equal
to the Minimum Call Price; (ii) if the Minimum Call Price is received, (x) the
holders of the Class A3 Certificates will be treated as having transferred
beneficial ownership of all rights under such Certificates (including the Class
A3 REMIC Interest) to the holders of the Class A2 Certificates, (y) the rights
of the holders of the Class A2 Certificates to (1) accrue interest attributable
to a rate in excess of 5.36% per annum (i.e., the maximum rate on the Class A2
REMIC Interest) and (2) receive, to the extent provided in Section 5.02 hereof,
amounts otherwise distributable to the Class A3 Certificates, shall be treated
as attributable to such holders' beneficial ownership of the Class A3 REMIC
Interest. The Trustee shall, and each holder or beneficial owner of a Class A2
Certificate or Class A3 Certificate (by virtue of its acquisition of such
Certificate or a beneficial interest in such Certificate) agrees to, adopt tax
reporting positions consistent with such tax treatment.

               Section 10.02.    Prohibited Transactions and Activities.

         None of the Depositor, the Master Servicer or the Trustee shall sell,
dispose of, or substitute for any of the Mortgage Loans, except in a disposition
pursuant to (i) the foreclosure of a Mortgage Loan, (ii) the bankruptcy of the
Trust Fund, (iii) the termination of each REMIC pursuant to Article VII of this
Agreement, (iv) a substitution pursuant to Article II of this Agreement or (v) a
repurchase of Mortgage Loans pursuant to Article II of this Agreement, nor
acquire any assets for any REMIC, nor sell or dispose of any investments in the
Certificate Account for gain, nor accept any contributions to any REMIC after
the Closing Date, unless it has received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense
of the party causing such sale, disposition, or substitution) that such
disposition, acquisition, substitution, or acceptance will not (a) affect
adversely the status of such REMIC as a REMIC or of the Certificates other than
the Residual Certificate and the Class E Certificates and Class P Certificates
as the regular interests therein, (b) affect the distribution of interest or
principal on the Certificates, (c) result in the encumbrance of the assets
transferred or assigned to the Trust Fund (except pursuant to the provisions of
this Agreement) or (d) cause such REMIC to be subject to a tax on prohibited
transactions or prohibited contributions pursuant to the REMIC Provisions.

               Section 10.03.    Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes
                                 and Loss of REMIC Status.

         In the event that any REMIC created hereunder fails to qualify as a
REMIC, loses its status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a
result of a prohibited transaction or



                                      122
<PAGE>

prohibited contribution under the REMIC Provisions due to the negligent
performance by the Trustee of its duties and obligations set forth herein, the
Trustee shall indemnify the Holder of the Residual Certificate against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from
such negligence; provided, however, that the Trustee shall not be liable for any
such Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Master Servicer, the
Depositor, or the Holder of such Residual Certificate, as applicable, or for any
such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by the Holder of such
Residual Certificate on which the Trustee has relied. The foregoing shall not be
deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Holder of such
Residual Certificate now or hereafter existing at law or in equity.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no event shall the Trustee have any
liability (1) for any action or omission that is taken in accordance with and in
compliance with the express terms of, or which is expressly permitted by the
terms of, this Agreement, (2) for any Losses other than arising out of a
negligent performance by the Trustee of its duties and obligations set forth
herein, and (3) for any special or consequential damages to Certificateholders
(in addition to payment of principal and interest on the Certificates). In
addition, the Trustee shall not have any liability for the actions or failure to
act of the other.

               Section 10.04.    REO Property.

         (a) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Master
Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee hereunder, shall not (except to the
extent provided in the applicable Servicing Agreement) permit any Servicer to,
rent, lease, or otherwise earn income on behalf of any REMIC with respect to any
REO Property which might cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as
"foreclosure" property within the meaning of section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or
result in the receipt by any REMIC of any "income from non-permitted assets"
within the meaning of section 860F(a)(2) of the Code or any "net income from
foreclosure property" which is subject to tax under the REMIC Provisions unless
the Master Servicer has advised, or has caused the applicable Servicer to
advise, the Trustee in writing to the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions,
such action would not adversely affect the status of any REMIC as a REMIC and
any income generated for any REMIC by the REO Property would not result in the
imposition of a tax upon such REMIC.

         (b) The Master Servicer shall make, or shall cause the applicable
Servicer to make, reasonable efforts to sell any REO Property for its fair
market value. In any event, however, the Master Servicer shall, or shall cause
the applicable Servicer to, dispose of any REO Property within three years from
the end of the calendar year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund unless the
Trustee has received a grant of extension from the Internal Revenue Service to
the effect that, under the REMIC Provisions and any relevant proposed
legislation and under applicable state law, the applicable REMIC may hold REO
Property for a longer period without adversely affecting the REMIC status of
such REMIC or causing the imposition of a Federal or state tax upon such REMIC.
If the Trustee has received such an extension, then (a) the Trustee shall
provide a copy of such extension to the Master Servicer and (b) the Trustee, or
the Master Servicer, acting on its behalf hereunder, shall, or shall cause the
applicable Servicer to, continue to attempt to sell the REO Property for its
fair market value for such period longer than three years as such extension
permits (the "Extended Period"). If the Trustee has not received such an
extension and the Trustee, or the Master Servicer acting on behalf of the
Trustee hereunder, or



                                      123
<PAGE>

the applicable Servicer is unable to sell the REO Property within 33 months
after its acquisition by the Trust Fund or if the Trustee has received such an
extension, and the Trustee, or the Master Servicer acting on behalf of the
Trustee hereunder, is unable to sell the REO Property within the period ending
three months before the close of the Extended Period, the Master Servicer shall,
or shall cause the applicable Servicer to, before the end of the three year
period or the Extended Period, as applicable, (i) purchase such REO Property at
a price equal to the REO Property's fair market value or (ii) auction the REO
Property to the highest bidder (which may be the Master Servicer) in an auction
reasonably designed to produce a fair price prior to the expiration of the
three-year period or the Extended Period, as the case may be.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

               Section 11.01.    Binding Nature of Agreement; Assignment.

         This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the
parties hereto and their respective successors and permitted assigns.

               Section 11.02.    Entire Agreement.

         This Agreement contains the entire agreement and understanding among
the parties hereto with respect to the subject matter hereof, and supersedes all
prior and contemporaneous agreements, understandings, inducements and
conditions, express or implied, oral or written, of any nature whatsoever with
respect to the subject matter hereof. The express terms hereof control and
supersede any course of performance and/or usage of the trade inconsistent with
any of the terms hereof.

               Section 11.03.    Amendment.

         (a) This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Depositor,
the Master Servicer and the Trustee, without notice to or the consent of any of
the Holders, (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to cause the provisions herein to
conform to or be consistent with or in furtherance of the statements made with
respect to the Certificates, the Trust Fund or this Agreement in any Offering
Document; or to correct or supplement any provision herein which may be
inconsistent with any other provisions herein, (iii) to make any other
provisions with respect to matters or questions arising under this Agreement or
(iv) to add, delete, or amend any provisions to the extent necessary or
desirable to comply with any requirements imposed by the Code and the REMIC
Provisions. No such amendment effected pursuant to the preceding sentence shall,
as evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel, adversely affect the status of any REMIC
created pursuant to this Agreement, nor shall such amendment effected pursuant
to clause (iii) of such sentence adversely affect in any material respect the
interests of any Holder. Prior to entering into any amendment without the
consent of Holders pursuant to this paragraph, the Trustee may require an
Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party requesting such amendment) to
the effect that such amendment is permitted under this paragraph. Any such
amendment shall be deemed not to adversely affect in any material respect any
Holder if the Trustee receives written confirmation from each Rating Agency that
such amendment will not



                                      124
<PAGE>

cause such Rating Agency to reduce, qualify or withdraw the then current rating
assigned to the Certificates (and any Opinion of Counsel requested by the
Trustee in connection with any such amendment may rely expressly on such
confirmation as the basis therefor).

         (b) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the
Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee with the consent of the Holders
of not less than 66 2/3% of the Class Principal Amount (or Percentage Interest)
of each Class of Certificates affected thereby for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of
this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders;
provided, however, that no such amendment shall be made unless the Trustee
receives an Opinion of Counsel, at the expense of the party requesting the
change, that such change will not adversely affect the status of any REMIC as a
REMIC or cause a tax to be imposed on such REMIC; and provided, further, that no
such amendment may (i) reduce in any manner the amount of, or delay the timing
of, payments received on Mortgage Loans which are required to be distributed on
any Certificate, without the consent of the Holder of such Certificate or (ii)
reduce the aforesaid percentages of Class Principal Amount (or Percentage
Interest) of Certificates of each Class, the Holders of which are required to
consent to any such amendment without the consent of the Holders of 100% of the
Class Principal Amount of each Class of Certificates affected thereby. For
purposes of this paragraph, references to "Holder" or "Holders" shall be deemed
to include, in the case of any Class of Book-Entry Certificates, the related
Certificate Owners.

         (c) Promptly after the execution of any such amendment, the Trustee
shall furnish written notification of the substance of such amendment to each
Holder, the Depositor and to the Rating Agencies.

         (d) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Holders under this
Section 11.03 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it
shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The
manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the
execution thereof by Holders shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as
the Trustee may prescribe.

         (e) Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in any Servicing
Agreement, the Trustee shall not consent to any amendment of any Servicing
Agreement except pursuant to the standards provided in this Section with respect
to amendment of this Agreement.

               Section 11.04.    Voting Rights.

         Except to the extent that the consent of all affected
Certificateholders is required pursuant to this Agreement, with respect to any
provision of this Agreement requiring the consent of Certificateholders
representing specified percentages of aggregate outstanding Certificate
Principal Amount, Certificates owned by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the
Trustee or any Servicer or Affiliates thereof are not to be counted so long as
such Certificates are owned by the Depositor, the Master Servicer, the Trustee
or any Servicer or Affiliates thereof.

thereunder or delegation of its rights or duties thereunder or any portion

                                      128
<PAGE>

              (i) Such successor servicer must be qualified to service loans for
         FNMA or FHLMC;

              (ii) Such successor servicer must satisfy the seller/servicer
         eligibility standards in the applicable Servicing Agreement, exclusive
         of any experience in mortgage loan origination, and must be reasonably
         acceptable to the Master Servicer, whose approval shall not be
         unreasonably withheld;

              (iii) Such successor servicer must execute and deliver to the
         Trustee and the Master Servicer an agreement, in form and substance
         reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee and the Master Servicer, that
         contains an assumption by such successor servicer of the due and
         punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to
         be performed and observed by the applicable Servicer under the
         applicable Servicing Agreement or, in the case of a transfer of
         servicing to a party that is already a Servicer pursuant to this
         Agreement, an agreement to add the related Mortgage Loans to the
         Servicing Agreement already in effect with such Servicer;

              (iv) If the successor servicer is not a Servicer of Mortgage Loans
         at the time of transfer, there must be delivered to the Trustee a
         letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that such transfer of
         servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or downgrade
         of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates;

              (v) The related Seller shall, at its cost and expense, take such
         steps, or cause the terminated Servicer to take such steps, as may be
         necessary or appropriate to effectuate and evidence the transfer of the
         servicing of the Mortgage Loans to such successor servicer, including,
         but not limited to, the following: (A) to the extent required by the
         terms of the Mortgage Loans and by applicable federal and state laws
         and regulations, the related Seller shall cause the prior Servicer to
         timely mail to each obligor under a Mortgage Loan any required notices
         or disclosures describing the transfer of servicing of the Mortgage
         Loans to the successor servicer; (B) prior to the effective date of
         such transfer of servicing, the related Seller shall cause the prior
         Servicer to transmit to any related insurer notification of such
         transfer of servicing; (C) on or prior to the effective date of such
         transfer of servicing, the related Seller shall cause the prior
         Servicer to deliver to the successor servicer all Mortgage Loan
         Documents and any related records or materials; (D) on or prior to the
         effective date of such transfer of servicing, the related Seller shall
         cause the prior Servicer to transfer to the successor servicer, or, if
         such transfer occurs after a Remittance Date but before the next
         succeeding Deposit Date, to the Master Servicer, all funds held by the
         applicable Servicer in respect of the Mortgage Loans; (E) on or prior
         to the effective date of such transfer of servicing, the related Seller
         shall cause the prior Servicer to, after the effective date of the
         transfer of servicing to the successor servicer, continue to forward to
         such successor servicer, within one Business Day of receipt, the amount
         of any payments or other recoveries received by the prior Servicer, and
         to notify the successor servicer of the source and proper application
         of each such payment or recovery; and (F) the related Seller shall
         cause the prior Servicer to, after the effective date of transfer of
         servicing to the successor servicer, continue to cooperate with the
         successor servicer to facilitate such



                                      129
<PAGE>

         transfer in such manner and to such extent as the successor servicer
         may reasonably request.

                  _______________________ (the "Transferor") has reviewed the
attached affidavit of _____________________________ (the "Transferee"), and has
no actual knowledge that such affidavit is not true and has no reason to believe

its debts as they become due.

Dear Sirs:


         In connection with our proposed purchase of $______________ principal
amount of Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-22 (the "Privately
Offered Certificates") of Structured Asset Securities Corporation (the
"Depositor") which are held in the form of Definitive Certificates, we confirm
that:

(1)      We understand that the Privately Offered Certificates have not been,
         and will not be, registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
         amended (the "Securities Act"), and may not be sold except as permitted
         in the following sentence. We agree, on our own behalf and on behalf of
         any accounts for which we are acting as hereinafter stated, that if we
         should sell any Privately Offered Certificates within two years of the
         later of the date of original issuance of the Privately Offered
         Certificates or the last day on which such Privately Offered
         Certificates are owned by the Depositor or any affiliate of the
         Depositor (which includes the Placement Agent) we will do so only (A)
         to the Depositor, (B) to "qualified institutional buyers" (within the
         meaning of Rule 144A under the Securities Act) in accordance with Rule
         144A under the Securities Act ("QIBs"), (C) pursuant to the exemption
         from registration provided by Rule 144 under the Securities Act, or (D)
         to an institutional "accredited investor" within the meaning of Rule
         501(a)(1), (2), (3) or (7) of Regulation D under the Securities Act
         that is not a QIB (an "Institutional Accredited Investor") which, prior
         to such transfer, delivers to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement
         dated as of November 1, 2004 among the Depositor, Citibank, N.A., as
         Trustee (the "Trustee"), and Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master
         Servicer, a signed letter in the form of this letter; and we further
         agree, in the capacities stated above, to provide to any person
         purchasing any of the Privately Offered Certificates from us a notice
         advising such purchaser that resales of the Privately Offered
         Certificates are restricted as stated herein.

(2)      We understand that, in connection with any proposed resale of any
         Privately Offered Certificates to an Institutional Accredited Investor,
         we will be required to furnish to the Trustee and the Depositor a
         certification from such transferee in the form hereof to confirm that
         the proposed sale is being made pursuant to an exemption from, or in a
         transaction not subject to, the registration requirements of the
         Securities Act. We further understand that the Privately Offered
         Certificates purchased by us will bear a legend to the foregoing
         effect.



                                      G-1

(3)      We are acquiring the Privately Offered Certificates for investment
         purposes and not with a view to, or for offer or sale in connection
         with, any distribution in violation of the Securities Act. We have such
         knowledge and experience in financial and business matters as to be
         capable of evaluating the merits and risks of our investment in the
         Privately Offered Certificates, and we and any account for which we are
         acting are each able to bear the economic risk of such investment.

(4)      We are an Institutional Accredited Investor and we are acquiring the
         Privately Offered Certificates purchased by us for our own account or
         for one or more accounts (each of which is an Institutional Accredited
         Investor) as to each of which we exercise sole investment discretion.

(5)      We have received such information as we deem necessary in order to make
         our investment decision.

(6)      If we are acquiring ERISA-Restricted Certificates, we understand that
         in accordance with ERISA, the Code and the Exemption, no Plan and no
         person acting on behalf of such a Plan may acquire such Certificate
         except in accordance with Section 3.03(d) of the Trust Agreement.

         Terms used in this letter which are not otherwise defined herein have
the respective meanings assigned thereto in the Trust Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE I

                          CONVEYANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS

Section 1.01      Mortgage Loans.

         (a) Sale of Mortgage Loans. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Seller does hereby transfer, assign, set over,
deposit with and otherwise convey to the Depositor, without recourse, subject to
Sections 1.03 and 1.04, all the right, title and interest of the Seller in and
to the Mortgage Loans (exclusive of any Retained Interest on such Mortgage
Loans, if any) identified on Schedule A-1 and Schedule A-2 hereto, having an
aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $322,668,769.23. Such
conveyance includes, without limitation, the right to all distributions of
principal and interest received on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans on or
after November 1, 2004 other than, (i) any amounts representing Retained
Interest, if any, and (ii) payments of principal and interest due on or before
such date, and all such payments due after such date but received prior to such
date and intended by the related Mortgagors to be applied after such date,
together with all of the Seller's right, title and interest in and to each
related account and all amounts from time to time credited to and the proceeds
of such account, any REO Property and the proceeds thereof, the Seller's rights
under any Insurance Policies relating to the Mortgage Loans, the Seller's
security interest in any collateral pledged to secure the Mortgage Loans,
including the Mortgaged Properties, and any proceeds of the foregoing.

         (b) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Seller hereby assigns to the Depositor all of its rights and interest under each
Transfer Agreement and each Servicing Agreement, other than any right to receive
Retained Interest if any, and any servicing rights retained thereunder, and
delegates to the Depositor all of its obligations thereunder, to the extent
relating to the Mortgage Loans. The Seller and the Depositor further agree that
this Agreement incorporates the terms and conditions of any assignment and
assumption agreement or other assignment document required to be entered into
under any of the Transfer Agreements (any such document an "Assignment
Agreement") and this Agreement constitutes an Assignment Agreement under such
Transfer Agreement, and the Depositor hereby assumes the


                                       3
<PAGE>

obligations of the assignee under each such Assignment Agreement. Concurrently
with the execution hereof, the Depositor tenders the purchase price of
$322,668,769.23. The Depositor hereby accepts such assignment and delegation,
and shall be entitled to exercise all the rights of the Seller under each
Transfer Agreement and each Servicing Agreement, other than any servicing rights
thereunder, as if the Depositor had been a party to each such agreement.

         (c) Schedules of Mortgage Loans. The Depositor and the Seller have
agreed upon which of the Mortgage Loans owned by the Seller are to be purchased
by the Depositor pursuant to this Agreement and the Seller will prepare on or
prior to the Closing Date a final schedule describing such Mortgage Loans (the
"Mortgage Loan Schedule"). The Mortgage Loan Schedule shall conform to the
requirements of the Depositor as set forth in this Agreement and to the
definition of "Mortgage Loan Schedule" under the Trust Agreement. The Mortgage
Loan Schedule attached hereto as Schedule A-1 specifies those Mortgage Loans
that are Transferred Mortgage Loans and the Mortgage Loan Schedule attached
hereto as Schedule A-2 specifies those Mortgage Loans that are Bank Originated
Mortgage Loans and which have been assigned by the Bank to the Seller pursuant
to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.

Section 1.02      Delivery of Documents.

         (a) In connection with such transfer and assignment of the Mortgage
Loans hereunder, the Seller, shall, at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Depositor (or its
designee) the documents or instruments with respect to each Mortgage Loan (each
a "Mortgage File") so transferred and assigned, as specified in the related
Transfer Agreements or Servicing Agreements.

         (b) For Mortgage Loans (if any) that have been prepaid in full on or
after the Cut-off Date and prior to the Closing Date, the Seller, in lieu of
delivering the related Mortgage Files, herewith delivers to the Depositor an
Officer's Certificate which shall include a statement to the effect that all
amounts received in connection with such prepayment that are required to be
deposited in the Collection Account maintained by the Master Servicer for such
purpose have been so deposited.

         Section 1.03. Review of Documentation. The Depositor, by execution and
delivery hereof, acknowledges receipt of the Mortgage Files pertaining to the
Mortgage Loans listed on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, subject to review thereof
by the custodian, LaSalle Bank National Association and U.S. Bank National
Association, as applicable (each, a "Custodian" and together, the "Custodians"),
for the Depositor. Each Custodian is required to review, within 45 days
following the Closing Date, each applicable Mortgage File. If in the course of
such review the related Custodian identifies any Material Defect, the Seller
shall be obligated to cure such Material Defect or to repurchase the related
Mortgage Loan from the Depositor (or, at the direction of and on behalf of the
Depositor, from the Trust Fund), or to substitute a Qualifying Substitute
Mortgage Loan therefor, in each case to the same extent and in the same manner
as the Depositor is obligated to the Trustee and the Trust Fund under Section
2.02(c) of the Trust Agreement.

         Section 1.04. Representations and Warranties of the Seller.

         by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Seller; neither
         the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Assignment and
         Assumption Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions herein
         or therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions hereof or
         thereof, will conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a
         default under, any of the provisions of any law, governmental rule,
         regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Seller or its
         properties or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Seller;

              (iii) The execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of
         this Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the

         registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of, any
         state, federal or other governmental authority or agency, except such
         as has been obtained, given, effected or taken prior to the date
         hereof;

              (iv) Each of this Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption
         Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Seller and,
         assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Bank, in the
         case of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the Depositor, in
         the case of this Agreement, constitutes a valid and binding obligation
         of the Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its respective
         terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to (A) applicable
         bankruptcy and insolvency laws and other similar laws affecting the
         enforcement of the rights of creditors generally and (B) general
         principles of equity regardless of whether such enforcement is
         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and

              (v) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
         knowledge of the Seller, threatened or likely to be asserted against or
         affecting the Seller, before or by any court, administrative agency,
         arbitrator or governmental body (A) with respect to any of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Assignment and
         Assumption Agreement or (B) with respect to any other matter which in
         the judgment of the Seller will be determined adversely to the Seller
         and will if determined adversely to the Seller materially and adversely
         affect it or its business, assets, operations or condition, financial
         or otherwise, or adversely affect its ability to perform its
         obligations under this Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption
         Agreement.

         (b) The representations and warranties of each Transferor with respect
to the Transferred Mortgage Loans in the applicable Transfer Agreement were made
as of the date of


                                       5

such Transfer Agreement. To the extent that any fact, condition or event with
respect to a Transferred Mortgage Loan constitutes a breach of both (i) a
representation or warranty of a Transferor under the applicable Transfer
Agreement and (ii) a representation or warranty of the Seller under this
Agreement, the sole right or remedy of the Depositor with respect to a breach by
the Seller of such representation and warranty (other than a breach by the
Seller of the representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections
1.04(b)(xii), 1.04(b)(xvii), 1.04(b)(xviii), 1.04(b)(xix) and 1.04(b)(xx)) shall
be the right to enforce the obligations of such Transferor under any applicable
representation or warranty made by it. The representations made by the Seller
pursuant to Sections 1.04(b)(xii), 1.04(b)(xvii), 1.04(b)(xviii), 1.04(b)(xix)
and 1.04(b)(xx)) shall be direct obligations of the Seller. The Depositor
acknowledges and agrees that the representations and warranties of the Seller in
this Section 1.04(b) (other than the representations and warranties made
pursuant to Sections 1.04(b)(xii), 1.04(b)(xvii), 1.04(b)(xviii), 1.04(b)(xix)
and 1.04(b)(xx)) are applicable only to facts, conditions or events that do not
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty made by the related
Transferor in the applicable Transfer Agreement. The Seller shall have no
obligation or liability with respect to any breach of a representation or
warranty made by it with respect to the Transferred Mortgage Loans if the fact,
condition or event constituting such breach also constitutes a breach of a
representation or warranty made by the related Transferor in such Transfer
Agreement, without regard to whether the related Transferor fulfills its
contractual obligations in respect of such representation or warranty; provided,
however, that if the related Transferor fulfills its obligations under the
provisions of such Transfer Agreement by substituting for the affected Mortgage
Loan a mortgage loan which is not a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, the
Seller shall, in exchange for such substitute mortgage loan, provide the
Depositor (a) with the applicable Purchase Price for the affected Mortgage Loan
or (b) within the two-year period following the Closing Date, with a Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Transferred Mortgage Loan. Subject to
the foregoing, the Seller represents and warrants upon delivery of the
Transferred Mortgage Loans to the Depositor hereunder on the Closing Date, as to
each, that:

              (i) The information set forth with respect to the Transferred
         Mortgage Loans on the Mortgage Loan Schedule provides an accurate
         listing of the Transferred Mortgage Loans, and the information with
         respect to each Transferred Mortgage Loan on the Mortgage Loan Schedule
         is true and correct in all material respects at the date or dates
         respecting which such information is given;

              (ii) There are no defaults (other than delinquency in payment) in
         complying with the terms of any Mortgage, and the Seller has no notice
         as to any taxes, governmental assessments, insurance premiums, water,
         sewer and municipal charges, leasehold payments or ground rents which
         previously became due and owing but which have not been paid;

              (iii) Except in the case of Cooperative Loans, if any, each
         Mortgage requires all buildings or other improvements on the related
         Mortgaged Property to be insured by a generally acceptable insurer
         against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other
         hazards as are customary in the area where the related Mortgaged
         Property is located pursuant to insurance policies conforming to the
         requirements of the guidelines of FNMA or FHLMC. If upon origination of
         the Transferred Mortgage Loan, the


                                       6

         Mortgaged Property was in an area identified in the Federal Register by
         the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards
         (and such flood insurance has been made available) a flood insurance
         policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
         Federal Flood Insurance Administration is in effect which policy
         conforms to the requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal
         Flood Insurance Administration. Each Mortgage obligates the related
         Mortgagor thereunder to maintain the hazard insurance policy at the
         Mortgagor's cost and expense, and on the Mortgagor's failure to do so,
         authorizes the holder of the Mortgage to obtain and maintain such
         insurance at such Mortgagor's cost and expense, and to seek
         reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor. Where required by state law
         or regulation, each Mortgagor has been given an opportunity to choose
         the carrier of the required hazard insurance, provided the policy is
         not a "master" or "blanket" hazard insurance policy covering the common
         facilities of a planned unit development. The hazard insurance policy
         is the valid and binding obligation of the insurer, is in full force
         and effect, and will be in full force and effect and inure to the
         benefit of the Depositor upon the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement;

              (iv) Each Mortgage has not been satisfied, cancelled, subordinated
         or rescinded, in whole or in part, and the Mortgaged Property has not
         been released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole or in part, nor
         has any instrument been executed that would effect any such release,
         cancellation, subordination or rescission;

              (v) Each Mortgage evidences a valid, subsisting, enforceable and
         perfected first lien on the related Mortgaged Property (including all
         improvements on the Mortgaged Property). The lien of the Mortgage is
         subject only to: (1) liens of current real property taxes and
         assessments not yet due and payable and, if the related Mortgaged
         Property is a condominium unit, any lien for common charges permitted
         by statute, (2) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way,
         easements and other matters of public record as of the date of
         recording of such Mortgage acceptable to mortgage lending institutions
         in the area in which the related Mortgaged Property is located and
         specifically referred to in the lender's Title Insurance Policy or
         attorney's opinion of title and abstract of title delivered to the
         originator of the applicable Transferred Mortgage Loan, and (3) such
         other matters to which like properties are commonly subject which do
         not, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the
         benefits of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage. Any
         security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to,
         and delivered to the Trustee in connection with, a Transferred Mortgage
         Loan establishes a valid, subsisting and enforceable first lien on the
         property described therein and the Depositor has full right to sell and
         assign the same to the Trustee;

              (vi) Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment of the
         Transferred Mortgage Loans to the Depositor, the Seller was the sole
         owner of record and holder of each Transferred Mortgage Loan, and the
         Seller had good and marketable title thereto, and has full right to
         transfer and sell each Transferred Mortgage Loan to the Depositor free
         and clear, except as described in paragraph (v) above, of any
         encumbrance, equity, participation interest, lien, pledge, charge,
         claim or security interest, and has full right and



                                       7
<PAGE>

         authority, subject to no interest or participation of, or agreement
         with, any other party, to sell and assign each Transferred Mortgage
         Loan pursuant to this Agreement;

              (vii) Each Transferred Mortgage Loan other than any Cooperative
         Loan is covered by either (i) an attorney's opinion of title and
         abstract of title the form and substance of which is generally
         acceptable to mortgage lending institutions originating mortgage loans
         in the locality where the related Mortgaged Property is located or (ii)
         an ALTA mortgagee Title Insurance Policy or other generally acceptable
         form of policy of insurance, issued by a title insurer qualified to do
         business in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located,
         insuring the originator of the Transferred Mortgage Loan, and its
         successors and assigns, as to the first priority lien of the Mortgage
         in the original principal amount of the Transferred Mortgage Loan
         (subject only to the exceptions described in paragraph (v) above). If
         the Mortgaged Property is a condominium unit located in a state in
         which a title insurer will generally issue an endorsement, then the
         related Title Insurance Policy contains an endorsement insuring the
         validity of the creation of the condominium form of ownership with
         respect to the project in which such unit is located. With respect to
         any Title Insurance Policy, the originator is the sole insured of such
         mortgagee Title Insurance Policy, such mortgagee Title Insurance Policy
         is in full force and effect and will inure to the benefit of the
         Depositor upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement, no claims have been made under such mortgagee Title
         Insurance Policy and no prior holder of the related Mortgage, including
         the Seller, has done, by act or omission, anything that would impair
         the coverage of such mortgagee Title Insurance Policy;

              (viii) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no foreclosure
         action is being threatened or commenced with respect to any Transferred
         Mortgage Loan;

              (ix) There is no proceeding pending for the total or partial
         condemnation of any Mortgaged Property (or, in the case of any
         Cooperative Loan, the related cooperative unit) and each such property
         is undamaged by waste, fire, earthquake or earth movement, windstorm,
         flood, tornado or other casualty, so as to have a material adverse
         effect on the value of the related Mortgaged Property as security for
         the related Transferred Mortgage Loan or the use for which the premises
         were intended;

              (x) There are no mechanics' or similar liens or claims which have
         been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are outstanding
         that under the law could give rise to such liens) affecting the related
         Mortgaged Property which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or
         coordinate with, the lien of the related Mortgage;

              (xi) Each Transferred Mortgage Loan was originated by a savings
         and loan association, savings bank, commercial bank, credit union,
         insurance company or similar institution that is supervised and
         examined by a Federal or State authority, or by a mortgagee approved by
         the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to Sections 203
         and 211 of the National Housing Act;


                                       8
<PAGE>

              (xii) Each Transferred Mortgage Loan at the time it was made
         complied in all material respects with applicable local, state, and
         federal laws including, but not limited to, all applicable predatory
         and abusive lending laws;

              (xiii) As of the Closing Date, each Transferred Mortgage Loan is a
         "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section 860G of the Code and
         Treas. Reg. ss.1.860G-2 (determined without regard to Treas. Reg.
         ss.1.860G-2(f) or any similar rule that provides that a defective
         obligation is a qualified mortgage for a temporary period);

              (xiv) As of the Closing Date, other than with respect to any Class
         E Distributable Amount, no Transferred Mortgage Loan provides for
         interest other than at either (i) a single fixed rate in effect
         throughout the term of the Transferred Mortgage Loan or (ii) a single
         "variable rate" (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. ss.1.860G-1(a)(3))
         in effect throughout the term of the Transferred Mortgage Loan;

              (xv) As of the Closing Date, no Transferred Mortgage Loan is the
         subject of pending or final foreclosure proceedings;

              (xvi) As of the Closing Date, based on delinquencies in payment on
         the Transferred Mortgage Loans, the Seller would not initiate
         foreclosure proceedings with respect to any Transferred Mortgage Loan
         prior to the next scheduled payment date on such Transferred Mortgage
         Loan;

              (xvii) No Transferred Mortgage Loan is a "high-cost," "high-cost
         home," "covered," "high-risk home" or "predatory" loan under any
         applicable federal, state or local predatory or abusive lending law (or
         a similarly classified loan using different terminology under a law
         imposing heightened regulatory scrutiny or additional legal liability
         for residential mortgage loans having high interest rates, points
         and/or fees); no Transferred Mortgage Loan originated on or after
         November 27, 2003 is a "High-Cost Home Loan" subject to the New Jersey
         Home Ownership Security Act of 2003 (N.J.S.A. 46:10B-22 et seq.); no
         Transferred Mortgage Loan is a "High-Cost Home Loan" subject to the New
         Mexico Home Loan Protection Act (N.M. Stat. Ann. ss.ss. 58-21A-1 et
         seq.);

              (xviii) No Transferred Mortgage Loan was at the time of
         origination subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of
         1994 (15 U.S.C. ss. 1602(c)), Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.32) or any
         comparable state law;

              (xix) No Transferred Mortgage Loan is a High Cost Loan or Covered
         Loan, as applicable (as such terms are defined in the then current
         Standard & Poor's LEVELS(R) Glossary which is now Version 5.6 Revised,
         Appendix E) and no Transferred Mortgage Loan originated on or after
         October 1, 2002 through March 6, 2003 is governed by the Georgia Fair
         Lending Act; and

              (xx) No Transferred Mortgage Loan that is secured by property
         located in Illinois is in violation of the provisions of the Illinois
         Interest Act (815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 205/1 et seq.).

         (c) In addition to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 1.04(b), all of which are also made by the Seller with respect to the
Bank Originated Mortgage Loans as of the Closing Date (or as of such other date
as is specified in particular representations and warranties), the Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Depositor upon the delivery to the Depositor on
the Closing Date of any Bank Originated Mortgage Loans, but solely as to each
Bank Originated Mortgage Loan, that, as of the Closing Date:

              (i) With respect to any hazard insurance policy covering a Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan and the related Mortgaged Property, the Seller
         has not engaged in, and has no knowledge of the Bank's or the
         Mortgagor's having engaged in, any act or omission which would impair
         the coverage of any such policy, the benefits of the endorsement
         provided for therein, or the validity and binding effect of either,
         including without limitation, no unlawful fee, commission, kickback or
         other unlawful compensation or value of any kind has been or will be
         received, retained or realized by any attorney, firm or other person or
         entity, and no such unlawful items have been received, retained or
         realized by the Seller;

              (ii) Neither the Seller nor the Bank has waived the performance by
         the Mortgagor of any action, if the Mortgagor's failure to perform such
         action would cause a Bank Originated Mortgage Loan to be in default,
         nor has the Seller or the Bank waived any default resulting from any
         action or inaction by the Mortgagor;

              (iii) The terms of the Mortgage Note and Mortgage have not been
         impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect, except by a
         written instrument which has been recorded, if necessary to protect the
         interests of the Depositor and which has been delivered to the
         Custodian;

              (iv) The Mortgaged Property relating to each Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan is a fee simple property located in the state identified
         in the Mortgage Loan Schedule and consists of a parcel of real property
         with a detached single family residence erected thereon, or a two- to
         four-family dwelling, or an individual condominium unit in a low-rise
         condominium project, or an individual unit in a planned unit
         development; provided, however, that any condominium project or planned
         unit development shall conform with the applicable FNMA and FHLMC
         requirements regarding such dwellings. No portion of the Mortgaged
         Property is used for commercial purposes;

              (v) The Mortgage Note and the Mortgage are genuine, and each is
         the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker thereof
         enforceable in accordance with its terms. All parties to the Mortgage
         Note and the Mortgage and any other related agreement had legal
         capacity to enter into the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan and to execute
         and deliver the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and any other related
         agreement, and the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage have been duly and
         properly executed by such parties. The documents, instruments and
         agreements submitted for loan underwriting were not falsified and
         contain no untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a
         material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
         information and statements therein not misleading. To the best of the
         Seller's knowledge, no fraud


                                       10
<PAGE>

         was committed in connection with the origination of the Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan;

              (vi) Each Bank Originated Mortgage Loan has been closed and the
         proceeds of the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed
         and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder, and any and
         all requirements as to completion of any on-site or off-site
         improvement and as to disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have
         been complied with. All costs, fees and expenses incurred in making or
         closing the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan and the recording of the
         Mortgage were paid, and the Mortgagor is not entitled to any refund of
         any amounts paid or due under the Mortgage Note or Mortgage;

              (vii) There is no default, breach, violation or event of
         acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and no
         event which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration
         of any grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach,
         violation or event of acceleration, and neither the Seller nor its
         predecessors has waived any default, breach, violation or event of
         acceleration;

              (viii) All improvements which were considered in determining the
         Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property lay wholly within the
         boundaries and building restriction lines of the Mortgaged Property and
         no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Mortgaged
         Property. No improvement located on or being part of the Mortgaged
         Property is in violation of any applicable zoning law or regulation;

              (ix) Each Mortgage contains customary and enforceable provisions
         which render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for
         the realization against the related Mortgaged Property of the benefits
         of the security, including (A) in the case of a Mortgage designated as
         a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (B) otherwise by judicial or
         non-judicial foreclosure. There is no homestead or other exemption
         available to the related Mortgagor which would materially interfere
         with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or
         the right to foreclose the Mortgage subject to the applicable federal
         and state laws and judicial precedent with respect to bankruptcy and
         rights of redemption. Upon default by a Mortgagor on a Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan and foreclosure on, or trustee's sale of, the Mortgaged
         Property pursuant to the proper procedures, the holder of the Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan will be able to deliver good and merchantable
         title to the property;

              (x) The Mortgage Note is not and has not been secured by any
         collateral except the lien of the corresponding Mortgage and the
         security interest of any applicable security agreement or chattel
         mortgage;

              (xi) In the event the Mortgage constitutes a deed of trust, a
         trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, has been
         properly designated and currently so serves and is named in the
         Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the
         Depositor to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection
         with a trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor;


                                       11
<PAGE>

              (xii) The Mortgage Note, the Mortgage, the Assignment of Mortgage
         and any other documents required to be delivered for the Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan by the Seller under this Agreement as set
         forth in Section 1.02 hereof have been delivered to the Custodian. The
         Seller is in possession of a complete, true and accurate Mortgage File
         in compliance with Section 1.02 hereof, except for such documents the
         originals of which have been delivered to the Custodian;

              (xiii) The Assignment of Mortgage is in recordable form and is
         acceptable for recording under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
         the Mortgaged Property is located;

              (xiv) The Mortgage contains an enforceable provision for the
         acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of a Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan in the event that the Mortgaged Property is
         sold or transferred without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee
         thereunder;

              (xv) No Bank Originated Mortgage Loan contains provisions pursuant
         to which Monthly Payments are paid or partially paid with funds
         deposited in any separate account established by the Mortgagor or
         anyone on behalf of the Mortgagor, or paid by any source other than the
         Mortgagor, nor does any Bank Originated Mortgage Loan contain any other
         similar provisions currently in effect which may constitute a "buydown"
         provision. No Bank Originated Mortgage Loan is a graduated payment
         mortgage loan and no Bank Originated Mortgage Loan has a shared
         appreciation or other contingent interest feature;

              (xvi) Any future advances made prior to the Cut-off Date have been
         consolidated with the outstanding principal amount secured by the
         Mortgage, and the secured principal amount, as consolidated, bears a
         single interest rate and single repayment term. The lien of the
         Mortgage securing the consolidated principal amount is insured by a
         title insurance policy, an endorsement to the policy insuring the
         mortgagee's consolidated interest or by other title evidence acceptable
         to FNMA and FHLMC. The consolidated principal amount does not exceed
         the original principal amount of any Bank Originated Mortgage Loan;

              (xvii) The origination and collection practices used with respect
         to each Bank Originated Mortgage Loan have been in accordance with
         Accepted Servicing Practices, and have been in all respects in
         compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. With respect to
         escrow deposits and escrow payments, all such payments are in the
         possession of the Seller and there exist no deficiencies in connection
         therewith for which customary arrangements for repayment thereof have
         not been made. All escrow payments have been collected in full
         compliance with state and federal law. An escrow of funds is not
         prohibited by applicable law and has been established in an amount
         sufficient to pay for every item which remains unpaid and which has
         been assessed but is not yet due and payable. No escrow deposits or
         escrow payments or other charges or payments due the Seller have been
         capitalized under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note. All Mortgage
         Interest Rate adjustments have been made in strict compliance with
         state and federal law and the terms of the related Mortgage Note. Any
         interest required to be paid pursuant to state and local law has been
         properly paid and credited;

              (xviii) The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the related
         Mortgage Property signed prior to the approval of the Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan application by a qualified appraiser, who had no
         interest, direct or indirect in the Mortgaged Property or in any loan
         made on the security thereof; and whose compensation is not affected by
         the approval or disapproval of the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan, and
         the appraisal and appraiser both satisfy the requirements of Title XI
         of the Federal Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of
         1989 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, all as in effect on
         the date the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan was originated;

              (xix) The Mortgaged Property is free from any and all toxic or
         hazardous substances and there exists no violation of any local, state
         or federal environmental law, rule or regulation. There is no pending
         action or proceeding directly involving any Mortgaged Property of which
         the Seller is aware in which compliance with any environmental law,
         rule or regulation is an issue; and to the best of the Seller's
         knowledge, nothing further remains to be done to satisfy in full all
         requirements of each such law, rule or regulation;

              (xx) The Bank Originated Mortgage Loan does not contain a
         provision permitting or requiring conversion to a fixed interest rate
         Mortgage Loan;

              (xxi) No Bank Originated Mortgage Loan was made in connection with
         (i) the construction or rehabilitation of a Mortgaged Property or (ii)
         facilitating the trade-in or exchange of a Mortgaged Property;

              (xxii) No action, inaction or event has occurred and no state of
         facts exists or has existed that has resulted or will result in the
         exclusion from, denial of, or defense to coverage under any applicable
         pool insurance policy, special hazard insurance policy, primary
         mortgage loan insurance policy or bankruptcy bond, irrespective of the
         cause of such failure of coverage. In connection with the placement of
         any such insurance, no commission, fee or other compensation has been
         or will be received by the Seller or any designee of the Seller or any
         corporation in which the Seller or any officer, director or employee
         had a financial interest at the time of placement of such insurance;

              (xxiii) Each original Mortgage was recorded and, except for those
         Bank Originated Mortgage Loans subject to the MERS identification
         system, all subsequent assignments of the original Mortgage (other than
         the assignment to the Depositor) have been recorded in the appropriate
         jurisdictions wherein such recordation is necessary to perfect the
         liens thereof as against creditors of the Seller, or are in the process
         of being recorded; and

              (xxiv) Any and all requirements of any federal, state or local
         law, including, without limitation, usury, truth in lending, real
         estate settlement procedures, consumer credit protection, equal credit
         opportunity or disclosure laws applicable to each Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan have been complied with.

         (d) It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 1.04(b) and 1.04(c) herein shall survive the Closing Date.
Upon discovery by either the


                                       13
<PAGE>

Seller or the Depositor of a breach of any of the foregoing representations and
warranties (excluding a breach of subparagraphs (xi) and (xvi) under Section
1.04(b)), that adversely and materially affects the value of the related
Mortgage Loan, that does not also constitute a breach of a representation or
warranty of a Transferor in the related Transfer Agreement, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other party;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this
paragraph shall be specifically applicable to a breach by the Seller of the
representations made pursuant to subparagraphs (xi) and (xvi) under Section
1.04(b) irrespective of the Transferor's breach of a comparable representation
or warranty in the Transfer Agreement. Within 60 days of the discovery of any
such breach, the Seller shall either (a) cure such breach in all material
respects, (b) repurchase such Mortgage Loan or any property acquired in respect
thereof from the Depositor at the applicable Purchase Price or (c) within the
two-year period following the Closing Date substitute a Qualifying Substitute
Mortgage Loan for the affected Mortgage Loan.

         Section 1.05. Grant Clause. It is intended that the conveyance of the
Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans and other
property conveyed pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing Date shall
constitute, and shall be construed as, a sale of such property and not a grant
of a security interest to secure a loan. However, if any such conveyance is
deemed to be in respect of a loan, it is intended that: (1) the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be established pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement; (2) the Seller hereby grants to the Depositor a first priority
security interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest in, to and
under, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, the Mortgage Loans and other
property; and (3) this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under
applicable law.

         Section 1.06. Assignment by Depositor. The Depositor shall have the
right, upon notice to but without the consent of the Seller, to assign, in whole
or in part, its interest under this Agreement with respect to the Mortgage Loans
to the Trustee, and the Trustee then shall succeed to all rights of the
Depositor under this Agreement. All references to the rights of the Depositor in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of and exercisable by its
assignee or designee, specifically including the Trustee.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         Section 2.01. Binding Nature of Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

         Section 2.02. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire
agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements,
understandings, inducements and conditions, express or implied, oral or written,
of any nature whatsoever with respect to the subject matter hereof. The express
terms hereof control and supersede any course of performance and/or usage of the
trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.


                                       14

         Section 2.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended from time to
time by the Seller and the Depositor, without notice to or the consent of any of
the Holders, (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to cause the provisions herein to
conform to or be consistent with or in furtherance of the statements made with
respect to the Certificates, the Trust Fund, the Trust Agreement or this
Agreement in the Prospectus Supplement; or to correct or supplement any
provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provisions herein,
(iii) to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising
under this Agreement or (iv) to add, delete, or amend any provisions to the
extent necessary or desirable to comply with any requirements imposed by the
Code and the REMIC Provisions. No such amendment effected pursuant to clause
(iii) of the preceding sentence shall adversely affect in any material respect
the interests of any Holder. Any such amendment shall be deemed not to adversely
affect in any material respect any Holder, if the Trustee receives written
confirmation from each Rating Agency that such amendment will not cause such
Rating Agency to reduce the then current rating assigned to the Certificates, if
any (and any Opinion of Counsel requested by the Trustee in connection with any
such amendment may rely expressly on such confirmation as the basis therefor).

         (a) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Seller
and the Depositor with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66-2/3% of
the Class Principal Amount or Class Notional Amount (or Percentage Interest) of
each Class of Certificates affected thereby for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of
this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders;
provided, however, that no such amendment may (i) reduce in any manner the
amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on Mortgage Loans which are
required to be distributed on any Certificate without the consent of the Holder
of such Certificate or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentages of Class Principal
Amount or Class Notional Amount (or Percentage Interest) of Certificates of each
Class, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment
without the consent of the Holders of 100% of the Class Principal Amount or
Class Notional Amount (or Percentage Interest) of each Class of Certificates
affected thereby. For purposes of this paragraph, references to "Holder" or
"Holders" shall be deemed to include, in the case of any Class of Book-Entry
Certificates, the related Certificate Owners.

         (b) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Holders under this
Section 2.03 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it
shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The
manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the
execution thereof by Holders shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as
the Trustee may prescribe.

         Section 2.04. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS
CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL
OBLIGATIONS LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

         Section 2.05. Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the
covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be for any
reason whatsoever held


                                       15
<PAGE>

invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed
severable from the remaining covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this
Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement.

         Section 2.06. Indulgences; No Waivers. Neither the failure nor any
delay on the part of a party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or
further exercise of the same or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege,
nor shall any waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to
any occurrence be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or
privilege with respect to any other occurrence. No waiver shall be effective
unless it is in writing and is signed by the party asserted to have granted such
waiver.

         Section 2.07. Headings Not to Affect Interpretation. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, and they
shall not be used in the interpretation hereof.

         Section 2.08. Benefits of Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement
and their successors hereunder, any benefit or any legal or equitable right,
power, remedy or claim under this Agreement.

         Section 2.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.

servicing of the Mortgage Loans. On or before the Closing Date or Servicing
Transfer Date, as applicable, the Seller shall cause to be delivered the

appropriately marked to clearly reflect the ownership of the

                                      -12-
<PAGE>


related Mortgage Loan by the Trustee. The Servicer shall release from its
custody the contents of any Servicing File retained by it only in accordance
with this Agreement.

         Section 2.02      Books and Records.

         (a) Subject to Section 3.01(a) hereof, as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date, the Servicing Transfer Date or the date on which a Qualifying
Substitute Mortgage Loan is delivered pursuant to Section 2.05 of the Trust
Agreement, as applicable (but in no event more than 90 days thereafter except to
the extent delays are caused by the applicable recording office), the Servicer,
at the expense of the Depositor, shall cause the Mortgage or Assignment of
Mortgage, as applicable, with respect to each MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan, to be
properly recorded in the name of MERS in the public recording office in the
applicable jurisdiction, or shall ascertain that such have previously been so
recorded and, with the cooperation of the Trustee, shall take such actions as
are necessary to cause the Trustee to be clearly identified as the owner of each
MERS Mortgage Loan and each MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS
for purposes of the system of recording transfers of beneficial ownership of
mortgages maintained by MERS.

         (b) Subject to Section 3.01(a) hereof, an Assignment of Mortgage in
favor of the Trustee shall be recorded as to each Non-MERS Mortgage Loan unless
instructions to the contrary are delivered to the Servicer, in writing, by the
Depositor. Subject to the preceding sentence, as soon as practicable after the
Closing Date or Servicing Transfer Date, as applicable (but in no event more
than 90 days thereafter except to the extent delays are caused by the applicable
recording office), the Servicer, at the expense of the Depositor, shall cause to
be properly recorded in each public recording office where such Non-MERS
Eligible Mortgage Loans are recorded each Assignment of Mortgage.

         (c) Additionally, the Servicer shall prepare and execute, at the
direction of the Trustee, any note endorsements relating to any of the Non-MERS
Mortgage Loans.

         (d) All rights arising out of the Mortgage Loans shall be vested in the
Trustee, subject to the Servicer's right to service and administer the Mortgage
Loans hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All funds
received on or in connection with a Mortgage Loan, other than the Servicing Fee
and other compensation to which the Servicer is entitled as set forth herein,
including but not limited to any and all servicing compensation pursuant to
Section 5.01 below, shall be received and held by the Servicer in trust for the
benefit of the Trustee pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

         (e) Any out-of-pocket costs incurred by the Servicer pursuant to this
Section 2.02 and Section 3.01(a), including any recording or other fees in
connection with the Servicer's obtaining the necessary powers of attorney (and
which are specified herein to be an expense of the Seller), shall be reimbursed
to the Servicer by the Seller within five (5) Business Days of receipt by the
Seller of an invoice for reimbursement. The Trust Fund shall not reimburse the
Seller for any such reimbursement to the Servicer.

         (f) The Master Servicer and the Trustee shall have the right to examine
the books, records and other information of the Servicer, with respect to or
concerning this Agreement or

                                      -13-

notice to the Servicer.

                                  ARTICLE III.

                         SERVICING OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS

         Section 3.01 Servicer to Service.

         The Servicer, as an independent contractor, shall service and
administer the Mortgage Loans from and after the Closing Date or Servicing
Transfer Date, as applicable, and shall have full power and authority, acting
alone, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which the Servicer may deem necessary or desirable, consistent
with the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted Servicing Practices.

         The Seller and the Servicer additionally agree as follows:

         (a) The Servicer shall (i) record or cause to be recorded the Mortgage
or the Assignment of Mortgage, as applicable, with respect to all MERS Eligible
Mortgage Loans, in the name of MERS, or shall ascertain that such have
previously been so recorded; (ii) with the cooperation of the Trustee, take such
actions as are necessary to cause the Trustee to be clearly identified as the
owner of each MERS Mortgage Loan and each MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan on the
records of MERS for purposes of the system of recording transfers of beneficial
ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS; (iii) prepare or cause to be prepared
all Assignments of Mortgage with respect to all Non-MERS Eligible Mortgage
Loans; (iv) record or cause to be recorded, subject to Section 2.02(b) hereof,
all Assignments of Mortgage with respect to Non-MERS Mortgage Loans in the name
of the Trustee; (v) pay the recording costs pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof;
and/or (vi) track such Mortgages and Assignments of Mortgage to ensure they have
been recorded. The Servicer shall be entitled to be paid by the Seller fees for
the preparation and recordation of the Mortgages and Assignments of Mortgage.
After the expenses of such recording costs pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof shall
have been paid by the Servicer, the Servicer shall submit to the Seller a
reasonably detailed invoice for reimbursement of recording costs and fees it
incurred hereunder.

         (b) If applicable, the Servicer shall, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, as
the same may be amended from time to time, and the regulations provided in
accordance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, provide notice to the
Mortgagor of each Mortgage Loan of the transfer of the servicing thereto to the
Servicer.

         (c) The Servicer shall be responsible for the preparation of and costs
associated with notifications to Mortgagors of the assumption of servicing by
the Servicer.

         Consistent with the terms of this Agreement and except as provided in
Section 3.19, the Servicer may waive any late payment charge, assumption fee or
other fee that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing the Mortgage
Loans. The Servicer shall not make any future advances to any obligor under any
Mortgage Loan, and (unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the
Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the Servicer, reasonably

                                      -14-
<PAGE>


foreseeable) the Servicer shall not permit any modification of any material term
of any Mortgage Loan, including any modification that would change the Mortgage
Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment of principal or interest, reduce or
increase the outstanding principal balance (except for actual payments of
principal) or change the final maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. In the event
of any such modification which permits the deferral of interest or principal
payments on any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such
principal or interest payment has been deferred, make a Monthly Advance in
accordance with Section 4.03, in an amount equal to the difference between (i)
such month's principal and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance
Rate on the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the amount
paid by the Mortgagor. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such
advances to the same extent as for all other advances made pursuant to Section
4.03. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer shall
continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on
behalf of itself and the Trustee, all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable
instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the
Mortgaged Properties. Upon the request of the Servicer, the Trustee shall
execute and deliver to the Servicer any powers of attorney and other documents,
furnished to it by the Servicer and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Servicer shall not, without the Trustee's written
consent: (i) initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's
name without indicating the Servicer's representative capacity; or (ii) take any
action with the intent to cause, and that actually causes the Trustee to be
registered to do business in any state. Promptly after the execution of any
assumption, modification, consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, the
Servicer shall forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents evidencing
such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Servicing Agreement, the Servicer
shall not make or permit any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of
any Mortgage Loan that would cause any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement
to fail to qualify as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax under
Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Servicer shall not (unless the Servicer determines, in its own discretion, that
there exists a situation of extreme hardship to the Mortgagor), waive any
premium or penalty in connection with a prepayment of principal of any Mortgage
Loan, and shall not consent to the modification of any Mortgage Note to the
extent that such modification relates to payment of a prepayment premium or
penalty.

         In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer shall
employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same care
that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering
mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted
Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the requirements
of this Agreement, the Fannie Mae Guides, and the Master Servicer's and Seller's
reliance on the Servicer.

         Section 3.02 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.

         Continuously from the Closing Date or Servicing Transfer Date, as
applicable, until the date each Mortgage Loan ceases to be subject to this
Agreement, the Servicer shall proceed diligently to collect all payments due
under each of the Mortgage Loans when the same shall become due and payable and
shall take special care in ascertaining and estimating Escrow Payments and all
other charges that will become due and payable with respect to the Mortgage
Loans and each related Mortgaged Property, to the end that the installments
payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to pay such charges as and when
they become due and payable.


         Section 3.03 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received
pursuant to the Mortgage Loans separate and apart from any of its own funds and
general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial Accounts,
in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled as directed by the Master
Servicer. The Custodial Account shall be an Eligible Deposit Account established
with an Eligible Institution. Any funds deposited in the Custodial Account may
be invested in Eligible Investments subject to the provisions of Section 3.11
hereof. Funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be drawn on by the Servicer
in accordance with Section 3.04. The creation of any Custodial Account shall be
evidenced by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit B. A copy of such
certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the Master Servicer and,
upon request, to any subsequent owner of the Mortgage Loans.

         The Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily basis,
and retain therein, the following collections received by the Servicer and
payments made by the Servicer after the Cut-off Date (other than scheduled
payments of principal and interest due on or before the Cut-off Date or received
by the Servicer prior to the Cut-off Date but allocable to the period subsequent
thereto or Servicing Transfer Date), as applicable:

                  (i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage
         Loans, including all Principal Prepayments;

                  (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
         adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

                  (iii) all Liquidation Proceeds;

                  (iv) all Insurance Proceeds (other than amounts applied to the
         restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or immediately released
         to the Mortgagor in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices);

                  (v) all Condemnation Proceeds that are not applied to the
         restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the
         Mortgagor;

                  (vi) with respect to each Principal Prepayment in full or in
         part, the Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, if any, for the month
         of distribution. Such deposit shall be made from the Servicer's own
         funds, without reimbursement therefor up to a maximum

                                      -16-
<PAGE>


         amount per month of the Servicing Fee actually received for such month
         for the Mortgage Loans;

                  (vii) all Monthly Advances made by the Servicer pursuant to
         Section 4.03;

                  (viii) any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer in
         connection with the deductible clause in any blanket hazard insurance
         policy;

                  (ix) any amounts received with respect to or related to any
         REO Property or REO Disposition Proceeds;

                  (x) any Prepayment Penalty Amount; and

                  (xi) any other amount required hereunder to be deposited by
         the Servicer in the Custodial Account.

         The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial Account shall
be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of the Servicing Fee and
Ancillary Income need not be deposited by the Servicer into the Custodial
Account.

         Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account by the
depository institution shall accrue to the benefit of the Servicer and the
Servicer shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the
Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.04. Additionally, any other benefit
derived from the Custodial Account associated with the receipt, disbursement and
accumulation of principal, interest, taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage
insurance, etc. shall accrue to the Servicer.


         Section 3.04 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the
Custodial Account for the following purposes:

                  (i) to make payments to the Master Servicer in the amounts and
         in the manner provided for in Section 4.01;

                  (ii) with respect to each LPMI Loan, in the amount of the

         Policies in accordance with Section 3.07;

                  (iii) in the event the Servicer has elected not to retain the
         Servicing Fee out of any Mortgagor payments on account of interest or
         other recovery of interest with respect to a particular Mortgage Loan
         (including late collections of interest on such Mortgage Loan, or
         interest portions of Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds or
         Liquidation Proceeds) prior to the deposit of such Mortgagor payment or
         recovery in the Custodial Account, to pay to itself the related
         Servicing Fee from all such Mortgagor payments on account of interest
         or other such recovery for interest with respect to that Mortgage Loan;

                                      -17-

         pursuant to Section 4.03, the Servicer's right to reimburse itself
         pursuant to this subclause (viii) with respect to any Mortgage Loan
         being limited to amounts received on or in respect of the related
         Mortgage Loan which represent late recoveries of payments of principal
         or interest with respect to which a Monthly Advance was made, it being
         understood that, in the case of any such reimbursement, the Servicer's
         right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the Trust Fund, provided,
         however, that following the final liquidation of a Mortgage Loan, the
         Servicer may reimburse itself for previously unreimbursed Monthly
         Advances in excess of Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds with
         respect to such Mortgage Loan from any funds in the Custodial Account,
         it being understood, in the case of any such reimbursement, that the
         Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the Trust
         Fund. The Servicer may recover at any time from amounts on deposit in
         the Custodial Account the amount of any Monthly Advances that the
         Servicer deems nonrecoverable or that remain unreimbursed to the
         Servicer from related Liquidation Proceeds after the final liquidation
         of the Mortgage Loan;

         Loan being limited to related Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation
         Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, REO Disposition Proceeds and other
         amounts received in respect of the related REO Property, and such other
         amounts as may be collected by the Servicer from the Mortgagor or
         otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that, in
         the case of any such reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall
         be prior to the rights of the Trust Fund;

                  (x) to reimburse itself for remaining unreimbursed Servicing
         Advances with respect to any defaulted Mortgage Loan as to which the
         Servicer has determined that all amounts that it expects to recover on
         behalf of the Trust Fund from or on account of such Mortgage Loan have
         been recovered;

                  (xi) to reimburse itself for expenses incurred or reimbursable
         to the Servicer pursuant to Sections 3.07, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 and 6.03 to

         Section 3.05 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account.

         The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received
pursuant to a Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and apart from
any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or
more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled as
directed by the Master Servicer. Each Escrow Account shall be an Eligible
Deposit Account established with an Eligible Institution in a manner that shall
provide maximum available insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow
Account may be drawn on by the Servicer in accordance with Section 3.06. The
creation of any Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a letter agreement in the
form of Exhibit C. A copy of such certification or letter agreement shall be
furnished to the Master Servicer and, upon request, to any subsequent owner of
the Mortgage Loans.

         The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts on a daily
basis, and retain therein:

                  (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage
         Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as
         required under the terms of this Agreement; and

                  (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or
         Condemnation Proceeds that are to be applied to the restoration or
         repair of any Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account only to
effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth in
Section 3.06. The Servicer shall retain any interest paid on funds deposited in
the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than interest on
escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. Additionally, any
other benefit derived from the Escrow Account associated with the receipt,
disbursement and accumulation of principal, interest, taxes, hazard insurance,
mortgage insurance, etc. shall accrue to the Servicer. To the extent required by
law, the Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the Mortgagor
notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or that
interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.


         Section 3.06 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

         Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by the
Servicer only:

                  (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes,

         condominium charges, fire and hazard insurance premiums or other items
         constituting Escrow Payments for the related Mortgage;

         excess of the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage
         Loan;

                  (iii) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application to

                  (iv) to reimburse the Servicer for any Servicing Advance made
         by the Servicer with respect to a related Mortgage Loan, but only from

         collections of Escrow Payments.

                  (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
         Property in accordance with the Fannie Mae Guides;

                  (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or any Mortgagor to the extent
         required by law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow

         Account by the Servicer; and

                  (viii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the

         Section 3.07 Maintenance of PMI Policy and/or LPMI Policy; Claims.

         The Servicer shall comply with all provisions of applicable state and
federal law relating to the cancellation of, or collection of premiums with

Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, and all regulations promulgated thereunder,
as amended from time to time.

         With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than LPMI Loans) with a loan
to value ratio at origination in excess of 80%, the Servicer shall maintain or
cause the Mortgagor to maintain (to the extent that the Mortgage Loan requires
the Mortgagor to maintain such insurance) in full force and effect a PMI Policy,
and shall pay or shall cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a
timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the
event that such PMI Policy shall be terminated, the Servicer shall obtain from
another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage
equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy, at substantially
the same fee level. The Servicer shall not take any action which would result in
noncoverage under any applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for the
actions of the Servicer would have been covered thereunder. In connection with
any assumption or substitution agreements entered into or to be entered into
with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall promptly notify the insurer
under the related PMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of
liability in accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy and shall take all
actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation
of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI Policy is terminated as a result
of such assumption or substitution of liability, the Servicer shall obtain a
replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

         The Servicer shall take all such actions as are necessary to service,
maintain and administer the LPMI Loans in accordance with the LPMI Policy and to
perform and enforce the rights of the insured under such LPMI Policy. Except as
expressly set forth herein, the Servicer shall have full authority on behalf of
the Trust Fund to do anything it reasonably deems appropriate or desirable in
connection with the servicing, maintenance and administration of the LPMI
Policy. The Servicer shall not modify or assume a Mortgage Loan covered by the
LPMI Policy or take any other action with respect to such Mortgage Loan which
would result in non-

                                      -20-
<PAGE>


coverage under the LPMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the
Servicer, would have been covered thereunder. If the LPMI Insurer fails to pay a
claim under the LPMI Policy as a result of breach by the Servicer of its
obligations hereunder or under the LPMI Policy, the Servicer shall be required
to deposit in the Custodial Account on or prior to the next succeeding
Remittance Date an amount equal to such unpaid claim from its own funds without
any right to reimbursement from the Trust Fund. The Servicer shall cooperate
with the LPMI Insurer and the Master Servicer and shall use its best efforts to
furnish all reasonable aid, evidence and information in the possession of the
Servicer to which the Servicer has access with respect to any LPMI Loan;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
LPMI Policy, the Servicer shall not be required to submit any reports to the
LPMI Insurer until a reporting date that is at least 15 days after the Servicer
has received sufficient loan level information from each Seller, the Master
Servicer or the LPMI Insurer to appropriately code its servicing system in
accordance with the LPMI Insurer's requirements.

         In connection with its activities as servicer, the Servicer agrees to
prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Trustee, claims to the insurer
under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the
terms of such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action
as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy
respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Any amounts collected by the Servicer
under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited in the Custodial Account,
subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.04.


         Section 3.08 Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance.

         The Servicer shall keep in force during the term of this Agreement a
Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy. Such Fidelity Bond and
Errors and Omissions Insurance shall be maintained with recognized insurers and
shall be in such form and amount as would permit the Servicer to be qualified as
a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac seller-servicer. The Servicer shall be deemed to
have complied with this provision if an affiliate of the Servicer has such
errors and omissions and fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such
insurance policy or fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to
the Servicer. The Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer a copy of each
such bond and insurance policy if (i) the Master Servicer so requests and (ii)
the Servicer is not an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc. at the time of such
request.


         Section 3.09 Notification of Adjustments.

         With respect to each Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
adjust the Mortgage Interest Rate on the related interest rate adjustment date
and shall adjust the Monthly Payment on the related mortgage payment adjustment
date, if applicable, in compliance with the requirements of applicable law and
the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note. The Servicer shall execute and deliver
any and all necessary notices required under applicable law and the terms of the
related Mortgage Note and Mortgage regarding the Mortgage Interest Rate and
Monthly Payment adjustments. The Servicer shall promptly, upon written request
therefor, deliver to the Master Servicer such notifications and any additional
applicable data regarding such adjustments and the methods used to calculate and
implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery by the Servicer or the receipt of
notice from the Master Servicer that the Servicer has failed to adjust a

                                      -21-
<PAGE>


Mortgage Interest Rate or Monthly Payment in accordance with the terms of the
related Mortgage Note, the Servicer shall immediately deposit in the Custodial
Account from its own funds the amount of any interest loss or deferral caused
thereby.


         Section 3.10 Completion and Recordation of Assignments of Mortgage.

         As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Servicing Transfer
Date or the date on which a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan is delivered
pursuant to Section 2.05 of the Trust Agreement, as applicable (but in no event
more than 90 days thereafter except to the extent delays are caused by the
applicable public recording office), the Servicer shall cause the endorsements
on the Mortgage Note (if applicable), and the Assignments of Mortgage (subject
to Section 3.01(a)) to be completed in the name of the Trustee (or MERS, as
applicable).


         Section 3.11 Protection of Accounts.

         The Servicer may transfer any Custodial Account or any Escrow Account
to a different Eligible Institution from time to time; provided that in the
event the Custodial Account or any Escrow Account is held in a depository
institution or trust company that ceases to be an Eligible Institution, the
Servicer shall transfer such Custodial Account or Escrow Account, as the case
may be, to an Eligible Institution. The Servicer shall give notice to the Master
Servicer of any change in the location of the Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall bear any expenses, losses or damages sustained by
the Master Servicer or the Trustee if the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow
Account are not demand deposit accounts.

         Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow Account may
at the option of the Servicer be invested in Eligible Investments. Any such
Eligible Investment shall mature no later than the Business Day immediately
preceding the related Remittance Date; provided, however, that if such Eligible
Investment is an obligation of an Eligible Institution (other than the Servicer)
that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such Eligible
Investment may mature on the related Remittance Date. Any such Eligible
Investment shall be made in the name of the Servicer in trust for the benefit of
the Trustee. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Servicer and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Servicer. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be
deposited in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Servicer out of
its own funds immediately as realized.


         Section 3.12 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

         With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall maintain
accurate records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
water rates, sewer rents, and other charges which are or may become a lien upon
the Mortgaged Property and the status of PMI Policy and LPMI Policy (if any)
premiums and fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to
time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and
shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination
date, employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account
which shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts
sufficient for such purposes, as allowed

                                      -22-
<PAGE>


under the terms of the Mortgage. The Servicer shall not be required to maintain
records with respect to the payment of LPMI Premiums unless the Servicer shall
be required to make payment of such premiums and such requirement shall be
indicated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule with respect to each applicable Mortgage
Loan. The Servicer assumes full responsibility for the timely payment of all
such bills, shall effect timely payment of all such charges irrespective of each
Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the
Escrow Payments, and shall make advances from its own funds to effect such
payments. With regard to any Mortgage Loans for which the Mortgagor is not
required to escrow Escrow Payments with the Servicer, the Servicer shall use
reasonable efforts consistent with Accepted Servicing Practices to determine
that any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they first became
due and shall insure that the Mortgaged Property is not lost to a tax lien as a
result of nonpayment and that such Mortgage is not left uninsured and shall make
advances from its own funds to effect any such delinquent payments to avoid the
lapse of insurance coverage on the Mortgaged Property or to avoid the imposition
of a tax lien.


         Section 3.13 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

         The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan hazard
insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by a
generally acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage
and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property
is located, in an amount which is at least equal to the greater of (i) the then
outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (ii) an amount such that
the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor or the loss
payee from becoming a co-insurer.

         If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged
Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood
Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood
insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a generally acceptable insurance carrier in an amount
representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum amount required,
under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any damage or loss on a
replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the mortgage if replacement
cost coverage is not available for the type of building insured) and (ii) the
maximum amount of insurance which is available under the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the term of the
Mortgage Loan, the Servicer determines in accordance with applicable law and
pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged Property is located in a
special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is covered in
an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973, as amended, the Servicer shall notify the related Mortgagor that the
Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if said Mortgagor fails
to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within forty-five (45) days
after such notification, the Servicer shall force place the required flood
insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.


         Section 3.14 Maintenance of Mortgage Blanket Insurance.

         The Servicer shall obtain and maintain a blanket policy insuring
against losses arising from fire and hazards covered under extended coverage on
all of the Mortgage Loans. To the

                                      -23-
<PAGE>


extent such policy provides coverage in an amount equal to the amount required
pursuant to Section 3.13 and otherwise complies with all other requirements of
Section 3.13, it shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations
as set forth in Section 3.13. Any amounts collected by the Servicer under any
such policy relating to a Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account or Escrow Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Sections 3.04 or
3.06. Such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in the event
that there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged Property a
policy complying with Section 3.13, and there shall have been a loss which would
have been covered by such policy, the Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial
Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable under the
blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to be deposited
from the Servicer's funds, without reimbursement therefor.


         Section 3.15 Restoration of Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer need not obtain the approval of the Trustee or the Master
Servicer prior to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to
the Mortgagor to be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
Property if such release is in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. At
a minimum, with respect to claims greater than $10,000, the Servicer shall
comply with the following conditions in connection with any such release of
Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds:

                  (i) the Servicer shall receive satisfactory independent
         verification of completion of repairs and issuance of any required
         approvals with respect thereto;

                  (ii) the Servicer shall take all steps necessary to preserve
         the priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
         requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;
         and

                  (iii) pending repairs or restoration, the Servicer shall place
         the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.


         Section 3.16 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property.

         In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in
foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be taken in the name of the Trustee or its nominee (or MERS, as
applicable), or in the event the Trustee is not authorized or permitted to hold
title to real property in the state where the REO Property is located, or would
be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax laws of such state by so
holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of
such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an Opinion of Counsel
obtained by the Servicer (with a copy delivered to the Trustee) from any
attorney duly licensed to practice law in the state where the REO Property is
located. The Person or Persons holding such title other than the Trustee shall
acknowledge in writing that such title is being held as nominee for the Trustee.

         The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO
Property for the Trustee solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and
sale. The Servicer, either itself or through an agent selected by the Servicer,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner
that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

property for its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in
the same locality as the REO Property is managed. The Servicer shall attempt to
sell the same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than
one year, except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as
the Servicer deems to be in the best interest of the Trustee. If the Servicer
determines that it is in the best interest of the Trustee to not proceed with
foreclosure or accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer shall have the
right to do so, whereupon the related Mortgage Loan shall be deemed to be
finally liquidated and the Servicer shall have the right to release the lien of
the Mortgage on the related Mortgage Property and the Servicer shall be entitled
to reimbursement for all outstanding unreimbursed Servicing Advances and Monthly
Advances from the Custodial Account in accordance with Section 3.04(viii).

         The Servicer may permit an obligor to pay off a non-performing Mortgage
Loan at less than its unpaid principal balance or chargeoff all or a portion of
such non-performing Mortgage Loan if such discounted payoff or chargeoff is in
accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices and the Servicer believes that such
discounted payoff or chargeoff is in the best interest of the Trust Fund;
provided that in the case of any proposed discounted payoff or proposed
chargeoff, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer, by telecopy and
telephone, of the proposed discounted payoff or chargeoff. The Master Servicer
shall be deemed to have approved the discounted payoff or chargeoff of any
Mortgage Loan unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in writing,
within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of the related notice, that it
disapproves of the discounted payoff or chargeoff, in which case the Servicer
shall not proceed with such discounted payoff or chargeoff.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
3.16, in connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure, in the event the Servicer has reasonable cause to believe that a
Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
or if the Trustee or the Master Servicer otherwise requests, an environmental
inspection or review of such Mortgaged Property to be conducted by a qualified
inspector shall be arranged by the Servicer. Upon completion of the inspection,
the Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a written
report of such environmental inspection. In the event that the environmental
inspection report indicates that the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, the Servicer shall not proceed with
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In the event that
the environmental inspection report is inconclusive as to the whether or not the
Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
the Servicer shall not, without the prior approval of the Master Servicer,
proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In such
instance, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have approved such foreclosure
or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure unless the Master Servicer
notifies the Servicer in writing, within two (2) Business Days after its receipt
of written notice of the proposed foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure
from the Servicer, that it disapproves of the related foreclosure or acceptance
of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Servicer shall be reimbursed for all
Servicing Advances made pursuant to this paragraph with respect to the related
Mortgaged Property from the Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall use its Best Efforts to dispose of the REO Property
as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event within three
years after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless (a) a REMIC
election has not been made with respect to the arrangement

                                      -25-
<PAGE>


under which the Mortgage Loans and the REO Property are held, and (b) the
Servicer determines, and gives an appropriate notice to the Master Servicer to
such effect, that a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of
such REO Property. If a period longer than three years is permitted under the
foregoing sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Servicer
shall report monthly to the Master Servicer as to the progress being made in
selling such REO Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Trustee,
a purchase money mortgage is taken in connection with such sale, such purchase
money mortgage shall name the Servicer as mortgagee, and such purchase money
mortgage shall not be held pursuant to this Agreement, but instead a separate
participation agreement among the Servicer and Trustee shall be entered into
with respect to such purchase money mortgage. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Servicer shall not be required to provide financing for the
sale of any REO Property.

         The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and hazard
insurance with extended coverage in amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no REO Property
acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to continue to be rented)
or otherwise used or held by or on behalf of the Trust Fund in such a manner, or
pursuant to any terms or for a period that would: (i) cause such REO Property to
fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(8) of the Code or (ii) result in the imposition of any tax upon any
REMIC included in the Trust Fund. Subject to the approval of the Master Servicer
as described in this paragraph, the disposition of REO Property shall be carried
out by the Servicer at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the
Servicer deems to be in the best interests of the Trust Fund.

         Prior to acceptance by the Servicer of an offer to sell any REO
Property, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of such offer in writing
which notification shall set forth all material terms of said offer (each a
"Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer shall be deemed to have approved the sale
of any REO Property unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in writing,
within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of the related Notice of Sale,
that it disapproves of the related sale, in which case the Servicer shall not
proceed with the sale. With respect to any REO Property, upon a REO Disposition,
the Servicer shall be entitled to retain from REO Disposition Proceeds a
disposition fee equal to $1,500.

         The Servicer shall withdraw from the Custodial Account funds necessary
for the proper operation, management and maintenance of the REO Property,
including the cost of maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to the Fannie
Mae Guides. The Servicer shall make monthly distributions on each Remittance
Date to the Master Servicer of the net cash flow from the REO Property (which
shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses described in
this Section 3.16 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to time to
be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

<PAGE>


         Section 3.17 Real Estate Owned Reports.

         Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section 4.02, the
Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer on or before the Remittance Date
each month a statement with respect to any REO Property covering the operation
of such REO Property for the previous month and the Servicer's efforts in
connection with the sale of such REO Property and any rental of such REO
Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous month. That statement
shall be accompanied by such other information as the Master Servicer shall
reasonably request.

         Section 3.18 MERS.


         (a) So long as the Trustee is a member of MERS, the Servicer shall use
its Best Efforts to cause the Trustee to be identified as the owner of each MERS
Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for purposes of the system of recording
transfers of beneficial ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS.

         (b) The Servicer shall maintain in good standing its membership in
MERS. In addition, the Servicer shall comply with all rules, policies and
procedures of MERS, including the Rules of Membership, as amended, and the MERS
Procedures Manual, as amended.

         (c) With respect to all MERS Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder, the
Servicer shall promptly notify MERS as to any transfer of beneficial ownership
of such Mortgage Loans of which the Servicer has notice.

         (d) With respect to all MERS Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder, the
Servicer shall notify MERS as to any transfer of servicing pursuant to Section
9.01 within 10 Business Days of such transfer of servicing. The Servicer shall
cooperate with the Trustee, the Master Servicer and any successor servicer to
the extent necessary to ensure that such transfer of servicing is appropriately
reflected on the MERS system.

         Section 3.19 Waiver of Prepayment Penalty Amounts.

         Except as provided below, the Servicer or any designee of the Servicer
shall not waive any Prepayment Penalty Amount with respect to any Mortgage Loan.
If the Servicer or its designee fails to collect a Prepayment Penalty Amount at
the time of the related prepayment of any Mortgage Loan subject to such
Prepayment Penalty Amount, the Servicer shall pay to the Trust Fund at such time
(by deposit to the Custodial Account) an amount equal to the amount of the
Prepayment Penalty Amount not collected; provided, however, the Servicer shall
not have any obligation to pay the amount of any uncollected Prepayment Penalty
Amount under this Section 3.19 if the failure to collect such amount is the
result of inaccurate or incomplete information in the Prepayment Penalty Amount
Schedule provided by the Seller and which is included as part of the Mortgage
Loan Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Prepayment Penalty Amounts
listed on the Prepayment Penalty Amount Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A
are complete, true and accurate and may be relied on by the Servicer in its
calculation of Prepayment Penalty Amounts. If the Prepayment Penalty Amount data
set forth on Exhibit A is incorrect, then the Servicer shall have no liability
for any loss resulting from calculation of Prepayment Penalty Amounts using the
data provided. Notwithstanding the above, the Servicer or its designee may waive
a Prepayment Penalty Amount without paying to the Trust Fund the

                                      -27-
<PAGE>


amount of such Prepayment Penalty Amount only if such Prepayment Penalty Amount
(i) relates to a defaulted Mortgage Loan or a reasonably foreseeable default,
such waiver is standard and customary in servicing similar mortgage loans to the
Mortgage Loan, and such waiver, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer would
maximize recovery of total proceeds from the Mortgage Loan, taking into account
the amount of such Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage Loan, or (ii)
relates to a prepayment charge the collection of which, if collected, would be a
violation of applicable laws.

                                   ARTICLE IV.

                           PAYMENTS TO MASTER SERVICER


         Section 4.01 Remittances.

         On each Remittance Date, no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,
the Servicer shall remit on a scheduled/scheduled basis by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Master Servicer (i) all amounts deposited in
the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the last day of the related
Due Period (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 3.04), plus (ii) all Monthly Advances, if any, which the
Servicer is obligated to remit pursuant to Section 4.03 (and which the Servicer
has not already deposited in the Custodial Account pursuant to Section
3.03(viii)); minus (iii) any amounts attributable to Principal Prepayments,
Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds or REO
Disposition Proceeds received after the applicable Prepayment Period, which
amounts shall be remitted on the following Remittance Date, together with any
additional interest required to be deposited in the Custodial Account in
connection with such Principal Prepayment in accordance with Section 3.03(vi),
and minus (iv) any amounts attributable to Monthly Payments collected but due on
a Due Date or Due Dates subsequent to the first day of the month in which such
Remittance Date occurs, which amounts shall be remitted on the Remittance Date
next succeeding the Due Date related to such Monthly Payment.

         With respect to any remittance received by the Master Servicer after
the Business Day on which such payment was due, the Servicer shall pay to the
Master Servicer interest on any such late payment at an annual rate equal to the
Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change, plus two (2) percentage
points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount permitted by applicable
law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial Account by the Servicer
on the date such late payment is made and shall cover the period commencing with
the day following such Business Day and ending with the Business Day on which
such payment is made, both inclusive. Such interest shall be remitted along with
the distribution payable on the next succeeding Remittance Date. The payment by
the Servicer of any such interest shall not be deemed an extension of time for
payment or a waiver by the Trustee or the Master Servicer of any Event of
Default.

         All remittances required to be made to the Master Servicer shall be
made to the following wire account or to such other account as may be specified
by the Master Servicer from time to time:

         Not later than the tenth (10th) calendar day of each month (or if such
calendar day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day), the
Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer (i) a monthly remittance advice in

in the format set forth in Exhibit D-2 hereto (or in such other format mutually
agreed between the Servicer and the Master Servicer) relating to the period
ending on the last day of the preceding calendar month and (ii) all such
information required pursuant to clause (i) above on a magnetic tape or other
similar media reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer. The format of this
monthly reporting may be amended from time to time to the extent necessary to
comply with applicable law or the terms of the Trust Agreement.

         Not later than the seventeenth day of each month, the Servicer shall
furnish to the Master Servicer (a) a monthly payoff remittance advice regarding
any Principal Prepayments in full applied to the related Mortgage Loan on or
after the seventeenth day of the month preceding the month of such reporting
date, but on or before the sixteenth day of the month of such reporting date,
containing such information and in such format as is mutually acceptable to the
Master Servicer and the Servicer, and in any event containing sufficient
information to permit the Master Servicer to properly report Principal
Prepayment in full information to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement and (b)
all such information required pursuant to clause (a) above in electronic format,
on magnetic tape or other similar media reasonably acceptable to the Master
Servicer.

         In addition, not more than 60 days after the end of each calendar year,
commencing December 31, 2004, the Servicer shall furnish to each Person who was
an owner of the Mortgage Loans at any time during such calendar year as required
by applicable law or if not required by applicable law, at the request of such
owner as to the aggregate of remittances for the applicable portion of such
year.

         Such obligation of the Servicer shall be deemed to have been satisfied
to the extent that substantially comparable information shall be provided by the
Servicer pursuant to any requirements of the Internal Revenue Code as from time
to time are in force.

         The Master Servicer may request that the Servicer provide, at the
Master Servicer's expense, an appraisal or a broker price opinion on any
Mortgage Loan which is 90 days or more delinquent. The Servicer shall use its
best efforts to deliver such appraisal or broker price opinion to the Master
Servicer within 15 calendar days after such request.

                                      -29-

         Beginning with calendar year 2004, the Servicer shall provide the
Master Servicer with such information concerning the Mortgage Loans as is
necessary for the Trustee to prepare the Trust Fund's federal income tax return
as the Trustee may reasonably request from time to time.


         Section 4.03 Monthly Advances by Servicer.

         On the Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance Date, the
Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds or from
amounts held for future distribution, or both, an amount equal to the aggregate
of all Monthly Advances relating to Monthly Payments which were due on the
Mortgage Loans during the applicable Due Period and which were delinquent at the
close of business on the immediately preceding Determination Date or which were
deferred pursuant to Section 3.01. Any amounts held for future distribution and
so used shall be replaced by the Servicer by deposit in the Custodial Account on
or before any future Remittance Date if funds in the Custodial Account on such
Remittance Date shall be less than remittances to the Master Servicer required
to be made on such Remittance Date. The Servicer shall keep appropriate records
of such amounts and will provide such records to the Master Servicer upon
request. The Servicer's obligation to make such Monthly Advances as to any
Mortgage Loan will continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior to the
payment in full of the Mortgage Loan, or through the last Remittance Date prior
to the Remittance Date for the distribution of all Liquidation Proceeds and
other payments or recoveries (including Insurance Proceeds and Condemnation
Proceeds) with respect to the Mortgage Loan unless the Servicer deems such
Monthly Advances to be unrecoverable, as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate
of the Servicer delivered to the Master Servicer.

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES


         Section 5.01 Servicing Compensation.

         As consideration for servicing the Mortgage Loans subject to this
Agreement, the Servicer shall retain (i) the relevant Servicing Fee for each
Mortgage Loan remaining subject to this Agreement during any month and (ii)
Ancillary Income. In addition, if at any time the Servicer is the Retained
Interest Holder with respect to any Mortgage Loans, then the Servicer, as the
Retained Interest Holder, shall retain an amount equal to the Retained Interest
relating to such Mortgage Loans; provided, that (i) the Trustee and the Master
Servicer shall have no obligation to make payment of the Retained Interest to
the Servicer and (ii) the Servicer's right to retain the Retained Interest is
limited to (and the Retained Interest may only be retained from) the interest
portion (including recoveries with respect to interest from Liquidation
Proceeds) of the Monthly Payments collected by the Servicer with respect to
those Mortgage Loans for which payment is in fact made of the entire amount of
the Monthly Payment. The Servicing Fee shall be payable monthly. The Servicing
Fees shall be payable only at the time of and with respect to those Mortgage
Loans for which payment is in fact made of the entire amount of the Monthly
Payment or as otherwise provided in Section 3.04. The obligation of the Trust
Fund to pay the Servicing Fees is limited as provided in Section 3.04. The
aggregate of the Servicing Fees payable to the Servicer for any month with
respect to the Mortgage Loans shall be reduced by

                                      -30-
<PAGE>


any Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount with respect to such month. Any
Prepayment Interest Excess Amount shall be retained by, or paid to, the Servicer
as a part of the Servicing Fee.

         The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in
connection with its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to
reimbursement thereof except as specifically provided for herein.


         Section 5.02 Annual Audit Report.

         On or before March 15th of each year, beginning with March 15, 2005,
Servicer shall, at its own expense, cause a firm of independent public
accountants (who may also render other services to Servicer), which is a member
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to furnish to the
Seller and the Master Servicer (i) year-end audited (if available) financial
statements of the Servicer and (ii) a statement to the effect that such firm has
examined certain documents and records for the preceding fiscal year (or during
the period from the date of commencement of such Servicer's duties hereunder
until the end of such preceding fiscal year in the case of the first such
certificate) and that, on the basis of such examination conducted substantially
in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers,
or such other attestation program as may be required by applicable law or
regulation, such firm is of the opinion that Servicer's overall servicing
operations have been conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation
Program for Mortgage Bankers, or such other attestation program as may be
required by applicable law or regulation, except for such exceptions that, in
the opinion of such firm, the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage
Bankers, or such other attestation program as may be required by applicable law
or regulation, requires it to report, in which case such exceptions shall be set
forth in such statement.


         Section 5.03 Annual Officer's Certificate.

         (a) On or before March 15th of each year, beginning with March 15,
2005, the Servicer, at its own expense, will deliver to each Seller, the
Trustee, the Depositor and the Master Servicer a Servicing Officer's
certificate, or such other certificates as may be required under applicable law
or regulation, stating, as to each signer thereof, that (i) a review of the
activities of the Servicer during such preceding fiscal year and of performance
under this Agreement has been made under such officers' supervision, and (ii) to
the best of such officers' knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has
fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement for such year, or, if there
has been a default in the fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each
such default known to such officers and the nature and status thereof including
the steps being taken by the Servicer to remedy such default.

         (b) For so long as a certificate under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended, ("Sarbanes-Oxley") is required to be given on behalf of the Trust
Fund, no later than March 15th of each year (or if not a Business Day, the
immediately preceding Business Day), or at any other time that the Master
Servicer, the Depositor or the Trustee provides a certification pursuant to
Sarbanes-Oxley and upon thirty (30) days written request of such parties, an
officer of the Servicer shall execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate to
the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Depositor for the benefit of the Trust
Fund and the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the

                                      -31-
<PAGE>


Depositor and their officers, directors and affiliates, in the form of Exhibit E
hereto or as may be required by applicable law or regulation.

         (c) The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Master Servicer,
the Depositor and their respective officers, directors, agents and affiliates
from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable
legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses arising out
of or based upon a breach by the Servicer or any of its officers, directors,
agents or affiliates of its obligations under this Section 5.03 or the
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Servicer in connection
therewith. If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or
insufficient to hold harmless the Master Servicer and/or the Depositor, then the
Servicer agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Master Servicer and/or the Depositor as a result of the losses, claims, damages
or liabilities of the Master Servicer and/or the Depositor in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Master Servicer and/or the
Depositor on the one hand and the Servicer on the other in connection with a
breach of the Servicer's obligations under this Section 5.03 or the Servicer's
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith.


         Section 5.04 Transfers of Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer shall use its best efforts to enforce any "due-on-sale"
provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny assumption by
the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be sold
whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or not the
Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to
the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, exercise its rights to
accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause
applicable thereto, provided, however, that the Servicer shall not exercise such
rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if the exercise of such rights
would impair or threaten to impair any recovery under the related PMI Policy or
LPMI Policy, if any.

         If the Servicer reasonably believes it is unable under applicable law
to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Servicer shall enter into (i) an
assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such property has
been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage
Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in the event the
Servicer is unable under applicable law to require that the original Mortgagor
remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Servicer has the prior consent of
the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of liability agreement
with the owner of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to which the original
Mortgagor is released from liability and the owner of the Mortgaged Property is
substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note; provided
that no such substitutions should be permitted unless such person satisfies the
underwriting criteria of the Servicer and has a credit risk rating at least
equal to that of the original Mortgagor. The Mortgage Loan, as assumed, shall
conform in all respects to the requirements, representations and warranties of
this Agreement. The Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer that any such
assumption or substitution agreement has been contemplated by forwarding to the
Master Servicer a copy of such assumption or substitution agreement (indicating
the Mortgage File to which it relates). The Servicer shall forward an original
copy of such agreement to the Custodian to be held by the Custodian with the
other documents related to

                                      -32-
<PAGE>


such Mortgage Loan. The Servicer shall be responsible for recording any such
assumption or substitution agreements. In connection with any such assumption or
substitution agreement, the Monthly Payment on the related Mortgage Loan shall
not be changed but shall remain as in effect immediately prior to the assumption
or substitution, the Mortgage Interest Rate, the stated maturity or the
outstanding principal amount of such Mortgage Loan shall not be changed nor
shall any required monthly payments of principal or interest be deferred or
forgiven. Any assumption fee collected by the Servicer for entering into an
assumption agreement shall be retained by the Servicer as additional servicing
compensation. In connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage
Interest Rate borne by the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan
nor the outstanding principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                           REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
                                 AND AGREEMENTS

         Section 6.01 Representations, Warranties and Agreements of the
Servicer.

         The Servicer, as a condition to the consummation of the transactions
contemplated hereby, hereby makes the following representations and warranties
to the Seller, the Master Servicer and the Trustee as of the Closing Date:

         (a) Due Organization and Authority. The Servicer is a corporation duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has all licenses necessary to carry on its
business as now being conducted and is licensed, qualified and in good standing
in each state where a Mortgaged Property is located if the laws of such state
require licensing or qualification in order to conduct business of the type
conducted by the Servicer, and in any event the Servicer is in compliance with
the laws of any such state to the extent necessary to ensure the enforceability
of the terms of this Agreement; the Servicer has the full power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform in accordance herewith; the
execution, delivery and performance of this Agreement (including all instruments
of transfer to be delivered pursuant to this Agreement) by the Servicer and the
consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly
authorized; this Agreement evidences the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Servicer and all requisite action has been taken by the
Servicer to make this Agreement valid and binding upon the Servicer in
accordance with its terms;

         (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of business of the
Servicer;

         (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the acquisition of the servicing responsibilities by the Servicer or the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor the fulfillment of or compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, will conflict with or result in a breach
of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Servicer's organizational
documents or any legal restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the
Servicer is now a party or by which it is bound, or constitute a default or
result in an acceleration under any of the foregoing, or result in the violation
of any law, rule, regulation,

                                      -33-
<PAGE>


order, judgment or decree to which the Servicer or its property is subject, or
impair the ability of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans, or impair the
value of the Mortgage Loans;

         (d) Ability to Perform. The Servicer does not believe, nor does it have
any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every covenant
contained in this Agreement;

         (e) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or threatened against the Servicer which, either in any
one instance or in the aggregate, may result in any material adverse change in
the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of the
Servicer, or in any material impairment of the right or ability of the Servicer
to carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any material
liability on the part of the Servicer, or which would draw into question the
validity of this Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in connection
with the obligations of the Servicer contemplated herein, or which would be
likely to impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform under the
terms of this Agreement;

         (f) No Consent Required. No consent, approval, authorization or order
of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution,
delivery and performance by the Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with
this Agreement;

         (g) Ability to Service. The Servicer is an approved seller/servicer of
conventional residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with the
facilities, procedures, and experienced personnel necessary for the sound
servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
is in good standing to service mortgage loans for either Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac. The Servicer is a member in good standing of the MERS system;

         (h) No Untrue Information. Neither this Agreement nor any statement,
report or other document furnished or to be furnished pursuant to this Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby contains any untrue
statement of fact or omits to state a fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading; and

         (i) No Commissions to Third Parties. The Servicer has not dealt with
any broker or agent or anyone else who might be entitled to a fee or commission
in connection with this transaction other than the Seller.


         Section 6.02 Remedies for Breach of Representations and Warranties of
the Servicer.

         It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 6.01 shall survive the engagement of the Servicer to perform
the servicing responsibilities as of the Closing Date or Servicing Transfer
Date, as applicable, hereunder and the delivery of the Servicing Files to the
Servicer and shall inure to the benefit of the Seller and the Trustee. Upon
discovery by either the Servicer, the Master Servicer or the Seller of a breach
of any of the foregoing representations and warranties which materially and
adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects
the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority of the
security interest on such Mortgaged Property or the interest of the Seller or
the Trustee, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice
to the other.

                                      -34-
<PAGE>


         Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice to the
Servicer of any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 6.01
which materially and adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to perform
its duties and obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially and
adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the
priority of the security interest on such Mortgaged Property, the Servicer shall
use its Best Efforts promptly to cure such breach in all material respects and,
if such breach cannot be cured, the Servicer shall, at the Trustee's or the
Master Servicer's option, assign the Servicer's rights and obligations under
this Agreement (or respecting the affected Mortgage Loans) to a successor
Servicer. Such assignment shall be made in accordance with Section 9.01.

         In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify the Seller, the Trustee and
the Master Servicer (and each of their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents) and hold each of them harmless against any Costs resulting from any
claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting
from, a breach of the Servicer representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the remedies set forth in this
Section 6.02 constitute the sole remedies of the Seller, the Master Servicer and
the Trustee respecting a breach of the foregoing representations and warranties.

         Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or arising out of
the breach of any representations and warranties made in Section 6.01 shall
accrue upon (i) discovery of such breach by the Servicer or notice thereof by
the Seller or the Master Servicer to the Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer
to cure such breach within the applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the
Servicer by the Seller or the Master Servicer for compliance with this
Agreement.

         Section 6.03 Additional Indemnification by the Servicer; Third Party
Claims.

         The Servicer shall indemnify the Seller, the Master Servicer, the
Depositor, the Trustee (and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents) and the Trust Fund, and hold them harmless against any and
all Costs that any such indemnified party may sustain in any way related to (i)
the failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans
in material compliance with the terms of this Agreement (including, but not
limited to its obligation to provide the certification pursuant to Section
5.03(b) hereunder) or for any inaccurate or misleading information provided in
the certification required pursuant to Section 5.03(b) or (ii) the failure of
the Servicer to cause any event to occur or not to occur which would have
occurred or would not have occurred, as applicable, if the Servicer were
applying Accepted Servicing Practices under this Agreement. The Servicer shall
immediately notify the Seller, the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Trustee
and the Trust Fund or any other relevant party if a claim is made by a third
party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume (with the
prior written consent of the indemnified party in the event of an indemnified
claim) the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
therewith, including counsel fees, promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against it or any other party in respect
of such claim and follow any written instructions received from such
indemnifying party in connection with such claim. Subject to the Servicer's
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.02, or the failure of the Servicer to
service and administer the Mortgage Loans in material compliance with the terms
of this Agreement, the Trust Fund shall indemnify the Servicer and hold the
Servicer harmless against any and all Costs that the Servicer may sustain in
connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement, the Certificates or
the

                                      -35-
<PAGE>


origination or Servicing of the Mortgage Loans by any prior owner or servicer,
other than any Costs incurred by reason of the Servicer's willful misfeasance,
bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of
its reckless disregard of obligations and duties hereunder.


         Section 6.04 Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and Loss of
REMIC Status.

         In the event that any REMIC fails to qualify as a REMIC, loses its
status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result of a
prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC Provisions due
to the negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set
forth herein, the Servicer shall indemnify the Holder of the related Residual
Certificate, the Master Servicer, the Trustee (and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents) and the Trust Fund against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from
such negligence; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be liable for
any such Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Trustee, the
Depositor or the Holder of such Residual Certificate, as applicable, nor for any
such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by the Holder of such
Residual Certificate on which the Servicer has relied. The foregoing shall not
be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Holder of such
Residual Certificate, the Trustee and the Trust Fund now or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no
event shall the Servicer have any liability (1) for any action or omission that
is taken in accordance with and in compliance with the express terms of, or
which is expressly permitted by the terms of, this Agreement, (2) for any Losses
other than arising out of a negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties
and obligations set forth herein, and (3) for any special or consequential
damages to Certificateholders (in addition to payment of principal and interest
on the Certificates).

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                                  THE SERVICER


         Section 7.01 Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer.

         The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a corporation or a limited liability company, and shall obtain and
preserve its qualification to do business as a foreign entity in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the
validity and enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and
to perform its duties under this Agreement.

         Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or
any corporation or limited liability company resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or any
Person succeeding to the business of the Servicer, shall be the successor of the
Servicer hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person shall
be an institution (i) having a net worth of not less than $25,000,000, and (ii)
which is a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac approved servicer in good standing.

                                      -36-
<PAGE>


         Section 7.02 Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and Others.

         Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Seller, the Master
Servicer or the Trustee for any action taken or for refraining from the taking
of any action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in
judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer
or any such person against any breach of warranties or representations made
herein, or failure to perform its obligations in strict compliance with any
standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any liability which would
otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly
executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.
The Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend
any legal action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage
Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it
in any expense or liability, provided, however, that the Servicer may, with the
consent of the Master Servicer, undertake any such action which it may deem
necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and the rights and duties of
the parties hereto. In such event, the Servicer shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Trust Fund for the reasonable legal expenses and costs of
such action.


         Section 7.03 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by the Servicer.

         The Seller has entered into this Agreement with the Servicer in
reliance upon the independent status of the Servicer, and the representations as
to the adequacy of its servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and
procedures, its integrity, reputation and financial standing, and the
continuance thereof. Therefore, the Servicer shall neither assign its rights
under this Agreement or the servicing hereunder nor delegate its duties
hereunder or any portion thereof, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its property or assets without, in each case, the prior
written consent of the Seller and the Master Servicer, which consent, in the
case of an assignment of rights or delegation of duties, shall be granted or
withheld in the discretion of the Seller and the Master Servicer, and which
consent, in the case of a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the
property or assets of the Servicer, shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, that in each case, there must be delivered to the Master Servicer and
the Trustee a letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that such transfer of
servicing or sale or disposition of assets will not result in a qualification,
withdrawal or downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer, without the consent of the Seller,
the Master Servicer or the Trustee, may retain third party contractors to
perform certain servicing and loan administration functions, including without
limitation, hazard insurance administration, tax payment and administration,
flood certification and administration, collection services and similar
functions; provided, that the retention of such contractors by Servicer shall
not limit the obligation of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

         The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Servicer and the Master Servicer
or upon the determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible
under applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Servicer. Any
such determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Master
Servicer and the Trustee which Opinion of Counsel shall be in form and substance
acceptable to the Master Servicer and the Trustee. No such resignation shall
become effective until a successor shall have assumed the Servicer's
responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in Section
9.01.

         Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 7.03, in the
event that the Servicer either shall assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property
or assets, without the prior written consent of the Seller and the Master
Servicer, then the Seller or the Master Servicer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set forth in Section 8.01, without
any payment of any penalty or damages and without any liability whatsoever to
the Servicer or any third party.


         Section 7.04 Subservicing Agreements and Successor Subservicer.

                  (a) The Servicer may enter into subservicing agreements for
         any servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans with any
         institution which (i) is an approved Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
         Seller/Servicer and (ii) which represents and warrants that it is in
         compliance with the laws of each state as necessary to enable it to
         perform its obligations under such subservicing agreement. For this
         purpose, subservicing shall not be deemed to include the use of a tax
         service, or services for reconveyance, insurance, property inspection
         or brokering REO Property or the retention of third party contractors
         to perform certain servicing and loan administration functions,
         including without limitation, hazard insurance administration, tax
         payment and administration, flood certification and administration,
         collection services and similar functions. The Servicer shall give
         prior written notice to the Master Servicer and the Trustee of the
         appointment of any subservicer and shall furnish to the Master Servicer
         a copy of such subservicing agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
         the Servicer shall be deemed to have received payments on Mortgage
         Loans immediately upon receipt by any subservicer of such payments. Any
         such subservicing agreement shall be consistent with and not violate
         the provisions of this Agreement. Each subservicing agreement shall
         provide that a successor servicer shall have the option to terminate
         such agreement without payment of any fees if the predecessor servicer
         is terminated or resigns.


                  (b) The Servicer may terminate any subservicing agreement to
         which it is a party in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
         subservicing agreement and either itself directly service the related
         Mortgage Loans or enter into a subservicing agreement with a successor
         subservicer that qualifies under Section 7.04(a).

                  (c) Notwithstanding any subservicing agreement or the
         provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements
         between the Servicer and a subservicer or reference to actions taken
         through a subservicer or otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated
         and primarily liable to the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the
         Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage
         Loans in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of
         such obligation or liability by virtue of such subservicing agreements
         or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the subservicer
         and to the same extent and

                                      -38-
<PAGE>


         under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were
         servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall be
         entitled to enter into any agreement with a subservicer for
         indemnification of the Servicer by such subservicer and nothing
         contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such
         indemnification.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                                   TERMINATION


         Section 8.01 Termination for Cause.

         This Agreement shall be terminable at the option of the Seller or the
Master Servicer if any of the following events of default exist on the part of
the Servicer:

                  (i) any failure by the Servicer to remit to the Master
         Servicer any payment required to be made under the terms of this
         Agreement which continues unremedied for a period of two Business Days
         after the date upon which written notice of such failure, requiring the
         same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the
         Master Servicer; or

                  (ii) failure by the Servicer duly to observe or perform in any
         material respect any other of the covenants or agreements on the part
         of the Servicer set forth in this Agreement which continues unremedied
         for a period of 30 days; or

                  (iii) failure by the Servicer to maintain its license to do
         business or service residential mortgage loans in any jurisdiction, if
         required by such jurisdiction, where the Mortgaged Properties are
         located; or

                  (iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory
         authority having jurisdiction for the appointment of a conservator or
         receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
         including bankruptcy, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar
         proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall
         have been entered against the Servicer and such decree or order shall
         have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60
         days; or

                  (v) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a
         conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
         of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of
         or relating to the Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially
         all of its property; or

                  (vi) the Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay
         its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take
         advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
         statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors,
         voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations or cease its normal
         business operations for three Business Days; or

                  (vii) the Servicer ceases to meet the qualifications of a
         Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac seller/servicer; or

                  (viii) the Servicer attempts to assign the servicing of the
         Mortgage Loans or its right to servicing compensation hereunder or the
         Servicer attempts to sell or otherwise dispose of

                                      -39-
<PAGE>


         all or substantially all of its property or assets or to assign this
         Agreement or the servicing responsibilities hereunder or to delegate
         its duties hereunder or any portion thereof (to other than a third
         party in the case of outsourcing routine tasks including, but not
         limited to, taxes, insurance, property inspection, reconveyance,
         collection or brokering REO Property), in each case without complying
         fully with the provisions of Section 7.03.

         In each and every such case, so long as an event of default shall not
have been remedied, in addition to whatever rights the Seller or the Master
Servicer may have at law or equity to damages, including injunctive relief and
specific performance, the Seller or the Master Servicer, by notice in writing to
the Servicer, may terminate all the rights and obligations of the Servicer under
this Agreement and in and to the servicing contract established hereby and the
proceeds thereof.

         Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Mortgage
Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in a successor Servicer
appointed by the Seller and the Master Servicer. Upon written request from the
Seller, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity
designated by the Seller any and all documents and other instruments, place in
such successor's possession all Servicing Files relating to the Seller's
Mortgage Loans, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, including but
not limited to the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans
and related documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The Servicer shall
cooperate with the Seller and the Master Servicer and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

         By a written notice, the Seller and the Master Servicer may waive any
default by the Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its
consequences. Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to
exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been
remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the
extent expressly so waived.

         Upon a termination for cause pursuant to Section 8.01, all unreimbursed
Servicing Fees, Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances still owing the Servicer
shall be paid by the Trust Fund as such amounts are received from the related
Mortgage Loans.


         Section 8.02 Termination Without Cause.

         This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the last Mortgage
Loan to the Master Servicer (or advances by the Servicer for the same), and (b)
the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon foreclosure of the last
Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all funds due hereunder, (ii) mutual consent
of the Servicer, the Seller and the Master Servicer in writing or (iii) at the
sole discretion of the Seller (acting in its capacity as owner of the servicing
rights relating to the Mortgage

                                      -40-
<PAGE>


Loans). Any such termination pursuant to clause (iii) above shall be with 30
days' prior notice, in writing and delivered to the Trustee, the Master Servicer
and the Servicer by registered mail to the addresses set forth in Section 9.03
of this Agreement (in the case of the Servicer) or in the Trust Agreement (in
the case of the Trustee or the Master Servicer). The Servicer shall comply with
the termination procedures set forth in Sections 7.03, 8.01 and 9.01 hereof. The
Master Servicer or the Trustee shall have no right to terminate the Servicer
pursuant to this Section 8.02. In connection with a termination by the Seller
pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 8.02, the Servicer shall be reimbursed
for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing Advances, Monthly Advances and
Servicing Fees and other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated
with any transfer of servicing at the time of such transfer of servicing. Any
invoices received by the Servicer after termination will be forwarded to the
Seller or the successor servicer for payment within thirty (30) days of receipt
from the Servicer.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS


         Section 9.01 Successor to the Servicer.

         Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities
and duties under this Agreement (a) pursuant to Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.01 or
8.02(ii), the Master Servicer shall (i) succeed to and assume all of the
Servicer's responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this
Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor having the characteristics set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01 and which shall succeed to all rights and
assume all of the responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under
this Agreement simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
responsibilities, duties and liabilities under this Agreement; or (b) pursuant
to a termination under Section 8.02(iii), the Seller shall appoint a successor
having the characteristics set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01 and
which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement simultaneously with the
termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and liabilities under
this Agreement (with respect to those related Mortgage Loans). Any successor to
the Servicer shall be subject to the approval of the Master Servicer and, to the
extent required by the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, shall be a member in good
standing of the MERS system (if any of the Mortgage Loans are MERS Eligible
Mortgage Loans, unless such Mortgage Loans are withdrawn from MERS and
Assignments of Mortgage are recorded in favor of the Trustee at the expense of
the successor Servicer). Any approval of a successor servicer by the Master
Servicer and, to the extent required by the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, shall,
if the successor servicer is not at that time a servicer of other Mortgage Loans
for the Trust Fund, be conditioned upon the receipt by the Master Servicer and
the Trustee of a letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that such transfer
of servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or downgrade of the
then-current rating of any of the Certificates. In connection with such
appointment and assumption, the Master Servicer or the Seller, as applicable,
may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
payments on Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree, provided,
however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the
Servicer under this Agreement. In the event that the Servicer's duties,
responsibilities and liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated
pursuant to the aforementioned sections,

                                      -41-
<PAGE>


the Servicer shall discharge such duties and responsibilities during the period
from the date it acquires knowledge of such termination until the effective date
thereof with the same degree of diligence and prudence which it is obligated to
exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might
impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of its successor. The
resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to the aforementioned sections
shall not become effective until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to this
Section 9.01 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the representations
and warranties made pursuant to Sections 6.01 and the remedies available to the
Master Servicer and the Seller under Section 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04, it being
understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.03 and
6.04 shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such resignation or
termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this Agreement. Neither the
Master Servicer, in its capacity as successor servicer, nor any other successor
servicer, shall be responsible for the lack of information and/or documents that
are not transferred to it by the Servicer and that it cannot otherwise obtain
through reasonable efforts.

         Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than 30 days
of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall prepare, execute
and deliver to the successor entity any and all documents and other instruments,
place in such successor's possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be
done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
such notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer and
endorsement of the Mortgage Notes and related documents, and the preparation and
recordation of Assignments of Mortgage. The Servicer shall cooperate with the
Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Seller, as applicable, and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

         Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer, the Master Servicer and the Seller an
instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the successor shall make the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.01 (including a
representation that the successor Servicer is a member of MERS, unless none of
the Mortgage Loans are MERS Mortgage Loans or MERS Eligible Mortgage Loans or
any such Mortgage Loans have been withdrawn from MERS and Assignments of
Mortgage are recorded in favor of the Trustee) and provide for the same remedies
set forth in Sections 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04 herein and (ii) an assumption of the
due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be
performed and observed by the Servicer under this Agreement, whereupon such
successor shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties,
responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect
as if originally named as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or
resignation of the Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.01 or 8.02 shall not affect any claims that the Master
Servicer or the Trustee may have against the Servicer arising out of the
Servicer's actions or failure to act prior to any such termination or
resignation. In addition, in the event any successor servicer is appointed
pursuant to Section 8.02(iii) of this Agreement, such successor servicer must
satisfy the conditions relating to the transfer of servicing set forth in the
Trust Agreement.

                                      -42-
<PAGE>


         The Servicer shall deliver promptly to the successor servicer the funds
in the Custodial Account and Escrow Account and all Mortgage Loan documents and
related documents and statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer shall
account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such
other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and definitively vest
in the successor all such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations
and liabilities of the Servicer.

         Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the Servicer
shall notify the Trustee, the Seller and Master Servicer of such appointment in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.03.


         Section 9.02 Costs.

         The Seller shall pay the legal fees and expenses of its attorneys.
Costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transfer of the servicing
responsibilities, including fees for delivering Servicing Files, shall be paid
by the Seller. Subject to Sections 2.02 and 3.01(a), the Depositor shall pay the
costs associated with the preparation, delivery and recording of Assignments of
Mortgages.

         Section 9.04 Severability Clause.

         Any part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which
is prohibited or which is held to be void or unenforceable shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof. Any part, provision, representation or warranty of
this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable or is held to be void or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective, as to such jurisdiction,
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction as to any Mortgage Loan shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law which prohibits
or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof. If the invalidity of any
part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement shall deprive any
party of the economic benefit intended to be conferred by this Agreement, the
parties shall negotiate, in good-faith, to develop

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

a structure the economic effect of which is as close as possible to the economic
effect of this Agreement without regard to such invalidity.


         Section 9.05 No Personal Solicitation.

         From and after the Closing Date, the Servicer hereby agrees that it
will not take any action or permit or cause any action to be taken by any of its
agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on the Servicer's
behalf, to personally, by telephone or mail, solicit the borrower or obligor
under any Mortgage Loan (on a targeted basis) for any purposes of prepayment,
refinancing or modification of the related Mortgage Loan, provided, however,
that this limitation shall not prohibit the Servicer from soliciting such
Mortgagor for purposes of prepayment, refinance or modification of any loan
owned or serviced by the Servicer other than a Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that, among other marketing
activities, promotions and solicitations undertaken by the Servicer which are
directed of the general public at large or which are directed generally to a
segment of the then existing customers of the Servicer or any of its affiliates
(including, without limitation, the mailing of promotional materials to the
Servicer's or its affiliates' deposit customers by inserting such materials into
customer account statements, mass mailings based on commercially acquired
mailing lists and newspaper, radio and television advertisements and
solicitations made on the basis of information acquired by the Servicer or its
affiliates that indicates that a borrower may be planning to refinance) shall
not constitute solicitation under this section. In the event the Servicer does
refinance any Mortgage Loan as a result of a violation of the requirements set
forth in this Section 9.05, the Servicer hereby agrees to pay to the Trust Fund
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount that the Trust
Fund would have received if it had sold the Mortgage Loan to a third party, and
the proceeds received by the Trust Fund as a result of such refinancing.


         Section 9.06 Counterparts.

         This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of
counterparts. Each counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, and all such
counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument.


         Section 9.07 Place of Delivery and Governing Law.

         This Agreement shall be deemed in effect when a fully executed
counterpart thereof is received by the Seller in the State of New York and shall
be deemed to have been made in the State of New York. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401
OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

                                      -45-
<PAGE>



         Section 9.08 Further Agreements.

         The Seller and the Servicer each agree to execute and deliver to the
other such reasonable and appropriate additional documents, instruments or
agreements as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this
Agreement.


         Section 9.09 Intention of the Parties.

         It is the intention of the parties that the Seller is conveying, and
the Servicer is receiving only a contract for servicing the Mortgage Loans.
Accordingly, the parties hereby acknowledge that the Trust Fund remains the sole
and absolute owner of the Mortgage Loans and all rights (other than the
servicing rights) related thereto.


         Section 9.10 Successors and Assigns; Assignment of Servicing Agreement.

         This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Servicer, each Seller, the Trustee and the Master Servicer
and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be

      SELLER'S ENGAGEMENT OF SERVICER TO PERFORM SERVICING RESPONSIBILITIES

Section 2.01.     Contract for Servicing; Possession of Servicing Files.

         The Seller, by execution and delivery of this Agreement, does hereby
contract with the Servicer as the owner of the servicing rights, subject to the
terms of this Agreement, for the servicing of the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
shall maintain a Servicing File with respect to each Mortgage Loan in order to
service such Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement and each Servicing File
delivered to the Servicer shall be held in trust by the Servicer for the benefit
of the Trustee; provided, however, that the Servicer shall have no liability for
any Servicing Files (or portions thereof) not delivered by the Seller. The
Servicer's possession of any portion of the Mortgage Loan documents shall be at
the will of the Trustee for the sole purpose of facilitating servicing of the
related Mortgage Loan pursuant to this Agreement, and such retention and
possession by the Servicer shall be in a custodial capacity only. The ownership
of each Mortgage Note, Mortgage, and the contents of the Servicing File shall be
vested in the Trustee and the ownership of all records and documents with
respect to the related Mortgage Loan prepared by or which come into the
possession of the Servicer shall immediately vest in the Trustee and shall be
retained and maintained, in trust, by the Servicer at the will of the Trustee in
such custodial capacity only. The Servicing File retained by the Servicer
pursuant to this Agreement shall be identified in accordance with the Servicer's
file tracking system to reflect the ownership of the related Mortgage Loan by
the Trustee. The Servicer shall release from its custody the contents of any
Servicing File retained by it only in accordance with this Agreement.

Section 2.02.     Books and Records.

         All rights arising out of the Mortgage Loans shall be vested in the
Trustee, subject to the Servicer's right to service and administer the Mortgage
Loans hereunder in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. All funds
received on or in connection with a Mortgage Loan, other than the Servicing Fee
and other compensation and reimbursement to which the Servicer is entitled as
set forth herein, including but not limited to Section 5.03 below, shall be
received and held by the Servicer in trust for the benefit of the Trustee
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.

         The Servicer shall forward to the related Custodian original documents
evidencing an assumption, modification, consolidation or extension of any
Mortgage Loan entered into in accordance with Section 3.01 within one week of
their execution; provided, however, that the Servicer shall provide such
Custodian with a Servicer certified true copy of any such document


                                      -12-
<PAGE>


submitted for recordation within one week of its execution, and shall provide
the original of any document submitted for recordation or a copy of such
document certified by the appropriate public recording office to be a true and
complete copy of the original within 120 days of its submission for recordation.


                                  ARTICLE III.

                         SERVICING OF THE MORTGAGE LOANS

Section 3.01.     Servicer to Service.

         The Servicer shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans from and
after the Closing Date, and shall have full power and authority, acting alone,
to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and administration
which the Servicer may deem necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of
this Agreement and with the Servicing Standard.

         Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Servicer may waive,
modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of
strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any
Mortgagor if in accordance with the Servicing Standard such waiver,
modification, postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Trust
Fund; provided, however, that unless the Servicer has obtained the prior written
consent of the Master Servicer, the Servicer shall not permit any modification
with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate,
defer or forgive the payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the
outstanding principal balance (except for actual payments of principal), or
change the final maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. In the event of any such
modification which permits the deferral of interest or principal payments on any
Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Remittance Date in any month in which any such principal or interest payment has
been deferred, make a Monthly Advance in accordance with Section 4.03, in an
amount equal to the difference between (a) such month's principal and one
month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid principal
balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by the Mortgagor. The
Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such advances to the same extent
as for all other advances made pursuant to Section 3.04. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Servicer shall continue, and is hereby
authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of itself and the
Trustee, all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full
release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If reasonably
required by the Servicer, the Trustee shall furnish the Servicer with a power of
attorney in a form similar to Exhibit H hereto (provided that any such power of
attorney shall be acceptable to the Trustee), and other documents, furnished to
it by the Servicer and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee, necessary or
appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative
duties under this Agreement; provided that the Trustee shall not be liable for
the actions of the Servicer under any such powers of attorney. Promptly after
the execution of any assumption, modification, consolidation or extension of any
Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall forward to the Master Servicer copies of any
documents evidencing such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Servicing Agreement,
the


                                      -13-
<PAGE>


Servicer shall not make or permit any modification, waiver or amendment of any
term of any Mortgage Loan that would cause any REMIC created under the Trust
Agreement to fail to qualify as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax
under Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

         The Servicer shall not without the Trustee's written consent: (i)
initiate any action, suit or proceedings solely under the Trustee's name without
indicating the Servicer's representative capacity or (ii) take any action with
the intent to cause, and which actually does cause, the Trustee to be registered
to do business in any state. The Servicer shall indemnify the Trustee for any
and all costs, liabilities and expenses incurred by the Trustee in connection
with the negligent or willful misuse of such powers of attorney by the Servicer.

         In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer shall
employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same care
that it would employ and exercise in servicing and administering similar
mortgage loans for other institutional investors, giving due consideration to
the Servicing Standard where such practices do not conflict with the
requirements of this Agreement.

Section 3.02.     Collection and Liquidation of Mortgage Loans.

         Continuously from the Closing Date, until the date each Mortgage Loan
ceases to be subject to this Agreement, the Servicer shall proceed diligently to
collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans when the same shall
become due and payable and shall take special care in ascertaining and
estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will become due and
payable with respect to the Mortgage Loans and each related Mortgaged Property,
to the end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to
pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

         The Servicer shall use its best efforts, consistent with the Servicing
Standard, to foreclose upon or otherwise comparably convert the ownership of
such Mortgaged Properties as come into and continue in default and as to which
no satisfactory arrangements can be made for collection of delinquent payments
pursuant to Section 3.01. The Servicer shall use its best efforts to realize
upon defaulted Mortgage Loans in such a manner as will maximize the receipt of
principal and interest by the Trustee, taking into account, among other things,
the timing of foreclosure proceedings. The foregoing is subject to the
provisions that, in any case in which Mortgaged Property shall have suffered
damage, the Servicer shall not be required to expend its own funds toward the
restoration of such property unless it shall determine in its discretion (i)
that such restoration will increase the proceeds of liquidation of the related
Mortgage Loan to the Master Servicer after reimbursement to itself for such
expenses, and (ii) that such expenses will be recoverable by the Servicer
through Insurance Proceeds or Liquidation Proceeds from the related Mortgaged
Property. In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan and not
postponed pursuant to Section 3.01 is not paid when the same becomes due and
payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails to perform any other covenant or
obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period, the Servicer shall take such action as (1) the Servicer
would take for other institutional investors under similar circumstances with
respect to a similar mortgage loan, (2) shall be consistent with the Servicing
Standard,


                                      -14-
<PAGE>


(3) the Servicer shall determine prudently to be in the best interest of the
Trust Fund, and (4) is consistent with any related LPMI Policy. In the event
that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not postponed pursuant to
Section 3.01 and remains delinquent for a period of one hundred and five (105)
days or any other default continues for a period of one hundred and five (105)
days beyond the expiration of any grace or cure period, the Servicer shall
commence foreclosure proceedings. The Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer
in writing of the commencement of foreclosure proceedings on a monthly basis no
later than the fifth Business Day of each month (which notification may be
included within the monthly reports submitted to the Master Servicer under this
Agreement). In such connection, the Servicer shall be responsible for all costs
and expenses incurred by it in any such proceedings; provided, however, that it
shall be entitled to reimbursement thereof from the related Mortgaged Property,
as contemplated in Section 3.04.

         Notwithstanding the generality of the preceding paragraph, the Servicer
shall take such actions generally in accordance with the Servicer's established
default timeline and in accordance with the Servicing Standard with respect to
each Mortgagor for which there is a delinquency until such time as such
Mortgagor is current with all payments due under the Mortgage Loan.

         With respect to a HOEPA Claim Loan, upon receipt of notice from the
Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Mortgagor that the Mortgagor has instituted
a claim that the related Mortgage Loan was originated in violation of HOEPA, the
Servicer shall, unless otherwise directed by such party, suspend all of its loss
mitigation activities with respect to such Mortgage Loan until such time as such
claim has been resolved. In the event that such party provides direction to the
Servicer, the Servicer shall continue to service such HOEPA Claim Loan pursuant
to the Servicing Standard, provided that such direction is not inconsistent with
the Servicing Standard.

Section 3.03.     Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account.

                  (a) The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected
and received pursuant to the Mortgage Loans separate and apart from any of its
own funds and general assets and shall initially establish and maintain a
Custodial Account, in the form of a time deposit or demand account titled "Chase
Manhattan Mortgage Corporation in trust for Citibank, N.A., as Trustee for
SASCO, Series 2004-22" and referred to herein as the "Custodial Account." The
Custodial Account shall be an Eligible Deposit Account established with an
Eligible Institution. Any funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be
invested in Eligible Investments subject to the provisions of Section 3.10
hereof. Funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be drawn on by the Servicer
in accordance with Section 3.04(a) hereof. The creation of the Custodial Account
shall be evidenced by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit B. A copy of
such certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the Trustee, the
Master Servicer and, upon request, to any subsequent owner of the Mortgage
Loans.

                  (b) The Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a
daily basis, but not more than two (2) Business Days after receipt by the
Servicer and retain therein, the following collections received by the Servicer
and payments made by the Servicer after the Cut-


                                      -15-

before the Cut-off Date) or the Servicing Transfer Date, as applicable:

Mortgage Loans adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

                           (iii) all Prepayment Charges;

                           all Liquidation Proceeds;

                           (iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts
required to be deposited pursuant to Section 3.11 (other than proceeds to be
held in the Escrow Account and applied to the restoration and repair of the
Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with the related
Mortgage Loan documents and the Servicing Standard);

                           (v) all Condemnation Proceeds that are not applied to
the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor
in accordance with the related Mortgage Loan documents and the Servicing
Standard;

                           (vi) with respect to each Principal Prepayment in
full or in part, the Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, if any, for the month
of distribution. Such deposit shall be made from the Servicer's own funds,
without reimbursement therefor up to a maximum amount per month of the Servicing
Fee actually received for such month for the Mortgage Loans;

                           (vii) all Monthly Advances made by the Servicer
pursuant to Section 4.03;

                           (viii) any amounts received from the seller of a
Mortgage Loan or any other person giving representations and warranties with
respect to the Mortgage Loan, in connection with the repurchase of any Mortgage
Loan;

                           (x) any amounts received with respect to or related
to any REO Property or REO Disposition Proceeds;

                           (xi) any amounts required to be deposited by the
Servicer pursuant to Section 3.16 in connection with any unpaid claims that are
a result of a breach by the Servicer or any subservicer of the obligations
hereunder or under the terms of a PMI Policy; and

                           (xii) any other amount required to be deposited in
the Custodial Account pursuant to this Agreement.


                                      -16-

<PAGE>


         The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial Account shall
be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of the Servicing Fee and
Ancillary Income need not be deposited by the Servicer into the Custodial
Account. Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account by the
depository institution shall accrue to the benefit of the Servicer and the
Servicer shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the
Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.04. Additionally, any other benefit
derived from the Custodial Account associated with the receipt, disbursement and
accumulation of principal, interest, taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage
insurance, etc. shall accrue to the Servicer.

Section 3.04.     Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account.

                  (a) The Servicer shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from
the Custodial Account for the following purposes:

amounts and in the manner provided for in Section 4.01;

                           (ii) in the event the Servicer has elected not to
retain the Servicing Fee out of any Mortgagor payments on account of interest or
other recovery of interest with respect to a particular Mortgage Loan (including
late collections of interest on such Mortgage Loan, or interest portions of
Insurance Proceeds, Liquidation Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds) prior to the
deposit of such Mortgagor payment or recovery in the Custodial Account, to pay
to itself the related Servicing Fee from all such Mortgagor payments on account
of interest or other such recovery for interest with respect to that Mortgage
Loan;

                           (iii) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Monthly
Advances and Servicing Advances, the Servicer's right to reimburse itself
pursuant to this subclause (iii) with respect to any Mortgage Loan being limited
to related Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, REO
Disposition Proceeds and other amounts received in respect of the related REO
Property, and such other amounts as may be collected by the Servicer from the
Mortgagor or otherwise relating to such Mortgage Loan, it being understood that,
in the case of any such reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall be
prior to the rights of the Trust Fund;

                           (iv) to reimburse itself following a final
liquidation of a Mortgage Loan for any previously unreimbursed Servicing
Advances made by the Servicer that it determines are Nonrecoverable Advances, it
being understood, in the case of each such reimbursement, that the Servicer's
right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the Trust Fund;

                           (v) to pay itself interest on funds deposited in the
Custodial Account;

                           (viii) with respect to each LPMI Loan, an amount
equal to the related LPMI Fee to make payment of premiums due under the LPMI
Policy;

                           (ix) to withdraw funds deposited in error; and

                           (x) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon

more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled,
"Chase Manhattan Mortgage Corporation in trust for Citibank, N.A., as Trustee
for the SASCO, Series 2004-22". The Escrow Accounts shall be Eligible Accounts
established with an Eligible Institution in a manner that shall provide maximum
available insurance thereunder. Nothing herein shall require the Servicer to
compel a Mortgagor to establish an Escrow Account in violation of applicable
law. Funds deposited in the Escrow Account may be drawn on by the Servicer in
accordance with Section 3.06. The creation of any Escrow Account shall be
evidenced by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit C hereto. A copy of such
certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the Master Servicer.

         The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts on a daily
basis, and retain therein:

Mortgage Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as
required under the terms of this Agreement; and

                           (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or repair of
any Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account only to
effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth in
Section 3.06. The Servicer shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on
funds deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than
interest on escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the
extent required by law, the Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the
Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or
that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

Section 3.06.     Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

         Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by the
Servicer only:

                           (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes,
assessments, water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium charges, fire
and hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting Escrow Payments for
the related Mortgage;


                                      -18-

<PAGE>


                           (ii) to reimburse the Servicer for any Servicing
Advance made by the Servicer with respect to a related Mortgage Loan, but only
from amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent late
collections of Escrow Payments thereunder;

                           (iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to
be in excess of the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage
Loan;

                           (iv) to the extent permitted by applicable law, for
transfer to the Custodial Account and application to reduce the principal
balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of the related
Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

                           (v) for application to restoration or repair of the
Mortgaged Property in accordance with Section 3.15;

                           (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or any Mortgagor to the
extent required by law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow
Account; and

                           (vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on
the termination of this Agreement.

         The Servicer will be responsible for the administration of the Escrow
Accounts and will be obligated to make Servicing Advances to the Escrow Account
in respect of its obligations under this Section 3.06, reimbursable from the
Escrow Accounts or Custodial Account to the extent not collected from the
related Mortgagor, anything to the contrary notwithstanding, when and as
necessary to avoid the lapse of insurance coverage on the Mortgaged Property, or
which the Servicer knows, or in servicing the Mortgage Loans in accordance with
the Servicing Standard should know, is necessary to avoid the loss of the
Mortgaged Property due to a tax sale or the foreclosure as a result of a tax
lien. If any such payment has not been made and the Servicer receives notice of
a tax lien with respect to the Mortgage being imposed, the Servicer will advance
or cause to be advanced funds necessary to discharge such lien on the Mortgaged
Property in order to prevent loss of title to the Mortgaged Property.

Section 3.07.     [Reserved].

Section 3.08.     Completion and Recordation of Assignment of Mortgage.

         To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the Assignments of
Mortgage is subject to recordation in all appropriate public offices for real
property records in all the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which
any or all of the Mortgaged Properties are situated, and in any other
appropriate public recording office or elsewhere. The cost of any such
recordation by the Servicer shall be borne by the Seller.

Section 3.09.     Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

                  (a) With respect to each Mortgage Loan which provides for
Escrow Payments, the Servicer shall maintain accurate records reflecting the
status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, sewer rents, and other
charges which are or may become a lien


                                      -19-
<PAGE>


upon the Mortgaged Property and the status of fire and hazard insurance coverage
and shall obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such charges
(including renewal premiums) ("Property Charges") and shall effect payment
thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination date, employing for such
purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account which shall have been
estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts sufficient for such
purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. The Servicer shall effect
timely payment of all such charges irrespective of each Mortgagor's faithful
performance in the payment of the same or the making of the Escrow Payments.

                  (b) To the extent that a Mortgage Loan does not provide for
Escrow Payments, the Servicer shall make advances from its own funds to effect
payment of all Property Charges upon receipt of notice of any failure to pay on
the part of the Mortgagor, or at such other time as the Servicer determines to
be in the best interest of the Trust Fund, provided, that in any event the
Servicer shall pay such charges on or before any date by which payment is
necessary to preserve the lien status of the Mortgage. The Servicer shall pay
any late fee or penalty which is payable due to any delay in payment of any
Property Charge to avoid a loss of the Mortgaged Property.

Section 3.10.     Protection of Accounts.

         The Servicer may transfer the Custodial Account or any Escrow Account
to a different Eligible Institution from time to time; provided that in the
event the Custodial Account or any Escrow Account is held in a depository
institution or trust company that ceases to be an Eligible Institution, the
Servicer shall transfer such Custodial Account or Escrow Account, as the case
may be, to an Eligible Institution. The Servicer shall give notice to the Master
Servicer of any change in the location of the Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall bear any expenses, losses or damages sustained by
the Master Servicer or the Trustee if the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow
Account are not demand deposit accounts.

         Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account may at the option of the
Servicer be invested in Eligible Investments. Any such Eligible Investment shall
mature no later than two (2) Business Days prior to the Remittance Date in each
month; provided, however, that if such Eligible Investment is an obligation of
an Eligible Institution (other than the Servicer) that maintains the Custodial
Account, then such Eligible Investment may mature on the related Remittance
Date. Any such Eligible Investment shall be made in the name of the Servicer in
trust for the benefit of the Trustee. All income on or gain realized from any
such Eligible Investment shall be for the benefit of the Servicer and may be
withdrawn at any time by the Servicer. Any losses incurred in respect of any
such investment shall be deposited in the Custodial Account, by the Servicer out
of its own funds immediately as realized. If, at any time, the amount on deposit
in the Custodial Account exceeds the amount of the applicable FDIC insurance,
such excess above the amount of the applicable FDIC insurance shall be invested
in Eligible Investments.

Section 3.11.     Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

         The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan hazard
insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by a
generally acceptable insurer acceptable under the Servicing Standard against
loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other hazards as are
customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located, in an amount
which is at least equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum insurable value of the
improvements securing such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the greater of (a) the
outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (b) an amount such that
the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor or the loss
payee from becoming a co-insurer.

         If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged
Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood
Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood
insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a generally acceptable insurance carrier acceptable under the
Servicing Standard in an amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i)
the minimum amount required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any
damage or loss on a replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the
mortgage if replacement cost coverage is not available for the type of building
insured) and (ii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available under the
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the
term of the Mortgage Loan, the Servicer determines in accordance with applicable
law and pursuant to the Servicing Standard that a Mortgaged Property is located
in a special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is
covered in an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended, the Servicer shall notify the related
Mortgagor that the Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if
said Mortgagor fails to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within
thirty (30) days after such notification, the Servicer shall immediately force
place the required flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

         The Servicer shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged Property
such other or additional insurance as may be required pursuant to such
applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in force and as shall
require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the requirements of any
private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to conform with the
Servicing Standard.

         In the event that the Master Servicer or the Servicer shall determine
that the Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards
and risks not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the
Mortgagor pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, the Servicer shall communicate
and consult with the Mortgagor with respect to the need for such insurance and
bring to the Mortgagor's attention the desirability of protection of the
Mortgaged Property.

         All policies required hereunder shall name the Servicer as loss payee
and shall be endorsed with standard or union mortgagee clauses, without
contribution, which shall provide for


                                      -21-
<PAGE>


at least 30 days prior written notice of any cancellation, reduction in amount
or material change in coverage.

         The Servicer shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of choice
in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent; provided, however, that the
Servicer shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance companies
unless such companies are generally acceptable under the Servicing Standard. The
Servicer shall determine that such policies provide sufficient risk coverage and
amounts, that they insure the property owner, and that they properly describe
the property address. The Servicer shall furnish to the Mortgagor a formal
notice of expiration of any such insurance in sufficient time for the Mortgagor
to arrange for renewal coverage by the expiration date.

         Pursuant to Section 3.04, any amounts collected by the Servicer under
any such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow Account and
applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property, or
property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be released to the
Mortgagor, in accordance with the Servicer's normal servicing procedures as
specified in Section 3.15) shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject
to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.06.

         Notwithstanding anything set forth in the preceding paragraph, the
Servicer agrees to indemnify the Trustee, the Certificateholders, the Master
Servicer and the Trust Fund for any claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines,
forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments and any other costs, fees
and expenses that any such indemnified party may sustain in any way related to
the failure of the Mortgagor (or the Servicer) to maintain hazard insurance or
flood insurance with respect to the related Mortgaged Property which complies
with the requirements of this section.

Section 3.12.     Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance.

         In the event that the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a blanket
policy insuring against losses arising from fire and hazards covered under
extended coverage on all of the Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy
provides coverage in an amount equal to the amount required pursuant to Section
3.11 and otherwise complies with all other requirements of Section 3.11, it
shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in
Section 3.11. Any amounts collected by the Servicer under any such policy
relating to a Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject
to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.05. Such policy may contain a deductible
clause, in which case, in the event that there shall not have been maintained on
the related Mortgaged Property a policy complying with Section 3.11, and there
shall have been a loss which would have been covered by such policy, the
Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account at the time of such loss the
amount not otherwise payable under the blanket policy because of such deductible
clause, such amount to deposited from the Servicer's funds, without
reimbursement therefor. Upon request of the Master Servicer or the Trustee, the
Servicer shall cause to be delivered to such person a certified true copy of
such policy and a statement from the insurer thereunder that such policy shall
in no event be terminated or materially modified without 30 days' prior written
notice to the Master Servicer and the Trustee.


                                      -22-
<PAGE>


Section 3.13.     Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
                  Insurance.

         The Servicer shall maintain with a carrier generally acceptable under
the Servicing Standard, at its own expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an
Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy, with broad coverage on all officers,
employees or other persons acting in any capacity requiring such persons to
handle funds, money, documents or papers relating to the Mortgage Loans
("Servicer Employees"). Any such Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond and
shall protect and insure the Servicer against losses, including forgery, theft,
embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and negligent acts of such Servicer
Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy also
shall protect and insure the Servicer against losses in connection with the
release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without having obtained payment in
full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No provision of this Section 3.13
requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall
diminish or relieve the Servicer from its duties and obligations as set forth in
this Agreement. The minimum coverage under any such bond and insurance policy
shall be at least equal to the corresponding amounts required by the Servicer.
Upon the request of the Master Servicer or the Trustee, the Servicer shall cause
to be delivered to such party a certified true copy of such fidelity bond and
insurance policy and a statement from the surety and the insurer that such
fidelity bond and insurance policy shall in no event be terminated or materially
modified without 30 days' prior written notice to the Master Servicer and the
Trustee.

Section 3.14.     Inspections.

         The Servicer shall inspect the Mortgaged Property as often as deemed
necessary by the Servicer under the Servicing Standard to assure itself that the
value of the Mortgaged Property is being preserved. In addition, the Servicer
shall inspect the Mortgaged Property and/or take such other actions as may be
necessary or appropriate in accordance with the Servicing Standard or as may be
required by the primary mortgage guaranty insurer. The Servicer shall keep a
written report of each such inspection.

Section 3.15.     Restoration of Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer need not obtain the approval of the Master Servicer or the
Trustee prior to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to
the Mortgagor to be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
Property if such release is in accordance with the Servicing Standard. At a
minimum, the Servicer shall comply with the following conditions in connection
with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds:

                           (i) the Servicer shall receive satisfactory
independent verification of completion of repairs and issuance of any required
approvals with respect thereto;

                           (ii) the Servicer shall take all steps necessary to
preserve the priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens; and


                                      -23-
<PAGE>


                           (iii) pending repairs or restoration, the Servicer
shall place the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow
Account.

Section 3.16.     Maintenance of PMI and/or LPMI Policy; Claims.

                  (a) The Servicer shall comply with all provisions of
applicable state and federal law relating to the cancellation of, or collection
of premiums with respect to, PMI Policies, including, but not limited to, the
provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, and all regulations
promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to time. The Servicer shall be
obligated to make premium payments with respect to (i) LPMI Policies, to the
extent of the LPMI Fee set forth on the Mortgage Loan Schedule with respect to
any LPMI Loans, which shall be paid out of the interest portion of the related
Monthly Payment or, if a Monthly Payment is not made, from the Servicer's own
funds and (ii) PMI Policies required to be maintained by the Mortgagor rather
than the Seller, if the Mortgagor is required but fails to pay any PMI Policy
premium, which shall be paid from the Servicer's own funds. Any premium payments
made by the Servicer from its own funds pursuant to this Section 3.16(a) shall
be recoverable by the Servicer as a Servicing Advance, subject to the
reimbursement provisions of Section 3.04(iii).

         With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than LPMI Loans) with a
loan-to-value ratio at origination in excess of 80%, the Servicer shall maintain
or cause the Mortgagor to maintain (to the extent that the Mortgage Loan
requires the Mortgagor to maintain such insurance) in full force and effect a
PMI Policy, and shall pay or shall cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium
thereon on a timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to
80%. In the event that such PMI Policy shall be terminated, the Servicer shall
obtain from another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a
total coverage equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy, at
substantially the same fee level. The Servicer shall not take any action which
would result in noncoverage under any applicable PMI Policy of any loss which,
but for the actions of the Servicer would have been covered thereunder. In
connection with any assumption or substitution agreements entered into or to be
entered into with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall promptly notify
the insurer under the related PMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or
substitution of liability in accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy and
shall take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to
the continuation of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI Policy is
terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the
Servicer shall obtain a replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

                  (b) With respect to each Mortgage Loan covered by a PMI Policy
or LPMI Policy, the Servicer shall take all such actions on behalf of the
Trustee as are necessary to service, maintain and administer the related
Mortgage Loan in accordance with such Policy and to enforce the rights under
such Policy. Except as expressly set forth herein, the Servicer shall have full
authority on behalf of the Trust Fund to do anything it deems appropriate or
desirable in connection with the servicing, maintenance and administration of
such Policy; provided that the Servicer shall not take any action to permit any
modification or assumption of a Mortgage Loan covered by a LPMI or PMI Policy,
or take any other action with respect to such Mortgage Loan, which would result
in non-coverage under such Policy of any loss which, but for actions of any
Servicer or the subservicer, would have been covered thereunder. If the
Qualified Insurer


                                      -24-
<PAGE>


fails to pay a claim under a LPMI or PMI Policy solely as a result of a breach
by the Servicer or subservicer of its obligations hereunder or under such
Policy, the Servicer shall be required to deposit in the Custodial Account on or
prior to the next succeeding Remittance Date an amount equal to such unpaid
claim from its own funds without any rights to reimbursement from the Trust
Fund. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Qualified Insurers and shall furnish
all reasonable evidence and information in the possession of the Servicer to
which the Servicer has access with respect to the related Mortgage Loan;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
LPMI Policy or PMI Policy, the Servicer shall not be required to submit any
reports to the related Qualified Insurer until a reporting date that is at least
15 days after the Servicer has received sufficient loan level information from
the Seller to appropriately code its servicing systems in accordance with the
Qualified Insurer's requirements.

                  (c) In connection with its activities as servicer, the
Servicer agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Trustee,
claims to the Qualified Insurer under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely
fashion in accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in
this regard, to take such action as shall be necessary to permit recovery under
any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Any amounts
collected by the Servicer under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.03(xii), subject to withdrawal
pursuant to Section 3.04.

                  (d) The Trustee shall furnish the Servicer with any powers of
attorney and other documents (within three (3) Business Days upon request from
the Servicer) in form as provided to it necessary or appropriate to enable the
Servicer to service and administer any PMI or LPMI Policy; provided, however,
that the Trustee shall not be liable for the actions of the Servicer under such
power of attorney.

                  (e) The Servicer shall deposit into the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 3.03(v) hereof all Insurance Proceeds received under the
terms of a PMI Policy or an LPMI Policy.

                  (f) Notwithstanding the provisions of (a) and (b) above, the
Servicer shall not take any action in regard to any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy
inconsistent with the interests of the Trustee or the Certificateholders or with
the rights and interests of the Trustee or the Certificateholders under this
Agreement.

Section 3.17.     Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property.

         In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in
foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be taken in the name of the Trustee or its nominee in trust for the
benefit of the Certificateholders, or in the event the Trustee is not authorized
or permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the REO Property
is located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax
laws of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be
taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an
Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Servicer from any attorney duly licensed to
practice law in the state where the REO Property is located. The Person


                                      -25-
<PAGE>


or Persons holding such title other than the Trustee shall acknowledge in
writing that such title is being held as nominee for the Trustee.

         The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO
Property for the Trustee solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and
sale. The Servicer, either itself or through an agent selected by the Servicer,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner
that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for
its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same
locality as the REO Property is managed. The Servicer shall attempt to sell the
same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than one year,
except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as the Servicer
deems to be in the best interest of the Trustee and the Certificateholders.

         If the Servicer hereafter becomes aware that a Mortgaged Property is an
Environmental Problem Property, the Servicer will notify the Master Servicer of
the existence of the Environmental Problem Property. Additionally, the Servicer
shall set forth in such notice a description of such problem, a recommendation
to the Master Servicer relating to the proposed action regarding the
Environmental Problem Property, and the Servicer shall carry out the
recommendation set forth in such notice unless otherwise directed by the Master
Servicer in writing within five (5) days after its receipt (or deemed receipt)
of such notice in accordance with the terms and provisions of Section 9.04
below. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall obtain the Master
Servicer's written consent to any expenditures proposed to remediate
Environmental Problem Properties or to defend any claims associated with
Environmental Problem Properties if such expenses, in the aggregate, are
expected to exceed $100,000. Failure to provide written notice of disapproval of
the expenditure within five (5) days of receipt (or deemed receipt) of such
request for prepaid expenditures shall be deemed an approval of such
expenditure. If the Servicer has received reliable instructions to the effect
that a Property is an Environmental Problem Property (e.g., Servicer obtains a
broker's price opinion which reveals the potential for such problem), the
Servicer will not accept a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure upon any such Property
without first obtaining a preliminary environmental investigation for the
Property satisfactory to the Master Servicer.

         In the event that the Trust Fund acquires any REO Property in
connection with a default or imminent default on a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer
shall dispose of such REO Property not later than the end of the third taxable
year after the year of its acquisition by the Trust Fund unless the Servicer has
applied for and received a grant of extension from the Internal Revenue Service
(and provide a copy of the same to the Master Servicer) to the effect that,
under the REMIC Provisions and any relevant proposed legislation and under
applicable state law, the applicable Trust REMIC may hold REO Property for a
longer period without adversely affecting the REMIC status of such REMIC or
causing the imposition of a federal or state tax upon such REMIC. If the
Servicer has received such an extension (and provided a copy of the same to the
Trustee and the Master Servicer), then the Servicer shall continue to attempt to
sell the REO Property for its fair market value for such period longer than
three years as such extension permits (the "Extended Period"). If the Servicer
has not received such an extension and the Servicer is unable to sell the REO
Property within the period ending three months before the end of such third
taxable year after its acquisition by the Trust Fund or if the Servicer has
received


                                      -26-

<PAGE>


such an extension, and the Servicer is unable to sell the REO Property within
the period ending three months before the close of the Extended Period, the
Servicer shall, before the end of the three-year period or the Extended Period,
as applicable, (i) purchase such REO Property at a price equal to the REO
Property's fair market value or (ii) auction the REO Property to the highest
bidder (which may be the Servicer) in an auction reasonably designed to produce
a fair price prior to the expiration of the three-year period or the Extended
Period, as the case may be. The Trustee shall (i) sign any document prepared and
delivered to it by the Servicer or (ii) take any other action, in each case
reasonably requested by the Servicer, which would enable the Servicer, on behalf
of the Trust Fund, to request such grant of extension.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no REO Property
acquired by the Trust Fund shall be held, rented (or allowed to continue to be
rented) or otherwise used by or on behalf of the Trust Fund in such a manner or
pursuant to any terms that would: (i) cause such REO Property to fail to qualify
as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code;
or (ii) subject any Trust REMIC to the imposition of any federal income taxes on
the income earned from such REO Property, including any taxes imposed by reason
of Sections 860F or 860G(c) of the Code, unless the Servicer has agreed to
indemnify and hold harmless the Trust Fund with respect to the imposition of any
such taxes.

         The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and hazard
insurance with extended coverage in amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property
and, to the extent required and available under the Flood Disaster Protection
Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount required above.

         The proceeds of sale of the REO Property shall be promptly deposited in
the Custodial Account. As soon as practical thereafter the expenses of such sale
shall be paid and the Servicer shall reimburse itself for any related
unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid Servicing Fees and unreimbursed advances
made pursuant to this Section or Section 4.03.

         The Servicer shall make advances of all funds necessary for the proper
operation, management and maintenance of the REO Property, including the cost of
maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to Section 3.11, such advances to be
reimbursed from the disposition or liquidation proceeds of the REO Property. The
Servicer shall make monthly distributions on each Remittance Date to the Master
Servicer of the net cash flow from the REO Property (which shall equal the
revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses described in this Section
3.17 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to time to be maintained
to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

Section 3.18.     Real Estate Owned Reports.

         Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section 4.02, the
Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer on or before the Remittance Date
in each month a statement with respect to any REO Property covering the
operation of such REO Property for the previous month and the Servicer's efforts
in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any rental of such


                                      -27-
<PAGE>


REO Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous month. That
statement shall be accompanied by such other information as the Master Servicer
shall reasonably request.

Section 3.19.     Liquidation Reports.

         Upon the foreclosure sale of any Mortgaged Property or the acquisition
thereof by the Trustee pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer
shall submit to the Trustee and the Master Servicer a monthly liquidation report
with respect to such Mortgaged Property. In addition, the Servicer shall provide
the Master Servicer a report setting forth Servicing Advances and other expenses
incurred connection with the liquidation of any Mortgage Loan.

Section 3.20.     Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of Mortgaged
                  Property.

         Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Servicer shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.

Section 3.21.     Prepayment Charges.

         The Servicer or any designee of the Servicer shall not waive any
Prepayment Charge with respect to any Mortgage Loan which contains a Prepayment
Charge which prepays during the term of the charge. If the Servicer or its
designee fails to collect the Prepayment Charge upon any prepayment of any
Mortgage Loan which contains a Prepayment Charge, the Servicer shall pay the
Trust Fund at such time (by deposit to the Custodial Account) an amount equal to
amount of the Prepayment Charge which was not collected. Notwithstanding the
above, the Servicer or its designee may waive (and shall waive, in the case of
(vi below) a Prepayment Charge without paying the Trust Fund the amount of the
Prepayment Charge if (i) the Mortgage Loan is in default (defined as 61 days or
more delinquent) and such waiver would maximize recovery of total proceeds
taking into account the value of such Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage
Loan, (ii) if the prepayment is not a result of a refinancing by the Servicer or
any of its affiliates and the Mortgage Loan is foreseen to be in default and
such waiver would maximize recovery of total proceeds taking into account the
value of such Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage Loan, (iii) the
collection of the Prepayment Charge would be in violation of applicable laws,
(iv) the collection of such Prepayment Charge would be considered "predatory"
pursuant to written guidance published or issued by any applicable federal,
state or local regulatory authority acting in its official capacity and having
jurisdiction over such matters (vi) notwithstanding any state or federal law to
the contrary, any Prepayment Charge in any instance when a Mortgage Loan is in
foreclosure.

Section 3.22.     Compliance with Safeguarding Customer Information
                  Requirements.

         The Servicer has implemented and will maintain security measures
designed to meet the objectives of the Interagency Guidelines Establishing
Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information published in final form on
February 1, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 8616, and the rules promulgated thereunder, as
amended from time to time (the "Guidelines"). The Servicer shall promptly
provide the Seller information regarding the implementation of such security
measures upon the reasonable request of the Seller.

                           PAYMENTS TO MASTER SERVICER

Section 4.01.     Remittances.

         On each Remittance Date, no later than 3:00 p.m. New York City time,
the Servicer shall remit on a scheduled/scheduled basis by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Master Servicer (a) all amounts deposited in
the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the last day of the related
Due Period (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 3.04), plus (b) all Monthly Advances, if any, which the
Servicer is obligated to make pursuant to Section 4.03, minus (c) any amounts
attributable to Principal Prepayments, Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds,
Condemnation Proceeds or REO Disposition Proceeds received after the applicable
Principal Prepayment Period, which amounts shall be remitted on the following
Remittance Date, together with any additional interest required to be deposited
in the Custodial Account in connection with such Principal Prepayment in
accordance with Section 3.03(vii), and minus (d) any amounts attributable to
Monthly Payments collected but due on a Due Date or Due Dates subsequent to the
first day of the month in which such Remittance Date occurs, which amounts shall
be remitted on the Remittance Date next succeeding the Due Date related to such
Monthly Payment.

         With respect to any remittance received by the Master Servicer after
the second Business Day following the Business Day on which such payment was
due, the Servicer shall pay to the Master Servicer interest on any such late
payment at an annual rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of
each change, plus three percentage points, but in no event greater than the
maximum amount permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be deposited in
the Custodial Account by the Servicer on the date such late payment is made and
shall cover the period commencing with the day following such second Business
Day and ending with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both
inclusive. Such interest shall be remitted along with the distribution payable
on the next succeeding Remittance Date. The payment by the Servicer of any such
interest shall not be deemed an extension of time for payment or a waiver of any
Event of Default by the Servicer.

         All remittances required to be made to the Master Servicer shall be
made to the following wire account or to such other account as may be specified
by the Master Servicer from time to time:

Section 4.02.     Statements to Master Servicer.

         Not later than the tenth (10th) calendar day of each month (or if such
tenth calendar day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business
Day), the Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer (i) a monthly remittance
advice in the format set forth in Exhibit D-1 hereto and a monthly defaulted
loan report in the format set forth in Exhibit D-2 hereto (or in such other
format mutually agreed to between the Servicer and the Master Servicer) relating
to the period ending on the last day of the preceding calendar month and (ii)
all such information required pursuant to clause (i) above on a magnetic tape or
other similar media reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer. The format of
this monthly reporting may be amended from time to time to the extent necessary
to comply with applicable law.

         Such monthly remittance advice shall also be accompanied with a
supplemental report provided to the Master Servicer and the Seller which
includes on an aggregate basis for the previous calendar month (i) the amount of
claims filed, (ii) the amount of any claim payments made, (iii) the amount of
claims denied or curtailed and (iv) policies cancelled with respect to those
Mortgage Loans covered by any PMI Policy purchased by Seller on behalf of the
Trust Fund. The Master Servicer will convert such data into a format acceptable
to the Trustee and provide monthly reports to the Trustee pursuant to the Trust
Agreement; provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained
in a PMI Policy, the Servicer shall not be required to submit any supplemental
reports including the foregoing data with respect to a PMI Policy until a
reporting date that is at least 15 days after the Servicer has received
sufficient loan level information from Seller to appropriately code its
servicing system in accordance with the PMI Insurer's requirements.

         Such monthly remittance advice shall also be accompanied by a
supplemental report provided to the Master Servicer, and the Seller which
includes on an aggregate basis for the previous calendar month (i) the amount of
claims filed on any LPMI Policy, (ii) the amount of any claim payments made on
any LPMI Policy, (iii) the amount of claims denied or curtailed on any LPMI
Policy and (iv) policies cancelled with respect to those Mortgage Loans covered
by any LPMI Policy purchased by the Seller on behalf of the Trust Fund.

         In addition, at the Master Servicer's request, not more than 60 days
after the end of each calendar year, commencing December 31, 2004, the Servicer
shall provide (as such information becomes reasonably available to the Servicer)
to the Master Servicer, such information concerning the Mortgage Loans and
annual remittances to the Master Servicer relating thereto as


                                      -30-

<PAGE>


is necessary for the Trustee to prepare the Trust Fund's federal income tax
return and for any investor in the Certificates to prepare any required tax
return. Such obligation of the Servicer shall be deemed to have been satisfied
to the extent that substantially comparable information shall be provided by the
Servicer to the Master Servicer and the Trustee pursuant to any requirements of
the Code as from time to time are in force. The Servicer shall also provide to
the Trustee such information as may be requested by it and required for the
completion of any tax reporting responsibility of the Trustee within such
reasonable time frame as shall enable the Trustee to timely file each Schedule Q
(or other applicable tax report or return) required to be filed by it.

Section 4.03.     Monthly Advances by Servicer.

         On the Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance Date, the
Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds or from
amounts held for future distribution, or both, an amount equal to all Monthly
Payments (with interest adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate) which
were due on the Mortgage Loans during the applicable Due Period and which were
delinquent at the close of business on the immediately preceding Determination
Date. Any amounts held for future distribution and so used shall be replaced by
the Servicer by deposit in the Custodial Account on or before any future
Remittance Date if funds in the Custodial Account on such Remittance Date shall
be less than remittances to the Master Servicer required to be made on such
Remittance Date. The Servicer shall keep appropriate records of such amounts and
will provide such records to the Master Servicer upon request.

         The Servicer's obligation to make such Monthly Advances as to any
Mortgage Loan will continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior to the
payment in full of the Mortgage Loan, or through the last Remittance Date prior
to the Remittance Date for the distribution of all Liquidation Proceeds and
other payments or recoveries (including Insurance Proceeds and Condemnation
Proceeds) with respect to the related Mortgage Loan.

Section 4.04.     Due Dates Other Than the First of the Month.

         Mortgage Loans having Due Dates other than the first day of a month
shall be accounted for as described in this Section 4.04. Any payment due on a
day other than the first day of each month shall be considered due on the first
day of the month following the month in which that payment is due as if such
payment were due on the first day of said month. For example, a payment due on
September 15 shall be considered to be due on October 1 of said month. Any
payment collected on a Mortgage Loan after the Cut-off Date shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account. For Mortgage Loans with Due Dates on the first day of
a month, deposits to the Custodial Account begin with the payment due on the
first of the month following the Cut-off Date.

Section 4.05.     Credit Reporting.

         For each Mortgage Loan, in accordance with its current servicing
practices, the Servicer will accurately and fully report its underlying borrower
credit files to each of three major national credit reporting agencies on a
monthly basis in a timely manner. In addition, with respect to any Mortgage Loan
serviced for a Fannie Mae pool, the Servicer shall transmit full


                                      -31-
<PAGE>


credit reporting data to each of such credit repositories in accordance with
Fannie Mae Guide Announcement 95-19 (November 20, 1995), a copy of which is
attached hereto as Exhibit G, reporting each of the following statuses, each
month with respect to a Mortgage Loan in a Fannie Mae pool: New origination,
current, delinquent (30-60-90-days, etc), foreclosed or charged off.


                                   ARTICLE V.

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

Section 5.01.     Transfers of Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer shall use its best efforts to enforce any "due-on-sale"
provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny assumption by
the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be sold
whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or not the
Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to
the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, exercise its rights to
accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause
applicable thereto; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not exercise such
rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if the exercise of such rights
would impair or threaten to impair any recovery under the related LPMI Policy,
if any.

         If the Servicer reasonably believes it is unable under applicable law
to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Servicer shall enter into (i) an
assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such property has
been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage
Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in the event the
Servicer is unable under applicable law to require that the original Mortgagor
remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Servicer has the prior consent of
the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of liability agreement
with the seller of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to which the original
Mortgagor is released from liability and the seller of the Mortgaged Property is
substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note. In
connection with any such assumption, none of the Mortgage Interest Rate borne by
the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan or the outstanding
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

         To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the Servicer shall
inquire diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee, and
shall use the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of the proposed
transferee which are used by the Servicer, its affiliates or Fannie Mae with
respect to underwriting mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans.
If the credit of the proposed transferee does not meet such underwriting
criteria, the Servicer diligently shall, to the extent permitted by the Mortgage
or the Mortgage Note and by applicable law, accelerate the maturity of the
Mortgage Loan.

Section 5.02.     Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage Files.

         Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt by the
Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a manner
customary for such purposes, the


                                      -32-
<PAGE>


Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer in the Monthly Remittance Advice as
provided in Section 4.02, and may request the release of any Mortgage Loan
Documents from the Seller in accordance with this Section 5.02 hereof.

         If the Servicer satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first having
obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or should
the Servicer otherwise prejudice any rights the Seller, the Trustee or the Trust
Fund may have under the mortgage instruments, the Servicer shall deposit into
the Custodial Account the entire outstanding principal balance, plus all accrued
interest on such Mortgage Loan, on the day preceding the Remittance Date in the
month following the date of such release. The Servicer shall maintain the
Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy as provided for in
Section 3.13 insuring the Servicer against any loss it may sustain with respect
to any Mortgage Loan not satisfied in accordance with the procedures set forth
herein.

Section 5.03.     Servicing Compensation.

         As consideration for servicing the Mortgage Loans subject to this
Agreement, the Servicer shall retain the relevant Servicing Fee for each
Mortgage Loan remaining subject to this Agreement during any month or part
thereof. Such Servicing Fee shall be payable monthly. Additional servicing
compensation in the form of Ancillary Income shall be retained by the Servicer
and is not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account. The obligation of
the Seller to pay the Servicing Fee is limited to, and the Servicing Fee is
payable solely from, the interest portion (including recoveries with respect to
interest from Liquidation Proceeds) of such Monthly Payment collected by the
Servicer.

         The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in
connection with its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to
reimbursement thereof except as specifically provided for herein.

Section 5.04.     Annual Audit Report.

         As soon as practicable in each year beginning with 2005, but in no
event later than March 15th of each year, the Servicer shall, at its own
expense, cause a firm of independent public accountants (who may also render
other services to the Servicer), which is a member of the American Institute of
Certified Public Accountants, to furnish to the Seller, the Trustee, the
Depositor and the Master Servicer (i) year-end audited (if available) financial
statements of the Servicer and (ii) a statement to the effect that such firm has
examined certain documents and records for the preceding fiscal year (or during
the period from the date of commencement of such Servicer's duties hereunder
until the end of such preceding fiscal year in the case of the first such
certificate) and that, on the basis of such examination conducted substantially
in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers
(or such other attestation program as may be required by applicable law or
regulation), such firm is of the opinion that the Servicer's overall servicing
operations have been conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation
Program for Mortgage Bankers (or such other attestation program as may be
required by applicable law or regulation) except for such exceptions that, in
the opinion of such


                                      -33-

<PAGE>


firm, the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers requires it to
report, in which case such exceptions shall be set forth in such statement.

Section 5.05.     Annual Officer's Certificate.

                  (a) On or before March 15th of each year, beginning with March
15, 2005, the Servicer, at its own expense, will deliver to the Seller, the
Trustee, the Depositor and the Master Servicer (i) a Servicing Officer's
certificate stating, as to each signer thereof, that (1) a review of the
activities of the Servicer during such preceding fiscal year and of performance
under this Agreement has been made under such officers' supervision, and (2) to
the best of such officers' knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has
fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement for such year, or, if there
has been a default in the fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each
such default known to such officers and the nature and status thereof including
the steps being taken by the Servicer to remedy such default or (ii) such other
certificates as may be required from an asset or mortgage servicer under
applicable law or regulation.

                  (b) For so long as a certificate under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
of 2002, as amended, ("Sarbanes-Oxley") is required to be given on behalf of the
Trust Fund, no later than March 15th of each year, beginning with March 15, 2005
(or if not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day), or at any
other time that the Master Servicer, the Trustee, and the Depositor are required
to provide a certificate pursuant to applicable law, an officer of the Servicer
shall execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate to the Master Servicer, the
Trustee, and the Depositor for the benefit of the Trust Fund and the Master
Servicer, the Trustee and the Depositor and their officers, directors and
affiliates, in the form of Exhibit E hereto.

Section 5.06.     Inspection.

         The Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer upon
five (5) Business Days' advance notice, during normal business hours, access to
all records maintained by the Servicer in respect of its rights and obligations
hereunder and access to officers of the Servicer responsible for such
obligations. Upon request, the Servicer shall furnish to the Trustee and the
Master Servicer its most recent publicly available financial statements and such
other information relating to its capacity to perform its obligations under this
Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE VI.

                   REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES AND AGREEMENTS

Section 6.01.     Representations, Warranties and Agreements of the Servicer.

         The Servicer, as a condition to the consummation of the transactions

                                      -34-

<PAGE>


licensed, qualified and in good standing in each state where a Mortgaged
Property is located if the laws of such state require licensing or qualification
in order to conduct business of the type conducted by the Servicer, and in any
event the Servicer is in compliance with the laws of any such state to the
extent necessary to ensure the enforceability of the terms of this Agreement;
the Servicer has the full corporate power and authority to execute and deliver
this Agreement and to perform in accordance herewith; the execution, delivery
and performance of this Agreement (including all instruments of transfer to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) by the Servicer and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized; this
Agreement evidences the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Servicer (except to the extent bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization,
fraudulent conveyance, or similar laws affect the enforcement of creditors'
rights generally) and all requisite corporate action has been taken by the
Servicer to make this Agreement valid and binding upon the Servicer in
accordance with its terms;

                  (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of
business of the Servicer;

                  (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the acquisition of the servicing responsibilities by the Servicer or
the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the fulfillment of or compliance with
the terms and conditions of this Agreement, will (i) conflict with or result in
a breach of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Servicer's charter
or by-laws or any legal restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the
Servicer is now a party or by which it is bound, (ii) constitute a default under
any of the foregoing, (iii) result in an acceleration under any of the
foregoing, (iv) result in the violation of any law, rule, regulation, order,
judgment or decree to which the Servicer or its property is subject or (v)
impair the ability of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans, or impair the
value of the Mortgage Loans;

                  (d) Ability to Perform. The Servicer does not believe, nor
does it have any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and
every covenant contained in this Agreement;

                  (e) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Servicer's knowledge, threatened
against the Servicer which, either in any one instance or in the aggregate, may
result in any material adverse change in the business, operations, financial
condition, properties or assets of the Servicer, or in any material impairment
of the right or ability of the Servicer to carry on its business substantially
as now conducted, or in any material liability on the part of the Servicer, or
which would draw into question the validity of this Agreement or of any action
taken or to be taken in connection with the obligations of the Servicer
contemplated herein, or which would be likely to impair materially the ability
of the Servicer to perform under the terms of this Agreement;

                  (f) No Consent Required. No consent, approval, authorization
or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the

<PAGE>


                  (g) No Default. The Servicer is not in default, and no event
or condition exists that after the giving of notice or lapse of time or both,
would constitute an event of default under any material mortgage, indenture,
contract, agreement, judgment, or other undertaking, to which the Servicer is a
party or which purports to be binding upon it or upon any of its assets, which
default could impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform under the
terms of this Agreement;

                  (h) Ability to Service. The Servicer is an approved
seller/servicer of conventional residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, with the facilities, procedures and experienced personnel necessary
for the sound servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage
Loans. The Servicer is in good standing to service mortgage loans for either
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and no event has occurred, including but not limited
to a change in insurance coverage, which would make the Servicer unable to
comply with either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac eligibility requirements or which
would require notification to either of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;

                  (i) No Untrue Information. Neither this Agreement nor any
statement, report or other document furnished or to be furnished pursuant to
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
contains any untrue statement of a material fact or omits to state a material
fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not misleading; and

                  (j) No Commissions to Third Parties. The Servicer has not
dealt with any broker or agent or anyone else who might be entitled to a fee or
commission in connection with this transaction other than the Seller.

Section 6.02.     Remedies for Breach of Representations and Warranties of the
                  Servicer.

         It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 6.01 shall survive the engagement of the Servicer to perform
the servicing responsibilities as of the Closing Date hereunder and the delivery
of the Servicing Files to the Servicer and shall inure to the benefit of the
Master Servicer and the Trustee. Upon discovery by either the Servicer, the
Master Servicer or the Trustee of a breach of any of the foregoing
representations and warranties which materially and adversely affects the
ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and obligations under this
Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects the value of the
Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority of the security interest
on such Mortgaged Property or the interests of the Master Servicer or the
Trustee, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to
the other.

         Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice to the
Servicer of any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 6.01
which materially and adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to perform
its duties and obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially and
adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the
priority of the security interest on such Mortgaged Property, the Servicer shall
use its best efforts promptly to cure such breach in all material respects and,
if such breach cannot be cured, the Servicer shall, at the Trustee's or the
Master Servicer's option, assign the Servicer's rights and obligations under
this Agreement (or respecting the affected Mortgage


                                      -36-

<PAGE>


Loans) to a successor servicer. Such assignment shall be made in accordance with
Sections 8.01 and 8.02.

         In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify the Master Servicer and the
Trustee and hold each of them harmless against any losses, damages, penalties,
fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs,
judgments, and other costs and expenses resulting from any claim, demand,
defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting from, a breach of
the Servicer's representations and warranties contained in Section 6.01.

         Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or arising out of
the breach of any representations and warranties made in Section 6.01 shall
accrue upon (i) discovery of such breach by the Servicer or notice thereof by
the Master Servicer, the Depositor or the Trustee to the Servicer, (ii) failure
by the Servicer to cure such breach within the applicable cure period, and (iii)
demand upon the Servicer by the Master Servicer or the Trustee for compliance
with this Agreement.

Section 6.03.     Additional Indemnification by the Servicer.

         The Servicer shall indemnify the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the
Trustee, and the Trust Fund and hold them harmless against any and all claims,
losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal
fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses
(collectively, the "Liabilities") that the indemnified party may sustain in any
way related to the failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the
Mortgage Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement (including but not
limited to its obligation to provide the certification pursuant to Section
5.05(b) hereunder) or for any inaccurate or misleading information provided in
the certification required pursuant to Section 5.05(b). The Servicer shall
immediately notify the Master Servicer, the Depositor and the Trustee if a claim
is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans
that may result in such Liabilities, and the Servicer shall assume (with the
prior written consent of the indemnified party) the defense of any such claim
and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, promptly
pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against
it or any indemnified party in respect of such claim and follow any written
instructions received from the such indemnified party in connection with such
claim. The Servicer shall be reimbursed promptly from the Trust Fund for all
amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding sentence except when the claim
is in any way related to the Servicer's indemnification pursuant to Section
6.02, or the failure of the Servicer to service and administer the Mortgage
Loans in accordance with the terms of this Agreement. In the event a dispute
arises between the Servicer and an indemnified party with respect to any of the
rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to this Agreement, and such
dispute is adjudicated in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or any other
judicial process, then the losing party (if the Trustee, the Trust Fund) shall
indemnify and reimburse the winning party for all attorney's fees and other
costs and expenses related to the adjudication of said dispute.

Section 6.04.     Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and Loss of
                  REMIC Status.

         In the event that any REMIC fails to qualify as a REMIC, loses its
status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result of a
prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC Provisions due
to the negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set
forth herein, the Servicer shall indemnify the Holder of the related Residual
Certificate, the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Trust Fund against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from
such negligence; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be liable for
any such Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Trustee, the
Master Servicer, the Depositor or the Holder of such Residual Certificate, as
applicable, nor for any such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by
the Holder of such Residual Certificate on which the Servicer has relied. The
foregoing shall not be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of
the Holder of such Residual Certificate, the Trustee and the Trust Fund now or
hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise. Notwithstanding the
foregoing, however, in no event shall the Servicer have any liability (1) for
any action or omission that is taken in accordance with and in compliance with
the express terms of, or which is expressly permitted by the terms of, this
Agreement, (2) for any Losses other than arising out of a negligent performance
by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set forth herein, and (3) for any
special or consequential damages to Certificateholders (in addition to payment
of principal and interest on the Certificates).

Section 6.05.     Reporting Requirements of the Commission and Indemnification.

         Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, the Servicer (i)
agrees to negotiate in good faith any amendment or modification (including an
indemnification agreed to in connection therewith) to this Agreement as may be
necessary, in the judgment of the Depositor and its counsel (as evidenced by an
opinion of such counsel addressed to the Servicer), to comply with any rules
promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the "Commission")
and any interpretations thereof by the staff of the Commission (collectively,
"SEC Rules") and (ii) with reasonable notice and upon written request, provide
to the Depositor for inclusion in any periodic report required to be filed under
the Securities and Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), such
items of information regarding this Agreement and matters related to the
Servicer, including as applicable (by way of example and not limitation), a
description of any material litigation or governmental action or proceeding
involving the Servicer or its affiliates (collectively, the "Servicer
Information"), provided, that such information shall be required to be provided
by the Servicer only to the extent that such shall be determined by the
Depositor and its counsel (as evidenced by an opinion of such counsel addressed
to the Servicer) to be necessary to comply with any SEC Rules.

Section 6.06.     [Reserved].

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                                  THE SERVICER

Section 7.01.     Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer.

         The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a corporation, and shall obtain and preserve its qualification to
do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform its
duties under this Agreement.

         Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or
any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which
the Servicer shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the business of the
Servicer, shall be the successor of the Servicer hereunder, without the
execution or filing of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the
parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding, provided,
however, that the successor or surviving Person shall be an institution (i)
having a net worth of not less than $25,000,000, and (ii) which is a Fannie Mae-
and Freddie Mac-approved servicer in good standing.

Section 7.02.     Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and Others.

         Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Master Servicer, the
Depositor or the Trustee for any action taken or for refraining from the taking
of any action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in
judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer
or any such person against any breach of warranties or representations made
herein, or failure to perform its obligations in strict compliance with any
standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any liability which would
otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly
executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.
The Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend
any legal action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage
Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it
in any expense or liability, provided, however, that the Servicer may undertake
any such action which it may deem necessary or desirable in respect of this
Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties hereto. In such event, the
Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement from the Trust Fund for the
reasonable legal expenses and costs of such action.

Section 7.03.     Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by the Servicer.

         This Agreement has been entered into with the Servicer in reliance upon
the independent status of the Servicer, and the representations as to the
adequacy of its servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and procedures,
its integrity, reputation and financial standing, and the continuance thereof.
Therefore, except as expressly provided in this Section 7.03 and Sections 3.21
and 7.01, the Servicer shall neither assign its rights under this Agreement or
the servicing


                                      -39-
<PAGE>


hereunder nor delegate its duties hereunder or any portion thereof, or sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets without,
in each case, the prior written consent of the Seller, the Master Servicer and
the Trustee which consent, in the case of an assignment of rights or delegation
of duties, shall be granted or withheld in the discretion of the Seller, the
Master Servicer and Trustee and which consent, in the case of a sale or
disposition of all or substantially all of the property or assets of the
Servicer, shall not be unreasonably withheld by any of them; provided, that in
each case, there must be delivered to the Seller, the Master Servicer and the
Trustee a letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that such transfer of
servicing or sale or disposition of assets will not result in a qualification,
withdrawal or downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates or
the NIMS Securities to be issued in the NIMS Transaction.

         The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Servicer, the Master Servicer and
the Trustee or upon the determination that its duties hereunder are no longer
permissible under applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the
Servicer. Any such determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer
shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the
Seller, the Master Servicer and the Trustee which Opinion of Counsel shall be in
form and substance reasonably acceptable to each of them. No such resignation
shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the Servicer's
responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in Sections
8.01 and 9.01.

         Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 7.03, in the
event that the Servicer either shall assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property
or assets, except to the extent permitted by and in accordance with this Section
7.03 and Sections 3.21 and 7.01, without the prior written consent of the
Seller, the Master Servicer and the Trustee, then such parties shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set forth in Section
8.01, without any payment of any penalty or damages and without any liability
whatsoever to the Servicer or any third party.


                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                                   TERMINATION

Section 8.01.     Termination for Cause.

                  (a) Any of the following occurrences shall constitute an event

remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the Master Servicer; or

part of the Servicer set forth in this Agreement which continues unremedied for
a period of thirty (30) days (or seven (7) days with respect to Servicer's
covenants and agreements set forth in Sections 5.04 and 5.05) after the date on
which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be remedied, shall
have been given to the Servicer by the Master Servicer; or

                           (iii) failure by the Servicer to maintain its license
to do business or service residential mortgage loans in any jurisdiction where
the Mortgaged Properties are located, where the failure to maintain such license
will have a material adverse effect on the Servicer's ability to service the
Mortgage Loans; or

                           (iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or
supervisory authority having jurisdiction for the appointment of a conservator
or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt, including
bankruptcy, marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings, or for
the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall have been entered against
the Servicer and such decree or order shall have remained in force undischarged
or unstayed for a period of 60 days; or

                           (v) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of
a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
marshalling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or relating to
the Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially all of its property; or

                           (vi) the Servicer shall admit in writing its
inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take
advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization statute,
make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, voluntarily suspend payment
of its obligations or cease its normal business operations for three Business
Days; or

                           (vii) the Servicer ceases to meet the qualifications
of a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac seller/servicer;

                           (viii) the Servicer attempts to assign the servicing

Servicer attempts to sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of
its property or assets or to assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or to delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof in a manner not permitted under this Agreement;

                           (ix) if (x) any of the Rating Agencies reduces or
withdraws the rating of any of the Certificates due to a reason attributable to
the Servicer or (y) the Servicer's residential primary servicer rating for
servicing of subprime loans issued by any of the Rating Agencies is reduced by
more than one level from the level in effect on the Closing Date; or

                           (x) the net worth of the Servicer shall be less than
$25,000,000.



                                      -41-

<PAGE>


         In each and every such case, so long as an Event of Default shall not
have been remedied, in addition to whatsoever rights the Master Servicer or the
Trustee may have at law or equity to damages, including injunctive relief and
specific performance, the Master Servicer or the Trustee, by notice in writing
to the Servicer, may terminate all the rights and obligations of the Servicer
under this Agreement and in and to the servicing contract established hereby and
the proceeds thereof.

         Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Mortgage
Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in a successor servicer
appointed by the Trustee or the Master Servicer, as the case may be, with the
consent of the other party. Upon written request from the Master Servicer, the
Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity designated
by the Master Servicer any and all documents and other instruments, place in
such successor's possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all
other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer and endorsement
or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, at the Servicer's
sole expense. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Seller, the Master Servicer,
the Trustee and such successor in effecting the termination of the Servicer's
responsibilities and rights hereunder, including without limitation, the
transfer to such successor for administration by it of all cash amounts which
shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow
Account or thereafter received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

         By a written notice, the Trustee or the Master Servicer, with the
consent of the other parties, may waive any default by the Servicer in the
performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences. Upon any waiver
of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any Event of Default
arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for every purpose of
this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any or other default or impair
any right consequent thereon except to the extent expressly so waived.

Section 8.02.     Termination Without Cause.

         This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the last Mortgage
Loan to the Master Servicer (or advances by the Servicer for the same), and (b)
the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon foreclosure of the last
Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all funds due hereunder, or (ii) mutual
consent of the Servicer, the Seller and the Master Servicer in writing provided
such termination is also acceptable to the Rating Agencies or (iii) with respect
to some or all of the Mortgage Loans, at the sole option of the Seller, without
cause, upon sixty (60) days written notice, subject to the limitations set forth
below. Any such notice of termination shall be in writing and delivered to the
Trustee, the Master Servicer, and the Servicer by registered mail to the address
set forth in Section 9.04 of this Agreement. The Servicer shall comply with the
termination procedures set forth in Sections 8.01, 8.02 and 9.01 hereof.

         In the event the Seller terminates the Servicer without cause with
respect to some or all of the Mortgage Loans (other than Distressed Mortgage
Loans), the Seller shall be required to pay to the Servicer as a Termination Fee
a sum equal to a percentage of the unpaid principal balance


                                      -42-

<PAGE>


of the Mortgage Loans, as follows: 2.50% for any Mortgage Loans where the
related mortgaged property is located in the States of New York, New Jersey or
Connecticut; 2.00% for all other Mortgage Loans. All unreimbursed Servicing
Fees, Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances owing to the Servicer relating to
such terminated Mortgage Loans (other than Distressed Mortgage Loans) shall be
reimbursed and paid to the Servicer at the time of such termination by the
Seller.

Section 8.03.     [Reserved]

Section 8.04.     Termination for Distressed Mortgage Loans.

                  (a) Subject to the requirements set forth in this Section
8.04, the Seller may terminate this Agreement with the prior consent of the
Trustee and the Master Servicer, with respect to the servicing of those Mortgage
Loans that are determined to be Distressed Mortgage Loans and in such event
servicing of such Mortgage Loans shall be transferred to the Special Servicer.
The appointment of a Special Servicer by the Seller and the execution of a
special servicing agreement between the Seller and the Special Servicer shall be
subject to the consent of the Trustee and the Master Servicer and the receipt of
confirmation from the Rating Agencies that the transfer of servicing to the
Special Servicer shall not result in a reduction of any rating previously given
by such Rating Agency to any Certificate or the NIMS Securities. Any monthly fee
paid to the Special Servicer in connection with any Mortgage Loan serviced by
such Special Servicer shall not exceed one-twelfth of the product of (a) 0.50%
and (b) the outstanding principal balance of such Mortgage Loan. All
unreimbursed Servicing Fees, Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances owing to
the Servicer relating to such Distressed Mortgage Loans shall be reimbursed and
paid to the Servicer by the successor Special Servicer upon such transfer to the
Special Servicer.

                  (b) All reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection
with a transfer of servicing to the Special Servicer including, without
limitation, the costs and expenses of the Trustee, the Servicer or any other
Person in connection with such transfer including the transfer of the Servicing
Files and the other necessary data to the Special Servicer, shall be paid by the
Seller from its own funds without reimbursement. The Seller shall be responsible
for the delivery of all required transfer notices and will send a copy of the
transfer notice to the Trustee.

                  (c) No Termination Fee shall be payable to the Servicer upon a
termination pursuant to this Section 8.04.


                                   ARTICLE IX.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

Section 9.01.     Successor to the Servicer.

         Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities
and duties under this Agreement (a) pursuant to Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.01 or
8.02, the Master Servicer shall (i) within 90 days of the Servicer's notice of
such termination, succeed to and assume all of the Servicer's responsibilities,
rights, duties and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a


                                      -43-

<PAGE>


successor having the characteristics set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of
Section 7.01 and which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement
simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties
and liabilities under this Agreement; or (b) pursuant to a termination under
Section 8.02(iii) or Section 8.03, the Seller shall appoint a successor having
the characteristics set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01 and which
shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties and
liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement simultaneously with the
termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and liabilities under
this Agreement. Any successor to the Servicer shall be subject to the approval
of the Master Servicer. Any approval of a successor servicer by the Master
Servicer and, to the extent required by the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, shall,
if the successor servicer is not at that time a servicer of other Mortgage Loans
for the Trust Fund, be conditioned upon the receipt by the Master Servicer, the
Seller and the Trustee of a letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that
such transfer of servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or
downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates. In connection
with such appointment and assumption, the Master Servicer or the Seller, as
applicable, may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor
out of payments on Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree,
provided, however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that
permitted the Servicer under this Agreement. In the event that the Servicer's
duties, responsibilities and liabilities under this Agreement should be
terminated pursuant to the aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge
such duties and responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires
knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof with the same
degree of diligence and prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this
Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice
the rights or financial condition of its successor. The resignation or removal
of the Servicer pursuant to the aforementioned sections shall not become
effective until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to this Section 9.01 and
shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the representations and warranties
made pursuant to Sections 6.01 and the remedies available to the Master
Servicer, the Trustee and the Seller under Sections 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04, it
being understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections 6.01, 6.02,
6.03 and 6.04 shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such
resignation or termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this
Agreement. Neither the Master Servicer, in its capacity as successor servicer,
nor any other successor servicer shall be responsible for the lack of
information and/or documents that it cannot otherwise obtain through reasonable
efforts.

         Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than 30 days
of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall prepare, execute
and deliver to the successor entity any and all documents and other instruments,
place in such successor's possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be
done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
such notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer of any
Mortgage Notes and the related documents. The Servicer shall cooperate with the
Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Seller, as applicable, and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

<PAGE>


         Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer, the Master Servicer and the Seller an
instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the successor shall make the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.01 and provide for the
same remedies set forth in Sections 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04 herein and (ii) an
assumption of the due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant
and condition to be performed and observed by the Servicer under this Agreement,
whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers,
duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Servicer, with like
effect as if originally named as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or
resignation of the Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.01, 8.02 or 8.04 shall not affect any claims that the
Seller, the Master Servicer or the Trustee may have against the Servicer arising
out of the Servicer's actions or failure to act prior to any such termination or
resignation. In addition, in the event any successor servicer is appointed
pursuant to Section 8.02(iii) of this Agreement, such successor servicer must
satisfy the conditions relating to the transfer of servicing set forth in the
Trust Agreement.

         The Servicer shall deliver promptly to the successor servicer the funds
in the Custodial Account and Escrow Account and all Mortgage Loan documents and
related documents and statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer shall
account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such
other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and definitively vest
in the successor all such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations
and liabilities of the Servicer.

         Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, it shall notify
the Trustee, the Seller and Master Servicer and the Depositor of such
appointment in accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 9.04.

Section 9.02.     Costs.

         The Seller shall pay the legal fees and expenses of its attorneys.
Costs and expenses incurred in connection with the transfer of the servicing
responsibilities, including fees for delivering Servicing Files, shall be paid
by (i) the terminated or resigning servicer if such termination or resignation
is a result of an occurrence of a termination event under Section 8.01, (ii) the
related Seller if such termination is pursuant to Section 8.02(iii) and (iii) in
all other cases by the Trust Fund. Subject to Section 2.02, the Seller, on
behalf of the Depositor, shall pay the costs associated with the preparation,
delivery and recording of Assignments of Mortgages.

Section 9.03.     Protection of Confidential Information.

         The Servicer shall keep confidential and shall not divulge to any
party, without the Seller's prior written consent, any nonpublic information
pertaining to the Mortgage Loans or any borrower thereunder, except to the
extent that it is appropriate for the Servicer to do so in working with legal
counsel, subservicers, special servicers, auditors, taxing authorities or other
governmental agencies.

addressee.

Section 9.05.     Severability Clause.

         Any part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which
is prohibited or which is held to be void or unenforceable shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof. Any part, provision, representation or warranty of
this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable or is held to be void or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective, as to such jurisdiction,
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction as to any Mortgage Loan shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law which prohibits
or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof. If the invalidity of any
part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement shall deprive any
party of the economic benefit intended to be conferred by this Agreement, the
parties shall negotiate, in good-faith, to develop a structure the economic
effect of which is as close as possible to the economic effect of this Agreement
without regard to such invalidity.

Section 9.06.     Covenant Against Solicitation.

         For as long as the Servicer services the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer
covenants that it will not, and that they will ensure that their affiliates and
agents, will not, directly solicit or provide information for any other party to
solicit for prepayment or refinancing of any of the Mortgage Loans by the
related mortgagors; provided, however, that the Servicer may solicit any
Mortgagor for whom the Servicer has received a request for payoff, or a written
or verbal communication from such Mortgagor indicating a desire to prepay the
related Mortgage Loan (other than as a result of direct solicitation); provided
further that, it is understood and agreed that promotions undertaken by the
Servicer or any of its affiliates which (i) concern optional insurance products
(excluding single premium credit life insurance) or other financial products or
services, excluding any mortgage related products such second mortgage products
(including HELOCs), or (ii) are directed to the general public at large or
certain segments thereof exclusive of the Mortgagors as a targeted group and,
including mass mailings based on commercially acquired mailing lists, newspaper,
radio and television advertisements shall not constitute solicitation under this
Section, nor is the Servicer prohibited from responding to unsolicited requests
or inquiries made by a Mortgagor.

Section 9.07.     Counterparts.

counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument.

Section 9.08.     Place of Delivery and Governing Law.

         This Agreement shall be deemed in effect when a fully executed
counterpart thereof is received by the Seller in the State of New York and shall

agreements as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this
Agreement.

Section 9.10.     Intention of the Parties.

         It is the intention of the parties that the Seller is conveying, and
the Servicer is receiving only a contract for servicing the Mortgage Loans.
Accordingly, the parties hereby acknowledge that the Trust Fund remains the sole
and absolute owner of the Mortgage Loans (other than the servicing rights) and
all rights related thereto.

Section 9.11.     Successors and Assigns; Assignment of Servicing Agreement.

         This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be

or hypothecated by the Servicer to a third party except in accordance with
Section 7.03 and shall not be assigned, pledged or hypothecated by the Seller.

Section 9.12.     Assignment by The Seller.

         The Seller shall assign (exclusive of the Seller's rights arising under
Section 8.02(iii) and 8.03), its interest under this Agreement to the Depositor,
which in turn shall assign such rights to the Trustee, and the Trustee then
shall succeed to all rights of the Seller under this Agreement.

Section 9.13.     Amendment.

         This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the Servicer and the
Seller, with (i) the prior written consent of the Trustee and (ii) the written

<PAGE>


Servicer, the Seller and the Servicer; provided that the party requesting such
amendment shall, at its own expense, provide the Trustee, the Master Servicer
and the Seller with an Opinion of Counsel that such amendment will not
materially adversely affect the interest of the Certificateholders in the
Mortgage Loans or the NIM Securities to be issued in the NIMS Transaction. Any
such amendment shall be deemed not to adversely affect in any material respect
any the interest of the Certificateholders in the Mortgage Loans, if the Trustee
receives written confirmation from each Rating Agency that such amendment will
not cause such Rating Agency to reduce, qualify or withdraw the then current
rating assigned to the Certificates (and any Opinion of Counsel received by the
Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Seller in connection with any such
amendment may rely expressly on such confirmation as the basis therefore);
provided, however, this Agreement may be amended by the Servicer, the Seller,
the Master Servicer and the Trustee from time to time without the delivery of an
Opinion of Counsel described above to the extent necessary, in the judgment of
the seller and its counsel, to comply with the SEC Rules.

Section 9.14.     Waivers.

         No term or provision of this Agreement may be waived or modified unless

         The exhibits to this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part
hereof and are an integral part of this Agreement.

Section 9.16.     Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.

         Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the parties to
this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in furtherance of the intent of
such parties as set forth herein, that the Trustee receive the benefit of the
provisions of this Agreement as intended third party beneficiaries of this
Agreement to the extent of such provisions. The Servicer shall have the same
obligations to the Trustee as if it were a party to this Agreement, and the
Trustee shall have the same rights and remedies to enforce the provisions of
this Agreement as if they were parties to this Agreement. The Servicer shall
only take direction from the Master Servicer (if direction by the Master
Servicer is required under this Agreement) unless otherwise directed by this
Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights and obligations of the
Trustee and the Master Servicer hereunder (other than the right to
indemnification) shall terminate upon the termination of the Trust Fund pursuant
to the Trust Agreement .

SUBJECT  "Full-File" Reporting to Credit Repositories

Part IV, Section 107, of the servicing Guide currently requires servicers to
report only 90-day delinquencies to the four major credit repositories. To
ensure that the repositories have up-to-date information for both servicing and
origination activity, we have decided to begin requiring -- as of the month
ending March 31, 1996 -- servicers to provide the credit repositories a
"full-file" status report for the mortgages they service for us.

"Full-file" reporting requires that servicers submit a monthly report to each of
the credit repositories to describe the exact status for each mortgage they
service for us. The status reported generally should be the one in effect as of
the last business day of each month. Servicers may, however, use a slightly
later cut-off date -- for example, at the and of the first week of a month -- to
assure that payment corrections, returned checks, and other adjustments related
to the previous month's activity can be appropriately reflected in their report
for that month. Statuses that must be reported for any given mortgage include
the following: new origination, current, delinquent (30-, 60-, 90-days, etc.),
foreclosed, and charged-off. (The credit repositories will provide the
applicable codes for reporting these statuses to them.) A listing of each of the
major repositories to which "full-file" status reports must be sent is attached.

Servicers are responsible for the complete and accurate reporting of mortgage
status information to the repositories and for resolving any disputes that arise
about the information they report. Servicers must respond promptly to any
inquiries from borrowers regarding specific mortgage status information about
them that was reported to the credit repositories.

Servicers should contact their Customer Account Team in their lead Fannie Mae
regional office if they have any questions about this expanded reporting
requirement.

                        RECONSTITUTED SERVICING AGREEMENT

         THIS RECONSTITUTED SERVICING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), entered into
as of the 1st day of November, 2004, by and between LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Seller"), and FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF NEVADA,
a national banking association (the "Servicer"), having an office at 7373 North

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Seller has conveyed certain Mortgage Loans identified on
Exhibit C hereto (the "Serviced Mortgage Loans") to Structured Asset Securities
Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation ("SASCO") pursuant to a
Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement dated as of November 1, 2004 (the
"Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement"), which in turn has conveyed the
Serviced Mortgage Loans to the Trustee, pursuant to a trust agreement, dated as
of November 1, 2004 (the "Trust Agreement"), among the Trustee, Aurora, as
master servicer (together with any successor master servicer appointed pursuant
to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the "Master Servicer"), and SASCO.

         WHEREAS, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB ("Lehman Brothers Bank") acquired
the Serviced Mortgage Loans from the Servicer, which Serviced Mortgage Loans
were either originated or acquired by the Servicer pursuant to the Master
Mortgage Loan Purchase and Warranties Agreement, dated as of August 27, 2004
(the "Purchase Agreement"), and annexed as Exhibit B hereto.

         WHEREAS, the Serviced Mortgage Loans are currently being serviced by
the Servicer for Lehman Brothers Bank pursuant to a Master Interim Servicing
Agreement for Conventional Fixed and Adjustable Rate Residential Mortgage Loans,
dated as of September 24, 2004 (the "Master Interim Servicing Agreement"), by
and between Lehman Brothers Bank and the Servicer.

         WHEREAS, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as
of November 1, 2004 (the "Assignment and Assumption Agreement") and annexed
hereto as Exhibit F, Lehman Brothers Bank has assigned all of its rights, title
and interest in the Serviced Mortgage Loans as well as all of its rights and
obligations as purchaser under the Purchase Agreement and the Master Interim
Servicing Agreement to the Seller, and the Seller has accepted such assignment.

         WHEREAS, the Seller desires that the Servicer continue to service the
Serviced Mortgage Loans, and the Servicer has agreed to do so, subject to the
rights of the Seller (with the consent of the Master Servicer) to terminate the
rights and obligations of the Servicer hereunder at any time without cause and
to the other conditions set forth herein.

         WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer agree that the provisions of the
Master Interim Servicing Agreement shall continue to apply to the Serviced
Mortgage Loans, but only to the extent provided herein and that this Agreement
shall govern the Serviced Mortgage Loans for so long as such Serviced Mortgage
Loans remain subject to the provisions of the Trust Agreement and until the
Transfer Date.

         WHEREAS, the Seller and Servicer agree that on the Transfer Date the
Servicer shall no longer service the Mortgage Loans and shall transfer servicing
of the Mortgage Loans to the successor servicer designated by the Seller herein.

<PAGE>

         WHEREAS, the Master Servicer and any successor master servicer shall be
obligated, among other things, to supervise the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Trustee, and shall have the right under the
conditions specified herein to terminate for cause the rights and obligations of
the Servicer under this Agreement.

         WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer intend that each of the Master
Servicer and the Trustee is an intended third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter
set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Seller and the Servicer hereby
agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

         1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this
Agreement, including Exhibit A hereto and any provisions of the Master Interim
Servicing Agreement incorporated by reference herein (regardless of whether such
terms are defined in the Master Interim Servicing Agreement or the Purchase
Agreement), shall have the meanings ascribed to such terms in the Trust
Agreement.

         2. Custodianship. The parties hereto acknowledge that U.S. Bank
National Association will act as custodian of the Serviced Mortgage Files for
the Trustee pursuant to a Custodial Agreement, dated November 1, 2004, between
U.S. Bank National Association and the Trustee.

         3. Servicing Transfer Date. The Servicer agrees, with respect to the
Serviced Mortgage Loans, to perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and
obligations that are to be performed and observed under the provisions of the
Master Interim Servicing Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein and on
Exhibit A hereto, and that the provisions of the Master Interim Servicing
Agreement, as so modified, are and shall be a part of this Agreement to the same
extent as if set forth herein in full. The parties hereto acknowledge and agree
that the Transfer Date with respect to the Mortgage Loans is January 2, 2005. On
such date, the Servicer shall transfer all servicing of the Mortgage Loans in
accordance with the Master Interim Servicing Agreement and the Purchase
Agreement to the successor servicer designated by the Seller. The Seller hereby
designates Aurora to act as the Servicer of the Mortgage Loans on and after the
Transfer Date and to service such Mortgage Loans pursuant to an existing
servicing agreement between the Seller and Aurora.

         4. Trust Cut-off Date. The parties hereto acknowledge that by operation
of Subsection 2.05 and Subsection 3.01 of the Master Interim Servicing
Agreement, the remittance on December18, 2004 to the Trust Fund is to include
principal due after November 1, 2004 (the "Trust Cut-off Date") plus interest,
at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate collected during the related Due Period
exclusive of any portion thereof allocable to a period prior to the Trust
Cut-off Date, with the adjustments specified in clause (b) of Subsection 3.01 of
the Master Interim Servicing Agreement.

         5. Servicing Fee. The parties hereto acknowledge that with respect to
each Serviced Mortgage Loan and for each period of one full month during the
period commencing with the Cut-off Date (as defined in the Trust Agreement) and
ending with the Servicing Transfer Date (i.e., the date selected by mutual
agreement of the parties for the transfer of the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans to Aurora, but no later than January 2, 2005), the Servicing Fee
for purposes of this Agreement shall equal one-twelfth of the product of (a) the
Servicing Fee Rate of 0.25% and (b) the outstanding principal balance of each
Serviced Mortgage Loan. Such fee shall be computed monthly on the same principal


                                      -2-
<PAGE>


amount and period respecting which any related interest payment on such Serviced
Mortgage Loan is computed. The obligation of the Trust Fund to pay such
Servicing Fee is payable solely from the interest portion (including recoveries
with respect to interest from Liquidation Proceeds, to the extent permitted by
Section 2.05 of the Master Interim Servicing Agreement) of the Monthly Payment
collected by the Servicer or as otherwise provided under Section 2.05.

         6. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including
any successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the
Master Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the
Servicer services the Serviced Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the
SASCO 2004-22 Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") created pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, shall have the same rights as Lehman Brothers Bank under the Master
Interim Servicing Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the
Master Interim Servicing Agreement and the term "Purchaser" as used in the
Master Interim Servicing Agreement in connection with any rights of the
Purchaser shall refer to the Trust Fund or, as the context requires, the Master
Servicer acting in its capacity as agent for the Trust Fund, except as otherwise
specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to
terminate the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement upon
the failure of the Servicer to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement, which failure results in an Event of Default as provided in Article
XI of the Master Interim Servicing Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, in no event shall the Master Servicer assume any of the
obligations of Lehman Brothers Bank under the Master Interim Servicing Agreement
and in connection with the performance of the Master Servicer's duties
hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto agree that the Master
Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections and limitations of
liability afforded to the Master Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

         7. No Representations. Neither the Servicer nor the Master Servicer
shall be obligated or required to make any representations and warranties
regarding the characteristics of the Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement and issuance of the
Certificates issued pursuant thereto.

         8. Notices. All notices and communications between or among the parties
hereto (including any third party beneficiary thereof) or required to be

1.   A new definition of "Best Efforts" is hereby added to Article I to
     immediately follow the definition of "Appropriate Federal Banking Agency",
     to read as follows:

          "Best Efforts": Efforts determined to be reasonably diligent by the
          Servicer in its sole discretion. Such efforts do not require the
          Servicer to enter into any litigation, arbitration or other legal or
          quasi-legal proceeding, nor do they require the Servicer to advance or
          expend fees or sums of money in addition to those specifically set
          forth in this Agreement.

2.   The definition of "Due Period" is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
     follows:

          of such Remittance Date.

3.   The definition of "Eligible Investments" in Article I is hereby amended in
     its entirety to read as follows:

          "Eligible Investments": Any one or more of the obligations and
          securities listed below which investment provides for a date of
          maturity not later than the Determination Date in each month:

               (i) direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed as to
          timely payment of principal and interest by, the United States of
          America or any agency or instrumentality of the United States of
          America the obligations of which are backed by the full faith and
          credit of the United States of America ("Direct Obligations");

               (ii) federal funds, or demand and time deposits in, certificates
          of deposits of, or bankers' acceptances issued by, any depository
          institution or trust company (including U.S. subsidiaries of foreign
          depositories and the Trustee or any agent of the Trustee, acting in
          its respective commercial capacity) incorporated or organized under
          the laws of the United States of America or any state thereof and
          subject to supervision and examination by federal or state banking
          authorities, so long as at the time of investment or the contractual
          commitment providing for such investment the commercial paper or other
          short-term debt obligations of such depository institution or trust
          company (or, in the case of a depository institution or trust company
          which is the principal subsidiary of a holding company, the commercial
          paper or other short-term debt or deposit obligations of such holding
          company or deposit institution, as the case may be) have been rated by
          each Rating Agency in its highest short-term rating category or one of
          its two highest long-term rating categories;

               (iii) repurchase agreements collateralized by Direct Obligations
          or securities guaranteed by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac with
          any registered broker/dealer subject to Securities Investors'
          Protection Corporation jurisdiction or any commercial bank insured by
          the FDIC, if such broker/dealer or bank has an uninsured, unsecured
          and


                                      A-2

          short-term rating category;

               (iv) securities bearing interest or sold at a discount issued by
          any corporation incorporated under the laws of the United States of
          America or any state thereof which have a credit rating from each

          providing for such investment, at least equal to one of the two
          highest long-term credit rating categories of each Rating Agency;
          provided, however, that securities issued by any particular
          corporation will not be Eligible Investments to the extent that
          investment therein will cause the then outstanding principal amount of
          securities issued by such corporation and held as part of the Trust
          Fund to exceed 20% of the sum of the aggregate principal balance of
          the Mortgage Loans; provided, further, that such securities will not
          be Eligible Investments if they are published as being under review
          with negative implications from any Rating Agency;

               (v) commercial paper (including both non-interest-bearing
          discount obligations and interest-bearing obligations payable on

          short-term rating category;

               (vi) a Qualified GIC;

               (vii) certificates or receipts representing direct ownership
          interests in future interest or principal payments on obligations of
          the United States of America or its agencies or instrumentalities
          (which obligations are backed by the full faith and credit of the
          United States of America) held by a custodian in safekeeping on behalf
          of the holders of such receipts; and

               (viii) any other demand, money market, common trust fund or time
          deposit or obligation, or interest-bearing or other security or
          investment, (A) rated in the highest rating category by each Rating
          Agency or (B) that would not adversely affect the then current rating
          by each Rating Agency of any of the Certificates. Such investments in
          this subsection (viii) may include money market mutual funds or common
          trust funds, including any fund for which the Trustee, the Master
          Servicer or an affiliate thereof serves as an investment advisor,
          administrator, shareholder servicing agent, and/or custodian or
          subcustodian, notwithstanding that (x) the Trustee, the Master

          expenses for services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, and (z)
          services performed for such funds and pursuant to this Agreement may
          converge at any time; provided, however, that no such instrument shall
          be an Eligible Investment if such instrument evidences either (i) a
          right to receive only interest payments with respect to the
          obligations underlying such instrument, or (ii) both principal and
          interest payments derived from obligations underlying such instrument
          and the principal and interest payments with respect to such
          instrument provide a yield to maturity of greater than 120% of the
          yield to maturity at par of such underlying obligations.

4.   A definition of "Ginnie Mae" is hereby added to Article I to immediately
     follow the definition of "Fidelity Bond," to read as follows:

8.   A new definition of "Principal Prepayment" is hereby added to Article I to

          under such contract or surety bond without the necessity of taking any
          action by any other Person;

               (c) provide that if at any time the then current credit standing
          of the obligor under such guaranteed investment contract is such that
          continued investment pursuant to such contract of funds would result
          in a downgrading of any rating of the Servicer, the Servicer shall
          terminate such contract without penalty and be entitled to the return

          (i) by deleting the first sentence of the second paragraph of such
     section and replacing it with the following:

     Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller may waive, modify
     or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of any
     such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the
     Seller's reasonable and prudent determination such waiver, modification,
     postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Purchaser,
     provided, however, that unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to
     the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the Seller,
     imminent, the Seller shall not permit any modification with respect to any
     Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate, forgive the
     payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the outstanding
     principal balance (except for actual payments of principal) or change the
     final maturity date on such Mortgage Loan.

          (ii) by adding the following to the end of the second paragraph of
     such section:

                                      A-5
<PAGE>

          Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
          consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
          forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents evidencing such
          assumption, modification, consolidation or extension. Notwithstanding
          anything to the contrary contained in the Master Interim Servicing
          Agreement, the Servicer shall not make or permit any modification,
          waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan that would cause
          any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement to fail to qualify as a
          REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax under Section 860F(a) or
          Section 860G(d) of the Code.

13.  Section 2.03 (Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments) is hereby amended by
     replacing the words "Continuously from the date hereof until the related
     Transfer Date" in the first and second lines thereof to "Continuously from
     the Closing Date until the date the Mortgage Loan ceases to be subject to
     this Agreement."

14.  Section 2.04 (Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account) is hereby
     amended by replacing the words "Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate
     Mortgage Loans, Group No. 2004-1 and various Mortgagors" with the words
     "the SASCO 2004-22 Trust Fund".

15.  Section 2.05 (Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account) is hereby
     amended by deleting the word "and" at the end of clause (vi), by replacing
     the period at the end of clause (vii) with a semicolon and by adding the
     following new clauses (viii) and (ix):

               (viii) to invest funds in the Custodial Account in Eligible
          Investments in accordance with Section 2.10; and

               (ix) to transfer funds to another Qualified Depository in
          accordance with Section 2.10 hereof.

16.  Section 2.06 (Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account) is hereby
     amended by replacing the words "Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate
     Mortgage Loans, Group No. 2004-1, and various Mortgagors" with "the SASCO
     2004-22 Trust Fund."

17.  Section 2.17 (Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property) is hereby
     amended by:

          (i) adding the following paragraph as the third paragraph of such
     Section:

               Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
          Section 2.17, in connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed
          in lieu of foreclosure, in the event the Servicer has reasonable cause
          to believe that a Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or
          toxic substances or wastes, or if the Trustee or the Master Servicer
          otherwise requests, an environmental inspection or review of such
          Mortgaged Property to be conducted by a qualified inspector shall be
          arranged by the Servicer. Upon completion of the inspection, the
          Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a
          written report of such environmental inspection. In the event that the
          environmental inspection report indicates that the Mortgaged Property
          is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, the
          Servicer shall not proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in
          lieu of foreclosure. In the event that the environmental inspection
          report is inconclusive as to the whether or not the Mortgaged Property
          is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, the
          Servicer shall not, without the prior approval of the Master Servicer,
          proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a


                                      A-6
<PAGE>

          deed in lieu of foreclosure. In such instance, the Master Servicer
          shall be deemed to have approved such foreclosure or acceptance of a
          deed in lieu of foreclosure unless the Master Servicer notifies the
          Servicer in writing, within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of
          written notice of the proposed foreclosure or deed in lieu of
          foreclosure from the Servicer, that it disapproves of the related
          foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The
          Servicer shall be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances made pursuant
          to this paragraph with respect to the related Mortgaged Property from
          the Custodial Account.

          (ii) by replacing the existing third paragraph of such section (before
     the amendment made by (i) above) by the following paragraph:

               The Servicer shall use its Best Efforts to dispose of the REO
          Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any
          event within three years after title has been taken to such REO
          Property, unless (a) a REMIC election has not been made with respect
          to the arrangement under which the Mortgage Loans and the REO Property
          are held, and (b) the Servicer determines, and gives an appropriate
          notice to the Master Servicer to such effect, that a longer period is
          necessary for the orderly liquidation of such REO Property. If a
          period longer than three years is permitted under the foregoing
          sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Servicer
          shall report monthly to the Master Servicer as to the progress being
          made in selling such REO Property and (ii) if, with the written
          consent of the Trustee, a purchase money mortgage is taken in
          connection with such sale, such purchase money mortgage shall name the
          Servicer as mortgagee, and such purchase money mortgage shall not be
          held pursuant to this Agreement, but instead a separate participation
          agreement among the Servicer and Trustee shall be entered into with
          respect to such purchase money mortgage. Notwithstanding anything
          herein to the contrary, the Servicer shall not be required to provide
          financing for the sale of any REO Property.Notwithstanding any other
          provisions of this Agreement, no REO Property acquired by the Trust
          Fund shall be rented (or allowed to continue to be rented) or
          otherwise used or held by or on behalf of the Trust Fund in such a
          manner, pursuant to any terms or for a period that would: (i) cause
          such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within
          the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of the Code or (ii) result in the
          imposition of any tax upon any REMIC included in the Trust Fund.

          (iii) by adding the following paragraph to the end of such section:

               Prior to acceptance by the Servicer of an offer to sell any REO
          Property, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of such offer
          in writing which notification shall set forth all material terms of
          said offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer shall be
          deemed to have approved the sale of any REO Property unless the Master
          Servicer notifies the Servicer in writing, within five (5) days after
          its receipt of the related Notice of Sale, that it disapproves of the
          related sale, in which case the Servicer shall not proceed with such
          sale.

18.  Section 3.01 (Remittances) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety
     to read as follows:

               On each Remittance Date the Servicer shall remit by wire transfer
          of immediately available funds to the Master Servicer (a) all amounts
          deposited in the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the
          last day of the related Due Period (net of charges


                                      A-7
<PAGE>

          against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Sections
          2.04 and 2.05), minus (b) any amounts attributable to Principal
          Prepayments, Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation
          Proceeds or REO Disposition Proceeds received after the applicable
          Prepayment Period, which amounts shall be remitted on the following
          Remittance Date, together with any additional interest required to be
          deposited in the Custodial Account in connection with such Principal
          Prepayment in accordance with Section 2.04(xi), and minus (c) any
          amounts attributable to scheduled monthly payments on the Mortgage
          Loans collected but due on a Due Date or Due Dates subsequent to the
          first day of the month in which such Remittance Date occurs, which
          amounts shall be remitted on the Remittance Date next succeeding the
          Due Date related to such monthly payment.

               With respect to any remittance received by the Master Servicer
          after the Business Day on which such payment was due, the Servicer
          shall pay to the Master Servicer interest on any such late payment at
          an annual rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of
          each change, plus two (2) percentage points, but in no event greater
          than the maximum amount permitted by applicable law. Such interest
          shall be deposited in the Custodial Account by the Servicer on the
          date such late payment is made and shall cover the period commencing
          with the day following such Business Day and ending with the Business
          Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such interest shall
          be remitted along with the distribution payable on the next succeeding
          Remittance Date. The payment by the Servicer of any such interest
          shall not be deemed an extension of time for payment or a waiver of
          any Event of Default by the Servicer.

               All remittances required to be made to the Master Servicer shall
          be made to the following wire account or to such other account as may

          any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
          reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and
          any other costs, fees and expenses that any of such parties may
          sustain in any way related to the failure


                                      A-9
<PAGE>

          the Trust Fund, promptly shall reimburse the Servicer for all amounts

          against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines,
          forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs,
          judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that the Servicer
          may sustain in any way related to the failure of the Trustee or the

     Assignment by Seller) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as follows:

               The Servicer shall neither assign this Agreement or the servicing

          hereof (to other than a third party in the case of outsourcing routine
          tasks such as taxes, insurance and property inspection, in which case
          the Servicer shall be fully liable for such tasks as if the Servicer
          performed them itself) or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
          substantially all of its property or assets without the prior written
          consent of the Trustee and the Master Servicer, which consent shall be
          granted or withheld in the reasonable discretion of such parties;
          provided, however, that the Servicer may assign its rights and
          obligations hereunder without prior written consent of the Trustee and
          the Master Servicer to any entity that is directly owned or controlled
          by the Servicer, and the Servicer guarantees the performance of such
          entity hereunder. In the event of such assignment by the Servicer, the
          Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a
          written statement guaranteeing the successor entity's performance of
          the Servicer's obligations under the Agreement.

     Section 11.01 (Events of Default) is hereby amended by replacing the last
     paragraph thereof with the following:

          Inc. and the Master Servicer. Upon written request from the Seller,
          the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor
          entity designated by the


                                      A-10
<PAGE>

          Seller any and all documents and other instruments, place in such
          successor's possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done
          all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the
          purposes of such notice of termination, including but not limited to
          the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and
          related documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The Servicer shall
          cooperate with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the Master Servicer
          and such successor in effecting the termination of the Servicer's
          responsibilities and rights hereunder, including without limitation,
          the transfer to such successor for administration by it of all cash
          amounts which shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to the
          Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received with
          respect to the Mortgage Loans.

26.  The parties hereto acknowledge that the word "Purchaser" in Section 11.02
     (Waiver of Defaults) shall refer to the "Master Servicer with the prior
     consent of the Trustee."

27.  A new Section 11.03 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby added to read as
     follows:

          Section 11.03 Termination Without Cause.

               This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
          distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the last
          Mortgage Loan to the Trust Fund (or advances by the Servicer for the
          same), and (b) the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon
          foreclosure of the last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all funds
          due hereunder, or (ii) mutual consent of the Servicer, Lehman Brothers
          Holdings Inc. and the Master Servicer in writing or (iii) at the sole
          option of the Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., without cause, upon 30
          days written notice. Any such notice of termination shall be in
          writing and delivered to the Servicer by registered mail to the
          address set forth at the beginning of this Agreement. The Master
          Servicer, the Trustee and the Servicer shall comply with the
          termination procedures set forth in Sections 11.01 and 11.03.

               In connection with any such termination referred to in clause
          (ii) or (iii) above, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. will be responsible
          for reimbursing the Servicer for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket
          Servicing Advances within 15 Business Days following the date of
          termination and other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs
          associated with any transfer of servicing.

28.  A new Section 11.04 (Successor to the Servicer) is hereby added to read as
     follows:

          Section 11.04 Successor to the Servicer.

               Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
          responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to Sections
          8.03, 11.01 or 11.03, the Master Servicer shall, in accordance with
          the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i) succeed to and assume all of
          the Servicer's responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under
          this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor meeting the eligibility
          requirements of this Agreement and (iii) and which shall succeed to
          all rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties and
          liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement with the termination
          of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and liabilities under this
          Agreement. Any successor to the Servicer that is not at that time a
          Servicer of other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund shall be subject
          to the approval of the Master Servicer, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
          the Trustee and each Rating Agency (as such term is defined in the
          Trust Agreement).


                                      A-11
<PAGE>

          Unless the successor servicer is at that time a servicer of other
          mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating Agency must deliver to
          the Trustee a letter to the effect that such transfer of servicing
          will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or downgrade of the
          then-current rating of any of the Certificates. In connection with
          such appointment and assumption, the Master Servicer or Lehman
          Brothers Holdings Inc., as applicable, may make such arrangements for
          the compensation of such successor out of payments on the Mortgage
          Loans as it and such successor shall agree; provided, however, that no
          such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the Servicer
          under this Agreement. In the event that the Servicer's duties,
          responsibilities and liabilities under this Agreement should be
          terminated pursuant to the aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall
          discharge such duties and responsibilities during the period from the
          date it acquires knowledge of such termination until the effective
          date thereof with the same degree of diligence and prudence which it
          is obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no
          action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or
          financial condition of its successor. The resignation or removal of
          the Servicer pursuant to the aforementioned sections shall not become
          effective until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to this
          Section 11.04 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the
          representations and warranties made pursuant to Article X shall be
          applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such resignation or
          termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this Agreement.

               Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than
          30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall
          prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity any and all
          documents and other instruments, place in such successor's possession
          all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or
          things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice
          of termination. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Trustee and the
          Master Servicer, as applicable, and such successor in effecting the
          termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder
          and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
          Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor
          for administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time
          be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial Account or any Escrow
          Account or thereafter received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

               Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
          acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer and the Master
          Servicer an instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the
          successor shall make an assumption of the due and punctual performance
          and observance of each covenant and condition to be performed and
          observed by the Servicer under this Agreement, whereupon such
          successor shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers,
          duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Servicer,
          with like effect as if originally named as a party to this Agreement.
          Any termination or resignation of the Servicer or termination of this
          Agreement pursuant to Sections 11.01 or 11.03 shall not affect any
          claims that the Master Servicer or the Trustee may have against the
          Servicer arising out of the Servicer's actions or failure to act prior
          to any such termination or resignation.

               The Servicer shall deliver within three (3) Business Days to the
          successor Servicer the funds in the Custodial Account and Escrow
          Account and all Mortgage Loan Documents and related documents and
          statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer shall account for all
          funds and shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other
          things as may reasonably be required to more fully and definitively
          vest in the


                                      A-12
<PAGE>

          successor all such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities,
          obligations and liabilities of the Servicer.

               Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
          Servicer shall notify the Trustee and Master Servicer of such
          appointment in accordance with the notice procedures set forth herein.

               Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all reasonable
          costs and expenses incurred in connection with any transfer of
          servicing hereunder (whether as a result of termination or removal of
          the Servicer or resignation of the Servicer or otherwise), including,
          without limitation, the costs and expenses of the Master Servicer or
          any other Person in appointing a successor servicer, or of the Master
          Servicer in assuming the responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder,
          or of transferring the Servicing Files and the other necessary data to
          the successor servicer shall be paid by the terminated, removed or
          resigning Servicer from its own funds without reimbursement.

29.  A new Section 12.11 (Intended Third Party Beneficiaries) is hereby added to
     read as follows:

          Section 12.11 Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.

               Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the parties
          to this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in furtherance of the
          intent of such parties as set forth herein, that the Master Servicer
          and the Trustee receive the benefit of the provisions of this
          Agreement as intended third party beneficiaries of this Agreement to
          the extent of such provisions. The Servicer shall have the same
          obligations to the Master Servicer and the Trustee as if they were
          parties to this Agreement, and the Master Servicer and the Trustee
          shall have the same rights and remedies to enforce the provisions of
          this Agreement as if they were parties to this Agreement. The Servicer
          shall only take direction from the Master Servicer (if direction by
          the Master Servicer is required under this Agreement) unless otherwise
          directed by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, all rights
          and obligations of the Master Servicer and the Trustee hereunder
          (other than the right to indemnification) shall terminate upon
          termination of the Trust Agreement and of the Trust Fund pursuant to
          the Trust Agreement.

30.  A new Section 12.12 (Acknowledgement) is hereby added to read as follows:

               Acknowledgement. The Servicer hereby acknowledges that the rights
          of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Servicing Agreement, as
          amended by this Agreement, will be assigned to SASCO under the
          Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement, and subsequently to the
          Trust Fund under the Trust Agreement and agrees that the Mortgage Loan
          Sale and Assignment Agreement and the Trust Agreement will each be an
          assignment and assumption agreement or other assignment document
          required pursuant to Section 8.04 of the Master Interim Servicing
          Agreement and will constitute an assignment and assumption of the
          rights of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Servicing Agreement
          to SASCO and the Trust Fund, as applicable. In addition, the Trust
          Fund will make a REMIC election. The Servicer hereby consents to such
          assignment and assumption and acknowledges the Trust Fund's REMIC
          election.

N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), recites and provides as
follows:

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Seller has conveyed certain Mortgage Loans identified on
Exhibit C hereto (the "Serviced Mortgage Loans") to Structured Asset Securities
Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation ("SASCO") pursuant to a
Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement dated as of November 1, 2004 (the
"Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement"), which in turn has conveyed the
Serviced Mortgage Loans to the Trustee, pursuant to a trust agreement, dated as
of November 1, 2004 (the "Trust Agreement"), among the Trustee, Aurora, as
master servicer (together with any successor master servicer appointed pursuant
to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the "Master Servicer"), and SASCO.

         WHEREAS, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB ("Lehman Brothers Bank") acquired

         WHEREAS, the Serviced Mortgage Loans are currently being serviced by

         WHEREAS, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as

hereto as Exhibit F, Lehman Brothers Bank has assigned all of its rights, title
and interest in the Serviced Mortgage Loans as well as all of its rights and

rights of the Seller (with the consent of the Master Servicer) to terminate the
rights and obligations of the Servicer hereunder at any time without cause and
to the other conditions set forth herein.

         WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer agree that the provisions of the
Flow Agreement shall continue to apply to the Serviced Mortgage Loans, but only
to the extent provided herein and that this Agreement shall govern the Serviced
Mortgage Loans for so long as such Serviced Mortgage Loans remain subject to the
provisions of the Trust Agreement and until the Transfer Date.

         WHEREAS, the Master Servicer and any successor master servicer shall be
obligated, among other things, to supervise the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Trustee, and shall have the right under the
conditions specified herein to terminate for cause the rights and obligations of

ending with the Servicing Transfer Date (i.e., the date selected by mutual
agreement of the parties for the transfer of the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans to Aurora, but no later than January 5, 2005), the Servicing Fee
for purposes of this Agreement shall equal

<PAGE>

one-twelfth of the product of (a) the Servicing Fee Rate of 0.25% and (b) the
outstanding principal balance of each Serviced Mortgage Loan. Such fee shall be
computed monthly on the same principal amount and period respecting which any
related interest payment on such Serviced Mortgage Loan is computed. The
obligation of the Trust Fund to pay such Servicing Fee is payable solely from
the interest portion (including recoveries with respect to interest from
Liquidation Proceeds, to the extent permitted by Section 2.05 of the Flow
Agreement) of the Monthly Payment collected by the Servicer or as otherwise
provided under Section 2.05.

         6. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including
any successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the
Master Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the
Servicer services the Serviced Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the
SASCO 2004-22 Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") created pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, shall have the same rights as Lehman Brothers Bank under the Flow
Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the Flow Agreement
and the term "Purchaser" as used in the Flow Agreement in connection with any
rights of the Purchaser shall refer to the Trust Fund or, as the context
requires, the Master Servicer acting in its capacity as agent for the Trust
Fund, except as otherwise specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Master Servicer
shall be entitled to terminate the rights and obligations of the Servicer under
this Agreement upon the failure of the Servicer to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement, which failure results in an Event of Default
as provided in Article XI of the Flow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall the Master Servicer assume any of the
obligations of Lehman Brothers Bank under the Flow Agreement and in connection
with the performance of the Master Servicer's duties hereunder, the parties and
other signatories hereto agree that the Master Servicer shall be entitled to all
of the rights, protections and limitations of liability afforded to the Master
Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

         7. No Representations. Neither the Servicer nor the Master Servicer
shall be obligated or required to make any representations and warranties
regarding the characteristics of the Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement and issuance of the
Certificates issued pursuant thereto.

         8. Notices. All notices and communications between or among the parties
hereto (including any third party beneficiary thereof) or required to be

                       Modifications to the Flow Agreement


1.     A new definition of "Best Efforts" is hereby added to Article I to
       immediately follow the definition of "Appropriate Federal Banking
       Agency", to read as follows:

              "Best Efforts": Efforts determined to be reasonably diligent by
              the Servicer in its sole discretion. Such efforts do not require
              the Servicer to enter into any litigation, arbitration or other
              legal or quasi-legal proceeding, nor do they require the Servicer
              to advance or expend fees or sums of money in addition to those
              specifically set forth in this Agreement.

2.     The definition "Due Period" is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
       follows:

              "Due Period": With respect to each Remittance Date, the period
              commencing on the second day of the month immediately preceding
              the month of such Remittance Date and ending on the first day of
              the month of such Remittance Date.

3.     The definition of "Eligible Investments" in Article I is hereby amended
       in its entirety to read as follows:

              "Eligible Investments": Any one or more of the obligations and
              securities listed below which investment provides for a date of
              maturity not later than the Determination Date in each month:

                     (i) direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed
              as to timely payment of principal and interest by, the United
              States of America or any agency or instrumentality of the United
              States of America the obligations of which are backed by the full
              faith and credit of the United States of America ("Direct
              Obligations");

                     (ii) federal funds, or demand and time deposits in,
              certificates of deposits of, or bankers' acceptances issued by,
              any depository institution or trust company (including U.S.
              subsidiaries of foreign depositories and the Trustee or any agent
              of the Trustee, acting in its respective commercial capacity)
              incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States of
              America or any state thereof and subject to supervision and
              examination by federal or state banking authorities, so long as at
              the time of investment or the contractual commitment providing for
              such investment the commercial paper or other short-term debt
              obligations of such depository institution or trust company (or,
              in the case of a depository institution or trust company which is
              the principal subsidiary of a holding company, the commercial
              paper or other short-term debt or deposit obligations of such
              holding company or deposit institution, as the case may be) have
              been rated by each Rating Agency in its highest short-term rating
              category or one of its two highest long-term rating categories;

                     (iii) repurchase agreements collateralized by Direct

              commercial bank insured by the FDIC, if such broker/dealer or bank
              has an uninsured, unsecured and


                                       A-2

              unguaranteed obligation rated by each Rating Agency in its highest
              short-term rating category;

                     (iv) securities bearing interest or sold at a discount
              issued by any corporation incorporated under the laws of the
              United States of America or any state thereof which have a credit
              rating from each Rating Agency, at the time of investment or the
              contractual commitment providing for such investment, at least
              equal to one of the two highest long-term credit rating categories
              of each Rating Agency; provided, however, that securities issued
              by any particular corporation will not be Eligible Investments to
              the extent that investment therein will cause the then outstanding
              principal amount of securities issued by such corporation and held
              as part of the Trust Fund to exceed 20% of the sum of the
              aggregate principal balance of the Mortgage Loans; provided,
              further, that such securities will not be Eligible Investments if
              they are published as being under review with negative
              implications from any Rating Agency;

                     (v) commercial paper (including both non-interest-bearing
              discount obligations and interest-bearing obligations payable on
              demand or on a specified date not more than 180 days after the
              date of issuance thereof) rated by each Rating Agency in its
              highest short-term rating category;

                     (vi) a Qualified GIC;

                     (vii) certificates or receipts representing direct
              ownership interests in future interest or principal payments on
              obligations of the United States of America or its agencies or
              instrumentalities (which obligations are backed by the full faith
              and credit of the United States of America) held by a custodian in
              safekeeping on behalf of the holders of such receipts; and

                     (viii) any other demand, money market, common trust fund or
              time deposit or obligation, or interest-bearing or other security
              or investment, (A) rated in the highest rating category by each
              Rating Agency or (B) that would not adversely affect the then
              current rating by each Rating Agency of any of the Certificates.
              Such investments in this subsection (viii) may include money
              market mutual funds or common trust funds, including any fund for
              which the Trustee, the Master Servicer or an affiliate thereof
              serves as an investment advisor, administrator, shareholder
              servicing agent, and/or custodian or subcustodian, notwithstanding
              that (x) the Trustee, the Master Servicer or an affiliate thereof
              charges and collects fees and expenses from such funds for
              services rendered, (y) the Trustee, the Master Servicer or an

              performed for such funds and pursuant to this Agreement may
              converge at any time; provided, however, that no such instrument
              shall be an Eligible Investment if such instrument evidences
              either (i) a right to receive only interest payments with respect
              to the obligations underlying such instrument, or (ii) both
              principal and interest payments derived from obligations
              underlying such instrument and the principal and interest payments
              with respect to such instrument provide a yield to maturity of
              greater than 120% of the yield to maturity at par of such
              underlying obligations.

              corporation whose long-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in
              one of its two highest rating categories or, if such insurance
              company has no long-term debt, whose claims paying ability is
              rated by each Rating Agency in one of its two highest rating
              categories, and whose short-term debt is rated by each Rating
              Agency in its highest rating category;

                     (b) provide that the Servicer may exercise all of the

              standing of the obligor under such guaranteed investment contract
              is such that continued investment pursuant to such contract of
              funds would result in a downgrading of any rating of the Servicer,
              the Servicer shall terminate such contract without penalty and be
              entitled to the return of all funds previously invested
              thereunder, together with accrued interest thereon at the interest
              rate provided under such contract to the date of delivery of such

              accrued interest thereon be returnable to the Custodial Account,

              Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller may waive,
              modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the
              postponement of any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to
              any Mortgagor if in the Seller's reasonable and prudent
              determination such waiver, modification, postponement or
              indulgence is not materially adverse to the Purchaser, provided,
              however, that unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to
              the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the
              Seller, imminent, the Seller shall not permit any modification
              with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage
              Interest Rate, forgive the payment of principal or interest,
              reduce or increase the outstanding principal balance (except for
              actual payments of principal) or change the final maturity date on
              such Mortgage Loan.

       (ii)   by adding the following to the end of the second paragraph of such
              section:


                                      A-5
<PAGE>

              Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
              consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer
              shall forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents
              evidencing such assumption, modification, consolidation or
              extension. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
              the Flow Agreement, the Servicer shall not make or permit any
              modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan
              that would cause any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement to
              fail to qualify as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax
              under Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

13.    Section 2.03 (Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments) is hereby amended by
       replacing the words "Continuously from the date hereof until the related
       Transfer Date" in the first and second lines thereof to "Continuously
       from the Closing Date until the date the Mortgage Loan ceases to be
       subject to this Agreement."

14.    Section 2.04 (Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account) is
       hereby amended by replacing the words "Residential Fixed Rate Mortgage
       Loans, Group No. 2000-1 and various Mortgagors" with the words "the SASCO
       2004-22 Trust Fund".

15.    Section 2.05 (Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account) is hereby
       amended by deleting the word "and" at the end of clause (vi), by
       replacing the period at the end of clause (vii) with a semicolon and by
       adding the following new clauses (viii) and (ix):

                     (viii) to invest funds in the Custodial Account in Eligible
              Investments in accordance with Section 2.10; and

                     (ix) to transfer funds to another Qualified Depository in

16.    Section 2.06 (Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account) is hereby

17.    Section 2.17 (Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property) is
       hereby amended by:

              (i)    adding the following paragraph as the third paragraph of
                     such Section:

                     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
              Section 2.17, in connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a
              deed in lieu of foreclosure, in the event the Servicer has
              reasonable cause to believe that a Mortgaged Property is
              contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, or if the
              Trustee or the Master Servicer otherwise requests, an
              environmental inspection or review of such Mortgaged Property to
              be conducted by a qualified inspector shall be arranged by the
              Servicer. Upon completion of the inspection, the Servicer shall
              provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a written report
              of such environmental inspection. In the event that the
              environmental inspection report indicates that the Mortgaged
              Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or
              wastes, the Servicer shall not proceed with foreclosure or
              acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In the event that the
              environmental inspection report is inconclusive as to the whether
              or not the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or
              toxic substances or wastes, the Servicer shall not, without


                                      A-6
<PAGE>

              the prior approval of the Master Servicer, proceed with
              foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In
              such instance, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have
              approved such foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
              foreclosure unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in
              writing, within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of written
              notice of the proposed foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure
              from the Servicer, that it disapproves of the related foreclosure
              or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Servicer shall
              be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances made pursuant to this
              paragraph with respect to the related Mortgaged Property from the
              Custodial Account.

              (ii)   by replacing the existing third paragraph of such section
                     (before the amendment made by (i) above) by the following
                     paragraph:

                     The Servicer shall use its Best Efforts to dispose of the
              REO Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property
              in any event within three years after title has been taken to such
              REO Property, unless (a) a REMIC election has not been made with
              respect to the arrangement under which the Mortgage Loans and the
              REO Property are held, and (b) the Servicer determines, and gives
              an appropriate notice to the Master Servicer to such effect, that
              a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such
              REO Property. If a period longer than three years is permitted
              under the foregoing sentence and is necessary to sell any REO
              Property, (i) the Servicer shall report monthly to the Master
              Servicer as to the progress being made in selling such REO
              Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Trustee, a
              purchase money mortgage is taken in connection with such sale,
              such purchase money mortgage shall name the Servicer as mortgagee,
              and such purchase money mortgage shall not be held pursuant to
              this Agreement, but instead a separate participation agreement
              among the Servicer and Trustee shall be entered into with respect
              to such purchase money mortgage. Notwithstanding anything herein
              to the contrary, the Servicer shall not be required to provide
              financing for the sale of any REO Property. Notwithstanding any
              other provisions of this Agreement, no REO Property acquired by
              the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to continue to be
              rented) or otherwise used or held by or on behalf of the Trust
              Fund in such a manner, pursuant to any terms or for a period that
              would: (i) cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as
              "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of
              the Code or (ii) result in the imposition of any tax upon any
              REMIC included in the Trust Fund.

              (iii)  by adding the following paragraph to the end of such
                     section:

                     Prior to acceptance by the Servicer of an offer to sell any
              REO Property, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of
              such offer in writing which notification shall set forth all
              material terms of said offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master
              Servicer shall be deemed to have approved the sale of any REO
              Property unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in
              writing, within five (5) days after its receipt of the related
              Notice of Sale, that it disapproves of the related sale, in which
              case the Servicer shall not proceed with such sale.

18.    Section 3.01 (Remittances) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety
       to read as follows:

                     On each Remittance Date the Servicer shall remit by wire
              transfer of immediately available funds to the Master Servicer (a)
              all amounts deposited in the Custodial Account


                                      A-7
<PAGE>

       as of the close of business on the last day of the related Due Period
       (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account
       pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 2.05), minus (b) any amounts attributable
       to Principal Prepayments, Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds,
       Condemnation Proceeds or REO Disposition Proceeds received after the
       applicable Prepayment Period, which amounts shall be remitted on the
       following Remittance Date, together with any additional interest required
       to be deposited in the Custodial Account in connection with such
       Principal Prepayment in accordance with Section 2.04(xi), and minus (c)
       any amounts attributable to scheduled monthly payments on the Mortgage
       Loans collected but due on a Due Date or Due Dates subsequent to the
       first day of the month in which such Remittance Date occurs, which
       amounts shall be remitted on the Remittance Date next succeeding the Due
       Date related to such monthly payment.

              With respect to any remittance received by the Master Servicer
       after the Business Day on which such payment was due, the Servicer shall
       pay to the Master Servicer interest on any such late payment at an annual
       rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change,
       plus two (2) percentage points, but in no event greater than the maximum
       amount permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be deposited in
       the Custodial Account by the Servicer on the date such late payment is
       made and shall cover the period commencing with the day following such
       Business Day and ending with the Business Day on which such payment is
       made, both inclusive. Such interest shall be remitted along with the
       distribution payable on the next succeeding Remittance Date. The payment
       by the Servicer of any such interest shall not be deemed an extension of
       time for payment or a waiver of any Event of Default by the Servicer.

              All remittances required to be made to the Master Servicer shall
       be made to the following wire account or to such other account as may be
       specified by the Master Servicer from time to time:

19.    Section 3.02 (Statements to Purchaser) is hereby amended as follows:

              (i) by replacing the first paragraph of such Section in its
       entirety by the following two (2) paragraphs:

              or other filings for the portion of the tax year 2004 and the

              information concerning the Mortgage Loans as is necessary for the
              Master Servicer to prepare the Trust Fund's federal income tax
              return as the Master Servicer may reasonably request from time to

<PAGE>

                     The Servicer shall indemnify the Trust Fund, the Depositor,

              against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines,
              forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related
              costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that any

              in strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement or the
              failure of the Servicer to comply with applicable law. The

              claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including
              counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment
              or decree which may be entered against it or any of such parties
              in respect of such claim. The Servicer shall follow any written
              instructions received from the Trustee in connection with such
              claim. The Trustee, from the assets of the Trust Fund, promptly
              shall reimburse the Servicer for all amounts advanced by it
              pursuant to the preceding sentence except when the claim is in any
              way relates to the failure of the Servicer to service and
              administer the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with the terms
              of this Agreement.

              and the Servicer with respect to any of the rights and obligations
              of the parties pursuant to this Agreement and such dispute is
              adjudicated in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or any
              other judicial process, then the losing party shall indemnify and
              reimburse the winning party for all attorney's fees and other

              any portion hereof (to other than a third party in the case of
              outsourcing routine tasks such as taxes, insurance and property
              inspection, in which case the Servicer shall be fully liable for
              such tasks as if the Servicer performed them itself) or sell or
              otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or
              assets without the prior written consent of the Trustee and the
              Master Servicer, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the
              reasonable discretion of such parties; provided, however, that the
              Servicer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder without
              prior written consent of the Trustee and the Master Servicer to
              any entity that is directly owned or controlled by the Servicer,
              and the Servicer guarantees the performance of such entity
              hereunder. In the event of such assignment by the Servicer, the
              Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a
              written statement guaranteeing the successor entity's performance
              of the Servicer's obligations under the Agreement.

27.    Section 11.01 (Events of Default) is hereby amended by replacing the last
       paragraph thereof with the following:

                     Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all
              authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether
              with respect to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and
              be vested in a successor Servicer appointed by Lehman Brothers
              Holdings Inc. and the Master Servicer. Upon written request from
              the Seller, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the
              successor entity designated by the Seller any and all documents
              and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
              Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or
              things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
              notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer
              and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related
              documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The Servicer shall
              cooperate with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the Master
              Servicer and such successor in effecting the termination of the
              Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including
              without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
              administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time
              be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow
              Account or thereafter received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

28.    The parties hereto acknowledge that the word "Purchaser" in Section 11.02
       (Waiver of Defaults) shall refer to the "Master Servicer with the prior
       consent of the Trustee."

29.    A new Section 11.03 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby added to read
       as follows:

              Section 11.03 Termination Without Cause.

                     This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a)
              the distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on
              the last Mortgage Loan to the Trust Fund (or advances by the
              Servicer for the same), and (b) the disposition of all REO
              Property acquired upon foreclosure of the last Mortgage Loan and
              the remittance of all funds due hereunder, or (ii) mutual consent
              of the Servicer, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the Master
              Servicer in writing or (iii) at the sole option of the Lehman
              Brothers Holdings Inc., without cause, upon 30 days written
              notice. Any such notice of termination shall be in writing and
              delivered to the Servicer by registered mail to the address set
              forth at the beginning of this Agreement. The Master Servicer, the
              Trustee and the Servicer shall comply with the termination
              procedures set forth in Sections 11.01 and 11.03.

                     In connection with any such termination referred to in
              clause (ii) or (iii) above, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. will be
              responsible for reimbursing the Servicer for all unreimbursed
              out-of-pocket Servicing Advances within 15 Business Days following
              the date of termination and other reasonable and necessary
              out-of-pocket costs associated with any transfer of servicing.

30.    A new Section 11.04 (Successor to the Servicer) is hereby added to read
       as follows:

              Section 11.04 Successor to the Servicer.

                     Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
              responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to
              Sections 8.03, 11.01 or 11.03, the Master Servicer shall, in
              accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i) succeed
              to and assume all of the Servicer's responsibilities, rights,
              duties and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a
              successor meeting the eligibility requirements of this Agreement
              and (iii) and which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of
              the responsibilities, duties and


                                      A-11
<PAGE>

              liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement with the
              termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
              liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the Servicer
              that is not at that time a Servicer of other mortgage loans for
              the Trust Fund shall be subject to the approval of the Master
              Servicer, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the Trustee and each
              Rating Agency (as such term is defined in the Trust Agreement).
              Unless the successor servicer is at that time a servicer of other
              mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating Agency must deliver
              to the Trustee a letter to the effect that such transfer of
              servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or
              downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates.
              In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Master
              Servicer or Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., as applicable, may make
              such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
              payments on the Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall
              agree; provided, however, that no such compensation shall be in
              excess of that permitted the Servicer under this Agreement. In the
              event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities and liabilities
              under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the
              aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties
              and responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires
              knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof
              with the same degree of diligence and prudence which it is
              obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no
              action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or
              financial condition of its successor. The resignation or removal
              of the Servicer pursuant to the aforementioned sections shall not
              become effective until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to
              this Section 11.04 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer of
              the representations and warranties made pursuant to Article X
              shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such
              resignation or termination of the Servicer, or the termination of
              this Agreement.

                     Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
              than 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the
              Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor
              entity any and all documents and other instruments, place in such
              successor's possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be
              done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
              the purposes of such notice of termination. The Servicer shall
              cooperate with the Trustee and the Master Servicer, as applicable,
              and such successor in effecting the termination of the Servicer's
              responsibilities and rights hereunder and the transfer of
              servicing responsibilities to the successor Servicer, including
              without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
              administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time
              be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial Account or any Escrow
              Account or thereafter received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

                     Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
              acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer and the
              Master Servicer an instrument (i) accepting such appointment,
              wherein the successor shall make an assumption of the due and
              punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition
              to be performed and observed by the Servicer under this Agreement,
              whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the
              rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
              liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect as if originally
              named as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation
              of the Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
              Sections 11.01 or 11.03 shall not affect any claims that the
              Master Servicer or the Trustee may have against the Servicer
              arising out of the Servicer's actions or failure to act prior to
              any such termination or resignation.


                                      A-12
<PAGE>

                     The Servicer shall deliver within three (3) Business Days
              to the successor Servicer the funds in the Custodial Account and
              Escrow Account and all Mortgage Loan Documents and related
              documents and statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer
              shall account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such
              instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required
              to more fully and definitively vest in the successor all such
              rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
              liabilities of the Servicer.

                     Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
              Servicer shall notify the Trustee and Master Servicer of such
              appointment in accordance with the notice procedures set forth
              herein.

                     Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
              reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any
              transfer of servicing hereunder (whether as a result of
              termination or removal of the Servicer or resignation of the
              Servicer or otherwise), including, without limitation, the costs
              and expenses of the Master Servicer or any other Person in
              appointing a successor servicer, or of the Master Servicer in
              assuming the responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder, or of
              transferring the Servicing Files and the other necessary data to
              the successor servicer shall be paid by the terminated, removed or
              resigning Servicer from its own funds without reimbursement.

31.    A new Section 12.11 (Intended Third Party Beneficiaries) is hereby added
       to read as follows:

              Section 12.11 Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.

                     Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
              parties to this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in
              furtherance of the intent of such parties as set forth herein,
              that the Master Servicer and the Trustee receive the benefit of
              the provisions of this Agreement as intended third party
              beneficiaries of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions.
              The Servicer shall have the same obligations to the Master
              Servicer and the Trustee as if they were parties to this
              Agreement, and the Master Servicer and the Trustee shall have the
              same rights and remedies to enforce the provisions of this
              Agreement as if they were parties to this Agreement. The Servicer
              shall only take direction from the Master Servicer (if direction
              by the Master Servicer is required under this Agreement) unless
              otherwise directed by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, all rights and obligations of the Master Servicer and
              the Trustee hereunder (other than the right to indemnification)
              shall terminate upon termination of the Trust Agreement and of the
              Trust Fund pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

32.    A new Section 12.12 (Acknowledgement) is hereby added to read as follows:

              Acknowledgement. The Servicer hereby acknowledges that the rights
              of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Servicing Agreement, as
              amended by this Agreement, will be assigned to SASCO under the
              Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement, and subsequently to
              the Trust Fund under the Trust Agreement and agrees that the
              Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement and the Trust
              Agreement will each be an assignment and assumption agreement or
              other assignment document required pursuant to Section 8.04 of the
              Flow Agreement and will constitute an assignment and assumption of
              the rights of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Servicing
              Agreement to SASCO and the Trust Fund, as applicable. In addition,
              the Trust Fund will

              make a REMIC election. The Servicer hereby consents to such
              assignment and assumption and acknowledges the Trust Fund's REMIC
              election.

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Servicer and Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (the "Bank") are
parties to a Flow Purchase, Warranties and Servicing Agreement dated as of July
1, 2004 (Group No. 2004-Flow) annexed as Exhibit B hereto (the "Bank Flow
Agreement"), pursuant to which the Servicer services certain fixed rate, first
lien residential mortgage loans, identified in Schedule I hereto (the "Mortgage
Loans") for the Bank;

         WHEREAS, on or prior to the Closing Date (as defined herein), the Bank
and LBH will enter into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as of
November 1, 2004 (the "Assignment and Assumption Agreement"), pursuant to which
the Bank will assign all of its rights, title and interest in and to the
Mortgage Loans to LBH and LBH will assume all of the rights and obligations of
the Bank under the Bank Flow Agreement, but only to the extent that the Bank
Flow Agreement relates to the Mortgage Loans;

         WHEREAS, on the Closing Date, LBH will convey the Mortgage Loans to
Structured Asset Securities Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation
("SASCO"), which in turn will convey the Mortgage Loans to the Trustee for the
benefit of the SASCO 2004-22 trust fund (the "Trust Fund") created, pursuant to
a trust agreement, dated as of November 1, 2004 (the "Trust Agreement") among
the Trustee, the Master Servicer and SASCO, as depositor (the "Depositor");

         WHEREAS, the Seller desires that the Servicer continue to service the
Mortgage Loans, and the Servicer has agreed to do so, subject to the rights of
the Seller and the Master Servicer to terminate the rights and obligations of
the Servicer hereunder subject to the conditions set forth herein;

         WHEREAS, on and after the Closing Date, the Seller and the Servicer
agree that the provisions of the Bank Flow Agreement shall apply to the Mortgage
Loans, as modified by the Agreement, and that this Agreement shall constitute a
"Reconstitution Agreement" in connection with a "Pass-Through Transfer" (as such
terms are defined in the Bank Flow Agreement) which shall govern the Mortgage
Loans for so long as such Mortgage Loans remain subject to the provisions of the
Trust Agreement;

         WHEREAS, pursuant to the Trust Agreement, the Master Servicer and any
successor master servicer shall be obligated, among other things, to supervise
the servicing of the Mortgage


<PAGE>

Loans on behalf of the Trustee and shall have the right to terminate the rights
and obligations of the Servicer upon the occurrence and continuance of an Event

         WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer intend that the Trustee be a third
party beneficiary of this Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter
set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Seller and the Servicer hereby
agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

         1. Acknowledgement of Assignment and Assumption. The Servicer hereby
acknowledges that the rights and obligations of the Bank under the Bank Flow
Agreement will be assigned to the Seller effective as of December 15, 2004 (the
"Closing Date") pursuant to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement; that such
rights and obligations, as modified by this Agreement, will, in turn, be
re-assigned by the Seller to SASCO pursuant to a mortgage loan sale and
assignment agreement dated as of November 1, 2004 (the "Mortgage Loan Sale and
Assignment Agreement") between the Seller, as seller, and SASCO, as purchaser;
and that such rights will simultaneously be re-assigned by SASCO to the Trustee
for the benefit of the Trust Fund pursuant to the Trust Agreement. The Servicer
hereby agrees that each of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, the Mortgage
Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement and the Trust Agreement, respectively, will
constitute a valid assignment and assumption by the Bank of the rights and
obligations of the Bank under the Bank Flow Agreement to the Seller, by the
Seller to SASCO, and of such rights but not obligations by SASCO to the Trust
Fund.

         2. Reconstitution; REMIC Election. The Servicer acknowledges that this
Agreement constitutes a "Reconstitution Agreement" in connection with a
"Pass-Through Transfer" and that the Reconstitution Date will be the Closing
Date. The Servicer also acknowledges that the Trust Fund will make a REMIC
election with respect to its holding of the Mortgage Loans and, accordingly, the
restrictions and requirements set forth in Section 4.04 of the Bank Flow
Agreement will be operative for purposes of this Agreement.

         3. Custodianship. The parties hereby agree that U.S. Bank National
Association will act as custodian of the Mortgage Files with respect to the
Mortgage Loans for the Trustee pursuant to the Custodial Agreement, dated as of
November 1, 2004, between U.S. Bank National Association and the Trustee.

         4. Servicing. The Servicer agrees, with respect to the Mortgage Loans,
to perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and obligations that are to
be performed and observed under the provisions of the Bank Flow Agreement,
except as otherwise provided herein or modified by Exhibit A hereto, and that
the provisions of the Bank Flow Agreement, as so modified, are and shall be a
part of this Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions were set forth
herein in full.

         5. Trust Cut-off Date. The parties hereto acknowledge that the
remittance on the December 18, 2004 Remittance Date to the Trust Fund is to
include principal due after

thereof allocable to a period prior to the Trust Cut-off Date, with the
adjustments specified in clauses (b), (c) and (d) of the first paragraph of
Section 6.01 of the Bank Flow Agreement.

         6. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including
any successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the
Master Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the
Servicer services the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions of this
Agreement. The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the Trust
Fund shall have the same rights as the Seller (as assignee of the Bank) under
the Bank Flow Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the
Bank Flow Agreement and the term "Purchaser" as used in the Bank Flow Agreement
in connection with any rights of the Purchaser shall refer to the Master
Servicer or the Trustee acting on behalf of the Trust Fund, except as otherwise
specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to
terminate the rights and obligations of the Servicer under this Agreement upon
the failure of the Servicer to perform any of its obligations under this
Agreement, as provided in Article X (Default) of the Bank Flow Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Master
Servicer be required to assume any of obligations of the Seller under the Bank
Flow Agreement; and, in connection with the performance of the Master Servicer's
duties hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto agree that the Master
Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections and limitations of
liability afforded to the Master Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

         7. No Representations. Neither the Servicer nor the Master Servicer
shall be obligated or required to make any representations and warranties
regarding the characteristics of the Mortgage Loans in connection with the
transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement and issuance of the mortgage
pass-through securities issued pursuant thereto.

         8. Notices. All notices and communications between or among the parties

                  against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines,
                  forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related
                  costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that
                  any of such parties may sustain in any way related to the
                  failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the
                  Mortgage Loans in compliance with the terms of this Agreement
                  (including, but not limited to its obligation to provide the
                  certification pursuant to Section 7.05(b) hereunder) or for
                  any inaccurate or misleading information provided in the
                  certification required pursuant to Section 7.05(b). The
                  Servicer immediately shall notify the relevant indemnified
                  party if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this
                  Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume (with the prior
                  written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall
                  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) the defense of any
                  such claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith,
                  including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and
                  satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it
                  or any of such parties in respect of such claim. The Servicer
                  shall follow any written instructions received from the


                                      A-3
<PAGE>

                  Master Servicer or the Trustee in connection with such claim.
                  The Servicer shall provide the Trustee (with a copy to the
                  Master Servicer) with a written report of all expenses and
                  advances incurred by the Servicer pursuant to this Section
                  8.04, and the Trustee (after consultation with the Master
                  Servicer) from the assets of the Trust Fund promptly shall
                  reimburse the Servicer for all amounts advanced by it pursuant
                  to the preceding sentence except when the claim is in any way
                  relates to the failure of the Servicer to service and
                  administer the Mortgage Loans in compliance with the terms of
                  this Agreement or the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
                  misconduct of this Servicer. In the event a dispute arises
                  between the Servicer and the indemnified party with respect to
                  any of the rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to
                  this Agreement and such dispute is adjudicated in a court of
                  law by an arbitration panel or any others judicial process,
                  then the losing party shall indemnify and reimburse the
                  winning party for all attorney's fees and other costs and
                  expenses relating to the adjudication of said dispute.

13.      Section 10.02 (Waiver of Defaults) is hereby amended by changing the
         reference to "Purchaser" to "Master Servicer with the prior written
         consent of the Trustee".

         (ii) thereof to read as below and adding the following sentence as the
         second sentence of Section 11.01:

                  (ii)     mutual consent of the Servicer and the Master
                           Servicer in writing, provided such termination is
                           also acceptable to the Trustee and the Rating
                           Agencies.

                           At the time of any termination of the Servicer
                  pursuant to Section 11.01, the Servicer shall be entitled to
                  all accrued and unpaid Servicing Fees and unreimbursed
                  Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances; provided, however, in
                  the event of a termination for cause pursuant to Section 10.01
                  hereof, such unreimbursed amounts shall not be reimbursed to
                  the Servicer until such amounts are received by the Trust Fund
                  from the related Mortgage Loans or if such amounts are
                  unrecoverable, from general collections.

15.      Section 11.02 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby amended by
         replacing the reference to "Purchaser" in clause (iii) with "Seller
         (with the prior consent of the Trustee and the Rating Agencies)"

16.      The first paragraph of Section 12.01 (Successor to Seller) is hereby
         amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                           Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
                  responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to
                  Sections 8.04, 10.01, 11.01(ii) or 11.02, the Master Servicer
                  shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Trust
                  Agreement (i) succeed to and assume all of the Servicer's
                  responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this
                  Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor meeting the eligibility
                  requirements of this Agreement, and which shall succeed to all



                                      A-4
<PAGE>

                  rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties and
                  liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement with the
                  termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
                  liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the
                  Servicer that is not at that time a Servicer of other mortgage
                  loans for the Trust Fund shall be subject to the approval of
                  the Master Servicer, the Seller, the Trustee and each Rating
                  Agency (as such term is defined in the Trust Agreement).
                  Unless the successor servicer is at that time a servicer of
                  other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating Agency
                  must deliver to the Trustee a letter to the effect that such
                  transfer of servicing will not result in a qualification,
                  withdrawal or downgrade of the then-current rating of any of
                  the mortgage pass-through securities issued by the Trust Fund.
                  In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Master
                  Servicer or the Seller, as applicable, may make such
                  arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
                  payments on the Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall
                  agree; provided, however, that no such compensation shall be
                  in excess of that permitted the Servicer under this Agreement.
                  In the event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities and
                  liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant
                  to the aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge
                  such duties and responsibilities during the period from the
                  date it acquires knowledge of such termination until the
                  effective date thereof with the same degree of diligence and
                  prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this
                  Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might
                  impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of its
                  successor. The resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant
                  to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective
                  until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to this Section
                  12.01 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the
                  representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections 4.01
                  and 4.02 and the remedies available to the Trust Fund under
                  Section 4.03, it being understood and agreed that the
                  provisions of Section 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03 shall be applicable
                  to the Servicer notwithstanding any such resignation or
                  termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this
                  Agreement.

17.      Section 12.02 (Amendment) is hereby amended by replacing the words "by
         written agreement signed by the Seller, as servicer and the Purchaser"
         with "by written agreement signed by the Servicer and the Seller, with
         the written consent of the Master Servicer and the Trustee".

18.      A new Section 12.18 (Intended Third Party Beneficiary) is hereby added
         to the Bank Flow Agreement to read as follows:

                  Section 12.18 Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.
         Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the parties to
         this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in furtherance of the
         intent of such parties as set forth herein, that the Trustee receive
         the benefit of the provisions of this Agreement as an intended third
         party beneficiary of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions.
         The Servicer shall have the same obligations to the Trustee as if they
         were parties to this Agreement, and the Trustee shall have the same
         rights and remedies to enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if
         it was a party to this Agreement. The Servicer shall only take
         direction from the Master Servicer (if



                                      A-5
<PAGE>

         direction by the Master Servicer is required under this Agreement)
         unless otherwise directed by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, all rights and obligations of the Master Servicer and the
         Trustee hereunder (other than the right to indemnification) shall
         terminate upon termination of the Trust Agreement and of the Trust Fund
         created pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

19.      A new Section 12.19 (Reporting Requirements of the Commission and
         Indemnification) is hereby added to the Bank Flow Agreement to read as
         follows:

                  Section 12.19 Reporting Requirements of the Commission and
         Indemnification. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
         the Servicer (i) agrees to negotiate in good faith any amendment or
         modification (including an indemnification agreed to in connection
         therewith) to this Agreement as may be necessary, in the judgment of
         the Depositor and its counsel (as evidenced by an opinion of such
         counsel addressed to the Servicer), to comply with any rules
         promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
         "Commission") and any interpretations thereof by the staff of the
         Commission (collectively, "SEC Rules") and (ii) with reasonable notice
         and upon written request, provide to the Depositor for inclusion in any
         periodic report required to be filed under the Securities and Exchange
         Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), such items of information
         regarding this Agreement and matters related to the Servicer, including
         as applicable (by way of example and not limitation), a description of
         any material litigation or governmental action or proceeding involving
         the Servicer or its affiliates (collectively, the "Servicer
         Information"), provided, that such information shall be required to be
         provided by the Servicer only to the extent that such shall be
         determined by the Depositor and its counsel (as evidenced by an opinion
         of such counsel addressed to the Servicer) to be necessary to comply
         with any SEC Rules.

20.      Section 12.18 (Exhibits) and Section 12.19 (General Interpretive
         Principles) are renumbered Sections 12.20 and Section 12.21,
         respectively.

              agreements has been provided to the Sarbanes Certifying Party;

         (iii) I am responsible for reviewing the activities performed by the

the Servicer shall note transfers of Mortgage Loans. Upon receipt of notice of
any transfer of a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall mark its books and records

as the Owner may designate shall be recorded as to each Non-MERS Mortgage Loan
unless instructions to the contrary are delivered to the Servicer in writing by
the Master Servicer. Subject to the preceding sentence, as soon as practicable
after the Master Servicer instructs the Servicer to record Assignments of
Mortgage (but in no event more than 30 days thereafter except to the extent
delays are caused by the applicable recording office), the Servicer, at the
Servicer's expense, shall cause to be properly recorded in each public recording
office where such Non-MERS Eligible Mortgage Loans are recorded each Assignment
of Mortgage.

                  In connection with each Reconstitution, the Servicer, at the
expense of the Owner and at the direction of the Owner or the Master Servicer,
shall cause an Assignment of Mortgage as to each Non-MERS Mortgage Loan in favor
of the new Owner identified in a Transfer Notice to be prepared and properly
recorded in each public recording office where such Non-MERS Mortgage Loans are
recorded as soon as practicable after the related Effective Date (but in no
event more than 90 days thereafter except to the extent delays are caused by the
applicable recording office). The Servicer shall track such Assignments of
Mortgage to ensure they have been recorded. Additionally, the Servicer shall
prepare and execute, at the direction of the Owner or the Master Servicer, any
note endorsements relating to any of the Non-MERS Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Owner or its designee, on behalf of
the Depositor, its out-of-pocket costs for the preparation and recordation of
the Assignments of Mortgage under this paragraph. After the expenses of such
recording costs shall have been paid by the Servicer, the Servicer shall submit
to the Master Servicer a reasonably detailed invoice for reimbursement of
recording costs incurred hereunder.


                                   ARTICLE III

                         REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES;
                               REMEDIES AND BREACH

                  Section 3.01 Servicer Representations and Warranties.

                  The Servicer, as a condition to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, hereby represents and warrants to the Owner
that as of each Commencement Date:

                  (a) Due Organization and Authority. The Servicer is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United
States or the jurisdiction of its formation, as applicable, and has and shall
continue to maintain all licenses necessary to carry on its business as now
being conducted and is and will continue to be licensed, qualified and in good
standing in each state where a Mortgaged Property is located if the laws of such
state require licensing or qualification in order to conduct business of the
type conducted by the Servicer, and in any event the Servicer is and will
continue to be in compliance with the laws of any such state to the extent
necessary to ensure the enforceability of the related Mortgage Loan and the
servicing of such Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
the Servicer has the full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform in accordance herewith; the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement (including all instruments of transfer to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) by the Servicer and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized; this
Agreement evidences the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Servicer; and all requisite action has been taken by the Servicer to make this
Agreement valid and binding upon the Servicer in accordance with its terms;

                  (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of
business of the Servicer;

                                      -14-
<PAGE>

                  (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the acquisition of the Mortgage Loans and the servicing
responsibilities by the Servicer, or the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Servicer's charter or by-laws or any legal
restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the Servicer is now a party
or by which it is bound, or constitute a default or result in an acceleration
under any of the foregoing, or result in the violation of any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the Servicer or its property is
subject, or impair the ability of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans, or
impair the value of the Mortgage Loans;

                  (d) Ability to Service. The Servicer is an approved
servicer of residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with the
facilities, procedures, and experienced personnel necessary for the sound
servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
is in good standing to service mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and
no event has occurred, including but not limited to a change in insurance
coverage, which would make the Servicer unable to comply with Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac eligibility requirements or which would require notification to
either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;

                  (e) Reasonable Servicing Fee. The Servicer acknowledges
and agrees that the Servicing Fee, as calculated at the Servicing Fee Rate,
represents reasonable compensation for performing such services and that the
entire Servicing Fee shall be treated by the Servicer, for accounting and tax
purposes, as compensation for the servicing and administration of the Mortgage
Loans pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (f) Ability to Perform. The Servicer does not believe,
nor does it have any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and
every covenant contained in this Agreement. The Servicer is solvent and the sale
of the Mortgage Loans is not undertaken to hinder, delay or defraud any of the
Servicer's creditors;

                  (g) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or threatened against the Servicer which,
either in any one instance or in the aggregate, may result in any material
adverse change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or
assets of the Servicer, or in any material impairment of the right or ability of
the Servicer to carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any
material liability on the part of the Servicer, or which would draw into
question the validity of this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans or of any action
taken or to be taken in connection with the obligations of the Servicer
contemplated herein, or which would be likely to impair materially the ability
of the Servicer to perform under the terms of this Agreement;

                  (h) No Consent Required. No consent, approval,
authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required
for the execution, delivery and performance by the Servicer of or compliance by
the Servicer with this Agreement, or if required, such approval has been
obtained prior to the Commencement Date;

                                      -15-
<PAGE>

                  (i) No Untrue Information. Neither this Agreement nor any
statement, report or other document furnished or to be furnished pursuant to
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
contains any untrue statement of fact or omits to state a fact necessary to make
the statements contained therein not materially misleading;

                  (j) Financial Statements. The Servicer has delivered to
the Owner financial statements as to its last three complete fiscal years and
any later quarter ended more than 60 days prior to the execution of this
Agreement. All such financial statements fairly present the pertinent results of
operations and changes in financial position at the end of each such period of
the Servicer and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied throughout the
periods involved, except as set forth in the notes thereto. There has been no
change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of
the Servicer since the date of the Servicer's financial statements that would
have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under
this Agreement. The Servicer has completed any forms requested by the Owner in a
timely manner and in accordance with the provided instructions;

                  (k) No Brokers' Fees. The Servicer has not dealt with any
broker, investment banker, agent or other person that may be entitled to any
commission or compensation in connection with the sale of the Mortgage Loans;
and

                  (l) Insured Depository Institution Representations. If
the Servicer is an Insured Depository Institution, the Servicer makes the
following additional representations and warranties:

                     (i) This Agreement between the Owner and the Servicer
         conforms to all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; and

                     (ii) This Agreement is (1) executed contemporaneously with
         the Loan Purchase Agreement, (2) approved by a specific corporate or
         banking association resolution by the Servicer's board of directors,
         which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board, and (3)
         an official record of the Servicer. A copy of such resolution,
         certified by a vice president or higher officer of the Servicer has
         been provided to the Owner.

                  Section 3.02 Remedies for Breach of Representations and
Warranties.

                  It is understood and agreed that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.01 shall survive the engagement of the
Servicer to perform the servicing responsibilities as of each Commencement Date
and the delivery of the Servicing Files to the Servicer and shall inure to the
benefit of the Owner. Upon discovery by either the Servicer or the Owner of a
breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties which materially
and adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects
the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority of the
security interest on such Mortgaged Property or the


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

interest of the Owner (in the case of any of the foregoing, a "Breach"), the
party discovering such Breach shall give prompt written notice to the other.

                  Within sixty (60) days of the earlier of either discovery by
or notice to the Servicer of any Breach of a representation or warranty, the
Servicer shall use its best efforts promptly to cure such Breach in all material
respects and, if such Breach cannot be cured, the Servicer shall, at the Owner's
option, assign the Servicer's rights and obligations under this Agreement (or
respecting the affected Mortgage Loans) to a successor servicer, subject to the
approval of the Owner, which approval shall be in the Owner's sole discretion.
Such assignment shall be in accordance with Section 12.01.

                  In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify the Owner, the
Master Servicer and each Reconstitution Party and hold each of them harmless
against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and
necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and expenses
resulting from any claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or grounded
upon, or resulting from, a Breach of the Servicer representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement.

                  Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or
arising out of the Breach of any representations and warranties made in Section
3.01 shall accrue as to any Mortgage Loan upon (i) discovery of such Breach by
the Owner or the Master Servicer or notice thereof by the Servicer to the Owner
or the Master Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer to cure such Breach as
specified above, and (iii) demand upon the Servicer by the Owner or the Master
Servicer for compliance with this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                 ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS

                  Section 4.01 Servicer to Act as Servicer.

                  From and after each Commencement Date, the Servicer, as an
independent contractor, shall service and administer the related Mortgage Loans
and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things
in connection with such servicing and administration which the Servicer may deem
necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and with
Accepted Servicing Practices; provided that the Servicer shall not take any
action that is inconsistent with or prejudices the rights and interests of the
Owner in any Mortgage Loan or under this Agreement.

                  The Servicer shall not make any future advances with respect
to a Mortgage Loan and (unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the
Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the Servicer, imminent and
the Servicer has obtained the prior written consent of the Master Servicer) the
Servicer shall not permit any modification of any material term of any Mortgage
Loan including any modifications that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate,
defer or forgive the payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the
outstanding principal balance (except for actual payments of principal) or
change the final maturity date on such


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

Mortgage Loan. Except with the written permission of the Master Servicer, no
modification, recast, extension, or capitalization of delinquent payments of a
Mortgage Loan shall be permitted. Where applicable, the Servicer must satisfy
all requirements under the applicable PMI Policy and/or any applicable LPMI
Policy regarding the relief granted with respect to a delinquent Mortgage Loan,
including, without limitation, securing the prior written consent of the
respective Qualified Insurer regarding any change in any term of such Mortgage
Loan, the release of the related Mortgagor from any liability related to such
Mortgage Loan, or the release of any portion of, or interest in, the Mortgaged
Property from the lien of the related Mortgage. In the event of any modification
permitted hereunder which permits the deferral of interest or principal payments
on any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such principal or
interest payment has been deferred, deposit in the Custodial Account from its
own funds, in accordance with Section 5.03, the difference between (a) such
month's principal and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate
on the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by
the Mortgagor. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such advances
to the same extent as for all other advances made pursuant to Section 5.03.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer shall continue,
and is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of
itself and the Owner, all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of
partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with
respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If
reasonably required by the Servicer, the Owner shall furnish the Servicer with
any powers of attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable
the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this
Agreement.

                  Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, but in no event later than the
Reporting Date in the month following the date of execution of such instrument,
the Servicer shall forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents
evidencing such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension.

                  In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the
Servicer shall employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise
the same care that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and
administering mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to
Accepted Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the
requirements of this Agreement, and the Owner's reliance on the Servicer.

                  Section 4.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans.

                  In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan and
not postponed pursuant to Section 4.01 is not paid when the same becomes due and
payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails to perform any other covenant or
obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period, the Servicer shall take such action as (1) the Servicer
would take under similar circumstances with respect to a similar mortgage loan
held for its own account for investment, (2) shall be consistent with Accepted
Servicing Practices, (3) the Servicer shall determine prudently to be in the
best interest of the Owner, and (4) is consistent with any related PMI Policy or
LPMI Policy. In the event that any payment due under


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

any Mortgage Loan is not postponed pursuant to Section 4.01 and remains
delinquent for a period of ninety (90) days or any other default continues for a
period of 90 days beyond the expiration of any grace or cure period, the
Servicer shall commence foreclosure proceedings, provided that, prior to
commencing foreclosure proceedings, the Servicer shall notify the Master
Servicer in writing of the Servicer's intention to do so, and the Servicer shall
not commence foreclosure proceedings if the Master Servicer objects to such
action within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice. In such connection, the
Servicer shall from its own funds make all necessary and proper Servicing
Advances, provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be required to expend
its own funds in connection with any foreclosure or towards the restoration or
preservation of any Mortgaged Property, unless it shall determine (a) that such
preservation, restoration and/or foreclosure will increase the proceeds of
liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Owner after reimbursement to itself for such
expenses and (b) that such expenses will be recoverable by it either through
Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall have priority for purposes of
withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 4.05) or through
Insurance Proceeds (respecting which it shall have similar priority).

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, in
the event the Servicer has reasonable cause to believe that a Mortgaged Property
is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, or if the Owner or
the Master Servicer otherwise requests an environmental inspection or review of
such Mortgaged Property to be conducted by a qualified inspector, the Servicer
shall cause such an environmental inspection or review to be made by a qualified
inspector. Upon completion of the inspection, the Servicer shall promptly
provide the Owner with a written report of the environmental inspection.

                  After reviewing the environmental inspection report, the
Master Servicer shall determine how the Servicer shall proceed with respect to
the Mortgaged Property. In the event (a) the environmental inspection report
indicates that the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic
substances or wastes and (b) the Master Servicer directs the Servicer to proceed
with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer
shall be reimbursed for all reasonable costs associated with such foreclosure or
acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure and any related environmental clean
up costs, as applicable, from the related Liquidation Proceeds, or if the
Liquidation Proceeds are insufficient to fully reimburse the Servicer, the
Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed from amounts in the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof. In the event the Master Servicer
directs the Servicer not to proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in
lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer shall be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances
made with respect to the related Mortgaged Property from the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof.

                  Section 4.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.

                  Continuously from the related Commencement Date until the date
each Mortgage Loan ceases to be subject to this Agreement, the Servicer shall
proceed diligently to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans
when the same shall become due and payable and shall take special care in
ascertaining and estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will
become due and payable with respect to the Mortgage Loan and the Mortgaged

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

Property, to the end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be
sufficient to pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

                  Section 4.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial
Account.

                  The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its own
funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain two (2) separate
Custodial Accounts, each in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, one
account for funds collected and relating to Reconstituted Mortgage Loans and one
for funds collected and relating to all Mortgage Loans that are not subject to a
Reconstitution. The Custodial Account relating to all Mortgage Loans that are
not then subject to a Reconstitution shall be titled "[Name of Servicer] in
trust for the benefit of Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master Servicer and the
Owner of Residential Mortgage Loans". The Custodial Account relating to all
Reconstituted Mortgage Loans shall be titled "[Name of Servicer] in trust for
the benefit of Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master Servicer and the various
Owners of Residential Mortgage Loans." The Custodial Account shall be
established with a Qualified Depository acceptable to the Owner. Any funds
deposited in the Custodial Account shall at all times be fully insured to the
full extent permitted under applicable law. Funds deposited in the Custodial
Account may be drawn on by the Servicer in accordance with Section 4.05. The
creation of any Custodial Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the
form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, in the case of an account established with the
Servicer, or by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, in the
case of an account held by a depository other than the Servicer. A copy of such
certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the Owner and, upon
request, to any subsequent Owner.

                  The Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily
basis, and retain therein, the following collections received by the Servicer
and payments made by the Servicer after the related Commencement Date with
respect to the Mortgage Loans (including payments received by the Servicer prior
to the related Commencement Date but allocable to a period subsequent thereto):

                     (i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage
         Loans, including all Principal Prepayments;

                     (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage
         Loans adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

                     (iii) all Liquidation Proceeds;

                     (iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to
         be deposited pursuant to Section 4.10 (other than proceeds to be held
         in the Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the
         Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with
         Section 4.14), Section 4.11 and Section 4.15;

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

                     (v) all Condemnation Proceeds which are not applied to the
         restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the
         Mortgagor in accordance with Section 4.14;

                     (vi) any amount required to be deposited in the Custodial
         Account pursuant to Section 4.01, 4.09, 4.19, 4.22, 5.03, 6.01 or 6.02;

                     (vii) with respect to each Principal Prepayment in full or
         in part, the Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, if any, for the
         month of distribution. Such deposit shall be made from the Servicer's
         own funds, without reimbursement therefor;

                     (viii) any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer
         pursuant to Section 4.11 in connection with the deductible clause in
         any blanket hazard insurance policy;

                     (ix) any amounts received with respect to or related to any
         REO Property and all REO Disposition Proceeds pursuant to Section 4.16;
         and

                     (x) any other amount required hereunder to be deposited by
         the Servicer in the Custodial Account.

                  The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial
Account shall be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of late payment
charges and assumption fees, to the extent permitted by Section 6.01, need not
be deposited by the Servicer into the Custodial Account. Any interest paid on
funds deposited in the Custodial Account by the depository institution shall
accrue to the benefit of the Servicer and the Servicer shall be entitled to
retain and withdraw such interest from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section
4.05.

                  Section 4.05 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account.

                  The Servicer shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the
Custodial Account for the following purposes:

                     (i) to make payments to the Owner in the amounts and in the
         manner provided for in Section 5.01;

                     (ii) to reimburse itself for Monthly Advances of the
         Servicer's funds made pursuant to Section 5.03, the Servicer's right to
         reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause (ii) being limited to
         amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent late
         payments of principal and/or interest respecting which any such advance
         was made, it being understood that, in the case of any such
         reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the
         rights of the Owner, except that, where the Servicer is required to
         repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 6.02, the Servicer's
         right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to the payment to the
         Owner of the Repurchase Price pursuant to such section and all other
         amounts required to be paid to the Owner with respect to such Mortgage
         Loan;

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

                     (iii) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Servicing
         Advances, and for any unpaid Servicing Fees, the Servicer's right to
         reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause (iii) with respect to any
         Mortgage Loan being limited to related Liquidation Proceeds,
         Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and such other amounts as may
         be collected by the Servicer from the Mortgagor or otherwise relating
         to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that, in the case of any such
         reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the
         rights of the Owner except where the Servicer is required to repurchase
         a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 6.02, in which case the Servicer's
         right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to the payment to the
         Owner of the Repurchase Price pursuant to such section and all other
         amounts required to be paid to the Owner with respect to such Mortgage
         Loan;

                     (iv) to pay itself interest earned on funds deposited in
         the Custodial Account;

                     (v) to reimburse itself for expenses incurred and
         reimbursable to it pursuant to Section 9.01, but only to the extent
         such amounts are determined to be reimbursable by the Owner pursuant to
         Section 9.01;

                     (vi) with respect to each Mortgage Loan that is covered by
         an LPMI Policy, in the amount of the related premiums for the LPMI
         Policy (if applicable);

                     (vii) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon the
         termination of this Agreement; and

                     (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

                  In connection with withdrawals pursuant to subclauses (ii) and
(iii) above, the Servicer's entitlement thereto is limited to collections or
other recoveries on the related Mortgage Loan. The Servicer shall therefore keep
and maintain a separate accounting for each Mortgage Loan it services for the
purpose of justifying any withdrawal from the Collection Account it maintains
pursuant to such subclause (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

                  In the event that the Custodial Account is interest bearing,
on each Remittance Date, the Servicer shall withdraw all funds from the
Custodial Account except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 5.01, the
Servicer is not obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Servicer may use
such withdrawn funds only for the purposes described in this Section 4.05.

                  Section 4.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account.

                  The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and
apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and
maintain two (2) separate Escrow Accounts, each in the form of time deposit or
demand accounts, one account for Escrow Payments relating to Reconstituted
Mortgage Loans and one for Escrow Payments relating to all Mortgage Loans that
are not subject to a Reconstitution. The Escrow Account relating to all Mortgage
Loans that are not then subject to a Reconstitution shall be titled "[Name of
Servicer] in trust for the benefit of Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master
Servicer and the Owner of Residential Mortgage Loans and




                                      -22-

various Mortgagors". The Escrow Account relating to all Reconstituted Mortgage
Loans shall be titled "[Name of Servicer] in trust for the benefit of Aurora
Loan Services Inc., as Master Servicer and the various Owners of Residential
Mortgage Loans and various Mortgagors." The Escrow Accounts shall be established
with a Qualified Depository, in a manner which shall provide maximum available
insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow Account may be drawn on by
the Servicer in accordance with Section 4.07. The creation of any Escrow Account
shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, in the
case of an account established with the Servicer, or by a letter agreement in
the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, in the case of an account held by a depository
other than the Servicer. A copy of such certification shall be furnished to the
Owner and, upon request, to any subsequent Owner.

                  The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts
on a daily basis, and retain therein:

                     (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the
         Mortgage Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such
         items as required under the terms of this Agreement; and

                     (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or
         Condemnation Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or
         repair of any Mortgaged Property.

                  The Servicer shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account
only to effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth
in Section 4.07. The Servicer shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on
funds deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than
interest on escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the
extent required by law, the Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the
Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or
that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

                  Section 4.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

                  Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by
the Servicer only:

                     (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes,
         assessments, water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium
         charges, fire and hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting
         Escrow Payments for the related Mortgage;

                     (ii) to reimburse the Servicer for any Servicing Advances
         made by the Servicer pursuant to Section 4.08 with respect to a related
         Mortgage Loan, but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage
         Loan which represent late collections of Escrow Payments thereunder;

                     (iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in
         excess of the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage
         Loan;

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

                     (iv) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application
         to reduce the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with
         the terms of the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

                     (v) for application to restoration or repair of the
         Mortgaged Property in accordance with the procedures outlined in
         Section 4.14;

                     (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or any Mortgagor to the extent
         required by law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow
         Account;

                     (vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the
         termination of this Agreement; and

                     (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

                  Section 4.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
maintain accurate records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes,
assessments, water rates, sewer rents, and other charges which are or may become
a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the status of PMI Policy and LPMI Policy
premiums and fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to
time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and
shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination
date, employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account
which shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts
sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. To the
extent that a Mortgage does not provide for Escrow Payments, the Servicer shall
determine that any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they
first become due. The Servicer assumes full responsibility for the timely
payment of all such bills and shall effect timely payment of all such charges
irrespective of each Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or
the making of the Escrow Payments, and the Servicer shall make advances from its
own funds to effect such payments; provided, however, that the Servicer shall
not be required to make an advance of its own funds for any such payments if
such advance would, if made, be, in the Servicer's reasonable judgment,
non-recoverable from future recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loan or
Mortgaged Property. The determination by the Servicer that any advance of funds
is or would be non-recoverable shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of
the Servicer delivered to the Master Servicer.

                  Section 4.09 Protection of Accounts.

                  The Servicer may transfer the Custodial Account or the Escrow
Account to a different Qualified Depository from time to time. Such transfer
shall be made only upon obtaining the consent of the Owner and the Master
Servicer, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.

                  The Servicer shall bear any expenses, losses or damages
sustained by the Owner because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow Account
are not demand deposit accounts.

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

                  Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow
Account may at the option of the Servicer be invested in Eligible Investments;
provided that in the event that amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or
the Escrow Account exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the "Insured
Amount") the Servicer shall be obligated to invest the excess amount over the
Insured Amount in Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such excess
amount becomes present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account. Any such
Eligible Investment shall mature no later than the Determination Date next
following the date of such Eligible Investment, provided, however, that if such
Eligible Investment is an obligation of a Qualified Depository (other than the
Servicer) that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such
Eligible Investment may mature on such Remittance Date. Any such Eligible
Investment shall be made in the name of the Servicer in trust for the benefit of
the Owner. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Servicer and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Servicer. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be
deposited in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Servicer out of
its own funds immediately as realized.

                  Section 4.10 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

                  The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage
Loan hazard insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are
insured by a generally acceptable insurer rated A:VI or better in the current
Best's Key Rating Guide ("Best's") against loss by fire, hazards of extended
coverage and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged
Property is located, in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i)
the replacement value of the improvements securing such Mortgage Loan and (ii)
the greater of (a) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and
(b) an amount such that the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the
Mortgagor or the loss payee from becoming a co-insurer.

                  If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related
Mortgaged Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by
the Flood Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such
flood insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a generally acceptable insurance carrier rated A:VI or better
in Best's in an amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the
minimum amount required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any
damage or loss on a replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the
mortgage if replacement cost coverage is not available for the type of building
insured) and (ii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available under the
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the
term of the Mortgage Loan, the Servicer determines in accordance with applicable
law and pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged Property is located
in a special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is
covered in an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended, the Servicer shall notify the related
Mortgagor that the Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if
said Mortgagor fails to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within
forty-five (45) days after such notification, the Servicer shall immediately
force place the required flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

                  If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project,
the Servicer shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association,
including hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained
in accordance with then current Fannie Mae requirements, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Servicer promptly of any change
in the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have
a material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.

                  The Servicer shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged
Property earthquake or such other or additional insurance as may be required
pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in
force and as shall require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the
requirements of any private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to
conform with Accepted Servicing Practices.

                  In the event that any Owner or the Servicer shall determine
that the Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards
and risks not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the
Mortgagor pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, the Servicer shall communicate
and consult with the Mortgagor with respect to the need for such insurance and
bring to the Mortgagor's attention the desirability of protection of the
Mortgaged Property.

                  All policies required hereunder shall name the Servicer as
loss payee and shall be endorsed with standard or union mortgagee clauses,
without contribution, which shall provide for at least 30 days prior written
notice of any cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage.

                  The Servicer shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom
of choice in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however,
that the Servicer shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance
companies unless such companies are rated A:VI or better in Best's and are
licensed to do business in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is
located. The Servicer shall determine that such policies provide sufficient risk
coverage and amounts, that they insure the property owner, and that they
properly describe the property address. The Servicer shall furnish to the
Mortgagor a formal notice of expiration of any such insurance in sufficient time
for the Mortgagor to arrange for renewal coverage by the expiration date.

                  Pursuant to Section 4.04, any amounts collected by the
Servicer under any such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the
Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged
Property, or property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be
released to the Mortgagor, in accordance with the Servicer's normal servicing
procedures as specified in Section 4.14) shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 4.05.

                  Section 4.11 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance.

                  In the event that the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a
blanket policy insuring against losses arising from fire and hazards covered
under extended coverage on all of the


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an amount
equal to the amount required pursuant to Section 4.10 and otherwise complies
with all other requirements of Section 4.10, it shall conclusively be deemed to
have satisfied its obligations as set forth in Section 4.10. Any amounts
collected by the Servicer under any such policy relating to a Mortgage Loan
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to
Section 4.05. Such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in the
event that there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged
Property a policy complying with Section 4.10, and there shall have been a loss
which would have been covered by such policy, the Servicer shall deposit in the
Custodial Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable
under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to
deposited from the Servicer's funds, without reimbursement therefor. Upon
request of the Master Servicer, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the
Master Servicer a certified true copy of such policy and a statement from the
insurer thereunder that such policy shall in no event be terminated or
materially modified without 30 days' prior written notice to the Master
Servicer.

                  Section 4.12 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance.

                  The Servicer shall maintain with responsible companies, at its
own expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance
Policy, with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting
in any capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or
papers relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Servicer Employees"). Any such Fidelity
Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the
Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Servicer against
losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Servicer Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the Servicer against
losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No
provision of this Section 4.12 requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Servicer from its
duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage
under any such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal to the
corresponding amounts required by the Master Servicer in the Servicer's Guide,
or, in the absence of such requirement, the corresponding amounts required by
Fannie Mae in the Fannie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities Selling and Servicing
Guide and by Freddie Mac in the Freddie Mac Sellers' & Servicers' Guide. Upon
the request of the Master Servicer, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to
the Master Servicer certificates evidencing that such policy and bond is in
effect and shall furnish to the Master Servicer a statement from the surety and
the insurer that such fidelity bond and insurance policy shall in no event be
terminated or materially modified without 30 days' prior written notice to the
Master Servicer.

                  Section 4.13 Inspections.

                  The Servicer shall inspect the Mortgaged Property as often as
deemed necessary by the Servicer to assure itself that the value of the
Mortgaged Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage Loan is more
than 60 days delinquent, the Servicer immediately shall inspect the Mortgaged
Property and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Accepted Servicing Practices or as may be required by the primary mortgage
guaranty insurer. The Servicer shall keep a written report of each such
inspection.

                  Section 4.14 Restoration of Mortgaged Property.

                  The Servicer need not obtain the approval of the Owner prior
to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the Mortgagor to
be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property if such
release is in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices and in an amount not
in excess of $5,000. At a minimum, the Servicer shall comply with the following
conditions in connection with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds:

                     (i) the Servicer shall receive satisfactory independent
         verification of completion of repairs and issuance of any required
         approvals with respect thereto;

                     (ii) the Servicer shall take all steps necessary to
         preserve the priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not
         limited to requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and
         materialmen's liens;

                     (iii) the Servicer shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is
         not in default; and

                     (iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Servicer shall
         place the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow
         Account.

                  If the Owner is named as an additional loss payee, the
Servicer is hereby empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such
a claim in the name of the Owner.

                  Section 4.15 Servicing and Administration of Mortgage
Insurance Policies.

                  (a) With respect to each Mortgage Loan covered by a PMI
Policy, the Servicer shall, without any cost to the Owner, maintain or cause the
Mortgagor to maintain in full force and effect such PMI Policy and shall pay or
shall cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a timely basis. In the
event that such PMI Policy shall be terminated, the Servicer shall obtain from
another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage
equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy. Subject to
Accepted Servicing Practices and applicable law (including the Homeowner's
Protection Act of 1998, as amended, and its implementing regulations), the
Servicer may cancel a PMI Policy, provided all requirements of applicable law
are met for the cancellation of such policy. If the insurer shall cease to be a
Qualified Insurer, the Servicer shall determine whether recoveries under the PMI
Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial condition of such
insurer, it being understood that the Servicer shall in no event have any
responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under the PMI Policy for
such reason. If the Servicer determines that recoveries are so jeopardized, it
shall notify the Owner and the Mortgagor, if required, and obtain from another
Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance policy. The Servicer shall not take
any action which would result in noncoverage under any applicable PMI Policy of
any loss which, but for the actions of the Servicer would have been covered
thereunder. In connection with any assumption or substitution agreement entered
into or to be entered into pursuant to Section 6.01, the Servicer


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

shall promptly notify the insurer under the related PMI Policy, if any, of such
assumption or substitution of liability in accordance with the terms of such PMI
Policy and shall take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a
condition to the continuation of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI
Policy is terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of
liability, the Servicer shall obtain a replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

                  (b) With respect to each Mortgage Loan which has an LPMI
Policy, the Servicer shall maintain in full force and effect such LPMI Policy,
and from time to time, withdraw the premium with respect to such Mortgage Loans
from the Custodial Account in order to pay the premium thereon on a timely
basis. In the event that the interest payments made with respect to the Mortgage
Loan are less than the premium with respect to the LPMI Policy, the Servicer
shall advance from its own funds the amount of any such shortfall in the LPMI
Policy premiums, in payment of such premium. Any such advance shall be a
Servicing Advance subject to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions on Section
4.05. In the event that such LPMI Policy shall be terminated, the Servicer shall
obtain from another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a
total coverage equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated LPMI Policy,
at substantially the same fee level. If the insurer shall cease to be a
Qualified Insurer, the Servicer shall determine whether recoveries under the
LPMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial condition of
such insurer, it being understood that the Servicer shall in no event have any
responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under the LPMI Policy for
such reason. If the Servicer determines that recoveries are so jeopardized, it
shall notify the Master Servicer and obtain from another Qualified Insurer a
replacement insurance policy. The Servicer shall not take any action which would
result in noncoverage under any applicable LPMI Policy of any loss which, but
for the actions of the Servicer would have been covered thereunder. In
connection with any assumption or substitution agreement entered into or to be
entered into pursuant to Section 6.01, the Servicer shall promptly notify the
insurer under the related LPMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or
substitution of liability in accordance with the terms of such LPMI Policy and
shall take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to
the continuation of coverage under such LPMI Policy. If such LPMI Policy is
terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the
Servicer shall obtain a replacement LPMI Policy as provided above.

                  (c) In connection with its activities as servicer, the
Servicer agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Owner,
claims to the insurer under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in
accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard,
to take such action as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI
Policy or LPMI Policy respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Any amounts
collected by the Servicer under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account.

                  (d) The Owner, in its sole discretion, at any time, may
(i) either obtain an additional PMI Policy on any Mortgage Loan which already
has an PMI Policy in place, or (ii) obtain a PMI Policy for any Mortgage Loan
which does not already have a PMI Policy in place. In any event, the Servicer
agrees to administer such PMI Policies or LPMI Policies in accordance with this
Agreement.

                  Section 4.16 Title, Management and Disposition of REO
Property.

                  In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired
in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of
sale shall be taken in the name of the Servicer or its designee (or MERS, as
applicable) or such other Person as may be designated by the Master Servicer, or
in the event the Servicer or its designee (or MERS, as applicable) is not
authorized or permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the
REO Property is located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing
business" or tax laws of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate
of sale shall be taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be
consistent with an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Servicer from any attorney
duly licensed to practice law in the state where the REO Property is located.
The Person or Persons holding such title other than the Owner shall acknowledge
in writing that such title is being held as nominee for the Owner.

                  The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
REO Property for the Owner solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and
sale. The Servicer, either itself or through an agent selected by the Servicer,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner
that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for
its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same
locality as the REO Property is managed. The Servicer shall attempt to sell the
same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than one year,
except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as the Servicer
deems to be in the best interest of the Owner.

                  The Servicer shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO
Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event
within three years after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless (i) a
REMIC, FASIT or REIT election has not been made with respect to the arrangement
under which the Mortgage Loans and the REO Property are held and (ii) the
Servicer determines, and gives an appropriate notice to the Master Servicer to
such effect, that a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of
such REO Property. If a period longer than three years is permitted under the
foregoing sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, the Servicer shall
report monthly to the Master Servicer as to the progress being made in selling
such REO Property. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Servicer
shall not be required to provide financing for the sale of any REO Property.

                  The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and
hazard insurance with extended coverage in amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.

                  Subject to the approval of the Master Servicer as described in
this paragraph, the disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
Servicer at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Servicer
deems to be in the best interests of the Owner. Prior to acceptance by the
Servicer of an offer to sell any REO Property, the Servicer shall notify the
Master Servicer of such offer in writing which notification shall set forth all
material terms of said offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer
shall be deemed to have approved the


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

sale of any REO Property unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in
writing, within five (5) days after its receipt of the related Notice of Sale,
that it disapproves of the related sale, in which case the Servicer shall not
proceed with such sale. The proceeds of sale of the REO Property shall be
promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as practical thereafter the
expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Servicer shall reimburse itself for
any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid Servicing Fees and
unreimbursed advances made pursuant to Section 5.03, and on the Remittance Date
immediately following the Principal Prepayment Period in which such sale
proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such sale remaining in the
Custodial Account shall be distributed to the Owner.

                  With the prior consent of the Master Servicer, the Servicer
shall withdraw from the Custodial Account funds necessary to reimburse the
Servicer for costs and expenses approved by the Master Servicer and incurred by
the Servicer in connection with the proper operation, management and maintenance
of the REO Property, including the cost of maintaining any hazard insurance
pursuant to Section 4.10. The Servicer shall make monthly distributions on each
Remittance Date to the Owner of the net cash flow from the REO Property (which
shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses described in
this Section 4.16 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to time to
be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to
time, the Owner may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to one
or more REO Properties as provided by Section 11.02.

                  Section 4.17 Real Estate Owned Reports.

                  Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section
5.02, the Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer on or before the
Reporting Date of each month a statement with respect to any REO Property
covering the operation of such REO Property for the previous month and the
Servicer's efforts in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any
rental of such REO Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous
month. That statement shall be accompanied by such other information as the
Master Servicer or the Owner shall reasonably request.

                  Section 4.18 Liquidation Reports.

                  Upon the foreclosure sale of any Mortgaged Property or the
acquisition thereof by the Owner pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the
Servicer shall submit to the Master Servicer a liquidation report with respect
to such Mortgaged Property.

                  Section 4.19 Notification of Adjustments.

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan that is an ARM Mortgage
Loan, the Servicer shall adjust the Mortgage Interest Rate on the related
Interest Rate Adjustment Date in compliance with the requirements of applicable
law and the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note. The Servicer shall execute and
deliver any and all necessary notices required under


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

applicable law and the terms of the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage regarding
the Mortgage Interest Rate adjustments. The Servicer shall promptly, upon
written request therefor, deliver to the Owner such notifications and any
additional applicable data regarding such adjustments and the methods used to
calculate and implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery by the Servicer or
the receipt of notice from the Owner that the Servicer has failed to adjust a
Mortgage Interest Rate in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage
Note, the Servicer shall immediately deposit in the Custodial Account from its
own funds the amount of any interest loss or deferral caused the Owner thereby.

                  Section 4.20 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of
Mortgaged Property.

                  Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Servicer shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.

                  Section 4.21. MERS.

                  In the case of each MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan, at the
request of the Master Servicer, the Servicer shall record the Assignment of
Mortgage into MERS and shall create MERS identification numbers relating to each
Mortgage Loan in the manner required by MERS. The Servicer shall pay all MERS
registration fees. As soon as practicable after the Master Servicer's request
from time to time (but in no event more than 30 days thereafter with respect to
each Mortgage Loan that was a MERS Mortgage Loan as of the Commencement Date, or
90 days thereafter with respect to each Mortgage Loan that was a MERS Eligible
Mortgage Loan as of the Commencement Date), the Servicer shall take such actions
as are necessary to cause the Owner or any successor Owner to be clearly
identified as the owner of each MERS Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for
purposes of the system of recording transfers of beneficial ownership of
mortgages maintained by MERS. The Servicer shall maintain in good standing its
membership in MERS. In addition, the Servicer shall comply with all rules,
policies and procedures of MERS, including the Rules of Membership, as amended,
and the MERS Procedures Manual, as amended. With respect to all MERS Mortgage
Loans serviced hereunder, the Servicer shall promptly notify MERS as to any
transfer of beneficial ownership or release of any security interest in such
Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner, the Master Servicer
and any successor owner or successor servicer to the extent necessary to ensure
that any transfer of ownership or servicing is appropriately reflected on the
MERS system.

                  Section 4.22 Waiver of Prepayment Charges.

                  Except as provided below, the Servicer or any designee of the
Servicer shall not waive any Prepayment Charge with respect to any Mortgage
Loan. If the Servicer or its designee fails to collect a Prepayment Charge at
the time of the related prepayment of any Mortgage Loan subject to such
Prepayment Charge, the Servicer shall pay to the Owner at such time (by deposit
to the Custodial Account) an amount equal to the amount of the Prepayment Charge
not collected. Notwithstanding the above, the Servicer or its designee may waive
a Prepayment Charge without paying to the Owner the amount of such Prepayment
Charge only if the related


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

prepayment is not the result of a refinancing by the Servicer or its designee
and such waiver (i) relates to a defaulted Mortgage Loan or a reasonably
foreseeable default, such waiver is standard and customary in servicing similar
mortgage loans to the Mortgage Loans, and such waiver, in the reasonable
judgment of the Servicer, would maximize recovery of total proceeds from the
Mortgage Loan, taking into account the amount of such Prepayment Charge and the
related Mortgage Loan, or (ii) relates to a Prepayment Charge the collection of
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer, would be a violation of
applicable laws.

                  Section 4.23. Compliance With REMIC Provisions

                  If a REMIC election has been made with respect to the
arrangement under which any Mortgage Loans and REO Property are held, the
Servicer shall not take any action, cause the REMIC to take any action or fail
to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the REMIC
Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the
status of the REMIC as a REMIC, or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon
the REMIC (including but not limited to the tax on "prohibited transactions" as
defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on "contributions" to a
REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code) unless the Servicer has received
an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action)
to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger such REMIC status
or result in the imposition of any such tax.

                              PAYMENTS TO THE OWNER

                  Section 5.01 Remittances.

                  On each Remittance Date the Servicer shall remit by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Owner (a) all amounts deposited
in the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the Determination Date
(net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to
Section 4.05), plus (b) all amounts, if any, which the Servicer is obligated to
distribute pursuant to Section 5.03, minus (c) any amounts attributable to
Principal Prepayments received after the applicable Principal Prepayment Period
which amounts shall be remitted on the following Remittance Date, together with
any additional interest required to be deposited in the Custodial Account in
connection with such Principal Prepayment in accordance with Section 4.04(vii),
and minus (d) any amounts attributable to Monthly Payments collected but due on
a Due Date or Dates subsequent to the first day of the month of the Remittance
Date, which amounts shall be remitted on the Remittance Date next succeeding the
Due Period for such amounts.

                  With respect to any month in which the Servicer is servicing
both Reconstituted Mortgage Loans and Mortgage Loans that have not been subject
to a Reconstitution, the Servicer shall submit two (2) separate remittance wire
transfers to the Master Servicer, one relating to Reconstituted Mortgage Loans
and one relating to all Mortgage Loans that are not then subject to a
Reconstitution.

the Servicer shall pay to the Owner interest on any such late payment at an

plus four percentage points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account by the Servicer on the date such late payment is made and shall cover
the period commencing with the day following such second Business Day and ending
with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such
interest shall be remitted along with the distribution payable on the next
succeeding Remittance Date. The payment by the Servicer of any such interest

Default by the Servicer.

                  Section 5.02 Statements to Master Servicer.

                  Not later than the Reporting Date of each month, the Servicer
shall furnish to the Master Servicer a monthly remittance advice, with a trial
balance report attached thereto, in the form of Exhibit D-1 annexed hereto,
together with a delinquency report in the form of Exhibit D-2 annexed hereto, in
hard copy and electronic medium mutually acceptable to the parties as to the
period ending on the Record Date in the preceding calendar month. Such monthly
remittance advice shall also be accompanied with a supplemental report provided
to the Master Servicer and any other party designated by the Master Servicer
which includes on an aggregate basis for the previous Due Period (i) the amount
of claims filed under PMI Policies and LPMI Policies, (ii) the amount of any
claim payments made under PMI Policies and LPMI Policies, (iii) the amount of
claims denied or curtailed under PMI Policies and LPMI Policies and (iv) PMI
Policies canceled with respect to those Mortgage Loans covered by any PMI Policy
purchased by the Owner.

                  With respect to any month in which the Servicer is servicing
both Reconstituted Mortgage Loans and Mortgage Loans that have not been subject
to a Reconstitution, the Servicer shall submit all information required
hereunder in two (2) separate reports, one relating to Reconstituted Mortgage
Loans and one relating to all Mortgage Loans that are not then subject to a
Reconstitution.

                  Upon reasonable advance notice, the Servicer shall provide to
any Owner that is a savings and loan association, a bank, an insurance company
or other regulated or supervised entity reports and access to information and
documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated
hereby sufficient to permit the Owner to comply with the applicable regulations
of relevant regulatory or supervisory authorities with respect to its investment
in the Mortgage Loans and the Owner's internal and third-party audit
requirements.

                  The Servicer shall prepare and file any and all tax returns,
information statements or other filings required to be delivered to any
governmental taxing authority or to any Owner pursuant to any applicable law
with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, the Servicer shall provide each Owner and the Master Servicer with
such information concerning the Mortgage Loans as is necessary for such Owner to
prepare its federal income tax return as any Owner or the Master Servicer may
reasonably request from time to time.

                  Section 5.03 Monthly Advances by Servicer.

                  On the Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance
Date, the Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds an
amount equal to all Monthly Payments (with interest adjusted to the Mortgage
Loan Remittance Rate) which were due on the Mortgage Loans during the applicable
Due Period and which were delinquent at the close of business on the immediately
preceding Determination Date or which were deferred pursuant to Section 4.01.
The Servicer's obligation to make such Monthly Advances as to any Mortgage Loan
will continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior to the payment in full
of the Mortgage Loan, or through the last Remittance Date prior to the
Remittance Date for the distribution of all Liquidation Proceeds and other
payments or recoveries (including Insurance


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Proceeds and Condemnation Proceeds) with respect to the Mortgage Loan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not be required to make a
Monthly Advance with respect to a Mortgage Loan if such advance would, if made,
be, in the Servicer's reasonable judgment, non-recoverable from future
recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property. The
determination by the Servicer that any advance of funds is or would be
non-recoverable shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of the Servicer
delivered to the Master Servicer.

                  Section 5.04 Failure to Provide Timely Reports.

                  In the event the Services fails to provide any reports
required hereunder to the Owner and Master Servicer accurately, completely and
timely, in order to compensate the Master servicer for the additional
administrative burden of processing such inaccurate, incomplete or untimely
reports, and in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Owner or the
Master Servicer may have, the Servicer shall pay the following fees to the
Master Servicer.

                    1.   For the first such failure, the amount of $1,000;

                    2.   For the second such failure, the amount of $1,500; and

                    3.   For the third such failure and each failure thereafter,
                         the amount of $2,500;

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the fourth
such failure in any successive twenty-four month period shall, at the option of
the Master Servicer, constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement without
any cure period available to the Servicer.

                  Section 5.05 Credit Reporting.

                  For each Mortgage Loan, in accordance with Accepted Servicing
Practices, the Servicer will accurately and fully report its underlying borrower
credit files to each of the following credit repositories or their successors:
Equifax Credit Information Services, Inc., Trans Union, LLC and Experian
Information Solution, Inc., on a monthly basis in a timely manner.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

                  Section 6.01 Transfers of Mortgaged Property.

                  The Servicer shall use its best efforts to enforce any
"due-on-sale" provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny
assumption by the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to
be sold whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or
not the Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to
the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, exercise its rights to
accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause
applicable thereto, provided,


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

however, that the Servicer shall not exercise such rights if prohibited by law
from doing so or if the exercise of such rights would impair or threaten to
impair any recovery under the related PMI Policy or LPMI Policy, if any.

                  If the Servicer reasonably believes it is unable under
applicable law to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Servicer shall enter
into (i) an assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such
property has been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under
the Mortgage Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in
the event the Servicer is unable under applicable law to require that the
original Mortgagor remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Servicer has
the prior consent of the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of
liability agreement with the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to
which the original Mortgagor is released from liability and the purchaser of the
Mortgaged Property is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the
Mortgage Note. If an assumption fee is collected by the Servicer for entering
into an assumption agreement, a portion of such fee, up to an amount equal to
one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the outstanding principal balance of the
related Mortgage Loan, will be retained by the Servicer as additional servicing
compensation, and any portion thereof in excess of one-half of one percent
(0.5%) shall be deposited in the Custodial Account for the benefit of the Owner.
In connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne
by the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

                  To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the
Servicer shall inquire diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed
transferee, and shall use the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of
the proposed transferee which are used by Fannie Mae with respect to
underwriting mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. If the
credit of the proposed transferee does not meet such underwriting criteria, the
Servicer diligently shall, to the extent permitted by the Mortgage or the
Mortgage Note and by applicable law, accelerate the maturity of the Mortgage
Loan.

                  Section 6.02 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage
Files.

                  Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt
by the Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a
manner customary for such purposes, the Servicer shall notify the Owner and the
Master Servicer in the Monthly Remittance Advice as provided in Section 5.02,
and may request the release of any Mortgage Loan Documents.

                  If the Servicer satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or
should the Servicer otherwise prejudice any rights the Owner may have under the
mortgage instruments, upon written demand of the Owner, the Servicer shall
repurchase the related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price by deposit thereof
in the Custodial Account within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such demand
by the Owner. The Servicer shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 4.12 insuring the Servicer
against any loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not satisfied
in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

                  Section 6.03 Servicing Compensation.

                  As compensation for its services hereunder, the Servicer shall
be entitled to withdraw from the Custodial Account or to retain from interest
payments on the Mortgage Loans the amount of its Servicing Fee. The Servicing
Fee shall be payable monthly and shall be computed on the basis of the same
unpaid principal balance and for the period respecting which any related
interest payment on a Mortgage Loan is computed. The Servicing Fee shall be
payable only at the time of and with respect to those Mortgage Loans for which
payment is in fact made of the entire amount of the Monthly Payment. The
obligation of the Owner to pay the Servicing Fee is limited to, and payable
solely from, the interest portion of such Monthly Payments collected by the
Servicer.

                  Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption
fees, to the extent provided in Section 6.01, and late payment charges shall be
retained by the Servicer to the extent not required to be deposited in the
Custodial Account. Prepayment Charges shall be the property of the Owner and
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account in accordance with Section 4.22. The
Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with
its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement
thereof except as specifically provided for herein.

                  Section 6.04 Annual Statement as to Compliance.

                  The Servicer shall deliver to the Master Servicer, on or
before March 31 each year beginning with March 31 of the year following the date
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, an Officer's Certificate,
stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during the preceding
calendar year and of performance under this Agreement has been made under such
officer's supervision, (ii) the Servicer has complied fully with the provisions
of Article II and Article IV, and (iii) to the best of such officer's knowledge,
based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations under this
Agreement throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the
fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such
officer and the nature and status thereof and the action being taken by the
Servicer to cure such default.

                  Section 6.05 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
Report.

                  On or before March 31st of each year beginning with March 31
of the year following the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a firm of independent public
accountants which is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants to furnish a statement to the Master Servicer to the effect that,
with respect to the most recently ended fiscal year, such firm has examined
certain documents and records relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans
and the Servicer's performance of its servicing obligations under this Agreement
and that such firm is of the opinion that the provisions of Article II and
Article IV have been complied with, and that, on the basis of such examination
conducted substantially in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation
Program for Mortgage Bankers, nothing has come to their attention which would
indicate that such servicing has not been conducted in compliance therewith,
except for (i) such exceptions as such


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

firm shall believe to be immaterial; and (ii) such other exceptions as shall be
set forth in such statement.

                  Section 6.06 Right to Examine Servicer Records.

                  The Owner and the Master Servicer shall have the right to
examine and audit any and all of the books, records, or other information of the
Servicer, whether held by the Servicer or by another on its behalf, with respect
to or concerning this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans or the performance by the
Servicer of its obligations hereunder, during business hours or at such other
times as may be reasonable under applicable circumstances, upon reasonable
advance notice.

                  The Servicer shall provide to the Owner, the Master Servicer
and any supervisory agents or examiners representing a state or federal
governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Owner or the Master Servicer,
including without limitation the OTS, the FDIC and other similar entities,
access to any documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans in the possession of
the Servicer that is required by any applicable regulations. Such access shall
be afforded without charge, upon reasonable request, during normal business
hours, at the offices of the Servicer and in accordance with any applicable
regulations.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                         RECONSTITUTION; MASTER SERVICER

                  Section 7.01 Reconstitution.

                  The Owner and the Servicer agree that with respect to some or
all of the Mortgage Loans, from time to time the Owner shall effect an Agency
Transfer, a Pass-Through Transfer or a Whole Loan Transfer, in each case
retaining the Servicer as the servicer thereof, or as applicable, the
"seller/servicer". Any Mortgage Loans that have been transferred by the initial
Owner pursuant to an Agency Transfer, a Pass-Through Transfer or a Whole Loan
Transfer may be referred to as "Reconstituted Mortgage Loans",

                  The Servicer shall cooperate fully with the Owner in
connection with any Reconstitution contemplated by the Owner pursuant to this
Section 7.01, including without limitation providing requested information and
reports to, and otherwise cooperating with, rating agencies, trustees,
securities administrators, guarantors, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, third party
purchasers or credit risk managers, as applicable. In that connection, the
Servicer shall provide to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee, master servicer
or a third party purchaser, as the case may be, and/or the Owner: (i) any and
all information and appropriate verification of information which may be
reasonably available to the Servicer, including the Servicer's foreclosure and
delinquency experience, whether through letters of its auditors and counsel or
otherwise, as the Owner shall request; and (ii) such additional representations,
warranties, covenants, opinions of counsel, letters from auditors, and
certificates of public officials or officers of the Servicer as are reasonably
believed necessary by any Reconstitution Party, rating agency or the Owner, as
the case may be, in connection with such Reconstitution transactions. In
addition, the Servicer shall


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

indemnify the Owner and any Reconstitution Party for any material misstatements
contained in the information provided pursuant to the preceding sentence that
the Owner may disclose in any securitization offering materials.

                  The Owner or the Master Servicer shall provide the Servicer
with notice with respect to any such Reconstitution in the form of Exhibit F
hereto (each, a "Transfer Notice"), including a schedule of Mortgage Loans which
have been transferred and the effective date of the Reconstitution (the
"Effective Date"), the Cut-Off Date, the Master Servicer, the new Owner, and
whether or not the Mortgage Loans are owned by a REMIC. Upon receipt of a
Transfer Notcie, the Servicer shall promptly countersign and return the Transfer
Notice to the Master Servicer. Upon the Effective Date of such a transfer, (A)
the Servicer and Owner agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in effect, and (B) the Servicer agrees to recognize Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the
trustee, trust or third party purchaser of the transferred Mortgage Loans in
such Reconstitution as the "Owner" of such Mortgage Loans, having the same
rights under this Agreement as the initial Owner with respect to such
transferred Mortgage Loans.

                  In connection with any Reconstitution and at the request of
the Owner or the Master Servicer, on not less than five (5) days notice, the
Servicer shall execute and deliver a certificate, in form and substance
acceptable to the Owner, acknowledging and certifying to the Owner and the
Master Servicer that: (i) the Servicer has received the Transfer Notice, and
attaching the related schedule of Mortgage Loans included in such Reconstitution
(which schedule shall include such Mortgage Loan data as may reasonably be
requested by the Owner or the Master Servicer), (ii) this Agreement is in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms, (iii) no Event of Default has
occurred under this Agreement, nor does there exist any state of facts that,
with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event
of Default under this Agreement, (iv) each of the representations and warranties
of the Servicer contained in Section 3.01 are true and correct as of the related
Effective Date as if made on such date and (v) the Servicer agrees to recognize
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mace, the trustee, trust or third party purchaser of the
transferred Mortgage Loans in such Agency Transfer, Whole Loan Transfer or
Pass-Through Transfer as the "Owner" of the related Mortgage Loans, having the
same rights under this Agreement as the initial Owner with respect to such
Mortgage Loans

                  With respect to each MERS Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
take such actions as are necessary to cause Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee
or such third party, as the case may be, to be clearly identified as the owner
of each MERS Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for purposes of the system of
recording transfers of beneficial ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS.

                  Section 7.02 Master Servicer; Servicer's Guide.

                  (a) The Owner has appointed Aurora Loan Services Inc., or
such other master servicer as may be identified in a Transfer Notice, to act as
master servicer of the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall correspond,
communicate and report solely to the Master Servicer, as if the Master Servicer
were the "Owner" hereunder. All amounts due to the Owner under this Agreement
shall be remitted to the Master Servicer in accordance with the Master
Servicer's instructions. Furthermore, the Master Servicer shall have all rights
as designee of the Owner to


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

enforce the representations and warranties, and all other covenants and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and the Servicer shall follow and shall
be entitled to rely on the instructions of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement as if such instructions were the instructions of the Owner. The Master
Servicer shall have the right to give any waivers or consents required or
allowed under this Agreement on behalf of the Owner, and the Servicer shall have
the right to rely on all such waivers and consents. The Master Servicer shall be
empowered to enter into and execute and deliver any amendments or modifications
to this Agreement as the Owner's designee hereunder, and such amendments or
modifications shall be binding upon the Owner as if the Owner had executed and
delivered the same. The Master Servicer may, at any time, without the Servicer's
consent, direct in writing that all or part of the functions of the Master
Servicer be performed by another entity designated by the Master Servicer for
such functions and time periods as the Master Servicer deems appropriate. The
Owner may, at any time (but subject to any agreements between the Owner and the
Master Servicer), without the Servicer's consent, appoint a successor master
servicer to act as master servicer with respect to some or all of the Mortgage
Loans serviced by the Servicer hereunder. In such case, any successor Master
Servicer has the right to assume the Master Servicer's rights and obligations
and to enforce Servicer's obligations hereunder.

                  (b) Upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the
Servicer, the Master Servicer may publish a Servicer's Guide (as the same may be
modified or amended from time to time, the "Servicer's Guide"), which shall set
forth various terms, provisions and procedures governing the administration and
servicing of the Mortgage Loans; provided, that the Servicer's Guide shall not
materially and adversely increase the obligations of the Servicer arising under
this Agreement. If the Servicer does not notify the Master Servicer in writing
within such thirty (30) day period that the Servicer objects to the Servicer's
Guide or any provisions thereof, the Servicer shall be deemed to have agreed to
be bound and abide by the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the
Servicer's Guide. Thereafter, the Master Servicer may amend the Servicer's Guide
from time to time to: (i) correct ambiguous or erroneous provisions; (ii) make
changes necessary or helpful to maintain compliance with Acceptable Servicing
Practices; or (iii) make such other modifications that the Master Servicer deems
advisable that do not materially and adversely increase the obligations of, or
decrease the benefits to, the Servicer. Each such amendment will be made by
means of a written notice to the Servicer. The written notice will specify the
terms of the amendment and the effective date. If the Servicer does not notify
the Master Servicer in writing that the Servicer objects to such amendment prior
to the proposed effective date specified in the Notice, the Servicer shall be
deemed to have agreed to the amendment, and such amendment shall automatically
become effective without any further notice or action on the part of the Master
Servicer or the Servicer. Amendments to the Servicer's Guide shall be made with
the consent of the Owner of the Mortgage Loans, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed; provided, that the failure of the Master
Servicer to obtain the consent of the Owner to any amendment shall not impair
the enforceability of any such amendment against the Servicer. To the extent of
any conflict between the express provisions of this Agreement and the provisions
of the Servicer's Guide, the express provisions of this Agreement shall control.
The failure by the Servicer to perform obligations under the Servicer's Guide
shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement.

                              SERVICER TO COOPERATE

                  Section 8.01 Provision of Information.

                  During the term of this Agreement, the Servicer shall furnish
to the Owner such periodic, special, or other reports or information and copies
or originals of any documents contained in the Servicing File for each Mortgage
Loan, whether or not provided for herein, as shall be necessary, reasonable, or
appropriate with respect to the Owner, any regulatory requirement pertaining to
the Owner or the purposes of this Agreement. All such reports, documents or
information shall be provided by and in accordance with all reasonable
instructions and directions which the Owner may give.

                  The Servicer shall execute and deliver all such instruments
and take all such action as the Owner may reasonably request from time to time,
in order to effectuate the purposes and to carry out the terms of this
Agreement.

                  Section 8.02 Financial Statements; Servicing Facility.

                  In connection with marketing the Mortgage Loans, the Owner may
make available to a prospective Owner a Consolidated Statement of Operations of
the Servicer for the most recently completed three fiscal years for which such a
statement is available, as well as a Consolidated Statement of Condition at the
end of the last two fiscal years covered by such Consolidated Statement of
Operations. The Servicer also shall make available any comparable interim
statements to the extent any such statements have been prepared by or on behalf
of the Servicer (and are available upon request to members or stockholders of
the Servicer or to the public at large). If it has not already done so, the
Servicer shall furnish promptly to the Owner copies of the statement specified
above.

                  The Servicer also shall make available to the Owner or
prospective Owner a knowledgeable financial or accounting officer for the
purpose of answering questions respecting recent developments affecting the
Servicer or the financial statements of the Servicer, and to permit any
prospective Owner to inspect the Servicer's servicing facilities for the purpose
of satisfying such prospective Owner that the Servicer have the ability to
service the Mortgage Loans as provided in this Agreement.

                                  THE SERVICER

                  Section 9.01 Indemnification; Third Party Claims.

                  The Servicer shall indemnify the Owner, the Master Servicer
and each Reconstitution Party, and hold each of them harmless against any and
all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, and forfeitures, including, but
not limited to reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other
costs, fees and expenses that either of them may sustain in any way related to
(i) the failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the Mortgage
Loans in material compliance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) the
failure of the Servicer to cause any event to occur which would have occurred if
the Servicer were applying Accepted Servicing Practices under this Agreement.
The Servicer immediately shall notify the Owner and the Master Servicer if a
claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage
Loans, assume (with the prior written consent of the Master Servicer) the
defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith,
including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or
decree which may be entered against it or the Owner, the Master Servicer or any
Reconstitution Party in respect of such claim. The Servicer shall follow any
written instructions received from the Owner or the Master Servicer in
connection with such claim.

                  Section 9.02 Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer.

                  The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises as a corporation, and shall obtain and preserve its qualification
to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform its
duties under this Agreement.

                  Any person into which the Servicer may be merged or
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or any Person succeeding
to the business of the Servicer, shall be the successor of the Servicer
hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person shall
be an institution (i) having a net worth of not less than $15,000,000 and (ii)
which is a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-approved servicer in good standing.

                  Section 9.03 Limitation on Liability of Servicer and Others.

                  Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Owner
for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good
faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in judgment, provided, however,
that this provision shall not protect the Servicer or any such person against
any Breach of warranties or representations made herein, or failure to perform
its obligations in


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

strict compliance with any standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Servicer and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any
kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any
matters arising hereunder. The Servicer shall not be under any obligation to
appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to its
duties to service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which
in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability, provided, however,
that the Servicer may, with the consent of the Owner, undertake any such action
which it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties hereto. In such event, the Servicer shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Owner the reasonable legal expenses and costs
of such action.

                  Section 9.04 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by
Servicer.

                  The Owner has entered into this Agreement with the Servicer
and subsequent Owners will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the
independent status of the Servicer, and the representations as to the adequacy
of its servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and procedures, its
integrity, reputation and financial standing, and the continuance thereof.
Therefore, the Servicer shall neither assign this Agreement or the servicing
hereunder or delegate its rights or duties hereunder or any portion hereof or
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets
without the prior written consent of the Owner, which consent shall be granted
or withheld in the sole discretion of the Owner. For purposes hereof, a merger,
consolidation or sale of a majority of the equity interests or voting power of
the Servicer shall be deemed an assignment of this Agreement.

                  The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties
hereby imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Servicer and the Owner or
upon the determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Servicer. Any such
determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by
an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Owner which Opinion of
Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Owner. No such
resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the
Servicer's responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in
Section 12.01.

                  Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section
9.04, in the event that the Servicer either shall assign this Agreement or the
servicing responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any
portion thereof or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
property or assets, without the prior written consent of the Owner, then the
Owner shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set
forth in Section 10.01, without any payment of any penalty or damages and
without any liability whatsoever to the Servicer or any third party.

                  Section 9.05 Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and
Loss of REMIC Status.

                  In the event that any REMIC under which any of the Mortgage
Loans are held


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

from time to time fails to qualify as a REMIC, loses its status as a REMIC, or
incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result of a prohibited transaction or
prohibited contribution under the REMIC Provisions due to the negligent
performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set forth herein, the
Servicer shall indemnify the Reconstitution Parties against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from such
negligence; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be liable for any
such Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Reconstitution
Parties, nor for any such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by the
Reconstitution Parties on which the Servicer has relied. The foregoing shall not
be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Reconstitution
Parties now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no event shall the Servicer have any
liability (1) for any action or omission that is taken in accordance with and in
compliance with the express terms of, or which is expressly permitted by the
terms of, this Agreement, (2) for any Losses other than arising out of a
negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set forth
herein, and (3) for any special or consequential damages.

                  Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default on
the part of the Servicer:

                           (i) any failure by the Servicer to remit to the Owner
         any payment required to be made under the terms of this Agreement which
         continues unremedied for a period of two days after the date when such
         payment is due hereunder; or

                           (ii) failure by the Servicer duly to observe or
         perform in any material respect any other of the covenants or
         agreements on the part of the Servicer set forth in this Agreement
         which continues unremedied for a period of 20 days (or (x) 5 days, in
         the case of a failure to provide any monthly reports required pursuant
         to this Agreement and (y)10 days, in the case of a failure to maintain
         any insurance policy required to be maintained pursuant to this
         Agreement) after the date on which written notice of such failure,
         requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
         Servicer by the Master Servicer, the Owner or by the Custodian; or

                           (iii) failure by the Servicer to maintain its license
         to do business in any jurisdiction where the Mortgage Property is
         located; or

                           (iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or
         supervisory authority having jurisdiction for the appointment of a
         conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
         of debt, including bankruptcy, marshaling of assets and liabilities or
         similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its
         affairs, shall

<PAGE>

         have been entered against the Servicer and such decree or order shall
         have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60
         days; or

                           (v) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of
         a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
         of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of
         or relating to the Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially
         all of its property; or

                           (vi) the Servicer shall admit in writing its
         inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a
         petition to take advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or
         reorganization statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its
         creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations or cease its
         normal business operations for three (3) Business Days; or

                           (vii) the Servicer ceases to meet the qualifications
         of a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac approved servicer; or

                           (viii) the Servicer fails to maintain a minimum net
         worth, determined in accordance with United States Generally Accepted
         Accounting Principles, of $15,000,000 as of any date; or

                           (ix) the Servicer, if it is an Insured Depository
         Institution, shall become the subject of a cease and desist order of
         the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency or enter into a memorandum of
         understanding, consent agreement or any similar agreement with the
         Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, any of which, would have or is
         purportedly the result of, any condition which would have a material
         adverse effect on the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer, or the Servicer's
         ability to service the Mortgage Loans as provided hereunder; or

                           (x) the Servicer, if it is an Insured Depository

         substantially all of its property or assets or to assign this Agreement
         or the servicing responsibilities hereunder or to delegate its duties
         hereunder or any portion thereof in violation of Section 9.04; or

                           (xii) an Event of Default arising under Section 5.04
         hereof.

                  In each and every such case, so long as an Event of Default
shall not have been remedied, in addition to whatsoever rights the Owner or the
Master Servicer may have at law or equity to damages, including injunctive
relief and specific performance, the Owner or the Master Servicer, by notice in
writing to the Servicer, may terminate all the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds
thereof.

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

                  Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all
authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect
to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the successor
appointed pursuant to Section 12.01. Upon written request from any Owner or the
Master Servicer, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the
successor entity designated by the Owner or the Master Servicer any and all
documents and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
Mortgage Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, including but
not limited to the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans
and related documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The Servicer shall
cooperate with the Owner, the Master Servicer and such successor in effecting
the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder,
including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for administration
by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to
the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to
the Mortgage Loans.

                  Section 10.02 Waiver of Defaults.

                  By a written notice, the Owner may waive any default by the
Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences.
Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for
every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent
expressly so waived.

                  Section 10.03. Survival of Obligations and Liabilities of the
Servicer.

                  The representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and
agreements of the parties provided in this Agreement and the parties'
obligations hereunder shall survive the execution and delivery and the
termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any termination of
the rights and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to this Article 10, the
Servicer shall remain liable for any actions of the Servicer taken prior to the
effective time of such termination. Any cause of action against the Servicer
relating to or arising out of the breach of its obligations under this Agreement
shall accrue upon (i) discovery of such Breach by the Servicer or notice thereof
by the Owner to the Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer to cure such breach
within the applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the Servicer by the
Owner for compliance with this Agreement.

                  Section 11.01 Termination.

                  This Agreement shall terminate upon either: (i) the later of
the final payment or other liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of
the last Mortgage Loan or the disposition of any REO Property with respect to
the last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

funds due hereunder; (ii) mutual consent of the Servicer and the Owner in
writing; or (iii) termination with or without cause under the terms of this
Agreement.

                  Section 11.02 Termination Without Cause.

                  The Initial Owner may terminate, at its sole option, any
rights the Servicer may have hereunder, without cause, as provided in this
Section 11.02. Any such notice of termination shall be in writing and delivered
to the Servicer by mail as provided in Section 12.05. The Owner and the Servicer
shall comply with the termination procedures set forth in Section 12.01 hereof,
provided that, in the event that the Initial Owner terminates this Agreement
without cause in accordance with this Section, the Initial Owner shall pay to
the Servicer a termination fee equal to two percent (2.0%) of the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the termination date.
Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event that (i) a
Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a period of 120 days or more (a "Delinquent
Mortgage Loan"), (ii) a Mortgage Loan becomes an REO Property or (iii) at any
time after the second anniversary of the date hereof there are fewer than [20]
Mortgage Loans that are not Reconstituted Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder, the
Owner may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to such
Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property or, in the case of (iii) above, all of
the remaining Mortgage Loans that are not Reconstituted Mortgage Loans, without
payment of a termination fee therefor, upon 15 days' written notice to the

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                  Section 12.01 Successor to Servicer.

                  Prior to termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and
duties under this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.04, 10.01, 11.01(ii) or
11.02, the Master Servicer shall (i) succeed to and assume all of the Servicer's
responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this Agreement or (ii)
appoint a successor having the characteristics set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
of Section 9.02 and which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement
prior to the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
liabilities under this Agreement. In connection with such appointment and
assumption, the Master Servicer may make such arrangements for the compensation
of such successor out of payments on Mortgage Loans as it and such successor
shall agree. In the event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities and
liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the
aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties and
responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires knowledge of such
termination until the effective date thereof with the same degree of diligence
and prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall
take no action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial
condition of its successor. The resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant
to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective until a successor
shall be appointed pursuant to this Section 12.01 and shall in no event relieve
the Servicer of the representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections
3.01 and the remedies available to the Owner under Section 3.02, it being
understood and agreed that the


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

provisions of such Sections 3.01 and 3.02 shall be applicable to the Servicer
notwithstanding any such sale, assignment, resignation or termination of the
Servicer, or the termination of this Agreement.

                  Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
than 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall
prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity any and all documents and
other instruments, place in such successor's possession all Servicing Files, and
do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to
effect the purposes of such notice of termination. The Servicer shall cooperate
with the Owner and the Master Servicer, as applicable, and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or any Escrow Account or thereafter
received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

                  Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Servicer and to the Owner an instrument accepting
such appointment, wherein the successor shall make the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.01, whereupon such successor shall become
fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations
and liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect as if originally named as a
party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation of the Servicer or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.04, 10.01, 11.01 or 11.02
shall not affect any claims that any Owner or the Master Servicer may have
against the Servicer arising out of the Servicer's actions or failure to act
prior to any such termination or resignation.

                  The Servicer shall deliver promptly (but in all events within
ten (10) Business Days) to the successor servicer the funds in the Custodial
Account and Escrow Account and all Mortgage Files and related documents and
statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer shall account for all funds and
shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may
reasonably be required to more fully and definitively vest in the successor all
such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of
the Servicer.

                  Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
Servicer shall notify the Owner and Master Servicer of such appointment in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12.05.

                  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any transfer of servicing as a
consequence of termination or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 10.01,
including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of the Owner or Master
Servicer or any other Person in appointing a successor servicer, or of the
Master Servicer in assuming the responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder, or
of transferring the Servicing Files and the other necessary data to the
successor servicer shall be paid by the terminated, removed or resigning
Servicer from its own funds without reimbursement.

<PAGE>

provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which is prohibited or

constitute one and the same agreement. Subject to Section 9.04, this Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Servicer and the Owner and
their respective successors and assigns.

jurisdictions in which any or all of the Mortgaged Properties are situated, and

Servicer or any affiliate of the Servicer which are directed to the general

                                     FORM OF
                              OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE

I, ____________________, hereby certify that I am the duly elected [Vice]
President of [_______________], a corporation organized under the laws of the
State of [_________], (the "Servicer") and further as follows: --------

                  1. Attached hereto as Attachment 1 is a true, correct and
         complete copy of the Articles of Incorporation of the Servicer which is
         in full force and effect on the date hereof and which has been in
         effect without amendment, waiver, rescission or modification since
         ____________.

                  2. Attached hereto as Attachment 2 is a true, correct and
         complete copy of the bylaws of the Servicer which are in effect on the
         date hereof and which have been in effect without amendment, waiver,
         rescission or modification.

                  3. Attached hereto as Attachment 3 is an original certificate
         of good standing of the Servicer, issued within ____ days of the date
         hereof by the secretary of State of the state of ________________, and
         no event has occurred since the date thereof which would impair such
         standing.

                  4. Each person who, as an officer or representative of the
         Servicer, signed the Correspondent Servicing Agreement, dated as of
         [DATE] (the "Servicing Agreement"), by and between the Servicer, Lehman
         Brothers Bank, FSB (the "Owner") and Aurora Loan Services Inc. (the
         "Master Servicer"), and any other document delivered prior hereto or on
         the date hereof in connection with the Agreement, was, at the
         respective times of such signing and delivery, and is now, a duly
         elected or appointed, qualified and acting officer or representative of
         the Servicer, and the signatures of such persons appearing on such
         documents are their genuine signatures.

                  5. To the best of my knowledge, either (i) no consent,
         approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or
         body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the
         Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with the Agreement or the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; or (ii)
         any required consent, approval, authorization or order has been
         obtained by the Servicer.

                  6. To the best of my knowledge, neither the consummation of
         the transactions contemplated by, nor the fulfillment of the terms of
         the Servicing Agreement, conflicts or will conflict with or results or
         will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default
         under the charter or by-laws of the Servicer, the terms of any
         indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Servicer is a
         party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or any statute
         or order, rule, regulations,

                                      -D-1-

<PAGE>

         writ, injunction or decree of any court, governmental authority or
         regulatory body to which the Servicer is subject or by which it is
         bound.

                  7. To the best of my knowledge, there is no action, suit,
         proceeding or investigation pending or threatened against the Servicer
         which, in my judgment, either in any one instance or in the aggregate,
         may result in any material adverse change in the business, operations,
         financial condition, properties or assets of the Servicer or in any
         material impairment of the right or ability of the Servicer to carry on
         its business substantially as now conducted or in any material
         liability on the part of the Servicer or which would draw into question
         the validity of the Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in
         connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or which would be
         likely to impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform
         under the terms of the Agreement.

                  9. The Servicer is duly authorized to engage in the
         transactions described and contemplated in the Servicing Agreement.

                                     FORM OF
                               OPINION OF COUNSEL


[DATE]




Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB
Three World Financial Center
New York, New York 10285

Aurora Loan Services Inc.
2530 South Parker Road
Suite 600
Aurora, Colorado 80014

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have requested my opinion, as legal counsel to COLONIAL SAVINGS, F.A. (the
"Servicer"), with respect to certain matters in connection with the servicing by
the Servicer of the Mortgage Loans pursuant to that certain Correspondent
Servicing Agreement, dated as of [DATE] (the "Servicing Agreement"), by and
between the Servicer, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (the "Owner") and Aurora Loan
Services Inc. (the "Master Servicer"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.

I have examined the Servicing Agreement and such other documents, records and
papers as I have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for this opinion.

To the extent I have deemed necessary and proper, I have relied upon the
representations and warranties of the Servicer contained in the Servicing
Agreement. I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as
originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural
persons and the conformity to the originals of all documents.

Subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:

1. The Servicer is a duly organized, validly existing corporation in good
standing under the laws of the State of [____________] and is authorized to
service and administer the Mortgage Loans in the states where the Mortgaged
Properties are located.

2. The Servicer has the power to engage in the transactions contemplated by the
Servicing Agreement and all requisite power, authority and legal right to
execute and deliver the Servicing Agreement, and to perform and observe the
terms and conditions of such instrument.

                                      -E-1-
<PAGE>

3. The Servicing Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Servicer and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable in
accordance with its respective terms against the Servicer, subject to bankruptcy
laws and other similar laws of general application affecting rights of creditors
and subject to the application of the rules of equity, including those
respecting the availability of specific performance.

4. Either (i) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or
governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and
performance by the Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with the Servicing
Agreement, or the servicing of the Mortgage Loans or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Servicing Agreement; or (ii) any required
consent, approval, authorization or order has been obtained by the Servicer.

5. Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, nor the
fulfillment of the terms of, the Servicing Agreement conflicts or will conflict
with or results or will result in a breach of, or constitutes or will constitute
a default under, the organization documents of the Servicer, the terms of any
material indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Servicer is a
party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or violates any statute
or order, rule, regulations, writ, injunction or decree of any court,
governmental authority or regulatory body to which the Servicer is subject or by
which it is bound.

6. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the best
of my knowledge, threatened against the Servicer which, in my judgment, either
in any one instance or in the aggregate, may result in any material adverse
change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of
the Servicer or in any material impairment of the right or ability of the
Servicer to carry on its business substantially as now conducted or in any
material liability on the part of the Servicer or which would draw into question
the validity of the Servicing Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereby, or which would be likely
to impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform under the terms of
the Servicing Agreement.


                                            Very truly yours,




                                      -E-2-

     This Interim Servicing Agreement (the "Agreement") is entered into as of
the twenty-fourth day of September, 2004, by and between First National Bank of
Nevada (the "Seller"), a national banking association and Lehman Brothers Bank,

in each Mortgage Loan Package purchased by the Purchaser, from and after the
related Closing Date, the Seller, as an independent contractor, shall, from time
to time, service and administer the Mortgage Loans, during the related Interim
Period, by execution and delivery of (a) the related Acknowledgement Agreement,
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 9, and (b) the related Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10, and shall have
full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection
with such servicing and administration which the Seller may deem necessary or
desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted
Servicing Practices.

     Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller may waive, modify
or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of strict
compliance with


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the
Seller's reasonable and prudent determination such waiver, modification,
postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Purchaser, provided,
however, that unless the Seller has obtained the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, the Seller shall not permit any modification with respect to any
Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive the
payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the outstanding principal
balance (except for actual payments of principal) or change the final maturity
date on such Mortgage Loan. In the event of any such modification which permits
the deferral of interest or principal payments on any Mortgage Loan, the Seller
shall, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Remittance Date in any
month in which any such principal or interest payment has been deferred, deposit
in the Custodial Account from its own funds, in accordance with Section 2.04,
the difference between (a) such month's principal and one month's interest at
the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid principal balance of such
Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by the Mortgagor. The Seller shall be
entitled to reimbursement for such advances to the same extent as for all other
advances made pursuant to Section 2.05 or upon the related Transfer Date.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller shall continue, and
is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of itself
and the Purchaser, all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of
partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with
respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If
reasonably required by the Seller, the Purchaser shall furnish the Seller with
any powers of attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable
the Seller to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this
Agreement.

     In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Seller shall employ
procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same care that it
customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering mortgage loans
for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted Servicing Practices
where such practices do not conflict with the requirements of this Agreement,
and the Purchaser's reliance on the Seller.

     The Seller shall keep at its servicing office books and records in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Seller shall
note transfers of Mortgage Loans. No transfer of a Mortgage Loan may be made
unless such transfer is in compliance with the terms hereof. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the Seller shall be under no obligation to deal with any Person
with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans unless the Seller has been
notified of such transfers as provided in this Section 2.01. The Purchaser may
sell and transfer, in whole or in part, the Mortgage Loans, provided that no
such sale and transfer shall be binding upon Seller unless such transferee shall
agree in writing in the form of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement attached
hereto Exhibit 8, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and an executed
copy of the same shall have been delivered to the Seller. Upon receipt thereof,
the Seller shall mark its books and records to reflect the ownership of the
Mortgage Loans by such assignee, and the previous Purchaser shall be released
from its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Purchaser and Seller and their permitted successors,
assignees and designees.

     Section 2.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans. In the event that any payment
due under any Mortgage Loan and not postponed pursuant to Section 2.01 is not
paid when the same becomes due and payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails
to perform any other covenant or

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period, the Seller shall take such action as (1) the Seller
would take under similar circumstances with respect to a similar mortgage loan
held for its own account for investment, (2) shall be consistent with Accepted
Servicing Practices, (3) the Seller shall determine prudently to be in the best
interest of Purchaser, and (4) is consistent with any related PMI Policy or LPMI
Policy. In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not
postponed pursuant to Section 2.01 and remains delinquent for a period of 90
days or any other default continues for a period of 90 days beyond the
expiration of any grace or cure period, the Seller shall commence foreclosure
proceedings, provided that, prior to commencing foreclosure proceedings, the
Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing of the Seller's intention to do so,
and the Seller shall not commence foreclosure proceedings if the Purchaser
objects to such action within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice. In such
connection, the Seller shall from its own funds make all necessary and proper
Servicing Advances, provided, however, that the Seller shall not be required to
expend its own funds in connection with any foreclosure or towards the
restoration or preservation of any Mortgaged Property, unless it shall determine
(a) that such preservation, restoration and/or foreclosure will increase the
proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Purchaser after reimbursement to
itself for such expenses and (b) that such expenses will be recoverable by it
either through Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall have priority for
purposes of withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 2.05) or
through Insurance Proceeds (respecting which it shall have similar priority).

     Section 2.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments. Continuously from the
date hereof until the related Transfer Date, the Seller shall proceed diligently
to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans when the same shall
become due and payable and shall take special care in ascertaining and
estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will become due and
payable with respect to the Mortgage Loans and each related Mortgaged Property,
to the end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to
pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

     Section 2.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account. The Seller
shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to the
Mortgage Loans separate and apart from any of its own funds and general assets
and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial Accounts, in the form of
time deposit or demand accounts, titled "First National Bank of Nevada in trust
for Purchasers of Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, Group
No. 2004-1 and various Mortgagors". The Custodial Account shall be established
with a Qualified Depository acceptable to the Purchaser. Any funds deposited in
the Custodial Account shall at all times be fully insured to the full extent
permitted under applicable law. Funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be
drawn on by the Seller in accordance with Section 2.05. The creation of any
Custodial Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit 2
hereto, in the case of an account established with the Seller, or by a letter
agreement in the form of Exhibit 3 hereto, in the case of an account held by a
depository other than the Seller. A copy of such certification or letter
agreement shall be furnished to the Purchaser and, upon request, to any
subsequent Purchaser.

     The Seller shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily basis, and
retain therein, the following collections received by the Seller after the
related Cut-off Date:

                                      -11-
<PAGE>



          (i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage Loans;

          (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
     adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

          (iii) all Liquidation Proceeds;

          (iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to be deposited
     pursuant to Section 2.11 (other than proceeds to be held in the Escrow
     Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property
     or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with Section 2.15), Section 2.12
     and Section 2.16;

          (v) all Condemnation Proceeds which are not applied to the restoration
     or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor in
     accordance with Section 2.15;

          (vi) any amount required to be deposited in the Custodial Account
     pursuant to Section 2.01, 2.10, 2.17, 4.01 or 4.02;

          (vii) any amounts payable in connection with the repurchase of any
     Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement; and

          (viii) any amounts required to be deposited by the Seller pursuant to
     Section 2.12 in connection with the deductible clause in any blanket hazard
     insurance policy.

     The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial Account shall be
exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, payments in the nature of assumption fees, to the extent
permitted by Section 4.01, need not be deposited by the Seller into the
Custodial Account. Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account
by the depository institution shall accrue to the benefit of the Seller and the
Seller shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 2.05.

     Section 2.05 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account. The Seller
shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the Custodial Account for the
following purposes:

          (i) to make payments to the Purchaser in the amounts and in the manner
     provided for in Section 3.01;

          (ii) with respect to each LPMI Loan, in the amount of the LPMI Fee, to
     make payments with respect to premiums for LPMI Policies;

          (iii) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Servicing Advances, any
     unpaid Servicing Fees and for unreimbursed advances of Seller funds made
     pursuant to Section 2.17, the Seller's right to reimburse itself pursuant
     to this subclause (iii) with respect to any Mortgage Loan being limited to
     related Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and
     such other amounts as may be collected by the Seller from the Mortgagor or
     otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that,

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

     in the case of any such reimbursement, the Seller's right thereto shall be
     prior to the rights of the Purchaser except that, where the Seller is
     required to repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 4.02 of this
     Agreement, the Seller's right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to
     the payment to the Purchaser of the Repurchase Price pursuant to such
     sections and all other amounts required to be paid to the Purchaser with
     respect to such Mortgage Loan;

          (iv) to pay itself interest on funds deposited in the Custodial
     Account;

          (v) to reimburse itself for expenses incurred and reimbursable to it
     pursuant to Section 4.03;

          (vi) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon the termination
     of this Agreement; and

          (vii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

     In the event that the Custodial Account is interest bearing, on each
Remittance Date, the Seller shall withdraw all funds from the Custodial Account
except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 3.01, the Seller is not
obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Seller may use such withdrawn
funds only for the purposes described in this Section 2.05.

     Section 2.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account. The Seller
shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to a Mortgage
Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and apart from any of its own funds
and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Escrow Accounts,
in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled, "First National Bank of
Nevada in trust for Purchasers of Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage
Loans, Group No. 2004-1 and various Mortgagors". The Escrow Accounts shall be
established with a Qualified Depository, in a manner which shall provide maximum
available insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow Account may be
drawn on by the Seller in accordance with Section 2.07. The creation of any
Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit 4
hereto, in the case of an account established with the Seller, or by a letter
agreement in the form of Exhibit 5 hereto, in the case of an account held by a
depository other than the Seller. A copy of such certification shall be
furnished to the Purchaser and, upon request, to any subsequent Purchaser.

     The Seller shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts on a daily
basis, and retain therein:

          (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage Loans,
     for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as required
     under the terms of this Agreement;

          (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation
     Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or repair of any
     Mortgaged Property.

     The Seller shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account only to effect
such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth in Section
2.07. The Seller shall be

                                      -13-
<PAGE>


entitled to retain any interest paid on funds deposited in the Escrow Account by
the depository institution, other than interest on escrowed funds required by
law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the extent required by law, the Seller shall
pay interest on escrowed funds to the Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow
Account may be non-interest bearing or that interest paid thereon is
insufficient for such purposes.

     Section 2.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account. Withdrawals from
the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by the Seller only:

          (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
     water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium charges, fire and
     hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting Escrow Payments for
     the related Mortgage;

          (ii) to reimburse the Seller for any Servicing Advance made by the
     Seller pursuant to Section 2.08 with respect to a related Mortgage Loan,
     but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent
     late collections of Escrow Payments thereunder;

          (iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in excess of
     the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan;

          (iv) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application to reduce
     the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of
     the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

          (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property
     in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 2.15;

          (vi) to pay to the Seller, or any Mortgagor to the extent required by
     law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account;

          (vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the termination of
     this Agreement; and

          (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

     Section 2.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges. With respect to
each Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall maintain accurate records reflecting the
status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, sewer rents, and other
charges which are or may become a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the
status of PMI Policy premiums and fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall
obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including
renewal premiums) and shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable
penalty or termination date, employing for such purpose deposits of the
Mortgagor in the Escrow Account which shall have been estimated and accumulated
by the Seller in amounts sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the
terms of the Mortgage. To the extent that a Mortgage does not provide for Escrow
Payments, the Seller shall determine that any such payments are made by the
Mortgagor at the time they first become due. The Seller assumes full
responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills and shall effect timely
payment of all such charges irrespective of each


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the
Escrow Payments, and the Seller shall make advances from its own funds to effect
such payments.

     Section 2.09 PMI and LPMI Obligations. The Seller shall comply with all
provisions of applicable state and federal law relating to the cancellation of,
or collection of premiums with respect to, PMI Policies and LPMI Policies,
including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act
of 1998, and all regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to
time. The Seller shall be obligated to make premium payments with respect to (a)
LPMI Policies, and (b) if the Mortgagor fails to pay any PMI Policy premium,
such PMI Policy.

     Section 2.10 Protection of Accounts. The Seller may transfer the Custodial
Account or the Escrow Account to a different Qualified Depository from time to
time. Such transfer shall be made only upon obtaining the consent of the
Purchaser, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.

     The Seller shall bear any expenses, losses or damages sustained by the
Purchaser because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow Account are not demand
deposit accounts.

     Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow Account may at
the option of the Seller be invested in Eligible Investments; provided that in
the event that amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account
exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the "Insured Amount") the Seller
shall be obligated to invest the excess amount over the Insured Amount in
Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such excess amount becomes
present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account. Any such Eligible
Investment shall mature no later than the Determination Date next following the
date of such Eligible Investment, provided, however, that if such Eligible
Investment is an obligation of a Qualified Depository (other than the Seller)
that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such Eligible
Investment may mature on such Remittance Date. Any such Eligible Investment
shall be made in the name of the Seller in trust for the benefit of the
Purchaser. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Seller and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Seller. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Seller out of its own
funds immediately as realized.

     Section 2.11 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance. The Seller shall cause to be
maintained for each Mortgage Loan, hazard insurance such that all buildings upon
the Mortgaged Property are insured by a generally acceptable insurer rated A:VI
or better in the current Best's Key Rating Guide ("Best's") against loss by
fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other hazards as are customary in
the area where the Mortgaged Property is located, in an amount which is at least
equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum insurable value of the improvements
securing such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the greater of (a) the outstanding
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (b) an amount such that the proceeds
thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor or the loss payee from
becoming a co-insurer.

     If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged Property
was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood Emergency
Management


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood insurance has
been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the
current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration is in effect with a
generally acceptable insurance carrier rated A:VI or better in Best's in an
amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum amount
required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any damage or loss on a
replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the mortgage if replacement
cost coverage is not available for the type of building insured) and (ii) the
maximum amount of insurance which is available under the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the term of the
Mortgage Loan, the Seller determines in accordance with applicable law and
Accepted Servicing Practices that a Mortgaged Property is located in a special
flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is covered in an
amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973, as amended, the Seller shall notify the related Mortgagor that the
Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if said Mortgagor fails
to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within forty-five (45) days
after such notification, the Seller shall immediately force place the required
flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

     If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project, the Seller
shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association, including
hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained in
accordance with then current Accepted Servicing Practices, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Seller promptly of any change in
the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have a
material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.

     The Seller shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged Property
earthquake or such other or additional insurance as may be required pursuant to
such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in force and as
shall require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the requirements of any
private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to conform with
Accepted Servicing Practices.

     In the event that any Purchaser or the Seller shall determine that the
Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards and risks
not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the Mortgagor pursuant
to the terms of the Mortgage, the Seller shall, in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices, provide notice of such to the Mortgagor.

     All policies required hereunder shall name the Seller as loss
payee and shall be endorsed with standard or New York mortgagee clauses, without
contribution, which shall provide for at least 30 days prior written notice of
any cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage.

     The Seller shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of choice in
selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however, that the
Seller shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance companies
unless such companies are rated A:VI or better in Best's and are licensed to do
business in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is located. The
Seller shall determine that such policies provide sufficient risk coverage and
amounts, that they insure the property owner, and that they properly describe
the property

                                      -16-
<PAGE>

address. The Seller shall furnish to the Mortgagor a formal notice of expiration
of any such insurance in sufficient time for the Mortgagor to arrange for
renewal coverage by the expiration date.

     Pursuant to Section 2.04, any amounts collected by the Seller under any
such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow Account and
applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property, or
property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be released to the
Mortgagor, in accordance with the Seller's normal servicing procedures as
specified in Section 2.15) shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject
to withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.05.

     Section 2.12 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance. In the event
that the Seller shall obtain and maintain a blanket policy insuring against
losses arising from fire and hazards covered under extended coverage on all of
the Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an
amount equal to the amount required pursuant to Section 2.11 and otherwise
complies with all other requirements of Section 2.11, it shall conclusively be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in Section 2.11. Any
amounts collected by the Seller under any such policy relating to a Mortgage
Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject to withdrawal pursuant
to Section 2.05. Such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in
the event that there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged
Property a policy complying with Section 2.11, and there shall have been a loss
which would have been covered by such policy, the Seller shall deposit in the
Custodial Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable
under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to be
deposited from the Seller's funds, without reimbursement therefor. Upon request
of the Purchaser, the Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a
certified true copy of such policy and a statement from the insurer thereunder
that such policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without
30 days' prior written notice to the Purchaser.

     Section 2.13 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance. The Seller shall maintain with responsible companies, at its own
expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy,
with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting in any
capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or papers
relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Seller Employees"). Any such Fidelity Bond and
Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the Mortgage
Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Seller against losses,
including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Seller Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the Seller against
losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No
provision of this Section 2.13 requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Seller from its duties
and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage under any
such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal [$5,000,000]. Upon the
request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall cause to be delivered to the
Purchaser a certified true copy of such fidelity bond and insurance policy and a
statement from the surety and the insurer that such fidelity bond and insurance
policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without 30 days'
prior written notice to the Purchaser.


                                      -17-
<PAGE>


     Section 2.14 Inspections. The Seller shall inspect the Mortgaged Property
as often as deemed necessary by the Seller to assure itself that the value of
the Mortgaged Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage Loan is
more than 60 days delinquent, the Seller immediately shall inspect the Mortgaged
Property and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices or as may be required by the primary mortgage guaranty
insurer. The Seller shall keep a written report of each such inspection.

     Section 2.15 Restoration of Mortgaged Property. The Seller need not obtain
the approval of the Purchaser prior to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds to the Mortgagor to be applied to the restoration or
repair of the Mortgaged Property if such release is in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices. At a minimum, the Seller shall comply with the following
conditions in connection with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds:

          (i) the Seller shall receive satisfactory independent verification of
     completion of repairs and issuance of any required approvals with respect
     thereto;

          (ii) the Seller shall take all steps necessary to preserve the
     priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
     requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;

          (iii) the Seller shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is not in
     default; and

          (iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Seller shall place the
     Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.

     If the Purchaser is named as an additional loss payee, the Seller is hereby
empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such a claim in the
name of the Purchaser.

     Section 2.16 Maintenance of PMI Policy and/or LPMI Policy; Claims. With
respect to each Mortgage Loan with a LTV in excess of 80%, the Seller shall:

          (i) with respect to Mortgage Loans which are not LPMI Loans, without
     any cost to the Owner, maintain or cause the Mortgagor to maintain in full
     force and effect a PMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan in
     excess of 75% (or such other percentage as stated in the related
     Acknowledgment Agreement) of value, and shall pay or shall cause the
     Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a timely basis, until the LTV of
     such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the event that such PMI Policy
     shall be terminated, the Seller shall obtain from another Qualified Insurer
     a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage equal to the
     remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy, at substantially the same
     fee level. If the insurer shall cease to be a Qualified Insurer, the Seller
     shall determine whether recoveries under the PMI Policy are jeopardized for
     reasons related to the financial condition of such insurer, it being
     understood that the Seller shall in no event have any responsibility or
     liability for any failure to recover under the PMI Policy for such reason.
     If the Seller determines that recoveries are so jeopardized, it shall
     notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor, if required, and obtain from
     another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance policy. The Seller


                                      -18-
<PAGE>



     shall not take any action which would result in noncoverage under any
     applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the Seller
     would have been covered thereunder. In connection with any assumption or
     substitution agreement entered into or to be entered into pursuant to
     Section 4.01, the Seller shall promptly notify the insurer under the
     related PMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of liability
     in accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy and shall take all actions
     which may be required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation of
     coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI Policy is terminated as a
     result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the Seller shall
     obtain a replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

          (ii) with respect to LPMI Loans, maintain in full force and effect an
     LPMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan in excess of 75% (or
     such other percentage as stated in the related Acknowledgment Agreement) of
     value, and from time to time, withdraw the LPMI Fee with respect to such
     LPMI Loan from the Custodial Account in order to pay the premium thereon on
     a timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In
     the event that the interest payments made with respect to any LPMI Loan are
     less than the LPMI Fee, the Seller shall advance from its own funds the
     amount of any such shortfall in the LPMI Fee, in payment of the premium on
     the related LPMI Policy. Any such advance shall be a Servicing Advance
     subject to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions on Section 2.05. In the
     event that such LPMI Policy shall be terminated, the Seller shall obtain
     from another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a
     total coverage equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated LPMI
     Policy, at substantially the same fee level. If the insurer shall cease to
     be a Qualified Insurer, the Seller shall determine whether recoveries under
     the LPMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial
     condition of such insurer, it being understood that the Seller shall in no
     event have any responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under
     the LPMI Policy for such reason. If the Seller determines that recoveries
     are so jeopardized, it shall notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor, if
     required, and obtain from another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance
     policy. The Seller shall not take any action which would result in
     noncoverage under any applicable LPMI Policy of any loss which, but for the
     actions of the Seller would have been covered thereunder. In connection
     with any assumption or substitution agreement entered into or to be entered
     into pursuant to Section 4.01, the Seller shall promptly notify the insurer
     under the related LPMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution
     of liability in accordance with the terms of such LPMI Policy and shall
     take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to
     the continuation of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such LPMI Policy is
     terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the
     Seller shall obtain a replacement LPMI Policy as provided above.

     In connection with its activities as servicer, the Seller agrees to prepare
and present, on behalf of itself and the Owner, claims to the insurer under any
PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of
such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action as shall
be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy respecting a
defaulted Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to Section 3.04, any amounts collected by the
Seller under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.05.

     Section 2.17 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property. In the
event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by deed
in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the
name of the Purchaser, or in the event the Purchaser is not authorized or
permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the REO Property is
located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax laws
of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be
taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an
Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Seller from any attorney duly licensed to
practice law in the state where the REO Property is located. The Person or
Persons holding such title other than the Purchaser shall acknowledge in writing
that such title is being held as nominee for the Purchaser.

     The Seller shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO Property
for the Purchaser solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale. The
Seller, either itself or through an agent selected by the Seller, shall manage,
conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner that it
manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for its own
account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same locality as
the REO Property is managed. The Seller shall attempt to sell the same (and may
temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than one year, except as
otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as the Seller deems to be
in the best interest of the Purchaser.

     The Seller shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO Property as
soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event within one year
after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless the Seller determines,
and gives an appropriate notice to the Purchaser to such effect, that a longer
period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such REO Property. If a
period longer than one year is permitted under the foregoing sentence and is
necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Seller shall report monthly to the
Purchaser as to the progress being made in selling such REO Property and (ii)
if, with the written consent of the Purchaser, a purchase money mortgage is
taken in connection with such sale, such purchase money mortgage shall name the
Seller as mortgagee, and such purchase money mortgage shall not be held pursuant
to this Agreement, but instead a separate participation agreement among the
Seller and Purchaser shall be entered into with respect to such purchase money
mortgage.

     The Seller shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and hazard
insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.

     The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
Seller at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Seller deems to
be in the best interests of the Purchaser. The proceeds of sale of the REO
Property shall be promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as
practical thereafter the expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Seller
shall reimburse itself for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid
Servicing Fees and unreimbursed advances made pursuant to this Section, and on
the Remittance Date immediately following the Principal Prepayment Period in
which such sale proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such sale
remaining in the Custodial Account shall be distributed to the Purchaser.

                                      -20-
<PAGE>


     With respect to each REO Property, the Seller shall hold all funds
collected and received in connection with the operation of the REO Property in
the Custodial Account. The Seller shall cause to be deposited on a daily basis
upon the receipt thereof in each Custodial Account all revenues received with
respect to the conservation and disposition of the related REO Property.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time, the
Purchaser may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to one or
more REO Properties as provided by Section 6.03(c).

     Section 2.18 Permitted Withdrawals with respect to REO Property. The Seller
shall withdraw REO funds on deposit in the Custodial Account with respect to
each related REO Property necessary for the proper operation, management and
maintenance of the REO Property, including the cost of maintaining any hazard
insurance pursuant to Section 2.11 and the fees of any managing agent acting on
behalf of the Seller. The Seller shall make monthly distributions on each
Remittance Date to the Purchaser of the net cash flow from the REO Property
(which shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses
described in Section 2.17 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to
time to be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

     Section 2.19 Real Estate Owned Reports. Together with the statement
furnished pursuant to Section 2.20, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser on
or before the 15th day of each month a statement with respect to any REO
Property covering the operation of such REO Property for the previous month and
the Seller's efforts in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any
rental of such REO Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous
month. That statement shall be accompanied by such other information as the
Purchaser shall reasonably request.

     Section 2.20 Liquidation Reports. Upon the foreclosure sale of any
Mortgaged Property or the acquisition thereof by the Purchaser pursuant to a
deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Seller shall submit to the Purchaser a
liquidation report with respect to such Mortgaged Property.

     Section 2.21 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of Mortgaged
Property. Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Seller shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.

                                  ARTICLE III

                              PAYMENTS TO PURCHASER

     Section 3.01 Remittances. On each Remittance Date the Seller shall remit by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Purchaser (a) all amounts
deposited in the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the
Determination Date (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 2.05), plus (b) all amounts, if any, which the
Seller is obligated to distribute pursuant to Section 2.03.

     With respect to any remittance received by the Purchaser after the second
Business Day following the Business Day on which such payment was due, the
Seller shall pay


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

to the Purchaser interest on any such late payment at an annual rate equal to
the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change, plus three percentage
points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount permitted by applicable
law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial Account by the Seller on
the date such late payment is made and shall cover the period commencing with
the day following such second Business Day and ending with the Business Day on
which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such interest shall be remitted
along with the distribution payable on the next succeeding Remittance Date. The
payment by the Seller of any such interest shall not be deemed an extension of
time for payment or a waiver of any Event of Default by the Seller.

     Section 3.02 Statements to Purchaser. Not later than the fifth Business Day
of each month, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser a Monthly Remittance
Advice, with a trial balance report attached thereto, in the form of Exhibit 1
annexed hereto in hard copy and electronic medium mutually acceptable to the
parties as to the preceding remittance and the period ending on the preceding
Determination Date.

     In addition, not more than 60 days after the end of each calendar year, the
Seller shall furnish to each Person who was a Purchaser at any time during such
calendar year an annual statement in accordance with the requirements of
applicable federal income tax law as to the aggregate of remittances for the
applicable portion of such year.

     Such obligation of the Seller shall be deemed to have been satisfied to the
extent that substantially comparable information shall be provided by the Seller
pursuant to any requirements of the Internal Revenue Code as from time to time
are in force.

     The Seller shall prepare and file any and all tax returns, information
statements or other filings required to be delivered to any governmental taxing
authority or to the Purchaser pursuant to any applicable law with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, the Seller
shall provide the Purchaser with such information concerning the Mortgage Loans
as is necessary for the Purchaser to prepare its federal income tax return as
the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

     Section 4.01 Transfers of Mortgaged Property. The Seller shall use its best
efforts to enforce any "due-on-sale" provision contained in any Mortgage or
Mortgage Note and to deny assumption by the person to whom the Mortgaged
Property has been or is about to be sold whether by absolute conveyance or by
contract of sale, and whether or not the Mortgagor remains liable on the
Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by
the Mortgagor, the Seller shall, to the extent it has knowledge of such
conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan
under the "due-on-sale" clause applicable thereto, provided, however, that the
Seller shall not exercise such rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if
the exercise of such rights would impair or threaten to impair any recovery
under the related PMI Policy or LPMI Policy, if any.


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

     If the Seller reasonably believes it is unable under applicable law to
enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Seller shall enter into (i) an assumption
and modification agreement with the person to whom such property has been
conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage Note
and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in the event the
Seller is unable under applicable law to require that the original Mortgagor
remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Seller has the prior consent of
the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of liability agreement
with the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to which the original
Mortgagor is released from liability and the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property
is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note. If an
assumption fee is collected by the Seller for entering into an assumption
agreement, a portion of such fee, up to an amount equal to one-half of one
percent (0.5%) of the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage
Loan, will be retained by the Seller as additional servicing compensation, and
any portion thereof in excess of one-half of one percent (0.5%) shall be
deposited in the Custodial Account for the benefit of the Purchaser. In
connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne by
the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

     To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the Seller shall inquire
diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee, and shall use
the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of the proposed transferee
which are used by the Seller with respect to underwriting mortgage loans of the
same type as the Mortgage Loans. If the credit of the proposed transferee does
not meet such underwriting criteria, the Seller diligently shall, to the extent
permitted by the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and by applicable law, accelerate
the maturity of the Mortgage Loan.

     Section 4.02 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage Files. Upon
the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt by the Seller of a
notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a manner customary for
such purposes, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in the Monthly Remittance
Advice as provided in Section 3.02, and may request the release of any Mortgage
Loan Documents from the Purchaser in accordance with this Section 4.02 hereof.

     If the Seller satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first having
obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or should
the Seller otherwise prejudice any rights the Purchaser may have under the
mortgage instruments, upon written demand of the Purchaser, the Seller shall
repurchase the related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price by deposit thereof
in the Custodial Account within 2 Business Days of receipt of such demand by the
Purchaser. The Seller shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 2.13 insuring the Seller against any
loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not satisfied in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

     Section 4.03 Servicing Compensation. As consideration for servicing the
Mortgage Loans during the Interim Period, the Seller shall retain a Servicing
Fee with respect to each Mortgage Loan, which amount shall be prorated for any
portion of a month during which the Mortgage Loan is serviced by the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement. The obligation of the

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

Purchaser to pay the Servicing Fee is limited to, and the Servicing Fee is
payable solely from, the interest portion (including recoveries with respect to
interest from Liquidation Proceeds, to the extent permitted by Section 2.05) of
such Monthly Payment collected by the Seller, or as otherwise provided under
Section 2.05.

     Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption fees, to the
extent provided in Section 4.01 and Ancillary Income, shall be retained by the
Seller to the extent not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account. The
Seller shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with
its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement
thereof except as specifically provided for herein.

     Section 4.04 Annual Statement as to Compliance. The Seller shall deliver to
the Purchaser, on or before March 31 each year beginning March 31, 2005, and on
the Transfer Date an Officer's Certificate, stating that (i) a review of the
activities of the Seller during the preceding calendar year and of performance
under this Agreement has been made under such officer's supervision, and (ii)
the Seller has complied fully with the provisions of Article II and Article IV,
and (iii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, the
Seller has fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement throughout such
year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation,
specifying each such default known to such officer and the nature and status
thereof and the action being taken by the Seller to cure such default.

     Section 4.05 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report. On or
before March 31st of each year beginning March 31, 2005, the Seller, at its
expense, shall cause a firm of independent public accountants which is a member
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to furnish a statement
to each Purchaser to the effect that such firm has examined certain documents
and records relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans and this Agreement
and that such firm is of the opinion that the provisions of Article II and
Article III have been complied with, and that, on the basis of such examination
conducted substantially in compliance with the Single Audit Program for Mortgage
Bankers, nothing has come to their attention which would indicate that such
servicing has not been conducted in compliance therewith, except for (i) such
exceptions as such firm shall believe to be immaterial, and (ii) such other
exceptions as shall be set forth in such statement.

     Section 4.06 Right to Examine Seller Records. The Purchaser shall have the
right to examine and audit any and all of the books, records, or other
information of the Seller, whether held by the Seller or by another on its
behalf, with respect to or concerning this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans,
during business hours or at such other times as may be reasonable under
applicable circumstances, upon reasonable advance notice.

                                   ARTICLE V

                               SELLER TO COOPERATE

     Section 5.01 Provision of Information. During the term of this Agreement,
the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser such periodic, special, or other
reports or information, whether or not provided for herein, as shall be
necessary, reasonable, or appropriate with respect

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

to the Purchaser or the purposes of this Agreement. All such reports or
information shall be provided by and in accordance with all reasonable
instructions and directions which the Purchaser may give.

     The Seller shall execute and deliver all such instruments and take all such
action as the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time, in order to
effectuate the purposes and to carry out the terms of this Agreement.

     Section 5.02 Financial Statements; Servicing Facilities. In connection with
marketing the Mortgage Loans, the Purchaser may make available to a prospective
Purchaser a Financial Consolidated Statement of Operations of the Seller for the
most recently completed three fiscal years for which such a statement is
available, as well as a Consolidated Statement of Condition at the end of the
last two fiscal years covered by such Consolidated Statement of Operations. The
Seller also shall make available any comparable interim statements to the extent
any such statements have been prepared by or on behalf of the Seller (and are
available upon request to members or stockholders of the Seller or to the public
at large). If it has not already done so, the Seller shall furnish promptly to
the Purchaser copies of the statement specified above.

     The Seller shall make available to the Purchaser or any prospective
Purchaser a knowledgeable financial or accounting officer for the purpose of
answering questions respecting recent developments affecting the Seller or the
financial statements of the Seller, and to permit any prospective Purchaser to
inspect the Seller's servicing facilities for the purpose of satisfying such
prospective Purchaser that the Seller have the ability to service the Mortgage
Loans as provided in this Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                                   TERMINATION

     Section 6.01 Damages. The Purchaser shall have the right at any time to
seek and recover from the Seller any damages or losses suffered by it as a
result of any failure by the Seller to observe or perform any duties,
obligations, covenants or agreements herein contained or contained in the
Purchase Agreement.

     Section 6.02 Termination Upon Transfer of Servicing.

     (a) Termination Procedures. This Agreement shall terminate with respect to
the Mortgage Loans or portion thereof transferred on the related Transfer Date
set forth in the related Terms Letter; provided that the Purchaser shall have
the option to extend the related Transfer Date for 2 months from the original
related Transfer Date upon written notice to the Seller at least 15 days prior
to the related Transfer Date of its intent to extend the related Transfer Date
for 2 months.

     The Purchaser may elect to terminate this Agreement and transfer the
servicing from the Seller prior to the Transfer Date with respect to all or any
portion of the Mortgage Loans by providing written notice to the Seller of its
intent to transfer servicing at least 30 days prior to the date on which it
intends to transfer the servicing from the Seller. On or before the

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

date specified by the Purchaser in accordance with this paragraph (a) for the
transfer of servicing from the Seller, the Seller shall prepare, execute and
deliver to the successor entity designated by the Purchaser any and all
documents and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
Mortgage Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer and endorsement
or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, at the Seller's sole
expense. The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Seller's responsibilities and rights hereunder.

     Section 6.03 Servicing Transfer Provisions. On or prior to the related
Transfer Date the Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense take such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and evidence the transfer of the
servicing of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, or its designee, including but
not limited to the following:

     On the Transfer Date, the Seller shall comply with all of the provisions of
Section 14 of the Purchase Agreement to effect a complete transfer of the
Servicing Rights. On the related Transfer Date for each Mortgage Loan, this
Agreement, except for Articles VI, VIII, IX and X which shall survive the
Transfer Date, shall terminate.

     (a) Mortgage Loans in Foreclosure. The servicing with respect to Mortgage
Loans in foreclosure on or before the Transfer Date shall not be transferred
from the Seller to the Purchaser or the successor servicer, as the case may be,
and such Mortgage Loans shall continue to be serviced by the Seller pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. However, if the Purchaser so elects, the Purchaser
may waive the provisions of this paragraph (a) and accept transfer of servicing
of such Mortgage Loans and all amounts received by the Seller thereunder.

     (b) Servicing Advances. Notwithstanding the fact that the Transfer Date has
occurred, the Seller shall not be reimbursed for any Servicing Advances with
respect to any Mortgage Loan until the Seller or the successor servicer receives
a Monthly Payment or Liquidation Proceeds with respect to such Mortgage Loan. At
such time, the Seller shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all unreimbursed
Servicing Advances with respect to such Mortgage Loan on a first priority basis
(but subject to any successor servicer's rights to reimbursement with respect to
Servicing Advances) from the Monthly Payment or Liquidation Proceeds received
with respect to such Mortgage Loan. This Section 6.03(b) shall survive the
Transfer Date.

     (c) Additional Termination Provisions. Notwithstanding and in addition to
the foregoing, in the event that (i) a Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a
period of 120 days or more (a "Delinquent Mortgage Loan") or (ii) a Mortgage
Loan becomes an REO Property, the Purchaser may at its election terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property, upon 15
days' written notice to the Seller.

                                BOOKS AND RECORDS

     Section 7.01 Possession of Servicing Files Prior to the Transfer Date.
Prior to the Transfer Date, the contents of each Servicing File are and shall be
held in trust by the Seller for the benefit of the Purchaser as the owner
thereof. The Seller shall maintain in the Servicing File a copy of the contents
of each Mortgage File and the originals of the documents in each Mortgage File
not delivered to the Purchaser. The possession of the Servicing File by the
Seller is at the will of the Purchaser for the sole purpose of servicing the
related Mortgage Loan, pursuant to this Agreement, and such retention and
possession by the Seller is in its capacity as Seller only and at the election
of the Purchaser. The Seller shall release its custody of the contents of any
Servicing File only in accordance with written instructions from the Purchaser,
unless such release is required as incidental to the Seller's servicing of the
Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement or is in connection with a repurchase
of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement.

     The Seller shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a
complete set of books and records for each Mortgage Loan which shall be marked
clearly to reflect the ownership of each Mortgage Loan by the Purchaser. In
particular, the Seller shall maintain in its possession, available for
inspection by the Purchaser or its designee, and shall deliver to the Purchaser
or its designee upon demand, evidence of compliance with all federal, state and
local laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to documentation as
to the method used in determining the applicability of the provisions of the
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, to the Mortgaged Property,
documentation evidencing insurance coverage and eligibility of any condominium
project for approval by Fannie Mae and periodic inspection reports as required
by Section 2.14.

     The Seller shall keep at its servicing office books and records in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Seller shall
note transfers of Mortgage Loans. No transfer of a Mortgage Loan may be made
unless such transfer is in compliance with the terms hereof. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the Seller shall be under no obligation to deal with any person
with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans unless the books and
records show such person as the owner of the Mortgage Loan. The Purchaser may,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, sell or transfer one or more of the
Mortgage Loans, provided, however, that the transferee will not be deemed to be
a Purchaser hereunder binding upon the Seller unless such transferee shall agree
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and an original
counterpart of the instrument of transfer and an assignment and assumption of
this Agreement executed by the transferee shall have been delivered to the
Seller. The Purchaser also shall advise the Seller of the transfer. Upon receipt
of notice of the transfer, the Seller shall mark its books and records to
reflect the ownership of the Mortgage Loans of such assignee, and shall release
the previous Purchaser from its obligations hereunder with respect to the
Mortgage Loans sold or transferred.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         INDEMNIFICATION AND ASSIGNMENT

     Section 8.01 Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and
hold it harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines,
and forfeitures, including, but not limited to reasonable and necessary legal
fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that
the Purchaser may sustain in any way related to the failure of the Seller to (a)
perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with the
terms of this Agreement, and/or (b) comply with applicable law. The Seller
immediately shall notify the Purchaser if a claim is made by a third party with
respect to this Agreement, assume (with the prior written consent of the
Purchaser) the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against it or the Purchaser in respect
of such claim. The Seller shall follow any written instructions received from
the Purchaser in connection with such claim. The Purchaser promptly shall
reimburse the Seller for all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding
sentence except when the claim is in any way related to the Seller's
indemnification pursuant to Section 8 of the Purchase Agreement, or the failure
of the Seller to (a) service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict
compliance with the terms of this Agreement and/or (b) comply with applicable
law.

     Section 8.02 Limitation on Liability of Seller and Others. Neither the
Seller nor any of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the Seller
shall be under any liability to the Purchaser for any action taken or for
refraining from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, provided, however, that this provision
shall not protect the Seller or any such person against any breach of warranties
or representations made herein, or failure to perform its obligations in strict
compliance with any standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Seller and any director, officer, employee
or agent of the Seller may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima
facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising hereunder. The Seller shall not be under any obligation to appear in,
prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to its duties to
service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which in its
opinion may involve it in any expense or liability, provided, however, that the
Seller may, with the consent of the Purchaser, undertake any such action which
it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement and the rights
and duties of the parties hereto. In such event, the Seller shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Purchaser of the reasonable legal expenses and costs of
such action.

     Section 8.03 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by Seller. The
Purchaser has entered into this Agreement with the Seller and subsequent
Purchasers will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the independent
status of the Seller, and the representations as to the adequacy of its
servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and procedures, its integrity,
reputation and financial standing, and the continuance thereof. Therefore, the
Seller shall neither assign this Agreement or the servicing hereunder or
delegate its rights or duties hereunder or any portion hereof or sell or
otherwise dispose of all or


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

substantially all of its property or assets without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the sole discretion
of the Purchaser.

     The Seller shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed
on it except by mutual consent of the Seller and the Purchaser or upon the
determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Seller. Any such
determination permitting the resignation of the Seller shall be evidenced by an
Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Purchaser which Opinion of
Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Purchaser. No such
resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the
Seller's responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in
Section 6.03.

     Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 8.03, in the
event that the Seller either shall assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof or sell or, subject to the provisions of the following paragraph,
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets, without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, then the Purchaser shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set forth in Section
6.03, without any payment of any penalty or damages and without any liability
whatsoever to the Seller or any third party.

     Any Person into which the Seller may be merged or consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Seller shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the business of the Seller,
shall be the successor of the Seller hereunder, without the execution or filing
of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that the
successor or surviving Person shall be an institution whose deposits are insured
by FDIC or a company whose business is the origination and servicing of mortgage
loans and shall satisfy any requirements of this Agreement with respect to the

                                   ARTICLE II

                                    SERVICING

          Section 2.01 Seller to Act as Servicer. With respect to the Mortgage
Loans in each Mortgage Loan Package purchased by the Purchaser, from and after
the related Closing Date, the Seller, as an independent contractor, shall, from
time to time, service and administer


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

the Mortgage Loans, during the related Interim Period, by execution and delivery
of (a) the related Acknowledgement Agreement, in the form attached hereto as
Exhibit 9, and (b) the related Assignment and Assumption Agreement, in the form
attached hereto as Exhibit 10, and shall have full power and authority, acting
alone, to do any and all things in connection with such servicing and
administration which the Seller may deem necessary or desirable, consistent with
the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted Servicing Practices.

          Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller may waive,
modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of
strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any
Mortgagor if in the Seller's reasonable and prudent determination such waiver,
modification, postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the
Purchaser, provided, however, that unless the Seller has obtained the prior
written consent of the Purchaser, the Seller shall not permit any modification
with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate,
defer or forgive the payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the
outstanding principal balance (except for actual payments of principal) or
change the final maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. In the event of any such
modification which permits the deferral of interest or principal payments on any
Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall, on the Business Day immediately preceding the
Remittance Date in any month in which any such principal or interest payment has
been deferred, deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds, in
accordance with Section 2.04, the difference between (a) such month's principal
and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid
principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by the
Mortgagor. The Seller shall be entitled to reimbursement for such advances to
the same extent as for all other advances made pursuant to Section 2.05 or upon
the related Transfer Date. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
Seller shall continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and
deliver on behalf of itself and the Purchaser, all instruments of satisfaction
or cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and all other
comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to
the Mortgaged Properties. If reasonably required by the Seller, the Purchaser
shall furnish the Seller with any powers of attorney and other documents
necessary or appropriate to enable the Seller to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties under this Agreement.

          In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Seller shall
employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same care
that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering
mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted
Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the requirements
of this Agreement, and the Purchaser's reliance on the Seller.

          The Seller shall keep at its servicing office books and records in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Seller
shall note transfers of Mortgage Loans. No transfer of a Mortgage Loan may be
made unless such transfer is in compliance with the terms hereof. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the Seller shall be under no obligation to deal with
any Person with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans unless the
Seller has been notified of such transfers as provided in this Section 2.01. The
Purchaser may sell and transfer, in whole or in part, the Mortgage Loans,
provided that no such sale and transfer shall be binding upon Seller unless such
transferee shall agree in writing in the form of the Assignment and Assumption
Agreement attached hereto Exhibit 8, to be bound by the terms of this


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

Agreement, and an executed copy of the same shall have been delivered to the
Seller. Upon receipt thereof, the Seller shall mark its books and records to
reflect the ownership of the Mortgage Loans by such assignee, and the previous
Purchaser shall be released from its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall
be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the Purchaser and Seller and their
permitted successors, assignees and designees.

          Section 2.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans. In the event that any
payment due under any Mortgage Loan and not postponed pursuant to Section 2.01
is not paid when the same becomes due and payable, or in the event the Mortgagor
fails to perform any other covenant or obligation under the Mortgage Loan and
such failure continues beyond any applicable grace period, the Seller shall take
such action as (1) the Seller would take under similar circumstances with
respect to a similar mortgage loan held for its own account for investment, (2)
shall be consistent with Accepted Servicing Practices, (3) the Seller shall
determine prudently to be in the best interest of Purchaser, and (4) is
consistent with any related PMI Policy. In the event that any payment due under
any Mortgage Loan is not postponed pursuant to Section 2.01 and remains
delinquent for a period of 90 days or any other default continues for a period
of 90 days beyond the expiration of any grace or cure period, the Seller shall
commence foreclosure proceedings, provided that, prior to commencing foreclosure
proceedings, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing of the Seller's
intention to do so, and the Seller shall not commence foreclosure proceedings if
the Purchaser objects to such action within 10 Business Days of receiving such
notice. In such connection, the Seller shall from its own funds make all
necessary and proper Servicing Advances, provided, however, that the Seller
shall not be required to expend its own funds in connection with any foreclosure
or towards the restoration or preservation of any Mortgaged Property, unless it
shall determine (a) that such preservation, restoration and/or foreclosure will
increase the proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Purchaser after
reimbursement to itself for such expenses and (b) that such expenses will be
recoverable by it either through Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall
have priority for purposes of withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to
Section 2.05) or through Insurance Proceeds (respecting which it shall have
similar priority).

          Section 2.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments. Continuously from
the date hereof until the related Transfer Date, the Seller shall proceed
diligently to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans when the
same shall become due and payable and shall take special care in ascertaining
and estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will become due and
payable with respect to the Mortgage Loans and each related Mortgaged Property,
to the end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to
pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

          Section 2.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account. The
Seller shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to the
Mortgage Loans separate and apart from any of its own funds and general assets
and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial Accounts, in the form of
time deposit or demand accounts, titled "First National Bank of Nevada in trust
for Purchasers of Residential Fixed Rate Mortgage Loans, Group No. 2000-1 and
various Mortgagors". The Custodial Account shall be established with a Qualified
Depository acceptable to the Purchaser. Any funds deposited in the Custodial
Account shall at all times be fully insured to the full extent permitted under
applicable law. Funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be drawn on by the
Seller in accordance with


                                      -10-
<PAGE>

Section 2.05. The creation of any Custodial Account shall be evidenced by a
certification in the form of Exhibit 2 hereto, in the case of an account
established with the Seller, or by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit 3
hereto, in the case of an account held by a depository other than the Seller. A
copy of such certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the
Purchaser and, upon request, to any subsequent Purchaser.

          The Seller shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily basis,
and retain therein, the following collections received by the Seller after the
related Cut-off Date:

          (i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage Loans;

          (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage Loans
     adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

          (iii) all Liquidation Proceeds;

          (iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to be deposited
     pursuant to Section 2.11 (other than proceeds to be held in the Escrow
     Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property
     or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with Section 2.15), Section 2.12
     and Section 2.16;

          (v) all Condemnation Proceeds which are not applied to the restoration
     or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor in
     accordance with Section 2.15;

          (vi) any amount required to be deposited in the Custodial Account
     pursuant to Section 2.01, 2.10, 2.17, 4.01 or 4.02;

          (vii) any amounts payable in connection with the repurchase of any
     Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 8 of the Purchase Agreement; and

          (viii) any amounts required to be deposited by the Seller pursuant to
     Section 2.12 in connection with the deductible clause in any blanket hazard
     insurance policy.

          The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial Account
shall be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of assumption fees, to the
extent permitted by Section 4.01, need not be deposited by the Seller into the
Custodial Account. Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account
by the depository institution shall accrue to the benefit of the Seller and the
Seller shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 2.05.

          Section 2.05 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account. The Seller
shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the Custodial Account for the
following purposes:

          (i) to make payments to the Purchaser in the amounts and in the manner
     provided for in Section 3.01;

                                      -11-
<PAGE>

          (ii) with respect to each LPMI Loan, in the amount of the LPMI Fee, to
     make payments with respect to premiums for LPMI Policies;

          (iii) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Servicing Advances, any
     unpaid Servicing Fees and for unreimbursed advances of Seller funds made
     pursuant to Section 2.17, the Seller's right to reimburse itself pursuant
     to this subclause (iii) with respect to any Mortgage Loan being limited to
     related Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and
     such other amounts as may be collected by the Seller from the Mortgagor or
     otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that, in the
     case of any such reimbursement, the Seller's right thereto shall be prior
     to the rights of the Purchaser except that, where the Seller is required to
     repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 4.02 of this Agreement, the
     Seller's right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to the payment to
     the Purchaser of the Repurchase Price pursuant to such sections and all
     other amounts required to be paid to the Purchaser with respect to such
     Mortgage Loan;

          (iv) to pay itself interest on funds deposited in the Custodial
     Account;

          (v) to reimburse itself for expenses incurred and reimbursable to it
     pursuant to Section 4.03;

          (vi) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon the termination
     of this Agreement; and

          (vii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

          In the event that the Custodial Account is interest bearing, on each
Remittance Date, the Seller shall withdraw all funds from the Custodial Account
except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 3.01, the Seller is not
obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Seller may use such withdrawn
funds only for the purposes described in this Section 2.05.

          Section 2.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account. The
Seller shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to a
Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and apart from any of its
own funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Escrow
Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled, "First
National Bank of Nevada in trust for Purchasers of Residential Fixed Rate
Mortgage Loans, Group No. 2000-1 and various Mortgagors". The Escrow Accounts
shall be established with a Qualified Depository, in a manner which shall
provide maximum available insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow
Account may be drawn on by the Seller in accordance with Section 2.07. The
creation of any Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the form
of Exhibit 4 hereto, in the case of an account established with the Seller, or
by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit 5 hereto, in the case of an account
held by a depository other than the Seller. A copy of such certification shall
be furnished to the Purchaser and, upon request, to any subsequent Purchaser.

          The Seller shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts on a daily
basis, and retain therein:

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

          (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage Loans,
     for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as required
     under the terms of this Agreement;

          (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation
     Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or repair of any
     Mortgaged Property.

          The Seller shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account only to
effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth in
Section 2.07. The Seller shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on funds
deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than
interest on escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the
extent required by law, the Seller shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the
Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or
that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

          Section 2.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account. Withdrawals
from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by the Seller only:

          (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
     water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium charges, fire and
     hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting Escrow Payments for
     the related Mortgage;

          (ii) to reimburse the Seller for any Servicing Advance made by the
     Seller pursuant to Section 2.08 with respect to a related Mortgage Loan,
     but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent
     late collections of Escrow Payments thereunder;

          (iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in excess of
     the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan;

          (iv) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application to reduce
     the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of
     the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

          (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property
     in accordance with the procedures outlined in Section 2.15;

          (vi) to pay to the Seller, or any Mortgagor to the extent required by
     law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow Account;

          (vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the termination of
     this Agreement; and

          (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error. Section

          2.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges. With respect to
each Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall maintain accurate records reflecting the
status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, sewer rents, and other
charges which are or may become a


                                      -13-
<PAGE>

lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the status of PMI Policy premiums and fire
and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to time, all bills for
the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and shall effect
payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination date, employing
for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account which shall
have been estimated and accumulated by the Seller in amounts sufficient for such
purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. To the extent that a
Mortgage does not provide for Escrow Payments, the Seller shall determine that
any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they first become due.
The Seller assumes full responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills
and shall effect timely payment of all such charges irrespective of each
Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the
Escrow Payments, and the Seller shall make advances from its own funds to effect
such payments.

          Section 2.09 PMI and LPMI Obligations. The Seller shall comply with
all provisions of applicable state and federal law relating to the cancellation
of, or collection of premiums with respect to, PMI Policies and LPMI Policies,
including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act
of 1998, and all regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to
time. The Seller shall be obligated to make premium payments with respect to (a)
LPMI Policies, and (b) if the Mortgagor fails to pay any PMI Policy premium,
such PMI Policy.

          Section 2.10 Protection of Accounts. The Seller may transfer the
Custodial Account or the Escrow Account to a different Qualified Depository from
time to time. Such transfer shall be made only upon obtaining the consent of the
Purchaser, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.

          The Seller shall bear any expenses, losses or damages sustained by the
Purchaser because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow Account are not demand
deposit accounts.

          Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow Account may
at the option of the Seller be invested in Eligible Investments; provided that
in the event that amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or the Escrow
Account exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the "Insured Amount") the
Seller shall be obligated to invest the excess amount over the Insured Amount in
Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such excess amount becomes
present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account. Any such Eligible
Investment shall mature no later than the Determination Date next following the
date of such Eligible Investment, provided, however, that if such Eligible
Investment is an obligation of a Qualified Depository (other than the Seller)
that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such Eligible
Investment may mature on such Remittance Date. Any such Eligible Investment
shall be made in the name of the Seller in trust for the benefit of the
Purchaser. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Seller and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Seller. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Seller out of its own
funds immediately as realized.

          Section 2.11 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance. The Seller shall cause
to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan, hazard insurance such that all
buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by a generally acceptable
insurer rated A:VI or better in the


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

current Best's Key Rating Guide ("Best's") against loss by fire, hazards of
extended coverage and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the
Mortgaged Property is located, in an amount which is at least equal to the
lesser of (i) the maximum insurable value of the improvements securing such
Mortgage Loan and (ii) the greater of (a) the outstanding principal balance of
the Mortgage Loan and (b) an amount such that the proceeds thereof shall be
sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor or the loss payee from becoming a
co-insurer.

          If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged
Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood
Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood
insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a generally acceptable insurance carrier rated A:VI or better
in Best's in an amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the
minimum amount required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any
damage or loss on a replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the
mortgage if replacement cost coverage is not available for the type of building
insured) and (ii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available under the
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the
term of the Mortgage Loan, the Seller determines in accordance with applicable
law and pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged Property is located
in a special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is
covered in an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended, the Seller shall notify the related
Mortgagor that the Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if
said Mortgagor fails to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within
forty-five (45) days after such notification, the Seller shall immediately force
place the required flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

          If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project, the
Seller shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association,
including hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained
in accordance with then current Fannie Mae requirements, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Seller promptly of any change in
the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have a
material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.

          The Seller shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged Property
earthquake or such other or additional insurance as may be required pursuant to
such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in force and as
shall require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the requirements of any
private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to conform with
Accepted Servicing Practices.

          In the event that any Purchaser or the Seller shall determine that the
Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards and risks
not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the Mortgagor pursuant
to the terms of the Mortgage, the Seller shall, in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices, provide notice of such to the Mortgagor.

          All policies required hereunder shall name the Seller as loss payee
and shall be endorsed with standard or New York mortgagee clauses, without
contribution, which shall


                                      -15-
<PAGE>

provide for at least 30 days prior written notice of any cancellation, reduction
in amount or material change in coverage.

          The Seller shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of choice
in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however, that the
Seller shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance companies
unless such companies are rated A:VI or better in Best's and are licensed to do
business in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is located. The
Seller shall determine that such policies provide sufficient risk coverage and
amounts, that they insure the property owner, and that they properly describe
the property address. The Seller shall furnish to the Mortgagor a formal notice
of expiration of any such insurance in sufficient time for the Mortgagor to
arrange for renewal coverage by the expiration date.

          Pursuant to Section 2.04, any amounts collected by the Seller under
any such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow Account and
applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property, or
property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be released to the
Mortgagor, in accordance with the Seller's normal servicing procedures as
specified in Section 2.15) shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject
to withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.05.

          Section 2.12 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance. In the
event that the Seller shall obtain and maintain a blanket policy insuring
against losses arising from fire and hazards covered under extended coverage on
all of the Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in
an amount equal to the amount required pursuant to Section 2.11 and otherwise
complies with all other requirements of Section 2.11, it shall conclusively be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in Section 2.11. Any
amounts collected by the Seller under any such policy relating to a Mortgage
Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject to withdrawal pursuant
to Section 2.05. Such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in
the event that there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged
Property a policy complying with Section 2.11, and there shall have been a loss
which would have been covered by such policy, the Seller shall deposit in the
Custodial Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable
under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to be
deposited from the Seller's funds, without reimbursement therefor. Upon request
of the Purchaser, the Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a
certified true copy of such policy and a statement from the insurer thereunder
that such policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without
30 days' prior written notice to the Purchaser.

          Section 2.13 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance. The Seller shall maintain with responsible companies, at its own
expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy,
with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting in any
capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or papers
relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Seller Employees"). Any such Fidelity Bond and
Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the Mortgage
Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Seller against losses,
including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Seller Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

Seller against losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a
Mortgage Loan without having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness
secured thereby. No provision of this Section 2.13 requiring such Fidelity Bond
and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Seller
from its duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum
coverage under any such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal to the
corresponding amounts required by Fannie Mae in the Fannie Mae Guides or by
Freddie Mac in the Freddie Mac Sellers' & Servicers' Guide. Upon the request of
the Purchaser, the Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a
certified true copy of such fidelity bond and insurance policy and a statement
from the surety and the insurer that such fidelity bond and insurance policy
shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without 30 days' prior
written notice to the Purchaser.

          Section 2.14 Inspections. The Seller shall inspect the Mortgaged
Property as often as deemed necessary by the Seller to assure itself that the
value of the Mortgaged Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage
Loan is more than 60 days delinquent, the Seller immediately shall inspect the
Mortgaged Property and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with
Accepted Servicing Practices or as may be required by the primary mortgage
guaranty insurer. The Seller shall keep a written report of each such
inspection. Section

          2.15 Restoration of Mortgaged Property. The Seller need not obtain the
approval of the Purchaser prior to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds to the Mortgagor to be applied to the restoration or
repair of the Mortgaged Property if such release is in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices. At a minimum, the Seller shall comply with the following
conditions in connection with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds:

          (i) the Seller shall receive satisfactory independent verification of
     completion of repairs and issuance of any required approvals with respect
     thereto;

          (ii) the Seller shall take all steps necessary to preserve the
     priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
     requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;

          (iii) the Seller shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is not in
     default; and

          (iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Seller shall place the
     Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.

          If the Purchaser is named as an additional loss payee, the Seller is
hereby empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such a claim in
the name of the Purchaser.

          Section 2.16 Maintenance of PMI Policy and/or LPMI Policy; Claims.
With respect to each Mortgage Loan with a LTV in excess of 80%, the Seller
shall:

          (i) with respect to Mortgage Loans which are not LPMI Loans, without
     any cost to the Owner, maintain or cause the Mortgagor to maintain in full
     force and effect a PMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan in
     excess of 75% (or such other

                                      -17-
<PAGE>

     percentage as stated in the related Acknowledgment Agreement) of value, and
     shall pay or shall cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a
     timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the
     event that such PMI Policy shall be terminated, the Seller shall obtain
     from another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a
     total coverage equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI
     Policy, at substantially the same fee level. If the insurer shall cease to
     be a Qualified Insurer, the Seller shall determine whether recoveries under
     the PMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial
     condition of such insurer, it being understood that the Seller shall in no
     event have any responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under
     the PMI Policy for such reason. If the Seller determines that recoveries
     are so jeopardized, it shall notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor, if
     required, and obtain from another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance
     policy. The Seller shall not take any action which would result in
     noncoverage under any applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for the
     actions of the Seller would have been covered thereunder. In connection
     with any assumption or substitution agreement entered into or to be entered
     into pursuant to Section 4.01, the Seller shall promptly notify the insurer
     under the related PMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of
     liability in accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy and shall take
     all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to the
     continuation of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI Policy is
     terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the
     Seller shall obtain a replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

          (ii) with respect to LPMI Loans, maintain in full force and effect an
     LPMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan in excess of 75% (or
     such other percentage as stated in the related Acknowledgment Agreement) of
     value, and from time to time, withdraw the LPMI Fee with respect to such
     LPMI Loan from the Custodial Account in order to pay the premium thereon on
     a timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In
     the event that the interest payments made with respect to any LPMI Loan are
     less than the LPMI Fee, the Seller shall advance from its own funds the
     amount of any such shortfall in the LPMI Fee, in payment of the premium on
     the related LPMI Policy. Any such advance shall be a Servicing Advance
     subject to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions on Section 2.05. In the
     event that such LPMI Policy shall be terminated, the Seller shall obtain
     from another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a
     total coverage equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated LPMI
     Policy, at substantially the same fee level. If the insurer shall cease to
     be a Qualified Insurer, the Seller shall determine whether recoveries under
     the LPMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial
     condition of such insurer, it being understood that the Seller shall in no
     event have any responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under
     the LPMI Policy for such reason. If the Seller determines that recoveries
     are so jeopardized, it shall notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor, if
     required, and obtain from another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance
     policy. The Seller shall not take any action which would result in
     noncoverage under any applicable LPMI Policy of any loss which, but for the
     actions of the Seller would have been covered thereunder. In connection
     with any assumption or substitution agreement entered into or to be entered
     into pursuant to Section 4.01, the Seller shall promptly notify the insurer
     under the related LPMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution
     of liability in accordance with the terms of such LPMI Policy and shall
     take all actions which may be


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

     required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation of coverage
     under such PMI Policy. If such LPMI Policy is terminated as a result of
     such assumption or substitution of liability, the Seller shall obtain a
     replacement LPMI Policy as provided above.

          In connection with its activities as servicer, the Seller agrees to
prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Owner, claims to the insurer
under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the
terms of such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action
as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy
respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to Section 3.04, any amounts
collected by the Seller under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.05.

          Section 2.17 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property. In the
event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by deed
in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the
name of the Purchaser, or in the event the Purchaser is not authorized or
permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the REO Property is
located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax laws
of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be
taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an
Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Seller from any attorney duly licensed to
practice law in the state where the REO Property is located. The Person or
Persons holding such title other than the Purchaser shall acknowledge in writing
that such title is being held as nominee for the Purchaser.

          The Seller shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO
Property for the Purchaser solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and
sale. The Seller, either itself or through an agent selected by the Seller,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner
that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for
its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same
locality as the REO Property is managed. The Seller shall attempt to sell the
same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than one year,
except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as the Seller
deems to be in the best interest of the Purchaser.

          The Seller shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO Property
as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event within one
year after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless the Seller
determines, and gives an appropriate notice to the Purchaser to such effect,
that a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such REO
Property. If a period longer than one year is permitted under the foregoing
sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Seller shall report
monthly to the Purchaser as to the progress being made in selling such REO
Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Purchaser, a purchase
money mortgage is taken in connection with such sale, such purchase money
mortgage shall name the Seller as mortgagee, and such purchase money mortgage
shall not be held pursuant to this Agreement, but instead a separate
participation agreement among the Seller and Purchaser shall be entered into
with respect to such purchase money mortgage.

          The Seller shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and hazard
insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent


                                      -19-
<PAGE>

required and available under the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as
amended, flood insurance in the amount required above.

          The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the Seller at
such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Seller deems to be in the
best interests of the Purchaser. The proceeds of sale of the REO Property shall
be promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as practical thereafter
the expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Seller shall reimburse itself
for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid Servicing Fees and
unreimbursed advances made pursuant to this Section, and on the Remittance Date
immediately following the Principal Prepayment Period in which such sale
proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such sale remaining in the
Custodial Account shall be distributed to the Purchaser.

          With respect to each REO Property, the Seller shall hold all funds
collected and received in connection with the operation of the REO Property in
the Custodial Account. The Seller shall cause to be deposited on a daily basis
upon the receipt thereof in each Custodial Account all revenues received with
respect to the conservation and disposition of the related REO Property.

          Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time, the
Purchaser may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to one or
more REO Properties as provided by Section 6.03(c).

          Section 2.18 Permitted Withdrawals with respect to REO Property. The
Seller shall withdraw REO funds on deposit in the Custodial Account with respect
to each related REO Property necessary for the proper operation, management and
maintenance of the REO Property, including the cost of maintaining any hazard
insurance pursuant to Section 2.11 and the fees of any managing agent acting on
behalf of the Seller. The Seller shall make monthly distributions on each
Remittance Date to the Purchaser of the net cash flow from the REO Property
(which shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses
described in Section 2.17 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to
time to be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

          Section 2.19 Real Estate Owned Reports. Together with the statement
furnished pursuant to Section 2.20, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser on
or before the 15th day of each month a statement with respect to any REO
Property covering the operation of such REO Property for the previous month and
the Seller's efforts in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any
rental of such REO Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous
month. That statement shall be accompanied by such other information as the
Purchaser shall reasonably request.

          Section 2.20 Liquidation Reports. Upon the foreclosure sale of any
Mortgaged Property or the acquisition thereof by the Purchaser pursuant to a
deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Seller shall submit to the Purchaser a
liquidation report with respect to such Mortgaged Property.

          Section 2.21 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of Mortgaged
Property. Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Seller shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.


                                   ARTICLE III

                              PAYMENTS TO PURCHASER

          Section 3.01 Remittances. On each Remittance Date the Seller shall
remit by wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Purchaser (a) all
amounts deposited in the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the
Determination Date (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 2.05), plus (b) all amounts, if any, which the
Seller is obligated to distribute pursuant to Section 2.03.

          With respect to any remittance received by the Purchaser after the
second Business Day following the Business Day on which such payment was due,
the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser interest on any such late payment at an
annual rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change,
plus three percentage points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account by the Seller on the date such late payment is made and shall cover the
period commencing with the day following such second Business Day and ending
with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such
interest shall be remitted along with the distribution payable on the next
succeeding Remittance Date. The payment by the Seller of any such interest shall
not be deemed an extension of time for payment or a waiver of any Event of
Default by the Seller.

          Section 3.02 Statements to Purchaser. Not later than the Determination
Date of each month, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser a Monthly
Remittance Advice, with a trial balance report attached thereto, in the form of
Exhibit 1 annexed hereto in hard copy and electronic medium mutually acceptable
to the parties as to the preceding remittance and the period ending on the
preceding Determination Date.

          In addition, not more than 60 days after the end of each calendar
year, the Seller shall furnish to each Person who was a Purchaser at any time
during such calendar year an annual statement in accordance with the
requirements of applicable federal income tax law as to the aggregate of
remittances for the applicable portion of such year.

          Such obligation of the Seller shall be deemed to have been satisfied
to the extent that substantially comparable information shall be provided by the
Seller pursuant to any requirements of the Internal Revenue Code as from time to
time are in force.

          The Seller shall prepare and file any and all tax returns, information
statements or other filings required to be delivered to any governmental taxing
authority or to the Purchaser pursuant to any applicable law with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, the Seller
shall provide the Purchaser with such information concerning the Mortgage Loans
as is necessary for the Purchaser to prepare its federal income tax return as
the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

          Section 4.01 Transfers of Mortgaged Property. The Seller shall use its
best efforts to enforce any "due-on-sale" provision contained in any Mortgage or
Mortgage Note and to deny assumption by the person to whom the Mortgaged
Property has been or is about to be sold whether by absolute conveyance or by
contract of sale, and whether or not the Mortgagor remains liable on the
Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by
the Mortgagor, the Seller shall, to the extent it has knowledge of such
conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan
under the "due-on-sale" clause applicable thereto, provided, however, that the
Seller shall not exercise such rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if
the exercise of such rights would impair or threaten to impair any recovery
under the related PMI Policy or LPMI Policy, if any.

          If the Seller reasonably believes it is unable under applicable law to
enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Seller shall enter into (i) an assumption
and modification agreement with the person to whom such property has been
conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage Note
and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in the event the
Seller is unable under applicable law to require that the original Mortgagor
remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Seller has the prior consent of
the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of liability agreement
with the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to which the original
Mortgagor is released from liability and the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property
is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note. If an
assumption fee is collected by the Seller for entering into an assumption
agreement, a portion of such fee, up to an amount equal to one-half of one
percent (0.5%) of the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage
Loan, will be retained by the Seller as additional servicing compensation, and
any portion thereof in excess of one-half of one percent (0.5%) shall be
deposited in the Custodial Account for the benefit of the Purchaser. In
connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne by
the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

          To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the Seller shall
inquire diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee, and
shall use the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of the proposed
transferee which are used by the Seller with respect to underwriting mortgage
loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. If the credit of the proposed
transferee does not meet such underwriting criteria, the Seller diligently
shall, to the extent permitted by the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and by
applicable law, accelerate the maturity of the Mortgage Loan.

          Section 4.02 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage Files.
Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt by the Seller of a
notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a manner customary for
such purposes, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in the Monthly Remittance
Advice as provided in Section 3.02, and may request the release of any Mortgage
Loan Documents from the Purchaser in accordance with this Section 4.02 hereof.



                                      -22-
<PAGE>

          If the Seller satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first having
obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or should
the Seller otherwise prejudice any rights the Purchaser may have under the
mortgage instruments, upon written demand of the Purchaser, the Seller shall
repurchase the related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price by deposit thereof
in the Custodial Account within 2 Business Days of receipt of such demand by the
Purchaser. The Seller shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 2.13 insuring the Seller against any
loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not satisfied in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

          Section 4.03 Servicing Compensation. As consideration for servicing
the Mortgage Loans during the Interim Period, the Seller shall retain a
Servicing Fee with respect to each Mortgage Loan, which amount shall be prorated
for any portion of a month during which the Mortgage Loan is serviced by the
Seller pursuant to this Agreement. The obligation of the Purchaser to pay the
Servicing Fee is limited to, and the Servicing Fee is payable solely from, the
interest portion (including recoveries with respect to interest from Liquidation
Proceeds, to the extent permitted by Section 2.02) of such Monthly Payment
collected by the Seller, or as otherwise provided under Section 2.02.

          Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption fees, to
the extent provided in Section 4.01 and Ancillary Income, shall be retained by
the Seller to the extent not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account.
The Seller shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection
with its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to
reimbursement thereof except as specifically provided for herein.

          Section 4.04 Annual Statement as to Compliance. The Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser, on or before March 31 each year beginning March 31,
200_, and on the Transfer Date an Officer's Certificate, stating that (i) a
review of the activities of the Seller during the preceding calendar year and of
performance under this Agreement has been made under such officer's supervision,
and (ii) the Seller has complied fully with the provisions of Article II and
Article IV, and (iii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such
review, the Seller has fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement
throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any
such obligation, specifying each such default known to such officer and the
nature and status thereof and the action being taken by the Seller to cure such
default. Section

          4.05 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report. On or
before March 31st of each year beginning March 31, 200_, the Seller, at its
expense, shall cause a firm of independent public accountants which is a member
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to furnish a statement
to each Purchaser to the effect that such firm has examined certain documents
and records relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans and this Agreement
and that such firm is of the opinion that the provisions of Article II and
Article III have been complied with, and that, on the basis of such examination
conducted substantially in compliance with the Single Audit Program for Mortgage
Bankers, nothing has come to their attention which would indicate that such
servicing has not been conducted in compliance therewith, except for (i) such
exceptions as such firm shall believe to be immaterial, and (ii) such other
exceptions as shall be set forth in such statement.

          Section 4.06 Right to Examine Seller Records. The Purchaser shall have
the right to examine and audit any and all of the books, records, or other
information of the Seller, whether held by the Seller or by another on its
behalf, with respect to or concerning this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans,
during business hours or at such other times as may be reasonable under
applicable circumstances, upon reasonable advance notice.


                                    ARTICLE V

                               SELLER TO COOPERATE

          Section 5.01 Provision of Information. During the term of this
Agreement, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser such periodic, special, or
other reports or information, whether or not provided for herein, as shall be
necessary, reasonable, or appropriate with respect to the Purchaser or the
purposes of this Agreement. All such reports or information shall be provided by
and in accordance with all reasonable instructions and directions which the
Purchaser may give.

          The Seller shall execute and deliver all such instruments and take all
such action as the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time, in order
to effectuate the purposes and to carry out the terms of this Agreement.

          Section 5.02 Financial Statements; Servicing Facilities. In connection
with marketing the Mortgage Loans, the Purchaser may make available to a
prospective Purchaser a Consolidated Statement of Operations of the Seller for
the most recently completed three fiscal years for which such a statement is
available, as well as a Consolidated Statement of Condition at the end of the
last two fiscal years covered by such Consolidated Statement of Operations. The
Seller also shall make available any comparable interim statements to the extent
any such statements have been prepared by or on behalf of the Seller (and are
available upon request to members or stockholders of the Seller or to the public
at large). If it has not already done so, the Seller shall furnish promptly to
the Purchaser copies of the statement specified above.

          The Seller shall make available to the Purchaser or any prospective
Purchaser a knowledgeable financial or accounting officer for the purpose of
answering questions respecting recent developments affecting the Seller or the
financial statements of the Seller, and to permit any prospective Purchaser to
inspect the Seller's servicing facilities for the purpose of satisfying such
prospective Purchaser that the Seller have the ability to service the Mortgage
Loans as provided in this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                                   TERMINATION

          Section 6.01 Agency Suspension. Should the Seller at any time during
the term of this Agreement have its right to service temporarily or permanently
suspended by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac or otherwise cease to be an approved
seller/servicer of conventional residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac, then the Purchaser may immediately terminate


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

this Agreement and accelerate performance of the provisions of the Purchase
Agreement to require immediate transfer of the Servicing Rights.

          Section 6.02 Damages. The Purchaser shall have the right at any time
to seek and recover from the Seller any damages or losses suffered by it as a
result of any failure by the Seller to observe or perform any duties,
obligations, covenants or agreements herein contained or contained in the
Purchase Agreement, or as a result of a party's failure to remain an approved
Fannie Mae mortgage servicer.

          Section 6.03 Termination Upon Transfer of Servicing.

          (a) Termination Procedures. This Agreement shall terminate with
respect to the Mortgage Loans or portion thereof transferred on the related
Transfer Date set forth in the related Terms Letter; provided that the Purchaser
shall have the option to extend the related Transfer Date for 2 months from the
original related Transfer Date upon written notice to the Seller at least 15
days prior to the related Transfer Date of its intent to extend the related
Transfer Date for 2 months.

          The Purchaser may elect to terminate this Agreement and transfer the
servicing from the Seller prior to the Transfer Date with respect to all or any
portion of the Mortgage Loans by providing written notice to the Seller of its
intent to transfer servicing at least 30 days prior to the date on which it
intends to transfer the servicing from the Seller. On or before the date
specified by the Purchaser in accordance with this paragraph (a) for the
transfer of servicing from the Seller, the Seller shall prepare, execute and
deliver to the successor entity designated by the Purchaser any and all
documents and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
Mortgage Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer and endorsement
or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, at the Seller's sole
expense. The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Seller's responsibilities and rights hereunder.

          Section 6.04 Servicing Transfer Provisions. On or prior to the related
Transfer Date the Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense take such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and evidence the transfer of the
servicing of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, or its designee, including but
not limited to the following:

          On the Transfer Date, the Seller shall comply with all of the
provisions of Section 5 of the Purchase Agreement to effect a complete transfer
of the Servicing Rights. On the related Transfer Date for each Mortgage Loan,
this Agreement, except for Articles VI, VIII, IX and X which shall survive the
Transfer Date, shall terminate.

          (a) Mortgage Loans in Foreclosure. The servicing with respect to
Mortgage Loans in foreclosure on or before the Transfer Date shall not be
transferred from the Seller to the Purchaser or the successor servicer, as the
case may be, and such Mortgage Loans shall continue to be serviced by the Seller
pursuant to the terms of this Agreement. However, if the Purchaser so elects,
the Purchaser may waive the provisions of this paragraph (a) and accept transfer
of servicing of such Mortgage Loans and all amounts received by the Seller
thereunder.


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

          (b) Servicing Advances. Notwithstanding the fact that the Transfer
Date has occurred, the Seller shall not be reimbursed for any Servicing Advances
with respect to any Mortgage Loan until the Seller or the successor servicer
receives a Monthly Payment or Liquidation Proceeds with respect to such Mortgage
Loan. At such time, the Seller shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all
unreimbursed Servicing Advances with respect to such Mortgage Loan on a first
priority basis (but subject to any successor servicer's rights to reimbursement
with respect to Servicing Advances) from the Monthly Payment or Liquidation
Proceeds received with respect to such Mortgage Loan. This Section 6.03(b) shall
survive the Transfer Date.

          (c) Additional Termination Provisions. Notwithstanding and in addition
to the foregoing, in the event that (i) a Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a
period of 120 days or more (a "Delinquent Mortgage Loan") or (ii) a Mortgage
Loan becomes an REO Property, the Purchaser may at its election terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property, upon 15
days' written notice to the Seller.


                                   ARTICLE VII

                                BOOKS AND RECORDS

          Section 7.01 Possession of Servicing Files Prior to the Transfer Date.
Prior to the Transfer Date, the contents of each Servicing File are and shall be
held in trust by the Seller for the benefit of the Purchaser as the owner
thereof. The Seller shall maintain in the Servicing File a copy of the contents
of each Mortgage File and the originals of the documents in each Mortgage File
not delivered to the Purchaser. The possession of the Servicing File by the
Seller is at the will of the Purchaser for the sole purpose of servicing the
related Mortgage Loan, pursuant to this Agreement, and such retention and
possession by the Seller is in its capacity as Seller only and at the election
of the Purchaser. The Seller shall release its custody of the contents of any
Servicing File only in accordance with written instructions from the Purchaser,
unless such release is required as incidental to the Seller's servicing of the
Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement or is in connection with a repurchase
of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 8 of the Purchase Agreement.

          The Seller shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a
complete set of books and records for each Mortgage Loan which shall be marked
clearly to reflect the ownership of each Mortgage Loan by the Purchaser. In
particular, the Seller shall maintain in its possession, available for
inspection by the Purchaser or its designee, and shall deliver to the Purchaser
or its designee upon demand, evidence of compliance with all federal, state and
local laws, rules and regulations, and requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac, including but not limited to documentation as to the method used in
determining the applicability of the provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection

          The Seller shall keep at its servicing office books and records in
which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Seller
shall note transfers of Mortgage Loans. No transfer of a Mortgage Loan may be
made unless such transfer is in compliance with the terms hereof. For the
purposes of this Agreement, the Seller shall be under no obligation to deal with
any person with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans unless the books
and records show such person as the owner of the Mortgage Loan. The Purchaser
may, subject to the terms of this Agreement, sell or transfer one or more of the
Mortgage Loans, provided, however, that the transferee will not be deemed to be
a Purchaser hereunder binding upon the Seller unless such transferee shall agree
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and an original
counterpart of the instrument of transfer and an assignment and assumption of
this Agreement executed by the transferee shall have been delivered to the
Seller. The Purchaser also shall advise the Seller of the transfer. Upon receipt
of notice of the transfer, the Seller shall mark its books and records to
reflect the ownership of the Mortgage Loans of such assignee, and shall release
the previous Purchaser from its obligations hereunder with respect to the
Mortgage Loans sold or transferred.


                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         INDEMNIFICATION AND ASSIGNMENT

          Section 8.01 Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser
and hold it harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties,
fines, and forfeitures, including, but not limited to reasonable and necessary
legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses
that the Purchaser may sustain in any way related to the failure of the Seller
to (a) perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance
with the terms of this Agreement, and/or (b) comply with applicable law. The
Seller immediately shall notify the Purchaser if a claim is made by a third
party with respect to this Agreement, assume (with the prior written consent of
the Purchaser) the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against it or the Purchaser in respect
of such claim. The Seller shall follow any written instructions received from
the Purchaser in connection with such claim. The Purchaser promptly shall
reimburse the Seller for all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding
sentence except when the claim is in any way related to the Seller's
indemnification pursuant to Section 8 of the Purchase Agreement, or the failure
of the Seller to (a) service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict
compliance with the terms of this Agreement and/or (b) comply with applicable
law.

          Section 8.02 Limitation on Liability of Seller and Others. Neither the
Seller nor any of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the Seller
shall be under any liability to the Purchaser for any action taken or for
refraining from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, provided, however, that this provision
shall not protect the Seller or any such person against any breach of warranties
or representations made herein, or failure to perform its obligations in strict
compliance with any standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Seller and any director, officer, employee
or agent of the Seller may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima
facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising hereunder. The


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Seller shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any
legal action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage Loans
in accordance with this Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it in any
expense or liability, provided, however, that the Seller may, with the consent
of the Purchaser, undertake any such action which it may deem necessary or
desirable in respect to this Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties
hereto. In such event, the Seller shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
Purchaser of the reasonable legal expenses and costs of such action.

          Section 8.03 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by Seller. The
Purchaser has entered into this Agreement with the Seller and subsequent
Purchasers will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the independent
status of the Seller, and the representations as to the adequacy of its
servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and procedures, its integrity,
reputation and financial standing, and the continuance thereof. Therefore, the
Seller shall neither assign this Agreement or the servicing hereunder or
delegate its rights or duties hereunder or any portion hereof or sell or
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall be granted or
withheld in the sole discretion of the Purchaser.

          The Seller shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Seller and the Purchaser or upon
the determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Seller. Any such
determination permitting the resignation of the Seller shall be evidenced by an
Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Purchaser which Opinion of
Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Purchaser. No such
resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the
Seller's responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in
Section 6.02.

          Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 8.03, in
the event that the Seller either shall assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property
or assets, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, then the
Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon notice given as
set forth in Section 6.02, without any payment of any penalty or damages and
without any liability whatsoever to the Seller or any third party.

          Section 8.04 Assignment by Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have the
right, without the consent of the Seller, to assign, in whole or in part, its
interest under this Agreement with respect to some or all of the Mortgage Loans,
and designate any person to exercise any rights of the Purchaser hereunder, by
executing an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in the form of Exhibit 8
hereto. Upon such assignment of rights and assumption of obligations, the
assignee or designee shall accede to the rights and obligations hereunder of the
Purchaser with respect to such Mortgage Loans and the Purchaser as assignor
shall be released from all obligations hereunder with respect to such Mortgage
Loans from and after the date of such assignment and assumption. All references
to the Purchaser in this Agreement shall be deemed to include its assignee or
designee.

the right or ability of the Seller to carry on its business substantially as now
conducted, or in any material liability on the part of the Seller, or which

of any action taken or to be taken in connection with the obligations of the
Seller contemplated herein, or which would be likely to impair materially the
ability of the Seller to perform under the terms of this Agreement;

          Section 10.07 No Consent Required. No consent, approval, authorization
or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the

to be remedied, shall have been given to the Seller by the Purchaser; or

          In each and every such case, so long as an Event of Default shall not
have been remedied, in addition to whatever rights the Purchaser may have at law
or equity to damages, including injunctive relief and specific performance, the
Purchaser, by notice in writing to



                                      -31-

except to the extent expressly so waived.

Seller and will be reflected on the Purchaser's balance sheet and other
financial statements as a purchase by the Purchaser. The Seller shall be
responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a complete set of books and

shall maintain in its possession, available for inspection by the Purchaser, or

recreating original documents, including but not limited to, optical imagery
techniques.

                  This Agreement continuously, from the time of its execution,
shall be an official record of the Seller and Seller will maintain a copy of
this Agreement and each agreement related hereto in its official books and
records. The Seller shall maintain with respect to each Mortgage Loan and shall

Servicing File during the time the Purchaser retains ownership of a Mortgage
Loan and thereafter in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

                  The Seller shall keep at its office books and records in which
the Seller shall note transfers of Mortgage Loans. No transfer of a Mortgage
Loan may be made unless such transfer is in compliance with the terms of Section

obligation to deal with any person with respect to this Agreement or any
Mortgage Loan unless a properly executed Assignment and Assumption substantially
in the form of Exhibit G with respect to such Mortgage Loan has been delivered
to the Seller; provided, that, in no event shall there be more than four (4)
"Purchasers" with respect to any Mortgage Loan Package, except as may be
otherwise set forth in the related Purchase Price and Terms Agreement.

                  Section 2.03 Delivery of Documents.

                  No later than the date set forth in the related Purchase Price
and Terms Agreement, the Seller shall deliver to the Custodian those Mortgage
Loan Documents as required by this Agreement with respect to each Mortgage Loan
included in the related Mortgage Loan Package, a list of which is attached as

have certified its receipt of all such Mortgage Loan Documents required to be
delivered pursuant to the Custodial Agreement, as evidenced by the initial
certification of the Custodian in the form annexed to the Custodial Agreement.
The Purchaser shall be responsible for maintaining the Custodial Agreement and
shall pay all fees and expenses of the Custodian. On the related Closing Date,
the Seller shall release any interest that it has in the Mortgage Loan Documents
upon its receipt of the Purchase Price for the related Mortgage Loans. Within
forty-five (45) days of receipt by the Seller of any notice from the Purchaser
or the Custodian that any of the Mortgage Loan Documents is missing, does not
appear regular on its face (i.e., is


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

mutilated, damaged, defaced, torn or otherwise physically altered) or appears to
be unrelated to the Mortgage Loans identified in the Mortgage Loan Schedule
(each, a "Material Defect"), the Seller shall cure such Material Defect (and, in
such event, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser with an Officer's Certificate
confirming that such cure has been effected). If the Seller does not so cure
such Material Defect, it shall, if such Material Defect would under Accepted
Servicing Practices reasonably be expected to result in a loss, repurchase the
related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price. A loss shall be deemed to be
attributable to the failure of the Seller to cure a Material Defect if, as
determined by the Purchaser acting in good faith, absent such Material Defect,
such loss would not have been incurred.

                  The Seller shall forward to the Custodian original documents
evidencing an assumption, modification, consolidation or extension of any
Mortgage Loan entered into in accordance with Section 5.01 or 7.01 within two
weeks of their execution, provided, however, that the Seller shall provide the
Custodian and the Purchaser or its designee with a certified true copy of any
such document submitted for recordation within two weeks of its execution, and
shall provide the original of any document submitted for recordation or a copy
of such document certified by the appropriate public recording office to be a
true and complete copy of the original within ninety (90) days of its submission
for recordation. If delivery is not completed within ninety (90) days from its
submission solely because such documents shall not have been returned by the
appropriate recording office, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser of the same
and indicate in such notice the approximate date on which such documents shall
be delivered, provided that, if such delivery is not completed within one
hundred eighty (180) days of submission, the Seller shall provide the Purchaser
with periodic updates as to the status of any such submission, which updates
shall be provided as often as may reasonably be deemed necessary by the
Purchaser.

                  The Seller shall deliver a final Mortgage Loan Schedule for
the Mortgage Loans included in any Mortgage Loan Package to be purchased on any
Closing Date to the Purchaser no later than the date set forth in the related
Purchaser Price and Terms Agreement.

                  In addition, in connection with the assignment of any MERS
Mortgage Loan, the Seller agrees that it will cause, at its own expense, the
MERS System to indicate that such Mortgage Loans have been assigned by the
Seller to the Purchaser in accordance with this Agreement by including (or
deleting, in the case of Mortgage Loans which are repurchased in accordance with
this Agreement) in such computer files the information required by the MERS
System to identify the Purchaser of such Mortgage Loans. The Seller further
agrees that it will not alter the information referenced in this paragraph with
respect to any Mortgage Loan during the term of this Agreement unless and until
such Mortgage Loan is repurchased in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement.

                                  ARTICLE III

                                 PURCHASE PRICE

                  The Purchase Price shall be the percentage of par as stated in
the related Purchase Price and Terms Agreement (subject to the adjustments as
provided therein), multiplied by the aggregate Stated Principal Balance of the
Mortgage Loans included in the related Mortgage Loan


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

Package. Notwithstanding the foregoing, if a Mortgage Loan prepays in full
between the related Cut-off Date and the related Closing Date, inclusive, the
Seller shall either remove such Mortgage Loan from the Mortgage Loan Schedule or
reimburse the Purchaser for the premium over par (if any) which the Purchaser
paid within five (5) days of the related Closing Date. In addition, Purchaser
will not purchase any Mortgage Loan that has not made a payment as of the date
set forth in the related Purchase Price and Terms Agreement. The initial
principal amount of the Mortgage Loans shall be the aggregate principal balance
of such Mortgage Loans, so computed as of the related Cut-off Date. On each
Closing Date, the Purchaser shall deduct from the Purchase Price proceeds
certain costs and expenses set forth in Article XIII or in the related Purchase
Price and Terms Agreement, if applicable.

                  In addition to the Purchase Price as described above, the
Purchaser shall pay to the Seller, on the related Closing Date, accrued interest
on the Stated Principal Balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the related Cut-off
Date at the weighted average Mortgage Interest Rate from the date interest was
last received on the related Mortgage Loan through the day prior to the related
Closing Date, inclusive.

                  The Purchase Price shall be paid on the related Closing Date
by wire transfer of immediately available federal funds.

                  The Purchaser shall be entitled to (i) all principal received
after the related Cut-off Date, (ii) all other recoveries of late charges,
assumption fees or other charges collected after the related Cut-off Date, to
the extent any such charges are not Ancillary Income, and (iii) all payments of
interest on the Mortgage Loans at the Mortgage Interest Rate. The principal
balance of each Mortgage Loan as of the related Cut-off Date is determined after
application of payments of principal received on or before the related Cut-off
Date. All payments of principal and interest (minus interest at the Servicing
Fee Rate) due on the first day of the month after the related Cut-off Date shall
belong to the Purchaser.

Agreement) by the Seller and the consummation of the transactions contemplated
hereby have been duly and validly authorized; this Agreement evidences the

of bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other similar laws
relating to or affecting creditors' rights and to the application of equitable
principles in any proceeding, whether at law or in equity; and all requisite
corporate action has been taken by the Seller to make this Agreement valid and
binding upon the Seller in accordance with its terms;

                  (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of
business of the Seller, and the transfer, assignment and conveyance of the
Mortgage Notes and the Mortgages by the Seller pursuant to this Agreement are
not subject to the bulk transfer or any similar statutory provisions in effect
in any applicable jurisdiction;

                  (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this
Agreement, the acquisition of the Mortgage Loans by the Seller, the sale of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser or the transactions contemplated hereby, nor the
fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions of this Agreement,
will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms, conditions or

                  (d) Ability to Perform. The Seller does not believe, nor does
it have any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every
covenant contained in this Agreement. The Seller is solvent and the sale of the
Mortgage Loans will not cause the Seller to become insolvent. The sale of the
Mortgage Loans is not undertaken with the intent to hinder, delay or defraud any
of the Seller's creditors;

                  (e) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or, to the Seller's knowledge, threatened
against the Seller which, either in any one instance or in the aggregate, may
result in any material adverse change in the business, operations, financial
condition, properties or assets of the Seller, or in any material impairment of
the right or ability of the Seller to carry on its business substantially as now
conducted, or in any material liability on the part of the Seller, or which

of any action taken or to be taken in connection with the obligations of the
Seller contemplated herein, or which would be likely to impair materially the
ability of the Seller to perform under the terms of this Agreement;

                  (f) No Consent Required. No consent, approval, authorization

<PAGE>


Purchaser or the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
Agreement, or if required, such approval has been obtained prior to the related
Closing Date;

                  (g) Selection Process. The Mortgage Loans were not
intentionally selected in a manner so as to affect adversely the interests of
the Purchaser;

                  (h) No Untrue Information. This Agreement, the related
Acknowledgment and Conveyance Agreement, and any statement, report or other
document furnished or to be furnished pursuant to this Agreement, the related
Acknowledgment and Conveyance Agreement or in connection with the transactions
contemplated hereby do not contain any untrue statement of material fact or omit
to state a material fact necessary to make the statements contained therein not
misleading;

                  (i) Sale Treatment. The Seller will treat the sale of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser as a sale for reporting and accounting purposes
and for federal income tax purposes;

                  (j) No Commissions to Third Parties: The Seller has not dealt
with any broker or agent or anyone else who might be entitled to a fee or
commission in connection with this transaction other than the Purchaser;

                  (k) Financial Statements. The Seller has delivered to the
Purchaser financial statements as to its last two (2) complete fiscal years for
which financial statements are available. All such financial statements fairly
present the pertinent results of operations and changes in financial position at
the end of each such period of the Seller and its subsidiaries and have been
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles
consistently applied throughout the periods involved, except as set forth in the
notes thereto. There has been no change in the business, operations, financial
condition, properties or assets of the Seller since the date of the Seller's
financial statements that would have a material adverse effect on its ability to
perform its obligations under this Agreement. The Seller has completed any forms
requested by the Purchaser in a timely manner and in accordance with the
provided instructions;

                  (l) Fair Consideration. The consideration received by the

consideration and reasonably equivalent value for the Mortgage Loans; and

connection with the servicing of the MERS Mortgage Loans for as long as such

conventional residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, with the
facilities, procedures, and experienced personnel necessary for the sound
servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. The Seller
is in good standing to service mortgage loans for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac,
and no event has occurred, including but not limited to a change in insurance
coverage, which would make the Seller unable to comply with Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac eligibility requirements or which would require notification to
either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, as applicable; and


                                      -20-
<PAGE>

                  (o) Reasonable Servicing Fee: The Seller acknowledges and
agrees that the Servicing Fee, as calculated at the Servicing Fee Rate,
represents reasonable compensation for performing such services and that the
entire Servicing Fee shall be treated by the Seller, for accounting and tax
purposes, as compensation for the servicing and administration of the Mortgage
Loans pursuant to this Agreement.

                  Section 4.02 Representations and Warranties Regarding
                               Individual Mortgage Loans.

                  As to each Mortgage Loan, the Seller hereby represents and
warrants to the Purchaser that as of the related Closing Date:

                  (a) Mortgage Loans as Described. The information set forth in
the Mortgage Loan Schedule is complete, true and correct in all material
respects;

                  (b) Payments Current. All payments required to be made up to
the related Closing Date on the Mortgage Loan under the terms of the Mortgage
Note have been made and credited. No payment required under the Mortgage Loan is
delinquent nor has any payment under the Mortgage Loan been delinquent for
thirty (30) days or more at any time since the date the Mortgage Loan was
originated. The first Monthly Payment has been or shall be made with respect to
the Mortgage Loan on its Due Date or within the grace period, all in accordance
with the terms of the related Mortgage Note;

                  (c) No Outstanding Charges. There are no defaults in complying
with the terms of the Mortgages, and all taxes, governmental assessments,
insurance premiums, water, sewer and municipal charges, leasehold payments or
ground rents which previously became due and owing have been paid, or an escrow
of funds has been established in an amount sufficient to pay for every such item
which remains unpaid and which has been assessed but is not yet due and payable.
The Seller has not advanced funds, or induced, solicited or knowingly received
any advance of funds by a party other than the Mortgagor, directly or
indirectly, for the payment of any amount required under the Mortgage Loan,
except for interest accruing from the date of the Mortgage Note or date of
disbursement of the Mortgage Loan proceeds, whichever is earlier, to the day
which precedes by one month the Due Date of the first installment of principal
and interest;

                  (d) Original Terms Unmodified. The terms of the Mortgage Note
and Mortgage have not been impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect,
except by a written instrument which has been recorded, if necessary to protect
the interests of the Purchaser and which has been delivered to the Purchaser.
The substance of any such waiver, alteration or modification has been approved
by any related title insurer, to the extent required by the policy, and its
terms are reflected on the Mortgage Loan Schedule. No Mortgagor has been
released, in whole or in part, except in connection with an assumption agreement
approved by any related the title insurer, to the extent required by the policy,
and which assumption agreement is part of the Mortgage Loan File delivered to
the Custodian and the terms of which are reflected in the related Mortgage Loan
Schedule;


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

                  (e) No Defenses. The Mortgage Loan is not subject to any right
of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including without limitation
the defense of usury, nor will the operation of any of the terms of the Mortgage
Note or the Mortgage, or the exercise of any right thereunder, render either the
Mortgage Note or the Mortgage unenforceable, in whole or in part, or subject to
any right of rescission, set-off, counterclaim or defense, including without
limitation the defense of usury, and no such right of rescission, set-off,
counterclaim or defense has been asserted with respect thereto;

                  (f) Hazard Insurance. Pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage,
all buildings or other improvements upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by a
generally acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage
and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property
is located pursuant to insurance policies conforming to the requirements of
Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the
Mortgaged Property was in an area identified in the Federal Register by the
Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards a
life-of-loan flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the current
guidelines of the Federal Flood Insurance Administration is in effect which
policy conforms to the requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Such flood
insurance shall be with an insurer acceptable under the Fannie Mae Guides or the
Freddie Mac Guides. All individual insurance policies contain a standard
mortgagee clause naming the Seller and its successors and assigns as mortgagee,
and all premiums thereon have been paid. The Mortgage obligates the Mortgagor
thereunder to maintain the hazard insurance policy at the Mortgagor's cost and
expense, and on the Mortgagor's failure to do so, authorizes the holder of the
Mortgage to obtain and maintain such insurance at such Mortgagor's cost and
expense, and to seek reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor. Where required
by state law or regulation, the Mortgagor has been given an opportunity to
choose the carrier of the required hazard insurance, provided the policy is not
a "master" or "blanket" hazard insurance policy covering the common facilities
of a planned unit development. The hazard insurance policy is the valid and
binding obligation of the insurer, is in full force and effect, and will be in
full force and effect and inure to the benefit of the Purchaser upon the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement. The Seller has
not engaged in, and has no knowledge of the Mortgagor's or any subservicer's
having engaged in, any act or omission which would impair the coverage of any
such policy, the benefits of the endorsement provided for herein, or the
validity and binding effect of either, including without limitation, no unlawful
fee, commission, kickback or other unlawful compensation or value of any kind
has been or will be received, retained or realized by any attorney, firm or
other person or entity, and no such unlawful items have been received, retained
or realized by the Seller;

                  (g) Compliance with Applicable Laws. Any and all requirements
of any federal, state or local law including, without limitation, usury,
truth-in-lending, real estate settlement procedures, consumer credit protection,
equal credit opportunity, predatory or abusive lending, or disclosure laws
applicable to the Mortgage Loan have been complied with, and the Seller shall
maintain in its possession, available for the Purchaser's inspection, and shall
deliver to the Purchaser on the related Closing Date, evidence of compliance
with all such requirements.

                  (h) No Satisfaction of Mortgage. The Mortgage has not been
satisfied, canceled, subordinated or rescinded, in whole or in part, and the
Mortgaged Property has not been released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole
or in part, nor has any instrument been


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

executed that would effect any such release, cancellation, subordination or
rescission. The Seller has not waived the performance by the Mortgagor of any
action, if the Mortgagor's failure to perform such action would cause the
Mortgage Loan to be in default, nor has the Seller waived any default resulting
from any action or inaction by the Mortgagor;

                  (i) Location and Type of Mortgaged Property. As to Mortgage
Loans that are not Co-op Loans and that are not secured by an interest in a
leasehold estate, the Mortgaged Property is a fee simple property located in the
state identified in the related Mortgage Loan Schedule and consists of a single
parcel of real property with a detached single family residence erected thereon,
a two- to four-family dwelling, an individual condominium unit in a condominium
project, or an individual unit in a planned unit development, provided, however,
that any condominium unit or planned unit development shall conform with the
applicable Underwriting Guidelines regarding such dwellings and that no
residence or dwelling is a mobile home or a manufactured dwelling. No portion of
the Mortgaged Property is used for commercial purposes except as permitted under
the Underwriting Guidelines;

                  (j) Valid First or Second Lien. With respect to any First Lien
Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgage is a valid, subsisting, enforceable and
perfected first lien on the Mortgaged Property, and with respect to any Second
Lien Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgage is a valid, subsisting, enforceable and
perfected second lien on the Mortgaged Property, including, for Mortgage Loans
that are not Co-op Loans, all buildings on the Mortgaged Property and all
installations and mechanical, electrical, plumbing, heating and air conditioning
systems located in or annexed to such buildings, and all additions, alterations
and replacements made at any time with respect to the foregoing securing the
Mortgage Note's original principal balance. Such lien is free and clear of all
adverse claims, liens and encumbrances having priority over the first lien or
second lien, as applicable, of the Mortgage subject only to:

                  (1) with respect to any Second Lien Mortgage Loan, the related
         First Lien;

                  (2) the lien of current real property taxes and assessments
         not yet due and payable;

                  (3) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way,
         easements and other matters of the public record as of the date of
         recording acceptable to mortgage lending institutions generally and
         specifically referred to in the lender's title insurance policy
         delivered to the originator of the Mortgage Loan and (i) referred to or
         to otherwise considered in the appraisal made for the originator of the
         Mortgage Loan or (ii) which do not adversely affect the appraised value
         of the Mortgaged Property set forth in such appraisal; and

                  (4) other matters to which like properties are commonly
         subject which do not materially interfere with the benefits of the
         security intended to be provided by the Mortgage or the use, enjoyment,
         value or marketability of the related Mortgaged Property.

                  (k) Any security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent
document related to and delivered in connection with the Mortgage Loan
establishes and creates (1) with respect to


                                      -23-
<PAGE>

any First Lien Mortgage Loan, a valid, subsisting and enforceable first lien and
first priority security interest and (2) with respect to any Second Lien
Mortgage Loan, a valid, subsisting, enforceable and perfected second lien and
second priority security interest, in each case, on the property described
therein and the Seller has full right to sell and assign the same to the
Purchaser. The Mortgaged Property was not, as of the date of origination of the
Mortgage Loan, subject to a mortgage, deed of trust, deed to secure debt or
other security instrument, if any, creating a lien subordinate to the lien of
the Mortgage;

                  (l) Validity of Mortgage Documents. The Mortgage Note and the
Mortgage are genuine, and each is the legal, valid and binding obligation of the
maker thereof enforceable in accordance with its terms, except as such
enforcement may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency, moratorium, reorganization
and other laws of general application affecting the rights of creditors
generally and the equitable remedy of specific performance and by general
equitable principles. All parties to the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and any
other related agreement had legal capacity to enter into the Mortgage Loan and
to execute and deliver the Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage and any other
related agreement, and the Mortgage Note and the related Mortgage and any other
related agreement have been duly and properly executed by such parties. No fraud
was committed in connection with the origination of the Mortgage Loan. The
Seller has reviewed all of the documents constituting the Servicing File and has
made such inquiries as it deems necessary to make and confirm the accuracy of
the representations set forth herein;

                  (m) Full Disbursement of Proceeds. The Mortgage Loan has been
closed and the proceeds of the Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed and there
is no requirement for future advances thereunder, and any and all requirements
as to completion of any on-site or off-site improvement and as to disbursements
of any escrow funds therefor have been complied with. All costs, fees and
expenses incurred in making or closing the Mortgage Loan and the recording of
the Mortgage were paid, and the Mortgagor is not entitled to any refund of any
amounts paid or due under the Mortgage Note or related Mortgage;

                  (n) Ownership. Except with respect to MERS Mortgage Loans, the
Seller or its affiliate is the sole owner of record and holder of the Mortgage
Loan. The Mortgage Loan is not assigned or pledged, and the Seller has good and
marketable title thereto, and has full right to transfer and sell the Mortgage
Loan therein to the Purchaser free and clear of any encumbrance, equity,
participation interest, lien, pledge, charge, claim or security interest, and
has full right and authority subject to no interest or participation of, or
agreement with, any other party, to sell and assign each Mortgage Loan pursuant
to this Agreement;

                  (o) Doing Business. All parties which have had any interest in
the Mortgage Loan, whether as mortgagee, assignee, pledgee or otherwise, are
(or, during the period in which they held and disposed of such interest, were)
(1) in compliance with any and all applicable licensing requirements of the laws
of the state wherein the Mortgaged Property is located, and (2) organized under
the laws of such state, or (3) qualified to do business in such state, or (4)
federal savings and loan associations or national banks having principal offices
in such state, or (5) not doing business in such state;

                  (p) LTV, PMI Policy. If a Mortgage Loan has an LTV greater
than 80% and is subject to a PMI Policy, such PMI Policy was issued by a
Qualified Insurer and insures against


                                      -24-
<PAGE>

payment defaults that portion of the Mortgage Loan in excess of the portion of
the Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property required by Fannie Mae. All
provisions of any such PMI Policy have been and are being complied with, any
such policy is in full force and effect, and all premiums due thereunder have
been paid. No action, inaction, or event has occurred and no state of facts
exists that has, or will result in the exclusion from, denial of, or defense to
coverage. If the Mortgage Loan provides for negative amortization or for the
potential for negative amortization, the PMI Policy insures any increase in the
Stated Principal Balance from the original balance of the Mortgage Note. Any
Mortgage Loan subject to a PMI Policy obligates the Mortgagor thereunder to
maintain the PMI Policy and to pay all premiums and charges in connection
therewith. The Mortgage Interest Rate for the Mortgage Loan as set forth on the
Mortgage Loan Schedule is net of any such insurance premium;

                  (q) Loan to Value Ratio. No Mortgage Loan has an LTV of
greater than as set forth in the related Purchase Price and Terms Agreement. No
Second Lien Mortgage Loan has a CLTV of greater than 100%;

                  (r) Title Insurance. Each Mortgage Loan that is not a Co-op
Loan is covered by an ALTA lender's title insurance policy or other generally
acceptable form of policy of insurance acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,
issued by a title insurer acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and qualified
to do business in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located,
insuring the Seller, its successors and assigns, as to the first priority lien
of the Mortgage in the original principal amount of the Mortgage Loan subject
only to the exceptions contained in clauses (1), (2) and (3) of paragraph (j) of
this Section 4.02. Where required by state law or regulation, the Mortgagor has
been given the opportunity to choose the carrier of the required mortgage title
insurance. Additionally, such lender's title insurance policy affirmatively
insures ingress and egress, and against encroachments by or upon the Mortgaged
Property or any interest therein. The Seller, its successors and assigns, are
the sole insureds of such lender's title insurance policy, and such lender's
title insurance policy is in full force and effect and will be in force and
effect upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement.
No claims have been made under such lender's title insurance policy, and no
prior holder of the Mortgage, including the Seller, has done, by act or
omission, anything which would impair the coverage of such lender's title
insurance policy including without limitation, no unlawful fee, commission,
kickback or other unlawful compensation or value of any kind has been or will be
received, retained or realized by any attorney, firm or other person or entity,
and no such unlawful items have been received, retained or realized by the
Seller;

                  (s) No Defaults. There is no default, breach, violation or
event of acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note or
related documents and no event which, with the passage of time or with notice
and the expiration of any applicable grace or cure period, would constitute a
default, breach, violation or event of acceleration, and neither the Seller nor
any of its predecessors have waived any default, breach, violation or event of
acceleration. With respect to each Second Lien Mortgage Loan, (i) the First Lien
is in full force and effect, (ii) there is no default, breach, violation or
event of acceleration existing under such prior mortgage or the related mortgage
note, (iii) no event which, with the passage of time or with notice and the
expiration of any grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach,
violation or event of acceleration thereunder, and either (A) the prior mortgage
contains a provision which allows or (B) applicable law requires, the mortgagee
under the Second Lien


                                      -25-
<PAGE>

Mortgage Loan to receive notice of, and affords such mortgagee an opportunity to
cure any default by payment in full or otherwise under the prior mortgage;

                  (t) No Mechanics' Liens. There are no mechanics' or similar
liens or claims which have been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights
are outstanding that under the law could give rise to such liens) affecting the
related Mortgaged Property which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or
coordinate with, the lien of the related Mortgage;

                  (u) Location of Improvements; No Encroachments. All
improvements which were considered in determining the Appraised Value of the
Mortgaged Property lay wholly within the boundaries and building restriction
lines of the Mortgaged Property (and wholly within the project with respect to a
condominium unit) and no improvements on adjoining properties to which value was
assigned encroach upon the Mortgaged Property; further, the value of the
Mortgaged Property is not diminished by any improvements on adjoining properties
which encroach the Mortgaged Property. No improvement located on or being part
of the Mortgaged Property (upon which value was given in determining the
Appraised Value) is in violation of any applicable zoning law or regulation;
provided, that in no event shall a legal nonconforming use of the Mortgaged
Property be considered a violation of any such zoning law or regulation;

                  (v) Origination: Payment Terms. Except with respect to
Interest Only Mortgage Loans, principal payments on the Mortgage Loan commenced
no more than sixty (60) days after the funds were disbursed in connection with
the Mortgage Loan. At the time the Mortgage Loan was originated, the originator
was a mortgagee approved by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development
pursuant to Sections 203 and 211 of the National Housing Act or a savings and
loan association, a savings bank, a commercial bank or similar banking
institution which is supervised and examined by a Federal or State authority.
The Mortgage Interest Rate is (i) with respect to ARM Mortgage Loans, adjusted
on each Interest Rate Adjustment Date pursuant to the related Mortgage Loan
Documents and subject to the Mortgage Interest Rate Cap, the Periodic Rate Cap
and the Lifetime Rate Cap and (ii) with respect to Fixed Rate Mortgage Loans,
the fixed interest rate set forth in the Mortgage Note. Except with respect to
any balloon Mortgage Loans and Interest Only Mortgage Loans, as indicated on the
related Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Mortgage Note is payable in equal monthly
installments of principal and interest, with interest calculated and payable in
arrears, sufficient to amortize the Mortgage Loan fully by the stated maturity
date, over an original term of not more than thirty (30) years from commencement
of amortization; provided, however, in the case of a balloon Mortgage Loan, the
Mortgage Loan matures at least five (5) years after the first payment date, but
prior to the full amortization of the Mortgage Loan, thereby requiring a final
payment of the outstanding principal balance prior to the full amortization of
such Mortgage Loan. The Mortgage Interest Rate, as well as the Lifetime Rate
Cap, the Periodic Rate Cap and the Mortgage Interest Rate Cap, are as set forth
on the Mortgage Loan Schedule. No ARM Mortgage Loan contains terms whereby the
Mortgagor is permitted to convert the Mortgage Loan to a Fixed Rate Mortgage
Loan and no ARM Mortgage Loan contains a rounding feature. All of the ARM
Mortgage Loans contain an interest rate provision that requires a lookback of 25
days. No mortgage loan provides for negative amortization. The Mortgage Interest
Rate is as set forth on the Mortgage Loan Schedule.


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

                  (w) Customary Provisions. The related Mortgage contains
customary and enforceable provisions such as to render the rights and remedies
of the holder thereof adequate for the realization against the Mortgaged
Property of the benefits of the security provided thereby, including, (i) in the
case of a Mortgage designated as a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (ii)
otherwise by judicial or nonjudicial foreclosure. Upon default by a Mortgagor on
a Mortgage Loan and foreclosure on, or trustee's sale of, the Mortgaged Property
pursuant to the proper procedures, the holder of the Mortgage Loan will be able
to deliver good and merchantable title to the Mortgaged Property. There is no
homestead or other exemption available to a Mortgagor which would interfere with
the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or the right to
foreclose the Mortgage subject to applicable federal and state laws and judicial
precedent with respect to bankruptcy and right of redemption;

                  (x) Conformance with Underwriting Guidelines. The Mortgage
Loan was underwritten in accordance with the Underwriting Guidelines in effect
at the time the Mortgage Loan was originated. The Mortgage Note and Mortgage are
on forms acceptable to participants in the secondary mortgage market for similar
types of Mortgage Loans;

                  (y) Occupancy of the Mortgaged Property. As of the related
Closing Date the Mortgaged Property will be lawfully occupied under applicable
law. All inspections, licenses and certificates required to be made or issued
with respect to all occupied portions of the Mortgaged Property and, with
respect to the use and occupancy of the same, including but not limited to
certificates of occupancy and fire underwriting certificates, have been made or
obtained from the appropriate authorities;

                  (z) No Additional Collateral. The related Mortgage Note is not
and has not been secured by any collateral except the lien of the corresponding
Mortgage and the security interest of any applicable security agreement or
chattel mortgage referred to in the "Valid First or Second Lien" representation
above;

                  (aa) Deeds of Trust. In the event the Mortgage constitutes a
deed of trust, a trustee, authorized and duly qualified under applicable law to
serve as such, has been properly designated and currently so serves and is named
in the Mortgage, and no fees or expenses, except as may be required by local
law, are or will become payable by the Purchaser to the trustee under the deed
of trust, except in connection with a trustee's sale after default by the
Mortgagor;

                  (bb) Acceptable Investment. The Seller has no knowledge of any
circumstances or conditions with respect to the Mortgage, the Mortgaged
Property, the Mortgagor or the Mortgagor's credit standing that can reasonably
be expected to cause private institutional investors to regard the Mortgage Loan
as an unacceptable investment, cause the Mortgage Loan to become delinquent, or
adversely affect the value or marketability of the Mortgage Loan;

                  (cc) Delivery of Mortgage Documents. The Mortgage Note, the
Mortgage, the Assignment of Mortgage and any other documents required to be
delivered by the Seller under this Agreement have been or will be delivered to

compliance with Exhibit B hereto, except for such documents the originals of
which have been delivered to the Purchaser or its designee;

                  (dd) Condominiums/Planned Unit Developments/Manufactured
Dwellings. If the Mortgaged Property is a condominium unit or a planned unit
development (other than a de minimus planned unit development) such condominium
or planned unit development project meets the related Underwriting Guidelines.
With respect to each Mortgage Loan secured by a manufactured home: (i) the
manufactured home is permanently affixed to a foundation which is suitable for
the soil conditions of the side; (ii) all foundations, both perimeter and
interior have footings that are located below the frost line; (iii) any wheels,
axles and trailer hitches are removed from the manufactured home; (iv) the
related Mortgage Loan is covered under a standard real estate title insurance
policy or attorney's title opinion or certificate that identified the
manufactured home as part of the real property an insures or indemnifies against
any loss if the manufactured home is determined not to be part of the real
property. In no event shall any Mortgage Loan be secured by a mobile home;

                  (ee) Transfer of Mortgage Loans. If the Mortgage Loan is not a
MERS Mortgage Loan, each of the Mortgage and the Assignment of Mortgage (upon
the insertion of the assignee's name) is in recordable form and is acceptable
for recording under the laws of the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property
is located;

                  (ff) Due on Sale. Each Mortgage, together with any such
documents as may be required under applicable law, contains an enforceable
provision for the acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of
the Mortgage Loan in the event that the Mortgaged Property is sold or
transferred without the prior written consent of the mortgagee thereunder, at
the option of the mortgagee;

                  (gg) No Buydown Provisions; No Graduated Payments or
Contingent Interests. The Mortgage Loan does not contain provisions pursuant to
which Monthly Payments are paid or partially paid with funds deposited in any
separate account established by the Seller, the Mortgagor or anyone on behalf of
the Mortgagor, or paid by any source other than the Mortgagor nor does it
contain any other similar provisions currently in effect which may constitute a
"buydown" provision. The Mortgage Loan is not a graduated payment mortgage loan
and the Mortgage Loan does not have a shared appreciation or other contingent
interest feature;

                  (hh) Consolidation of Future Advances. Any future advances
made to the Mortgagor prior to the related Cut-off Date have been consolidated
with the outstanding principal amount secured by the Mortgage, and the secured
principal amount, as consolidated, bears a single interest rate readjustment
feature and single repayment term. The lien of the Mortgage securing the
consolidated principal amount is expressly insured as having first lien priority
as indicated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule by a title insurance policy, an
endorsement to the policy insuring the mortgagee's consolidated interest or by
other title evidence acceptable to the Purchaser, Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. The
consolidated principal amount does not exceed the original principal amount of
the Mortgage Loan;


                  (ii) Mortgaged Property Undamaged; No Condemnation
Proceedings. There is no proceeding pending or to the Seller's knowledge
threatened for the total or partial


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

condemnation of the Mortgaged Property. The Mortgaged Property is undamaged by
waste, fire, earthquake or earth movement, windstorm, flood, tornado or other
casualty so as to affect adversely the value of the Mortgaged Property as
security for the Mortgage Loan or the use for which the premises were intended;

                  (jj) Collection Practices; Escrow Payments. The origination
and collection practices used with respect to the Mortgage Loan have been in
accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices in all respects in compliance with
all applicable laws and regulations and in all material respects proper and
prudent in the mortgage origination and servicing business. With respect to
escrow deposits and Escrow Payments, if applicable, all such payments are in the
possession of the Seller and there exist no deficiencies in connection therewith
for which customary arrangements for repayment thereof have not been made. All
Escrow Payments have been collected in full compliance with state and federal
law. An escrow of funds is not prohibited by applicable law and has been
established in an amount sufficient to pay for every item which remains unpaid
and which has been assessed but is not yet due and payable. No escrow deposits
or Escrow Payments or other charges or payments due the Seller have been
capitalized under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note. All Mortgage Interest Rate
adjustments have been made in strict compliance with state and federal law and
the terms of the related Mortgage Note. The index used for the adjustment of the
Mortgage Interest Rate on each ARM Loan is the Index. Any interest required to
be paid pursuant to state and local law has been properly paid and credited;

                  (kk) Appraisal. The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the
related Mortgage Property signed prior to the approval of the Mortgage Loan
application by a Qualified Appraiser;

                  (ll) Servicemembers' Relief Act. Unless otherwise indicated on
the related Mortgage Loan Schedule, the Mortgagor has not notified the Seller,
and the Seller has no knowledge of any relief requested or allowed to the
Mortgagor under the Servicemembers' Civil Relief Act;

                  (mm) Environmental Matters. To the best of the Seller's
knowledge, the Mortgaged Property is free from any and all toxic or hazardous
substances and there exists no violation of any local, state or federal
environmental law, rule or regulation. There is no pending action or proceeding
directly involving any Mortgaged Property of which the Seller is aware in which
compliance with any environmental law, rule or regulation is an issue; and to
the best of the Seller's knowledge, nothing further remains to be done to
satisfy in full all requirements of each such law, rule or regulation consisting
a prerequisite to use and enjoyment of said property;

                  (nn) Insurance. The Seller has caused or will cause to be
performed any and all acts required to preserve the rights and remedies of the
Purchaser in any insurance policies applicable to the Mortgage Loans including,
without limitation, any necessary notifications of insurers, assignments of
policies or interests therein, and establishments of coinsured, joint loss payee
and mortgagee rights in favor of the Purchaser; No action, inaction, or event
has occurred and no state of fact exists or has existed that has resulted or
will result in the exclusion from, denial of, or defense to coverage under any
applicable pool insurance policy, special hazard insurance policy or bankruptcy
bond, irrespective of the cause of such failure of coverage. In


                                      -29-
<PAGE>

connection with the placement of any such insurance, no commission, fee, or
other compensation has been or will be received by the Seller or any designee of
the Seller or any corporation in which the Seller or any officer, director, or
employee had a financial interest at the time of placement of such insurance;


                  (oo) Mortgagor Acknowledgment. The Mortgagor has executed a
statement to the effect that the Mortgagor has received all disclosure materials
required by applicable law with respect to the making of ARM Mortgage Loans or
the Seller has verification of delivery of such materials. The Seller shall
maintain or cause to be maintained such statement or verification in the
Mortgage File;

                  (pp) Regarding the Mortgagor. The Mortgagor is one or more
natural persons, or, to the extent such entities are acceptable mortgagors under
Fannie Mae guidelines, a qualified living trust (revocable trust) or a qualified
land trust.


                  (qq) Predatory Lending Regulations; High Cost Loans. None of
the Mortgage Loans are classified as (i) "high cost" loans under the Home

"abusive," "covered" (excluding home loans defined as "covered home loans"
pursuant to the New Jersey Home Ownership Security Act of 2002) or "predatory"
loans under any other applicable state, federal or local law. Each loan at the
time it was made complied in all material respects with applicable local, state,
and federal laws, including, but not limited to, all applicable predatory and
abusive lending laws;

"high cost loan" as defined in the Georgia Fair Lending Act, as amended;

                  (ss) REMIC Status. The Mortgage Loan is a qualified mortgage
for inclusion in a "real estate mortgage investment conduit" for federal income
tax purposes;

                  (tt) Simple Interest Mortgage Loans. None of the Mortgage
Loans are simple interest Mortgage Loans;

                  (uu) Single Premium Credit Life Insurance. None of the
proceeds of the Mortgage Loan were used to finance single-premium credit life
insurance policies;

                  (vv) Tax Service Contract The Seller has obtained a life of
loan, transferable real estate tax service contract with an Approved Tax Service
Contract Provider on each Mortgage Loan and such contract is assignable without
penalty, premium or cost to the Purchaser; upon the initial set-up, each such
tax service contract shall contain complete and accurate information with
respect to the Mortgage Loan and the Mortgaged Property;

                  (ww) Flood Certification Contract. The Seller has obtained a
life of loan, transferable flood certification contract with an Approved Flood
Policy Insurer for each


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

Mortgage Loan and such contract is assignable without penalty, premium or cost
to the Purchaser;

                  (xx) Genuineness of Signatures. Each of the documents in the
Mortgage File is genuine and contains genuine signatures. Each document that
Purchaser requires to be an original document is an original document. All
certified copies of original documents are true copies and meet the applicable
requirements and specifications of this Agreement and any other written
requirements that Purchaser has reasonably made of the Seller;

                  (yy) No Prior Rejection. No Mortgage Loan has been previously
submitted for purchase by the Seller to the Purchaser and reviewed and rejected
by the Purchaser for credit compliance or valuation reasons;

                  (zz) Qualified Mortgage Loan. Each Mortgage Loan constitutes a
qualified mortgage loan under Section 860(g)(a)(3)(A) of the Code and Treasury
Regulations Section 1.860G-2(a)(1) and (3);

                  (aaa) Convertibility. No ARM Mortgage Loan contains a
provision whereby the Mortgagor can convert the mortgage loan to a fixed rate
instrument.

                  (bbb) Recordation. Each original Mortgage was recorded and,
except for those Mortgage Loans subject to MERS, all subsequent assignments of
the original Mortgage (other than the assignment to the Purchaser) have been
recorded in the appropriate jurisdictions wherein such recordation is necessary
to perfect the lien thereof as against creditors of the Seller, or is in the
process of recordation.

                  (ccc) Origination Practices. No error, omission,
misrepresentation, negligence, fraud or similar occurrence with respect to a
Mortgage Loan has taken place on the part of any person including without
limitation the Seller, the Mortgagor, any appraiser, any builder or developer,
or any other party involved in the origination of the Mortgage Loan or, in the
application of any insurance in relation to such Mortgage Loan; no predatory or
deceptive lending practices or deceptive trade practices, including, without
limitation, the extension of credit without regard to the ability of the
borrower to repay and the extension of credit which has no apparent benefit to

fee is permitted pursuant to federal, state and local law and does not exceed
the maximum amount permitted under applicable law. With respect to each Mortgage
Loan that contains a prepayment fee, such prepayment fee is set forth on the
related Mortgage Loan Schedule;

                  (hhh) Lost Instrument Affidavits. In the event any Mortgage

         First Lien, and the original lender has notified any senior lienholder
         in writing of the existence of the Second Lien Mortgage Loan and

                               Warranties.

                  (a) It is understood and agreed that the representations and
warranties set forth in Sections 4.01 and 4.02 shall survive the sale of the
Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser and the delivery of the Mortgage Loan Documents
to the Custodian and shall inure to the benefit of the Purchaser,
notwithstanding any restrictive or qualified endorsement on any Mortgage Note or
Assignment of Mortgage or the examination or failure to examine any Mortgage
File. Upon


                                      -32-
<PAGE>

discovery by the Seller or the Purchaser of a breach of any of the foregoing
representations and warranties which materially and adversely affects the value
of the Mortgage Loans or the interest of the Purchaser therein, or which
materially and adversely affects the interests of Purchaser in the related
Mortgage Loan in the case of a representation and warranty relating to a
particular Mortgage Loan (in the case of any of the foregoing, a "Breach"), the
party discovering such Breach shall give prompt written notice to the other.

                  Upon discovery by either party of a Breach of any
representation or warranty, the party discovering such Breach shall give prompt
written notice to the other party. Within 60 days of the earlier of either
discovery by or notice to the Seller of any Breach of a representation or
warranty, the Seller shall use its best efforts promptly to cure such Breach in
all material respects and, if such Breach cannot be cured, the Seller shall, at
the Purchaser's option, repurchase such Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price.
In the event that a Breach shall involve any representation or warranty set
forth in Section 4.01, the Seller shall use its best efforts to cure such Breach
within 60 days of the earlier of notice or discovery thereof, and if such Breach
cannot be cured within 75 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice
to the Seller of such Breach, the Seller shall, at the Purchaser's option,
repurchase all affected Mortgage Loans at the Repurchase Price. Any repurchase
of a Mortgage Loan or Loans pursuant to the foregoing provisions of this Section
4.03 shall be accomplished by deposit in the Custodial Account of the amount of
the Repurchase Price for distribution to Purchaser on the next scheduled
Remittance Date, after deducting therefrom any amount received in respect of
such repurchased Mortgage Loan or Loans and being held in the Custodial Account
for future distribution.

                  If pursuant to the foregoing provisions the Seller repurchases
a Mortgage Loan that is a MERS Mortgage, the Seller shall either (i) cause MERS
to execute and deliver an assignment of the Mortgage in recordable form to
transfer the Mortgage from MERS to the Seller and shall cause such Mortgage to
be removed from registration on the MERS System in accordance with MERS' rules
and regulations or (ii) cause MERS to designate on the MERS System the Seller as
the beneficial holder of such Mortgage Loan.

                  At the time of repurchase, the Purchaser and the Seller shall
arrange for the reassignment of the Deleted Mortgage Loan to the Seller and the
delivery to the Seller of any documents held by the Custodian relating to the
Deleted Mortgage Loan. In the event of a repurchase, the Seller shall,
simultaneously with such reassignment, give written notice to the Purchaser and
any servicer of the Mortgage Loans that such repurchase has taken place. For the
month of repurchase, distributions to Purchaser shall include the Monthly
Payment due on any Deleted Mortgage Loan in the month of repurchase, and the
Seller shall thereafter be entitled to retain all amounts subsequently received
by the Seller in respect of such Deleted Mortgage Loan.

                  If the Seller is required to repurchase any Mortgage Loan
pursuant to this Section 4.03 as a result of a breach of any of the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 4.02, the Seller may, with
the Purchaser's prior consent, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
within two years from the related Closing Date, remove such defective Mortgage
Loan from the terms of this Agreement and provide a Qualified Substitute
Mortgage Loan for such defective Mortgage Loan, in lieu of repurchase.


                                      -33-
<PAGE>

                  The Seller shall amend the related Mortgage Loan Schedule to
reflect the withdrawal of the removed Mortgage Loan from this Agreement and the
substitution of such Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan therefor. Upon such
amendment, the Purchaser shall review the Mortgage File delivered to it relating
to the Qualified Substitute Mortgage Loan. The Monthly Payment on a Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan due on the Due Date in the month of substitution shall
be the property of the Seller and the Monthly Payment on the defective Mortgage
Loan for which the substitution is made, due on such Due Date shall be the
property of the Purchaser.

                  In addition to such repurchase or substitution obligation, the
Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and hold it harmless against any losses,
damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, including without limitation, reasonable
and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and
expenses resulting from any claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or
grounded upon, or resulting from, a Breach of the Seller representations and
warranties contained in this Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the
obligations of the Seller set forth in this Section 4.03 to cure or repurchase a
defective Mortgage Loan and to indemnify the Purchaser as provided in this
Section 4.03 constitute the sole remedies of the Purchaser respecting a Breach
of the foregoing representations and warranties.

                  Any cause of action against the Seller relating to or arising
out of the Breach of any representations and warranties made in Sections 4.01
and 4.02 shall accrue as to any Mortgage Loan upon (i) discovery of such Breach
by the Purchaser or notice thereof by the Seller to the Purchaser, (ii) failure
by the Seller to cure such Breach within the applicable cure period or
repurchase such Mortgage Loan as specified above, and (iii) demand upon the
Seller by the Purchaser for compliance with this Agreement.

                  With respect to any Mortgage Loan, if the related Mortgagor is
thirty (30) or more days delinquent with respect to the Mortgage Loan's first
Monthly Payment due to the Purchaser, the Seller shall, upon receipt of notice
from the Purchaser, promptly repurchase such Mortgage Loan from the Purchaser in
accordance with this Section; provided, that no right to cure set forth herein
shall apply.

                  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, in the event
that a Mortgage Loan is prepaid in full within thirty days of the related
Closing Date, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser the purchase price premium
(if any) paid by the Purchaser for the Mortgage Loan, reduced by any prepayment
penalty fees received from the borrower and remitted to the Purchaser; provided,
however, in the event that the Purchaser or a subsequent servicer forgives the
related prepayment penalty and still satisfies the Mortgage Loan, the Seller
shall pay to the Purchaser the purchase price premium paid by the Purchaser for
the Mortgage Loan, reduced by the forgiven prepayment penalty amount.

to which no default is imminent, no repurchase pursuant to Section 4.03 or 8.03
shall be made, unless, if so required by the applicable REMIC Documents the
Seller has obtained an Opinion of Counsel to the effect that such repurchase
will not (i) result in the imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" of
such REMIC (as defined in Section 860F of the Code) or otherwise subject the
REMIC to tax, or (ii) cause the REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC at any time.

                  (B) Tax Returns.

         transactions contemplated thereby; (d) cause to be provided to the
         owner thereunder such data necessary for their original issue discount
         computations and market discount computations with respect to the

         owner thereunder may reasonably request from time to time; (e) conduct
         the affairs of the REMIC so as to maintain the status thereof as a
         REMIC under the REMIC Provisions; (f) not knowingly or intentionally

         of computing and furnishing such information may be charged to the
         person liable for such tax; and (j) in a timely manner cause to be paid
         the amount of any and all federal, state and local taxes

         the Code and (iii) any tax on "net income from foreclosure property" as
         defined in Section 860G(c) of the Code.

                  (2) Within 30 days after the closing date of any REMIC, if so
         required by the applicable REMIC Documents, the Seller shall cooperate
         and provide any and all information necessary or helpful to enable the
         trustee or other responsible party to prepare and file (or cause to be
         prepared and filed) with the Internal Revenue Service Form 8811,
         "Information Return for Real Estate Mortgage Investment Conduits
         (REMIC) and Issuers of Collateralized Debt Obligations" for the REMIC.
         The trustee or other responsible party shall sign such returns and is
         hereby indemnified and held harmless by the Seller with respect to any
         tax or liability arising from the trustee's or other responsible
         party's signing such information returns to the extent that such tax or
         liability results from information provided by or on behalf of the
         Seller or information that should have been provided by or on behalf of
         the Seller pursuant to the terms hereof and in accordance with Accepted
         Servicing Practices, and is not the result of any miscalculation,
         misinterpretation, error or omission on the part of such trustee or
         responsible party.

                  (C) General Servicing Obligations.

                  The Seller shall use its best efforts to sell any REO Property
within three (3) years after its acquisition by the REMIC unless (i) the Seller
applies for an extension of such three-year period from the Internal Revenue
Service pursuant to the REMIC Provisions and Code Section 856(e)(3), in which
event such REO Property shall be sold within the applicable extension period, or
(ii) the Seller obtains for the Purchaser an Opinion of Counsel, addressed to
the Purchaser and the Seller, to the effect that the holding by the REMIC of
such REO Property subsequent to such three year period will not result in the
imposition of taxes on "prohibited transactions" as defined in Section 860F of
the Code or cause the REMIC to fail to qualify as a REMIC under the REMIC
Provisions or comparable provisions of relevant state laws at any time. The
Seller shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO Property for the
Purchaser solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale in a manner
which does not cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as "foreclosure
property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) or result in the receipt by
the REMIC of any "income from non-permitted assets" within the meaning of
Section 860F(a)(2)(B) of the Code or any "net income from foreclosure property"
which is subject to taxation under Section 860G(a)(1) of the Code. Pursuant to
its efforts to sell such REO Property, the Seller shall either itself or through
an agent selected by the Seller protect and conserve such REO Property in the
same manner and to such extent as is customary in the locality where such REO
Property is located and may, incident to its conservation and protection of the
interests of the Purchaser, rent the same, or any part thereof, as the Seller
deems to be in the best interest of the Seller and the Purchaser for the period
prior to the sale of such REO Property; provided, however, that any rent
received or accrued with respect to such REO Property qualifies as "rents from
real property" as defined in Section 856(d) of the Code.

                  (D) Additional Covenants.

                  In addition to the provision set forth in this Section 4.04,
if a REMIC election is made with respect to the arrangement under which any of
the Mortgage Loans or REO Properties are held, then, with respect to such
Mortgage Loans and/or REO Properties, and notwithstanding the terms of this
Agreement, the Seller shall not take any action, cause the REMIC to take any
action or fail to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the
REMIC Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger
the status of the REMIC as a REMIC or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax
upon the REMIC (including but not limited to the tax on "prohibited
transactions" as defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on
"contributions" to a REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code) unless the
Seller has received an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking
to take such action) to the effect that the contemplated action will not
endanger such REMIC status or result in the imposition of any such tax.

                  If a REMIC election is made with respect to the arrangement
under which any Mortgage Loans or REO Properties are held, the Purchaser and
Seller shall amend this Agreement such that it will meet all applicable Rating
Agency requirements.

                                   ARTICLE V

                 ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS

                  Section 5.01 Seller to Act as Servicer.

                  The Seller, as an independent contractor, shall service and
administer the Mortgage Loans from the related closing date and shall have full
power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection with
such servicing and administration which the Seller may deem necessary or
desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted
Servicing Practices. The Seller shall service and administer the Mortgage Loans
through the exercise of the same care that it customarily employs for its own
account. The Seller may perform its servicing responsibilities through agents or
independent contractors, but shall not thereby be released from any of its
responsibilities hereunder. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the
Seller may delegate any of its duties under this Agreement to one or more
affiliates without regard to any of the requirements of this Section; provided,
however, that the Seller shall not be released from any of its responsibilities
hereunder by virtue of such delegation.

                  Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, prior to a
Mortgage Loan becoming subject to a Reconstitution Agreement, the Seller may
waive, modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the
postponement of strict compliance with any such term or in any manner grant
indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the Seller's reasonable and prudent
determination such waiver, modification, postponement or indulgence is not
materially adverse to the Purchaser, provided, however, that the Seller shall
not make any future advances with respect to a Mortgage Loan and (unless the
Mortgagor is in default with respect to the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in
the judgment of the Seller, imminent and the Seller has obtained the prior
written consent of the Purchaser) the Seller shall not permit any modification
with respect


                                      -37-
<PAGE>

to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or
forgive the payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the outstanding
principal balance (except for actual payments of principal) or change the final
maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. The Seller agrees and acknowledges,
provided, that, in the event of any such modification which permits the deferral
of interest or principal payments on any Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall, on the
Business Day immediately preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any
such principal or interest payment has been deferred, deposit in the Custodial
Account from its own funds, the difference between (a) such month's principal
and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid
principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by the
Mortgagor. To the extent the Seller has received the Purchaser's prior written
consent for any such modification permitting the deferral of interest or
principal payments, the Seller shall be entitled to reimbursement for advances
required under this paragraph, pursuant to Section 5.05. Without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, the Seller shall continue, and is hereby authorized
and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of itself and the Purchaser, all
instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of partial or full release,
discharge and all other comparable instruments, with respect to the Mortgage
Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties, and, with the prior consent
of the Purchaser, which shall be deemed given if the Purchaser does not
affirmatively grant or deny consent within five (5) days of request therefor,
institute foreclosure proceedings or obtain a deed-in-lieu of foreclosure so as
to convert the ownership of such properties, and to hold or cause to be held
title to such properties, on behalf of the Purchaser pursuant to the provisions
of Section 5.17. If reasonably required by the Seller, the Purchaser shall
promptly furnish the Seller with any powers of attorney and other documents
necessary or appropriate to enable the Seller to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties under this Agreement.

                  The Seller is authorized and empowered by the Purchaser, in
its own name, when the Seller believes it appropriate in its reasonable judgment
to register any Mortgage Loan on the MERS System, or cause the removal from the
registration of any Mortgage Loan on the MERS System, to execute and deliver, on
behalf of the Purchaser, any and all instruments of assignment and other
comparable instruments with respect to such assignment or re-recording of a
Mortgage in the name of MERS, solely as nominee for the Purchaser and its
successors and assigns.

                  In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Seller
shall employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same
care that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering
mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted
Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the requirements
of this Agreement, and the Purchaser's reliance on the Seller. If the Seller
determines that any Servicing Advance or Monthly Advance made, or to be made,
with respect to such Mortgage Loan is not, or, if made would not be, recoverable
from related late collections thereon or proceeds thereof, the Seller shall
deliver to the Purchaser an Officer's Certificate indicating the reasons for
such determination. The Purchaser and Seller shall cooperate to minimize the
number of Officer's Certificates required to be delivered pursuant to the
preceding sentence.

                  If the Seller is notified that any superior lienholder has
accelerated or intends to accelerate the obligations secured by the superior
lien, or has declared or intends to declare a default under the Mortgage or the
Mortgage Note secured thereby, or has filed or intends to file


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

an election to have the Mortgaged Property sold or foreclosed, the Seller shall
immediately notify the Purchaser of any such notice from or action by the
superior lienholder and of the amount necessary to cure the default or reinstate
the superior lien. The Seller shall further make recommendations to the
Purchaser (including note sales to third parties) so as to best protect the
Purchaser's interest in and the security of the related Mortgage Loan. If the
Purchaser directs the Seller to cure a default under or otherwise reinstate a
superior lien, the Purchaser will advance to the Seller necessary funds to cure
the default or reinstate the superior lien. The Seller shall thereafter take
immediate action to recover from the Mortgagor the amount so advanced. The
Purchaser shall notify the Seller in writing of any and all action which it
requests the Seller to take.

                  In the event that the Seller reasonably deems that the factual
circumstances require prompt action, the Seller may (but shall not be obligated
to) without notice to the Purchaser, advance the necessary funds to cure the
default or reinstate the superior lien so as to best protect the Purchaser's
interest. The Seller shall thereafter notify the Purchaser of the action taken,
including the amount of the advance. The Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller
for all advances made pursuant to this paragraph. The Seller shall thereafter
take immediate action to recover from the Mortgagor the amount so advanced.

                  Section 5.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans.

                  In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan and
not postponed pursuant to Section 5.01 is not paid when the same becomes due and
payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails to perform any other covenant or
obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period, the Seller shall take such action as (1) the Seller
would take under similar circumstances with respect to a similar mortgage loan
held for its own account for investment, (2) shall be consistent with Accepted
Servicing Practices, and (3) the Seller shall determine prudently to be in the
best interest of Purchaser, provided, however, that the Seller shall deliver a
notice to the applicable Mortgagor of the Seller's intent to foreclose (such
notice, a "Notice of Intent") by the time period set forth in the Fannie Mae
Guides or at such other time as permitted under applicable state law. In the
event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not postponed pursuant to
Section 5.01 and remains delinquent for a period of no later than ninety (90)
days or any other default continues for a period of ninety (90) days beyond the
expiration of any grace or cure period, the Seller shall commence foreclosure
proceedings and provide notice thereof to the Purchaser in writing; provided
that, the Seller may postpone such foreclosure proceedings until such payment is
delinquent or any other default continues for a period of no later than one
hundred twenty (120) days beyond the expiration of any grace or cure period, if
the Seller in its good faith business judgment reasonably believes that the
postponement of such foreclosure proceedings is warranted and the Purchaser
shall not suffer a material loss in connection with such postponement. In such
connection, the Seller shall from its own funds make all necessary and proper
Servicing Advances, provided, however, that the Seller shall not be required to
expend its own funds in connection with any foreclosure or towards the
restoration, preservation or inspection of any Mortgaged Property, unless in its
good faith business judgment, the Seller reasonably believes (a) that such
preservation, restoration and/or foreclosure will increase the proceeds of
liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Purchaser after reimbursement to itself for
such expenses and (b) that such expenses will be recoverable by it either
through Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall have priority for
purposes of


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 5.05) or through
Insurance or Condemnation Proceeds (respecting which it shall have similar
priority). If the Seller determines not to make a Servicing Advance pursuant to
the preceding sentence, then the Seller shall deliver an Officer's Certificate
setting forth the reasons for such determination.

                  Section 5.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.

                  Continuously from the related Closing Date until the date each
Mortgage Loan ceases to be subject to this Agreement, the Seller shall proceed
diligently to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans when the
same shall become due and payable and shall take special care in ascertaining
and estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will become due and
payable with respect to the Mortgage Loans and each related Mortgaged Property,
to the end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to
pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

                  Section 5.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial
                               Account.

                  The Seller shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its own
funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial
Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled "Wachovia
Mortgage Corporation in trust for Lehman Brothers Bank, purchaser of
Conventional Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, Group No.
2004-FLOW". The Custodial Account shall be established with a Qualified
Depository. Any funds deposited in the Custodial Account shall at all times be
fully insured to the full extent permitted under applicable law. Funds deposited
in the Custodial Account may be drawn on by the Seller in accordance with
Section 5.05. The creation of any Custodial Account shall be evidenced by a
certification in the form of Exhibit D-1 hereto, in the case of an account
established with the Seller, or by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit D-2
hereto, in the case of an account held by a depository other than the Seller. A
copy of such certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the
Purchaser and, upon request, to any subsequent purchaser of the Mortgage Loans.

                  The Seller shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily
basis, within two (2) Business Days of receipt thereof, and retain therein, the
following collections received by the Seller and payments made by the Seller
after the Cut-off Date:

                  (i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage
         Loans, including all Principal Prepayments;

                  (ii) any Prepayment Charge received in connection with the
         Mortgage Loans;

                  (iii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage
         Loans adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

                  (iv) all Liquidation Proceeds;

                  (v) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to be
         deposited pursuant to Section 5.11 (other than proceeds to be held in
         the Escrow Account and


                                      -40-

         applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or
         released to the Mortgagor in accordance with Section 5.15), Section
         5.12 and Section 5.15;

                  (vi) all Condemnation Proceeds which are not applied to the
         restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the
         Mortgagor in accordance with Section 5.15;

                  (vii) any amount required to be deposited in the Custodial
         Account pursuant to Section 5.01, 5.10, 5.11, 5.20, 6.01, 6.03, 6.04,
         7.01 or 7.02;

                  (viii) any amounts payable in connection with the repurchase
         of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 4.03; (ix) any amounts
         required to be deposited by the Seller pursuant to Section 5.12 in
         connection with the deductible clause in any blanket hazard insurance
         policy;

                  (x) any amounts required to be deposited by the Seller
         pursuant to Section 5.16 in connection with any unpaid claims that are
         a result of a breach by the Seller or any subservicer of the
         obligations hereunder or under the terms of a PMI Policy;

                  (xi) any amounts received by the Seller under a PMI or LPMI
         Policy;

                  (xii) with respect to each Principal Prepayment in full or in
         part, the Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, if any, for the month
         of distribution. Such deposit shall be made from the Seller's own
         funds, without reimbursement therefor up to a maximum amount per month
         of the Servicing Fee actually received for such month for the Mortgage
         Loans; and

                  (xiii) any amounts received with respect to or related to any
         REO Property and all REO Disposition Proceeds pursuant to Section 5.17.

                  The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial
Account shall be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of Ancillary
Income need not be deposited by the Seller into the Custodial Account. Any
interest paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account by the depository
institution shall accrue to the benefit of the Seller and the Seller shall be
entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 5.05.

                  Section 5.05 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account.

                  The Seller shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the
Custodial Account for the following purposes:

                  (i) to make payments to the Purchaser in the amounts and in
         the manner provided for in Section 6.01;

                  (ii) to reimburse itself for Monthly Advances, the Seller's
         right to reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause (ii) being limited
         to amounts received on the related

                                      -41-
<PAGE>

         Mortgage Loan which represent late collections (net of the related
         Servicing Fee) of principal and/or interest respecting which any such
         advance was made, it being understood that, in the case of such
         reimbursement, the Seller's right thereto shall be prior to the rights
         of the Purchaser, except that, where the Seller is required to
         repurchase a Mortgage Loan, pursuant to Section 3.03, the Seller's
         right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to the payment to the
         Purchaser of the Repurchase Price pursuant to such Section and all
         other amounts required to be paid to the Purchaser with respect to such
         Mortgage Loan;

                  (iii) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Servicing Advances,
         the Seller's right to reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause (iii)
         with respect to any Mortgage Loan being limited to related Liquidation
         Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, REO Disposition
         Proceeds and other amounts received in respect of the related REO
         Property, and such other amounts as may be collected by the Seller from
         the Mortgagor or otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan, it being
         understood that, in the case of any such reimbursement, the Seller's
         right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the Purchaser;

                  (iv) to pay itself interest on funds deposited in the
         Custodial Account;

                  (v) with respect to each LPMI Loan, and amount equal to the
         related LPMI Fee to make payment of premiums due under the LPMI Policy;

                  (vi) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon the
         termination of this Agreement; (vii) to withdraw funds deposited in
         error; (viii) to pay to itself with respect to each Mortgage Loan that
         has been repurchased pursuant to Section 4.03 all amounts received
         thereon and not distributed as of the date on which the related
         Repurchase Price is determined;

                  (ix) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Monthly Advances and
         Servicing Advances deemed to be non-recoverable, to the extent not

on each Remittance Date, the Seller shall withdraw all funds from the Custodial
Account except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 6.01, the Seller is
not obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Seller may use such
withdrawn funds only for the purposes described in this Section 5.05.

                  Section 5.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account.

                  The Seller shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and
apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and
maintain one or more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand
accounts, titled, "Wachovia Mortgage Corporation, in trust Lehman Brothers Bank,
FSB, purchaser of Conventional Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage
Loans, Group No. 2004-FLOW, and various Mortgagors". The Escrow Accounts shall
be established with a Qualified Depository, in a manner which shall provide
maximum available insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow Account
may be drawn on by the Seller in accordance with Section 5.07. The creation of
any Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit
E-1 hereto, in the case of an account established with the Seller, or by a
letter agreement in the form of Exhibit E-2 hereto, in the case of an account
held by a depository other than the Seller. A copy of such certification shall
be furnished to the Purchaser and, upon request, to any subsequent purchaser.

                  The Seller shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts on
a daily basis, not later than two (2) Business Days after receipt thereof, and
retain therein:

                  (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage
         Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as
         required under the terms of this Agreement; and

                  (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or
         Condemnation Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or
         repair of any Mortgaged Property.

                  The Seller shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account only
to effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth in
Section 5.07. The Seller shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on funds
deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than
interest on escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the
extent required by law, the Seller shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the
Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or
that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

                  Section 5.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

                  Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by
the Seller only:

                  (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes,
         assessments, water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium
         charges, fire and hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting
         Escrow Payments for the related Mortgage;

                  (ii) to reimburse the Seller for any Servicing Advances made
         by the Seller pursuant to Section 5.09 with respect to a related
         Mortgage Loan, but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage
         Loan which represent late collections of Escrow Payments thereunder;

<PAGE>

                  (iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in
         excess of the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage
         Loan;

                  (iv) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application to
         reduce the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with
         the terms of the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

                  (v) for application to restoration, inspection or repair of
         the Mortgaged Property in accordance with the procedures outlined in
         Section 5.15;

                  (vi) to pay to the Seller, or any Mortgagor to the extent
         required by law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow
         Account;

                  (vii) to pay to the Mortgagors or other parties Insurance
         Proceeds in accordance with Section 5.06;

                  (viii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the
         termination of this Agreement; and

                  (ix) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

                  The Seller will be responsible for the administration of the
Escrow Accounts and will be obligated to make Servicing Advances to the Escrow
Account in respect of its obligations under this Section 5.07, reimbursable from
the Escrow Accounts or Custodial Account to the extent not collected from the
related Mortgagor, anything to the contrary notwithstanding, when and as
necessary to avoid the lapse of insurance coverage on the Mortgaged Property, or
which the Seller knows, or in the exercise of the required standard of care of
the Seller hereunder should know, is necessary to avoid the loss of the
Mortgaged Property due to a tax sale or the foreclosure as a result of a tax
lien. If any such payment has not been made and the Seller receives notice of a
tax lien with respect to the Mortgage being imposed, the Seller will, within ten
(10) days of such notice, advance or cause to be advanced funds necessary to
discharge such lien on the Mortgaged Property.

                  Section 5.08 Completion and Recordation of Assignment of
Mortgage.

                  To the extent permitted by applicable law, each of the
Assignments of Mortgage to be prepared by the Seller will be subject to
recordation in all appropriate public offices for real property records in all
the counties or other comparable jurisdictions in which any or all of the
Mortgaged Properties are situated, and in any other appropriate public recording
office or elsewhere.

                  Section 5.09 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

                  (a) With respect to each Mortgage Loan which provides for
Escrow Payments, the Seller shall maintain accurate records reflecting the
status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, sewer rents, and other
charges which are or may become a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the
status of fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to
time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination
date, employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account
which shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Seller in amounts
sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. The
Seller assumes full responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills and
shall effect timely payment of all such charges irrespective of each Mortgagor's
faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the Escrow
Payments, and the Seller shall make advances from its own funds to effect such
payments.

                  (b) To the extent that a Mortgage Loan does not provide for
Escrow Payments, the Seller shall make advances from its own funds to effect
payment of all Property Charges upon receipt of notice of any failure to pay on
the part of the Mortgagor, or at such other time as the Seller determines to be
in the best interest of the Purchaser, provided, that in any event the Seller
shall pay such charges on or before the earlier of (a) any date by which payment
is necessary to preserve the lien status of the Mortgage or (b) the date which
is ninety days after the date on which such charges first became due. The Seller
shall pay any late fee or penalty which is payable due to any delay in payment
of any Property Charge after the earlier to occur of (a) the date on which the
Seller receives notice of the failure of the Mortgagor to pay such Property
Charge or (b) the date which is ninety days after the date on which such charges
first became due.

                  Section 5.10 Protection of Accounts.

                  The Seller may transfer the Custodial Account or the Escrow
Account to a different Qualified Depository from time to time. Such transfer
shall be made only upon providing notice to the Purchaser.

                  The Seller shall bear any expenses, losses or damages
sustained by the Purchaser because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow
Account are not demand deposit accounts.

                  Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow
Account may at the option of the Seller be invested in Eligible Investments;
provided that in the event that amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or
the Escrow Account exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the "Insured
Amount") the Seller shall be obligated to invest the excess amount over the
Insured Amount in Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such excess
amount becomes present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account. Any such
Eligible Investment shall mature no later than the Determination Date next
following the date of such Eligible Investment, provided, however, that if such
Eligible Investment is an obligation of a Qualified Depository (other than the
Seller) that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such
Eligible Investment may mature on such Remittance Date. Any such Eligible
Investment shall be made in the name of the Seller in trust for the benefit of
the Purchaser. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Seller and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Seller. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Seller out of its own
funds immediately as realized.

                  Section 5.11 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

                  The Seller shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan
hazard insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured
by a generally acceptable insurer acceptable under Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac
guidelines against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other
hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property is located, in
an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (a) 100% of the maximum
insurable value of the improvements securing such Mortgage Loan and (b) the
greater of (i) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (ii)
an amount such that the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the
Mortgagor or the loss payee from becoming a co-insurer.

                  If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related
Mortgaged Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by
the Flood Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such
flood insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with an insurance carrier acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac,
in an amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum amount
required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any damage or loss on a
replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the mortgage if replacement
cost coverage is not available for the type of building insured) and (ii) the
maximum amount of insurance which is available under the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the term of the
Mortgage Loan, the Seller determines in accordance with applicable law and
pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged Property is located in a
special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is covered in
an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973, as amended, the Seller shall notify the related Mortgagor that the
Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if said Mortgagor fails
to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within forty-five (45) days
after such notification, the Seller shall immediately force place the required
flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

                  If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project,
the Seller shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association,
including hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained
in accordance with then current Fannie Mae requirements, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Seller promptly of any change in
the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have a
material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.

                  The Seller shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged
Property earthquake or such other or additional insurance as may be required
pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in
force and as shall require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the
requirements of any private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to
conform with Accepted Servicing Practices.

                  In the event that any Purchaser or the Seller shall determine
that the Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards
and risks not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the
Mortgagor pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, the Seller shall, in its
discretion, communicate with the Mortgagor with respect to the need for such

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

insurance and bring to the Mortgagor's attention the desirability of protection
of the Mortgaged Property.

                  All policies required hereunder shall name the Seller as loss
payee and shall be endorsed with standard or union mortgagee clauses, without
contribution, which shall provide for at least thirty (30) days' prior written
notice of any cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage.

                  The Seller shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of
choice in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however,
that the Seller shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance
companies unless such companies are acceptable to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac and
are licensed to do business in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property
is located. The Seller shall determine that such policies provide sufficient
risk coverage and amounts, that they insure the property owner, and that they
properly describe the property address. The Seller shall furnish to the
Mortgagor a formal notice of expiration of any such insurance in sufficient time
for the Mortgagor to arrange for renewal coverage by the expiration date.

                  Pursuant to Section 5.04, any amounts collected by the Seller
under any such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow
Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged
Property, or property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be
released to the Mortgagor, in accordance with the Seller's normal servicing
procedures as specified in Section 5.15) shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 5.05.

                  Notwithstanding anything set forth in the preceding paragraph,
the Seller agrees to indemnify the Purchaser for any claims, losses, damages,
penalties, fines, forfeitures, legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any
other costs, fees and expenses that the Purchaser may sustain in any way related
to the failure of the Mortgage (or the Seller) to maintain hazard insurance or
flood insurance with respect to the related Mortgaged Property which complies
with the requirements of this section.

                  Section 5.12 Maintenance of Mortgage Insurance.

                  In the event that the Seller shall obtain and maintain a
blanket policy insuring against losses arising from fire and hazards covered
under extended coverage on all of the Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such
policy provides coverage in an amount equal to the amount required pursuant to
Section 5.11 and otherwise complies with all other requirements of Section 5.11,
it shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth
in Section 5.11. Any amounts collected by the Seller under any such policy
relating to a Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial Account or
Escrow Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 5.05 or 5.17. Such
policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in the event that there
shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged Property a policy
complying with Section 5.11, and there shall have been a loss which would have
been covered by such policy, the Seller shall deposit in the Custodial Account
at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable under the blanket
policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to deposited from the
Seller's funds, without reimbursement therefor. Upon the


                                      -47-
<PAGE>


reasonable request of any Purchaser, the Seller shall cause to be delivered to
such Purchaser a certified true copy of such policy and a statement from the
insurer thereunder that such policy shall in no event be terminated or
materially modified without thirty (30) days' prior written notice to such
Purchaser.

                  Section 5.13 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and
                               Omissions Insurance.

                  The Seller shall maintain with responsible companies, at its
own expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance
Policy, with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting
in any capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or
papers relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Seller Employees"). Any such Fidelity
Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the
Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Seller against
losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Seller Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the Seller against
losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No
provision of this Section 5.13 requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Seller from its duties
and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage under any
such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal to the corresponding
amounts required by Fannie Mae in the Fannie Mae Guides or by Freddie Mac in the
Freddie Mac Guides. Upon the reasonable request of the Purchaser, the Seller
shall cause to be delivered to such Purchaser a certified true copy of such
fidelity bond and insurance policy and a statement from the surety and the
insurer that such fidelity bond and insurance policy shall in no event be
terminated or materially modified without 30 days' prior written notice to the
Purchaser.

                  Section 5.14 Inspections.

                  The Seller shall inspect the Mortgaged Property as often as
deemed necessary by the Seller to assure itself that the value of the Mortgaged
Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage Loan is more than
sixty (60) days delinquent, the Seller immediately shall inspect the Mortgaged
Property and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices or as may be required by the primary mortgage guaranty
insurer. The Seller shall keep a written report of each such inspection.

                  Section 5.15 Restoration of Mortgaged Property.

                  The Seller need not obtain the approval of the Purchaser prior
to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the Mortgagor to
be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property if such
release is in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. At a minimum, the
Seller shall comply with the following conditions in connection with any such
release of Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds:

                  (i) the Seller shall receive satisfactory independent
         verification of completion of repairs and issuance of any required
         approvals with respect thereto;

                                      -48-
<PAGE>

                  (ii) the Seller shall take all steps necessary to preserve the
         priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
         requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;

                  (iii) the Seller shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is not in
         default; and

                  (iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Seller shall place
         the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.

                  If the Purchaser is named as an additional loss payee, the
Seller is hereby empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such a
claim in the name of the Purchaser.

                  Section 5.16 Maintenance of PMI and/or LPMI Policy; Claims.

                  (a) The Seller shall comply with all provisions of applicable
state and federal law relating to the cancellation of, or collection of premiums
with respect to, PMI Policies, including, but not limited to, the provisions of
the Home Purchasers Protection Act of 1998, and all regulations promulgated
thereunder, as amended from time to time. The Seller shall be obligated to make
premium payments with respect to PMI Policies required to be maintained by the
Mortgagor rather than the Purchaser, if the Mortgagor is required but fails to
pay any PMI Policy premium, which shall be paid from the Seller's own funds. Any
premium payments made by the Seller from its own funds pursuant to this Section
5.16(a) shall be recoverable by the Seller as a Servicing Advance, subject to
the reimbursement provisions of Section 5.05(iii) and 5.05(vii).

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan with a loan-to-value ratio
at origination in excess of 80% and subject to a PMI Policy, the Seller shall,
without any cost to the Purchaser, maintain or cause the Mortgagor to maintain
(to the extent that the Mortgage Loan requires the Mortgagor to maintain such
insurance) such PMI Policy in full force and effect, and shall pay or shall
cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a timely basis, until the LTV
of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the event that such PMI Policy shall
be terminated, the Seller shall obtain from another Qualified Insurer a
comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage equal to the remaining
coverage of such terminated PMI Policy, at substantially the same fee level. The
Seller shall not take any action which would result in noncoverage under any
applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the Seller would
have been covered thereunder. In connection with any assumption or substitution
agreements entered into or to be entered into with respect to a Mortgage Loan,
the Seller shall promptly notify the insurer under the related PMI Policy, if
any, of such assumption or substitution of liability in accordance with the
terms of such PMI Policy and shall take all actions which may be required by
such insurer as a condition to the continuation of coverage under such PMI
Policy. If such PMI Policy is terminated as a result of such assumption or
substitution of liability, the Seller shall obtain a replacement PMI Policy as
provided above.

(b) With respect to each Mortgage Loan covered by a PMI Policy, the Seller shall
take all such actions on behalf of the Purchaser as are necessary to service,
maintain and administer the related Mortgage Loan in accordance with such Policy
and to enforce the rights under such Policy. Except as expressly set forth
herein, the Seller shall have full authority on


                                      -49-
<PAGE>

behalf of the Purchaser to do anything it deems appropriate or desirable in
connection with the servicing, maintenance and administration of such Policy;
provided that the Seller shall not take any action to permit any modification or
assumption of a Mortgage Loan covered by a PMI Policy, or take any other action
with respect to such Mortgage Loan, which would result in non-coverage under
such Policy of any loss which, but for actions of the Seller, would have been
covered thereunder. If the Qualified Insurer fails to pay a claim under a PMI
Policy solely as a result of a breach by the Seller of its obligations under
this paragraph or under such Policy, the Seller shall be required to deposit in
the Custodial Account on or prior to the next succeeding Remittance Date an
amount equal to such unpaid claim from its own funds without any rights to
reimbursement from the Purchaser; provided, that once the Seller has paid the
amount of such unpaid claim and the Purchaser has otherwise fully recovered all
amounts due to the Purchaser with respect to the Mortgage Loan, the Purchaser
shall (at the Seller's cost and expense) cooperate with the Seller in permitting
the Seller to be subrogated to the rights of the Purchaser with respect to such
Mortgage Loan to the same extent that the insurer would have been subrogated
under the applicable PMI Policy had such insurer not failed to pay such claim.
The Seller shall cooperate with the Qualified Insurers and shall furnish all
reasonable evidence and information in the possession of the Seller to which the
Seller has access with respect to the related Mortgage Loan; provided, however,
notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any PMI Policy, the Seller
shall not be required to submit any reports to the related Qualified Insurer
until a reporting date that is at least fifteen (15) days after the Seller has
received sufficient loan level information from each Purchaser to appropriately
code its servicing systems in accordance with the Qualified Insurer's
requirements.

                  (c) In connection with its activities as servicer, the Seller
agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Purchaser, claims to
the Qualified Insurer under any PMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance
with the terms of such PMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action as
shall be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy respecting a
defaulted Mortgage Loan. Any amounts collected by the Seller under any PMI
Policy shall be deposited in the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 5.03(xi),
subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 5.04(iv).

                  Section 5.17 Title, Management and Disposition of REO
                               Property.

                  In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired
in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of
sale shall be taken in the name of the Purchaser's designee, or in the event the
Purchaser's designee is not authorized or permitted to hold title to real
property in the state where the REO Property is located, or would be adversely
affected under the "doing business" or tax laws of such state by so holding
title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of such Person
or Persons as shall be consistent with an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the
Seller from any attorney duly licensed to practice law in the state where the
REO Property is located. The Person or Persons holding such title other than the
Purchaser shall acknowledge in writing that such title is being held as nominee
for the Purchaser's designee.

                  The Seller shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
REO Property for the Purchaser solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition
and sale. The Seller, either itself or through an agent selected by the Seller,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO


                                      -50-
<PAGE>

Property in the same manner that it manages, conserves, protects and operates
other foreclosed property for its own account, and in the same manner that
similar property in the same locality as the REO Property is managed. The Seller
shall attempt to sell the same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period
not greater than one year, except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and
conditions as the Seller deems to be in the best interest of the Purchaser. The
Seller shall notify the Purchaser from time to time as to the status of each REO
Property.

                  The Seller shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO
Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event
within three years after title has been taken to such REO Property, not later
than the end of the third taxable year after the year of its acquisition unless
(i) (A) a REMIC election has not been made with respect to the arrangement under
which the Mortgage Loans and the REO Property are held, and (ii) the Seller
determines, and gives an appropriate notice to the Purchaser to such effect,
that a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such REO
Property. If a period longer than three years is permitted under the foregoing
sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Seller shall report
monthly to the Purchaser as to the progress being made in selling such REO
Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Purchaser, a purchase
money mortgage is taken in connection with such sale, such purchase money
mortgage shall name the Seller as mortgagee, and such purchase money mortgage
shall not be held pursuant to this Agreement, but instead a separate
participation agreement among the Seller and Purchaser shall be entered into
with respect to such purchase money mortgage.

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
Section 5.17, in connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu
of foreclosure, in the event the Seller has reasonable cause to believe that a
Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
or if the Purchaser otherwise requests, an environmental inspection or review of
such Mortgaged Property to be conducted by a qualified inspector shall be
arranged by the Seller. Upon completion of the inspection, the Seller shall
provide the Purchaser with a written report of such environmental inspection. In
the event that the environmental inspection report indicates that the Mortgaged
Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, the Seller
shall not proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure. In the event that the environmental inspection report is
inconclusive as to the whether or not the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, the Seller shall not, without the prior
approval of the Purchaser, proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in
lieu of foreclosure. In the event the Purchaser or its designee directs the
Seller not to proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure, the Seller shall be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances,
including any inspection costs incurred pursuant to this paragraph, made with
respect to the related Mortgaged Property from the Custodial Account pursuant to
Section 5.05 hereof.

                  Subject to the approval of the Purchaser or its designee as
described in this paragraph, the disposition of REO Property shall be carried
out by the Seller at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the
Seller deems to be in the best interests of the Purchaser. Prior to acceptance
by the Seller of an offer to sell any REO Property, the Seller shall notify the
Purchaser or its designee of such offer in writing which notification shall set
forth all material terms of said offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Purchaser
or its designee shall be deemed to have approved the sale of any REO Property
unless the Purchaser or its designee notifies the


                                      -51-
<PAGE>

Seller in writing, within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of the related
Notice of Sale, that it disapproves of the related sale, in which case the
Seller shall not proceed with such sale.

                  The Seller shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and
hazard insurance with extended coverage in amount which is at least equal to the
unpaid principal amount of the Mortgage Loan applicable to such REO Property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.

                  The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
Seller at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Seller deems to
be in the best interests of the Purchaser. The proceeds of sale of the REO
Property shall be promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as
practical thereafter the expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Seller
shall reimburse itself for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid
Servicing Fees and unreimbursed advances made pursuant to this Section or
Section 6.04, and on the Remittance Date immediately following the Principal
Prepayment Period in which such sale proceeds are received the net cash proceeds
of such sale remaining in the Custodial Account shall be distributed to the
Purchaser.

                  The Seller shall make advances of all funds necessary for the
proper operation, management and maintenance of the REO Property, including the
cost of maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to Section 5.11, such advances
to reimbursed from the disposition or liquidation proceeds of the REO Property.
The Seller shall make monthly distributions on each Remittance Date to the
Purchaser of the net cash flow from the REO Property (which shall equal the
revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses described in this Section
5.17 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to time to be maintained
to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

                  Section 5.18 Real Estate Owned Reports.

                  Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section
6.02, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser or its designee on or before the
tenth (10th) calendar day of each month a statement with respect to any REO
Property covering the operation of such REO Property for the previous month and
the Seller's efforts in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any
rental of such REO Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous
month. That statement shall be accompanied by such other information as the
Purchaser or its designee shall reasonably request.

                  Section 5.19 Liquidation Reports.

                  Upon the foreclosure sale of any Mortgaged Property or the
acquisition thereof by the Purchaser pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure,

                  With respect to each ARM Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall
adjust the Mortgage Interest Rate on the related Interest Rate Adjustment Date
in compliance with the requirements of applicable law and the related Mortgage
and Mortgage Note. The Seller shall execute and deliver any and all necessary
notices required under applicable law and the terms of the related Mortgage Note
and Mortgage regarding the Mortgage Interest Rate adjustments. The Seller shall
promptly, upon written request therefor, deliver to the Purchaser such
notifications and any additional applicable data regarding such adjustments and
the methods used to calculate and implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery
by the Seller or the receipt of notice from the Purchaser that the Seller has
failed to adjust a Mortgage Interest Rate in accordance with the terms of the
related Mortgage Note, the Seller shall immediately deposit in the Custodial
Account from its own funds the amount of any interest loss or deferral caused
the Purchaser thereby.

                  Section 5.21 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of
                               Mortgaged Property.

                  Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Seller shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.

                  Section 5.22 Prepayment Charges

                  The Seller or any designee of the Seller shall not waive any
Prepayment Charge with respect to any Mortgage Loan which contains a Prepayment
Charge which prepays during the term of the penalty. If the Seller or its
designee fails to collect the Prepayment Charge upon any prepayment of any
Mortgage Loan which contains a Prepayment Charge, the Seller shall pay the
Purchaser an amount equal to the Prepayment Charge which was not collected.
Notwithstanding the above, the Seller or its designee may waive a Prepayment
Charge without paying the Purchaser the amount of the Prepayment Charge if (i)
the Mortgage Loan is in default (defined as 61 days or more delinquent) and such
waiver would maximize recovery of total proceeds taking into account the value
of such Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage Loan or (ii) if the
prepayment is not a result of a refinance by the Seller or any of its affiliates
and the Mortgage Loan is foreseen to be in default and such waiver would
maximize recovery of total proceeds taking into account the value of such
Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage Loan or (iii) the collection of the
Prepayment Charge would be in violation of applicable laws.

                  Section 5.23 Credit Reporting.

                  For each Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall accurately and fully
furnish, in accordance with the Fair Credit Reporting Act and its implementing
regulations, accurate and complete information (e.g. favorable and unfavorable)
on its borrower credit files to each of the following credit repositories:
Equifax, Experian Information Solutions, Inc., and Trans Union, LLC on a monthly
basis.

                  Section 5.24 Safeguarding Customer Information

                  The Seller has implemented and will maintain security measures
designed to meet the objectives of the Interagency Guidelines Establishing
Standards for Safeguarding Customer Information published in final form on
February 1, 2001, 66 Fed. Reg. 8616, and the rules promulgated thereunder, as
amended from time to time (the "Guidelines").

                  The Seller shall promptly provide the Purchaser information
regarding such security measures upon the reasonable request of the Purchaser or
its designee (including any Master Servicer of the Mortgage Loans) which
information shall include, but not be limited to, any Statement on Auditing
Standards (SAS) No. 70 report covering the Seller's operations, and any other
audit reports, summaries of test results or equivalent measures taken by the
Seller with respect to its security measures.

                              PAYMENTS TO PURCHASER

                  Section 6.01 Remittances.

                  On each Remittance Date the Seller shall remit by wire
transfer of immediately available funds to the Purchaser (a) all amounts
deposited in the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the last day
of the related Due Period (net of charges against or withdrawals from the
Custodial Account pursuant to Section 5.05), plus (b) all amounts, if any, which
the Seller is obligated to distribute pursuant to Section 6.04, minus (c) any
amounts attributable to Principal Prepayments, Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance
Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds or REO Disposition Proceeds received after the
applicable Due Period which amounts shall be remitted on the following
Remittance Date, together with any additional interest required to be deposited
in the Custodial Account in connection with such Principal Prepayment in
accordance with Section 5.04(xii), and minus (d) any amounts attributable to
Monthly Payments collected but due on a due date or dates subsequent to the
first day of the month of the Remittance Date, which amounts shall be remitted
on the Remittance Date next succeeding the Due Period for such amounts.

                  With respect to any remittance received by the Purchaser after
the second Business Day following the Business Day on which such payment was
due, the Seller shall pay to the Purchaser interest on any such late payment at
an annual rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change,
plus two percentage points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount
permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account by the Seller on the date such late payment is made and shall cover the
period commencing with the day following such second Business Day and ending
with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such
interest shall be remitted along with the distribution payable on the next
succeeding Remittance Date. The payment by the Seller of any such interest shall
not be deemed an extension of time for payment or a waiver of any Event of
Default by the Seller.

                  Section 6.02 Statements to Purchaser.

                  Not later than the tenth (10th) calendar day of each month,
the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser or its designee a monthly remittance
advice in the format set forth in Exhibit F-1 hereto and a monthly defaulted
loan report in format set forth in Exhibit F-2 hereto (or in such other format
mutually agreed to between the Seller and the Purchaser) relating to the period
ending on the last day of the preceding calendar month.

                  The Seller shall prepare and file any and all tax returns,
information statements or other filings required to be delivered to any
governmental taxing authority or to any Purchaser pursuant to any applicable law
with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, the Seller shall provide each Purchaser with such information
concerning the Mortgage Loans as is necessary for such Purchaser to prepare its
federal income tax return as any Purchaser may reasonably request from time to
time.

                  Such obligation of the Seller shall be deemed to have been
satisfied to the extent that substantially comparable information shall be
provided by the Seller pursuant to any requirements of the Internal Revenue Code
as from time to time are in force.

                  Section 6.03 Due Dates Other Than the First of the Month

                  After Reconstitution, Mortgage Loans having Due Dates other
than the first day of a month, including Mortgage Loans permitting semi-annual
amortization of principal, shall be accounted for as described in this Section
6.03. Any payment due on a day other than the first day of each month shall be
considered due on the first day of the month following the month in which that
payment is due as if such payment were due on the first day of said month. For
example, a payment due on August 15 shall be considered to be due on September 1
of said month. With respect to a Mortgage Note permitting semi-annual
amortization of principal, the Seller shall be required to remit monthly
scheduled principal and interest based on a monthly amortization schedule. Any
payment collected on a Mortgage Loan after each Cut-off Date shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account. For Mortgage Loans with Due Dates on the first day of
a month, deposits to the Custodial Account begin with the payment due on the
first of the month following each Cut-off Date.

                  Section 6.04 Monthly Advances by the Seller

                  The Seller shall deposit in the Custodial Account on the
Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance Date, from its own funds or
from amount held for future distribution, or both, an amount equal to all
Monthly Payments (with interest adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate)
which were due on the Mortgage Loans during the applicable Due Period and which
were delinquent at the close of business on the immediately preceding
Determination Date or which were deferred pursuant to Section 6.01. Any amounts
held for future distribution and so used shall be replaced by the Seller by
deposit in the Custodial Account on or before any future Remittance Date if
funds in the Custodial Account on such Remittance Date shall be less than
remittances to the Purchaser required to be made on such Remittance Date. The
Seller's obligation to make such Monthly Advances as to any Mortgage Loan will
continue through the earlier of (i) the date of the termination or resignation,
as


                                      -55-
<PAGE>

applicable, of the Seller pursuant to Section 8.02, 10.01,11.01 or 11.02 or (ii)
the date of final disposition and liquidation of the related Mortgage Loan or
any Mortgaged Property acquired through foreclosure or a conveyance in lieu of
foreclosure, unless the Seller reasonably believes such advance to be
non-recoverable from proceeds of the related Mortgage Loan.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

                  Section 7.01 Transfers of Mortgaged Property.

                  The Seller shall use its best efforts to enforce any
"due-on-sale" provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny
assumption by the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to
be sold whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or
not the Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Seller shall, to the
extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate
the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause applicable
thereto, provided, however, that the Seller shall not exercise such rights if
prohibited by law from doing so or if the exercise of such rights would impair
or threaten to impair any recovery under the related LPMI Policy, if any.

                  If the Seller reasonably believes it is unable under
applicable law to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Seller shall enter into
(i) an assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such
property has been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under
the Mortgage Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in
the event the Seller is unable under applicable law to require that the original
Mortgagor remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Seller has the prior
consent of the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of liability
agreement with the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to which the
original Mortgagor is released from liability and the purchaser of the Mortgaged
Property is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note.
Any assumption fee collected by the Seller for entering into an assumption
agreement shall be retained by the Seller as additional servicing compensation.
In connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne
by the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

                  To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the Seller
shall inquire diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee,
and shall use the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of the proposed
transferee which are used by the Seller with respect to underwriting mortgage
loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. If the credit of the proposed
transferee does not meet such underwriting criteria, the Seller diligently
shall, to the extent permitted by the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and by
applicable law, accelerate the maturity of the Mortgage Loan.

                  Section 7.02 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage
                               Files.

                  Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt
by the Seller of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a
manner customary for such purposes, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in the
monthly remittance advice as provided in Section 6.02, and may request the
release of any Mortgage Loan Documents from the Purchaser in accordance with
this Section 7.02. The Purchaser shall no later than five (5) Business Days
after receipt of such certification and request, release or cause to be released
to the Seller, the related Mortgage Loan Documents and, upon its receipt of such
documents, the Seller shall promptly prepare and deliver to the Purchaser the
requisite satisfaction or release. No later than three (3) Business Days
following its receipt of such satisfaction or release, the Purchaser shall
deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Seller the release or satisfaction
properly executed by the owner of record of the applicable Mortgage or its duly
appointed attorney in fact. If such Mortgage Loan is a MERS Mortgage Loan, the
Seller is authorized to cause the removal from the registration on the MERS
System of such Mortgage and to execute and deliver, on behalf of the Purchaser,
any and all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation or of partial or full
release.

                  If the Seller satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or
should the Seller otherwise prejudice any rights the Purchaser may have under
the mortgage instruments, the Seller shall deposit into the Custodial Account
the then outstanding principal balance, plus all accrued interest on such
Mortgage Loan, on the day preceding the Remittance Date in the month following
the date of such release. The Seller shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors
and Omissions Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 5.13 insuring the
Seller against any loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not
satisfied in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

                  From time to time and as appropriate for the servicing or
foreclosure of the Mortgage Loans, including for the purpose of collection under
any Primary Mortgage Insurance Policy, the Purchaser shall, upon request of the
Seller and delivery to the Purchaser of a servicing receipt signed by a
Servicing Officer, release the portion of the Mortgage File held by the
Purchaser to the Seller. Such servicing receipt shall obligate the Seller to
return such Mortgage Loan Documents to the Purchaser when the need therefor by
the Seller no longer exists, unless the Mortgage Loan has been liquidated and
the Liquidation Proceeds relating to the Mortgage Loan have been deposited in
the Custodial Account or the Mortgage File has been delivered to an attorney, or
to a public trustee or other public official as required by law, for purposes of
initiating or pursuing legal action or other proceedings for the foreclosure of
the Mortgaged Property either judicially or non-judicially, and the Seller has
delivered to the Purchaser an Officer's Certificate of a Servicing Officer
stating that such Mortgage Loan was liquidated, the servicing receipt shall be
released by the Purchaser to the Seller.

                  Section 7.03 Servicing Compensation.

                  As compensation for servicing the Mortgage Loans subject to
this Agreement, the Seller shall retain the relevant Servicing Fee for each
Mortgage Loan remaining subject to this Agreement during any month or part
thereof. Such Servicing Fee shall be payable monthly. Additional servicing
compensation in the form of Ancillary Income shall be retained by the


                                      -57-
<PAGE>

Seller and is not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account. The
obligation of the Purchaser to pay the Servicing Fee is limited to, and the
Servicing Fee is payable solely from, the interest portion (including recoveries
with respect to interest from Liquidation Proceeds) of such Monthly Payment
collected by the Seller.

                  The Seller shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by
it in connection with its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be
entitled to reimbursement thereof except as specifically provided for herein.

                  Section 7.04 Annual Audit Report.

                  On or before March 15th of each calendar year, commencing
March 15, 2005, the Seller shall, at its own expense, cause a firm of
independent public accountants (who may also render other services to the
Seller), which is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants, to furnish to the Purchaser (i) year-end audited (if available)
financial statements of the Seller and (ii) a statement to the effect that such
firm has examined certain documents and records for the preceding fiscal year
(or during the period from the date of commencement of such Seller's duties
hereunder until the end of such preceding fiscal year in the case of the first
such certificate) and that, on the basis of such examination conducted
substantially in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for
Mortgage Bankers, such firm is of the opinion that the Seller's overall
servicing operations have been conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single
Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers except for such exceptions that, in the
opinion of such firm, the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage
Bankers requires it to report, in which case such exceptions shall be set forth
in such statement.

                  Section 7.05 Annual Officer's Certificate.

                  On or before March 15th of each calendar year, commencing
March 15, 2005, the Seller shall, at its own expense, deliver to the Purchaser a
Servicing Officer's certificate stating, as to each signer thereof, that (i) a
review of the activities of the Seller during such preceding fiscal year and of
performance under this Agreement has been made under such officers' supervision,
and (ii) to the best of such officers' knowledge, based on such review, the
Seller has fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement for such year, or,
if there has been a default in the fulfillment of all such obligations,
specifying each such default known to such officers and the nature and status
thereof including the steps being taken by the Seller to remedy such default.

                  Section 7.06 Right to Examine Seller Records.

                  The Purchaser shall have the right to examine and audit any
and all of the books, records, or other information of the Seller, whether held
by the Seller or by another on its behalf, with respect to or concerning this
Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, during normal business hours or at such other
times as may be reasonable under applicable circumstances, upon reasonable
advance notice.

                  The Seller shall provide to the Purchaser and any supervisory
agents or examiners representing a state or federal governmental agency having
jurisdiction over the Purchaser or the Master Servicer, including without
limitation, OCC, OTS, the FDIC and other similar entities,


                                      -58-
<PAGE>

access to any documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans in the possession of
the Seller that is required by any applicable regulations. Such access shall be
afforded without charge, upon reasonable request, during normal business hours,
at the offices of the Seller and in accordance with any applicable regulations.
In connection with providing such access, the Seller shall not be required to
incur any out-of-pocket costs or expenses unless provisions have been made for
the reimbursement therefor.

                  The Purchaser and the Seller agree that with respect to some
or all of the Mortgage Loans, from time to time and upon no less than ten (10)
Business Days' prior notice to the Seller the Purchaser shall:

                  (a) The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser in

                    period of time after receipt of any Reconstitution Agreement

the case may be, and any other participants in such Agency Transfer, Whole Loan
Transfer or Pass-Through Transfer, (i) any and all information with respect to
itself, its servicing portfolio or the Mortgage Loans and appropriate
verification of information which may be reasonably available to the Seller,
whether through letters of its auditors and counsel or otherwise, as the
Purchaser or any such other participant shall request upon reasonable demand and
(ii) such additional representations, warranties, covenants, opinions of
counsel, letters from auditors, and certificates of public officials or officers
of the Seller as may reasonably be negotiated in good faith by Seller and are
reasonably believed necessary by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee, such
third party

                                      -60-

purchaser, any Master Servicer, any Rating Agency or the Purchaser, as the case
may be, in connection with such transactions.

                  (c) If requested by Purchaser, for so long as a certificate
under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002, as amended, ("Sarbanes-Oxley") is required
to be given on behalf of the trust fund pursuant to any Reconstitution, no later
than March 15th of each year (or if not a Business Day, the immediately
preceding Business Day), or at any other time that a party provides a
certification pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley and the related Reconstitution, and
upon thirty (30) days written request of such parties, an officer of the Seller
shall execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate to the appropriate parties
for the benefit of the trust fund and the required parties and their officers,
directors and affiliates.

                  (d) To the extent required by the applicable Reconstitution
Agreements or otherwise requested by the Purchaser in connection with a
Reconstitution, the Seller shall prepare Assignments of Mortgage in form and
substance acceptable to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee or such third
party, as the case may be, for each Mortgage Loan that is part of a
Reconstitution. The Seller shall execute each Assignment of Mortgage, track such
Assignments of Mortgage to ensure they have been recorded and deliver them as
required by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee or such third party, as the
case may be, upon the Seller's receipt thereof. The Purchaser shall pay all
reasonable fees associated with the preparation, recording and tracking of such
Assignments of Mortgage.

                  The Purchaser shall reimburse the Seller for any and all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs and fees, including reasonable attorney's fees,
incurred by the Seller in response to requests for information or assistance
under this Section. All Mortgage Loans not sold or transferred pursuant to an
Agency Transfer, Pass-Through Transfer or Whole Loan Transfer and any and all
Mortgage Loans repurchased by the Purchaser pursuant to Section 8.03 below with
respect to an Agency Transfer, Pass-Through Transfer or Whole Loan Transfer
shall be subject to this Agreement and shall continue to be serviced in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and with respect thereto this
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

                  Section 8.02 Transfer of Servicing Following Reconstitution.

                  Following a Reconstitution of Mortgage Loans, the Purchaser or
its designee (which may include the Master Servicer, trustee, insurer, guarantor
or certificateholders) shall have the right, in its sole discretion, to cause
the Seller at any time under any Reconstitution Agreement to transfer the
servicing responsibilities and duties with respect to some or all of the
Mortgage Loans serviced thereunder to the Purchaser or any designee of the
Purchaser; provided, however, that the Purchaser shall provide the Seller with
thirty (30) days prior written notice and shall pay to the Seller a termination
fee identical to the "termination without cause fee" structure set forth in
Section 11.02, provided further that such transfer shall be subject to the
approval of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, as the case may be, with respect to
Agency Transfers, the trustee, Master Servicer or Rating Agencies with respect
to Pass-Through Transfers or any relevant third party purchaser with respect to
Whole Loan Transfers. No termination fee shall be paid or payable for any
Mortgage Loans with respect to which any payment is more than one hundred twenty
(120) days past due as of the date of such termination. The Seller agrees to
cooperate

                                      -61-
<PAGE>

with the Purchaser in such transfer of servicing responsibilities and shall
comply with the termination procedures set forth in Sections 10.01 and 12.01
hereof.

                  Section 8.03 Purchaser's Repurchase and Indemnification
Obligations.

                  Upon receipt by the Seller of notice from Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac or other such third party purchaser of a breach of any Purchaser
representation or warranty contained in any Reconstitution Agreement or a
request by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee or third party purchaser as the
case may be, for the repurchase of any Mortgage Loan transferred to Fannie Mae
or Freddie Mac pursuant to an Agency Transfer or to a trustee pursuant to a
Pass-Through Transfer or to a third party purchaser pursuant to a Whole Loan
Transfer, the Seller shall promptly notify the Purchaser of same and shall, at
the direction of the Purchaser, use its best efforts to cure and correct any
such breach and to satisfy the requests or concerns of Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac,
the trustee or the third party purchaser related to such deficiencies of the
related Mortgage Loans transferred to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee or
other such third party purchaser.

                  The Purchaser shall repurchase from the Seller any Mortgage
Loan transferred to Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac pursuant to an Agency Transfer or
to a trustee pursuant to a Pass-Through Transfer or to a third party purchaser
pursuant to a Whole Loan Transfer with respect to which the Seller has been
required by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the trustee to repurchase due to a
breach of a representation or warranty made by the Purchaser with respect to the
Mortgage Loans, or the servicing thereof prior to the related Closing Date to
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee or any third party purchaser in any
Reconstitution Agreement and not due to a breach of the Seller's representations
or obligations thereunder or pursuant to this Agreement. The repurchase price to
be paid by the Purchaser to the Seller shall equal that repurchase price paid by
the Seller to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, or the third party purchaser plus all
reasonable costs and expenses borne by the Seller in connection with the cure of
said breach of a representation or warranty made by the Purchaser and in
connection with the repurchase of such Mortgage Loan from Fannie Mae, Freddie
Mac, the trustee or the third party purchaser, including, but not limited to,
reasonable attorneys' fees.

                  At the time of repurchase, the Custodian and the Seller shall
arrange for the reassignment of the repurchased Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser
according to the Purchaser's instructions and the delivery to the Custodian of
any documents held by Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee or other relevant
third party purchaser with respect to the repurchased Mortgage Loan pursuant to
the related Reconstitution Agreement. In the event of a repurchase, the Seller
shall, simultaneously with such reassignment, give written notice to the
Purchaser that such repurchase has taken place, and amend the Mortgage Loan
Schedule to reflect the addition of the repurchased Mortgage Loan to this
Agreement.

                  Section 8.04 Additional Indemnification by the Seller.

                  The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and hold it harmless
against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures,
reasonable and necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other
costs, fees and expenses that the Purchaser may sustain in any way related to
the failure of the Seller to perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans

                                      -62-
<PAGE>

in compliance with the terms of this Agreement or any Reconstitution Agreement
entered into pursuant to Section 8.01. The Seller shall promptly notify the
Purchaser if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or
any Reconstitution Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, shall promptly notify Fannie
Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee or other relevant third party with respect to any
claim made by a third party with respect to any Reconstitution Agreement, assume
(with the prior written consent of the Purchaser) the defense of any such claim
and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including counsel fees, promptly
pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against
it or the Purchaser in respect of such claim and follow any written instructions
received from the Purchaser in connection with such claim. The Purchaser
promptly shall reimburse the Seller for all amounts advanced by it pursuant to
the preceding sentence except when the claim is in any way related to the
failure of the Seller to service and administer the Mortgage Loans in compliance
with the terms of this Agreement or any Reconstitution Agreement. In the event a
dispute arises between the Seller and the Purchaser with respect to any of the
rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to this Agreement, and such
dispute is adjudicated in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or any other
judicial process, then the losing party shall indemnify and reimburse the
winning party for all attorney's fees and other costs and expenses related to
the adjudication of said dispute.

                  Section 8.05 Transfer Of Servicing.

                  In the event that the Seller's duties, responsibilities and
liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the provisions
of this Agreement, the Seller shall discharge such duties and responsibilities
during the period from the date it acquires knowledge of such termination until
the effective date thereof with the same degree of diligence and prudence which
it is obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no action
whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of
its successor. The resignation or removal of the Seller pursuant to the
aforementioned sections shall not become effective until a successor shall be
appointed by the Purchaser. The Seller shall deliver promptly to the successor
Seller the funds in the Custodial Account and Escrow Account and all Servicing
Files and related documents and statements held by it hereunder and the Seller
shall account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such instruments and
do such other things as may reasonably be required to more fully and
definitively vest in the successor all such rights, powers, duties,
responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Seller.

                                   ARTICLE IX

                                   THE COMPANY

                  Section 9.01 Merger or Consolidation of the Seller.

                  The Seller shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a corporation, and shall obtain and preserve its qualification to
do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform its
duties under this Agreement.

<PAGE>

                  Any person into which the Seller may be merged or
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Seller shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to
the business of the Seller (including by means of sale or disposal of all or
substantially all of the Seller's property or assets), shall be the successor of
the Seller hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any
further act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the
contrary notwithstanding, provided, however, that the successor or surviving
Person shall be an institution (i) having a net worth of not less than
$25,000,000, (ii) which is a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac approved servicer in
good standing.

                  Section 9.02 Limitation on Liability of Seller and Others.

                  The duties and obligations of the Seller shall be determined
solely by the express provisions of this Agreement, and the Seller shall not be
liable except for the performance of such duties and obligations as are
specifically set forth in this Agreement. Neither the Seller nor any of the
directors, officers, employees or agents of the Seller shall be under any
liability to the Purchaser for any action taken or for refraining from the
taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in
judgment, provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Seller or
any such person against any Breach of warranties or representations made herein,
or failure to perform its obligations in compliance with any standard of care
set forth in this Agreement, or any liability which would otherwise be imposed
by reason of any breach of the terms and conditions of this Agreement. The
Seller and any director, officer, employee or agent of the Seller may rely in
good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly executed and
submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder. The Seller
shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend any legal
action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage Loans in
accordance with this Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it in any
expense or liability, provided, however, that the Seller may, with the consent
of the Purchaser, undertake any such action which it may deem necessary or
desirable in respect to this Agreement and the rights and duties of the parties
hereto. In such event, the Seller shall be entitled to reimbursement from the
Purchaser of the reasonable legal expenses and costs of such action.

                  Section 9.03 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by
Seller.

                  The Purchaser has entered into this Agreement with the Seller
and subsequent Purchasers will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the
independent status of the Seller, and the representations as to the adequacy of
its servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and procedures, its
integrity, reputation and financial standing, and the continuance thereof.
Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 9.03, the Seller
shall neither assign this Agreement or the servicing hereunder nor delegate its
rights or duties hereunder or any portion hereof (to other than a third party in
the case of outsourcing routine tasks such as (by way of example) taxes,
insurance, mortgage release and property inspection, in which case the Seller
shall be fully liable for such tasks as if the Seller performed them itself)
without the prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall not be
unreasonably withheld.

                  The Seller shall not resign from the obligations and duties
hereby imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Seller and the Purchaser or
upon the determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by



                                      -64-
<PAGE>

the Seller. Any such determination permitting the resignation of the Seller
shall be evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the
Purchaser which Opinion of Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to
the Purchaser. No such resignation shall become effective until a successor
shall have assumed the Seller's responsibilities and obligations hereunder in
the manner provided in Section 13.01.

                  Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section
9.03, in the event that the Seller either shall assign this Agreement or the
servicing responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any
portion thereof (to other than a third party in the case of outsourcing routine
tasks such as (by way of example) taxes, insurance, mortgage release and
property inspection, in which case the Seller shall be fully liable for such
tasks as if the Seller performed them itself) without the prior written consent
of the Purchaser, then the Purchaser shall have the right to terminate this
Agreement upon notice given as set forth in Section 10.01, without any payment
of any penalty or damages and without any liability whatsoever to the Seller or
any third party.

                  Section 9.04 Limitation on Assignment by the Seller.

                  Except as otherwise provided herein, this Agreement shall not
be assigned, pledged or hypothecated by the Seller to a third party without the
prior written consent of the Purchaser, which consent shall be granted or
withheld in the sole discretion of the Purchaser.

                                     DEFAULT

                  Section 10.01 Events of Default.

                  Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default on
the part of the Seller:

               (i) any failure by the Seller to remit to the Purchaser any
          payment required to be made under the terms of this Agreement which
          continues unremedied for a period of two Business Days after the date
          upon which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be
          remedied, shall have been given to the Seller by the Purchaser; or

               (ii) failure by the Seller duly to observe or perform in any
          material respect any other of the covenants or agreements on the part
          of the Seller set forth in this Agreement or in the Custodial
          Agreement which continues unremedied for a period of 30 days after the
          date on which written notice of such failure, requiring the same to be
          remedied, shall have been given to the Seller by the Purchaser; or

               (iii) failure by the Seller to maintain its license to do
          business or service mortgage loans in any jurisdiction where the
          Mortgage Property is located, but only to the extent such
          non-qualification materially and adversely affects the Seller's
          ability to perform its obligations hereunder; or


                                      -65-
<PAGE>

               (iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory

          receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
          including bankruptcy, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar
          proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs,
          shall have been entered against the Seller and such decree or order
          shall have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of
          sixty (60) days; or

               (v) the Seller shall consent to the appointment of a conservator
          or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
          marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of or
          relating to the Seller or of or relating to all or substantially all
          of its property; or

               (vi) the Seller shall admit in writing its inability to pay its
          debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take advantage
          of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization statute,
          make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors, voluntarily
          suspend payment of its obligations or cease its normal business
          operations for three Business Days; or

               (vii) the Seller ceases to meet the qualifications of a Fannie
          Mae or Freddie Mac servicer for more than thirty (30) days; or

               (viii) the Seller fails to maintain a minimum net worth of
          $25,000,000; or

               (ix) the Seller attempts to assign its right to servicing
          compensation hereunder or attempts without the consent of the
          Purchaser to assign this Agreement or the servicing responsibilities
          hereunder or to delegate its duties hereunder or any portion thereof
          in a manner not permitted under this Agreement;

               (x) if (a) after a Reconstitution in a Pass-Through Transfer, any
          of the Rating Agencies reduces or withdraws the rating of any of the
          certificates issued by a securitization trust that owns the Mortgage
          Loans due to a reason attributable to the Seller or (b) the Seller's
          performance in servicing mortgage loans materially and negatively
          impacts the ability of the Purchaser to effect an Agency Transfer,
          Whole Loan Transfer or Pass-Through Transfer with respect to the
          Mortgage Loans; or

               (xi) except as set forth in Section 9.01, the Seller attempts,
          without the consent of the Purchaser, to sell or otherwise dispose of
          all or substantially all of its property or assets.

                  Then, and in each and every such case, so long as an Event of
Default shall not have been remedied, in addition to whatsoever rights the
Purchaser may have at law or equity to damages, including injunctive relief and
specific performance, the Purchaser, by notice in writing to the Seller, (i) may
terminate all the rights and obligations of the Seller under this Agreement and
in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds thereof, and (ii) may terminate
any commitment the Purchaser has entered into to purchase additional Mortgage
Loans from the Seller hereunder.

<PAGE>

                  Upon receipt by the Seller of such written notice, all
authority and power of the Seller under this Agreement, whether with respect to
the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the successor
appointed pursuant to Section 13.01. Upon written request from any Purchaser,
the Seller shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity designated
by the Purchaser any and all documents and other instruments, place in such
successor's possession all Mortgage Files, and do or cause to be done all other
acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of
termination, including but not limited to the transfer and endorsement or
assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, at the Seller's sole
expense. The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Seller's responsibilities and rights hereunder,
including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for administration
by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by the Seller to
the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to
the Mortgage Loans.

                  If any of the Mortgage Loans are MERS Mortgage Loans, in
connection with the termination or resignation of the Seller hereunder, either
(i) the successor servicer shall represent and warrant that it is a member of
MERS in good standing and shall agree to comply in all material respects with
the rules and procedures of MERS in connection with the servicing of the
Mortgage Loans that are registered with MERS, or (ii) the Seller shall cooperate
with the successor servicer either (x) in causing MERS to execute and deliver an
assignment of Mortgage in recordable form to transfer the Mortgage from MERS to
the Purchaser and to execute and deliver such other notices, documents and other
instruments as may be necessary or desirable to effect a transfer of such
Mortgage Loan or servicing of such Mortgage Loan on the MERS System to the
successor servicer or (y) in causing MERS to designate on the MERS System the
successor servicer as the servicer of such Mortgage Loan.

                  Section 10.02 Waiver of Defaults.

                  By a written notice, the Purchaser may waive any default by
the Seller in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences.
Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for
every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent
expressly so waived.

                  This Agreement, and the respective obligations and
responsibilities of the Seller and the Purchaser, shall terminate upon either:
(i) the later of the final payment or other liquidation (or any advance with
respect thereto) of the last Mortgage Loan or the disposition of any REO
Property with respect to the last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all funds
due hereunder; or (ii) mutual consent of the Seller and the Purchaser in
writing.

                  Section 11.02 Termination Without Cause.

                  This Agreement and the Seller's rights hereunder with respect
to some or all of the Mortgage Loans shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a)
the distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the last
Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser (or advances by the Seller for the same), and (b)
the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon foreclosure of the last
Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all funds due hereunder, or (ii) mutual
consent of the Seller and the Purchaser in writing or (iii) at the sole option
of the Purchaser, without cause, upon 30 days written notice, subject to the
limitations set forth below. Any such notice of termination shall be in writing
and delivered to the Seller by registered mail to the address set forth at the
beginning of this Agreement. The Purchaser and the Seller shall comply with the
termination procedures set forth in Sections 10.01 and 12.01 hereof.

                  In the event the Purchaser terminates the Seller without cause
with respect to some or all of the Mortgage Loans, the Purchaser shall be
required to pay to the Seller a termination fee equal to 2.0% of the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of such termination date.

                  Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event
that (i) a Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a period of one hundred twenty
(120) days or more (a "Delinquent Mortgage Loan") or (ii) a Mortgage Loan
becomes an REO Property, the Purchaser may at its election terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property without
payment of a termination fee therefor, upon thirty (30) days' written notice to
the Seller.

                       Section 12.01 Successor to Seller.

                  Prior to termination of the Seller's responsibilities and
duties under this Agreement pursuant to Sections 8.05, 10.01, 11.01 (ii) or
pursuant to Section 11.02 after the 30 day period has expired, the Purchaser
shall, (i) succeed to and assume all of the Seller's responsibilities, rights,
duties and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor which
shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties and
liabilities of the Seller under this Agreement simultaneously with the
termination of Seller's responsibilities, duties and liabilities under this
Agreement. In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Purchaser may
make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of payments on
Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree. In the event that the
Seller's duties, responsibilities and liabilities under this Agreement should be
terminated pursuant to the aforementioned sections, the Seller shall discharge
such duties and responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires
knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof with the same
degree of diligence and prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this
Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice
the rights or financial condition of its successor. The resignation or removal
of the Seller pursuant to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective
until a successor shall


                                      -68-
<PAGE>

be appointed pursuant to this Section 12.01 and shall in no event relieve the
Seller of the representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections 4.01 and
4.02 and the remedies available to the Purchaser under Section 4.03, it being
understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections 4.01, 4.02, and 4.03

<PAGE>

                  Section 12.10 Relationship of Parties.

                  Nothing herein contained shall be deemed or construed to

                  Section 12.11 Execution; Successors and Assigns.

                  This Agreement may be executed in one or more counterparts and
by the different parties hereto on separate counterparts, each of which, when so
executed, shall be deemed to be an original; such counterparts, together, shall
constitute one and the same agreement. This Agreement shall inure to the benefit
of and be binding upon the Seller and the Purchaser and their respective
successors and assigns.

                  Section 12.12 Recordation of Assignments of Mortgage.

                  The Assignments of Mortgage are generally required to be
recorded by or on behalf of the Seller in the appropriate offices for real
property records; provided however, the Seller shall not cause to be recorded
any Assignment which relates to a Mortgage Loan in a jurisdiction where either
the rating agencies (in the case of Agency or Pass-Through Transfers) or
purchasers (in the case of Whole Loan Transfers) do not require recordation;
provided further, however, notwithstanding the foregoing, upon the occurrence of
certain events set forth in the pooling agreement (in the case of and Agency or
Pass-Through Transfer), each such assignment of Mortgage shall be recorded by
the Master Servicer or the trustee as set forth in the pooling agreement. Any
costs associated with the recording of the initial Assignments of Mortgage and
other relevant documents will be borne by the Seller, provided, however, if the
Seller fails to pay the cost of recording or with respect to additional
Assignments of Mortgage, such expense will be paid by the Master Servicer or the
trustee, as applicable, and will be reimbursable to such party (other than the
Master Servicer so long as the Master Servicer is also the Seller) by the
applicable trust prior to any distribution to certificateholders. In the event
that Purchaser sells any Mortgage Loans in a Whole Loan Transfer and the
subsequent purchaser requests recorded Assignments of Mortgage, the Seller,
shall at its expense (or at the Purchaser's expense if the Seller has already
paid for the initial recording of such Assignments of Mortgage pursuant to this
Agreement) cause to be recorded any Assignments of Mortgage.

                  Section 12.13 Assignment by Purchaser.

                  The Purchaser shall have the right, upon notice to the Seller,
to assign, in whole or in part, its interest under this Agreement with respect
to some or all of the Mortgage Loans, and designate any person to exercise any
rights of the Purchaser hereunder, by executing an Assignment and Assumption
Agreement substantially in the form of Exhibit G hereto. Upon such assignment of
rights and assumption of obligations, the assignee or designee shall accede to
the rights and obligations hereunder of the Purchaser with respect to such
Mortgage Loans and


                                      -74-
<PAGE>

the Purchaser as assignor shall be released from all obligations hereunder with
respect to such Mortgage Loans from and after the date of such assignment and
assumption, provided, however, that, in no event shall there be any more than
four (4) "Purchasers" with respect to any Mortgage Loan Package, except as may
be permitted under the related Purchase Price and Terms Agreement. All
references to the Purchaser in this Agreement shall be deemed to include its
assignee or designee.

                  Section 12.14 No Personal Solicitation.

                  From and after the related Closing Date, the Seller hereby
agrees that it will not take any action or permit or cause any action to be
taken by any of its agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on
the Seller's behalf, to personally, by telephone, mail, e-mail or the internet,
solicit the borrower or obligor under any Mortgage Loan to refinance a Mortgage
Loan, in whole or in part, without the prior written consent of the Purchaser.
It is understood and agreed that all rights and benefits relating to the
solicitation of any Mortgagors to refinance any Mortgage Loan and the attendant
rights, title and interest in and to the list of such Mortgagors and data
relating to their Mortgages (including insurance renewal dates) shall be
transferred to the Purchaser pursuant hereto on the related Closing Date and the
Seller shall not take any action to undermine these rights and benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that (i) offers to
refinance a Mortgage Loan made within thirty (30) days following receipt by the
Seller of a pay-off request from the Mortgagor (ii) promotions and solicitations
undertaken by the Seller or any affiliate of the Seller which are directed to
the general public at large, including, without limitation, mass mailing based
on commercially acquired mailing lists, newspaper, radio and television
advertisements and (iii) promotions, solicitations or responding to any
Mortgagor requests for information regarding other bank or financial products or
services, unless such promotions or solicitations are related to the refinancing
or prepayment of a Mortgage Loan, shall not constitute solicitation under this
Section 12.14. The provisions of this Section 12.14 shall survive any
termination of this Agreement.

                  Section 12.15 Confidential Information

                  The Seller shall keep confidential and shall not divulge to
any party, without the Purchaser's prior written consent, the Purchase Price
paid by the Purchaser for any Mortgage Loan or Mortgage Loan Package, except to
the extent that it is appropriate for the Seller to do so in working with legal
counsel, auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies.

                  The Seller hereby acknowledges that the Purchaser is subject
to the privacy regulations under Title V of the Gramm-Leach-Bliley Act, 15
U.S.C. ss. 6801 et seq., pursuant to which regulations the Purchaser is required
to obtain certain undertakings from the Seller with regard to the privacy, use
and protection of nonpublic personal financial information of the Mortgagors.
Therefore, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement,
the Seller agrees that (a) it shall not disclose or use any personally
identifiable information relating to a mortgagor (as defined below, "Customer
Information") except to the extent necessary to carry out its obligations under
this Agreement and for no other purpose, (b) it shall not disclose Customer
Information to any third party, including, without limitation, its third party
service providers without the prior consent of the Purchaser and an agreement in
writing from the third party to use or disclose such Customer Information only
to the extent necessary to carry


                                      -75-
<PAGE>

out the Seller's obligations under this Agreement and for no other purposes, (c)
it shall maintain, and shall require all third parties approved under subsection
(b) to maintain, effective information security measures to protect Customer
Information from unauthorized disclosure or use, and (d) it shall provide the
Purchaser with information regarding such security measures upon the reasonable
request of the Purchaser and promptly provide the Purchaser with information
regarding any failure of such security measures or any security breach related
to Customer Information. The obligations set forth in this Section shall survive
termination of the Agreement. For the purposes of this Agreement, "Customer
Information" means the nonpublic personal information (as defined in 15 U.S.C.
ss. 6809(4)) of the Purchaser's employees, clients or prospective clients,
including the Mortgagors (and/or clients or prospective clients of the
Purchaser's parent, affiliated or subsidiary companies) received by the Seller
in connection with the performance of its obligations under the Agreement,
including, but not limited to (i) an individual's name, address, e-mail address,
IP address, telephone number and/or social security number, (ii) the fact that
an individual has a relationship with the Purchaser and/or its parent,
affiliated or subsidiary companies, or (iii) an individual's account information
to the extent Nonpublic Personal Information (as defined) is, either
intentionally or unintentionally, disclosed to or obtained by the Seller during
the Agreement. The Seller covenants to keep such Nonpublic Personal Information
strictly confidential and to strictly limit its use of such information to
carrying out the services set forth herein. For the purposes of this provision,
the term "Nonpublic Personal Information" is defined as any non-public
personally identifiable financial information of an individual, including but
not limited to the Mortgagors or the Purchaser's clients or employees.

                  Section 12.16 Appointment and Designation of Master Servicer.

                  The Purchaser may, in its sole discretion from time to time,
engage a master servicer (the "Master Servicer") to assist the Purchaser in the
supervision of the performance by the Seller of its obligations and
responsibilities arising under this Agreement. In the event that the Purchaser
so appoints a Master Servicer, the Purchaser shall provide written notice
thereof to the Seller. From the date of such notice until such time as the
Seller receives written notice from the Purchaser that it has terminated or
replaced such Master Servicer, the Seller shall deliver all notices, reports and
remittances that the Seller is obligated to deliver to the Purchaser under this
Agreement directly to the Master Servicer named in such notice (or to any
successor master servicer named in any subsequent written notice received from
the Purchaser). The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Purchaser, shall
have the benefit of the covenants and agreements of the Seller under this
Agreement and the Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Purchaser, shall have
the same rights as the Purchaser to enforce the obligations of the Seller
arising under this Agreement. The Master Servicer shall be entitled to terminate
the rights and obligations of the Seller under this Agreement upon the
occurrence of an Event of Default as provided in this Agreement. Notwithstanding
anything herein to the contrary, in no event shall the Master Servicer assume
any of the obligations of the Purchaser under this Agreement; and in connection
with the performance of the Master Servicer's duties hereunder the Seller agrees
that the Master Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections,
indemnities and limitations of liability afforded to the Purchaser under this
Agreement. The Purchaser hereby appoints Aurora Loan Services Inc. as its Master
Servicer hereunder, effective with respect to Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder
in connection with a Reconstitution after the related Reconstitution Date.

                                    EXHIBIT I

                    FORM OF OPINION OF COUNSEL TO THE SELLER

                                     (date)

Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB
745 Seventh Avenue
5th Floor
New York, New York 10019

Dear Sirs:

                  You have requested [our] [my] opinion, as [Assistant] General
Counsel to Wachovia Mortgage Corporation (the "Seller"), with respect to certain
matters in connection with the sale by the Seller of the Mortgage Loans pursuant
to that certain Flow Purchase, Warranties and Servicing Agreement by and between
the Seller and Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (the "Purchaser"), Group No. 2004-FLOW
dated as of July 1, 2004 (the "Purchase Agreement") which sale is in the form of
whole loans, serviced pursuant thereto. Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings set forth in the Purchase Agreement.

                  [We] [I] have examined the following documents:

1. the
Purchase Agreement;

2. the form of Assignment of Mortgage;

3. the form of endorsement of the Mortgage Notes; and

4.                         such other documents, records and papers as we have
                           deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for this
                           opinion.

                  To the extent [we] [I] have deemed necessary and proper, [we]
[I] have relied upon the representations and warranties of the Seller contained
in the Purchase Agreement. [We] [I] have assumed the authenticity of all
documents submitted to [us] [me] as originals, the genuineness of all
signatures, the legal capacity of natural persons and the conformity to the
originals of all documents.


                                    Exh. I-1

<PAGE>



       Based upon the foregoing, it is [our] [my] opinion that:

       1.     The Seller is a corporation duly formed, validly existing and in
              good standing under the laws of the state of [_______] and is
              qualified to transact business in, and is in good standing under,
              the laws of the state of [________].

       2.     The Seller has the power to engage in the transactions
              contemplated by the Purchase Agreement and all requisite power,
              authority and legal right to execute and deliver the Purchase
              Agreement, and to perform and observe the terms and conditions of
              such Agreement.

       3.     The Purchase Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and
              delivered by the Seller and is a legal, valid and binding
              agreement enforceable in accordance with its respective terms
              against the Seller, subject to bankruptcy laws and other similar
              laws of general application affecting rights of creditors and
              subject to the application of the rules of equity, including those
              respecting the availability of specific performance, none of which
              will materially interfere with the realization of the benefits
              provided thereunder or with the Purchaser's ownership of the
              Mortgage Loans.

       4.     The Seller has been duly authorized to allow any of its officers
              to execute any and all documents by original signature in order to
              complete the transactions contemplated by the Purchase Agreement
              and by original signature in order to execute the endorsements to
              the Mortgage Notes and the Assignments of Mortgages, and the
              original signature of the officer at the Seller executing the
              endorsements to the Mortgage Notes and the Assignments of
              Mortgages represents the legal and valid signature of said officer
              of the Seller.

       5.     Either (i) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any
              court or governmental agency or body is required for the
              execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of or compliance
              by the Seller with the Purchase Agreement or the sale of the
              Mortgage Loans or the consummation of the transactions
              contemplated by the Purchase Agreement; or (ii) any required
              consent, approval, authorization or order has been obtained by the
              Seller.

       6.     Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, nor
              the fulfillment of the terms of, the Purchase Agreement conflicts
              or will conflict with or results or will result in a breach of or
              constitutes or will constitute a default under the charter or
              by-laws of the Seller, the terms of any indenture or other
              agreement or instrument to which the Seller is a party or by which
              it is bound or to which it is subject, or violates any statute or
              order, rule, regulations, writ, injunction or decree of any court,

                                    Exh. I-2


<PAGE>

              governmental authority or regulatory body to which the Seller is
              subject or by which it is bound.

       7.     There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or,
              to the best of [our] [my] knowledge, threatened against the Seller
              which, in [our] [my] judgment, either in any one instance or in
              the aggregate, may result in any material adverse change in the
              business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of
              the Seller or in any material impairment of the right or ability
              of the Seller to carry on its business substantially as now
              conducted or in any material liability on the part of the Seller
              or which would draw into question the validity of the Purchase
              Agreement, or the Mortgage Loans or of any action taken or to be
              taken in connection with the transactions contemplated thereby, or
              which would be likely to impair materially the ability of the
              Seller to perform under the terms of the Purchase Agreement.

       8.     The sale of each Mortgage Note and Mortgage as and in the manner
              contemplated by the Purchase Agreement is sufficient to fully
              transfer to the Purchaser all right, title and interest of the
              Seller thereto as noteholder and mortgagee.

       9.     The Mortgages have been duly assigned and the Mortgage Notes have
              been duly endorsed as provided in the Purchase Agreement. The
              Assignments of Mortgage are in recordable form, except for the
              insertion of the name of the assignee, and upon the name of the
              assignee being inserted, are acceptable for recording under the
              laws of the state where each related Mortgaged Property is
              located. The endorsement of the Mortgage Notes, the delivery to
              the Purchaser, or its designee, of the Assignments of Mortgage,
              and the delivery of the original endorsed Mortgage Notes to the
              Purchaser, or its designee, are sufficient to permit the Purchaser
              to avail itself of all protection available under applicable law
              against the claims of any present or future creditors of the
              Seller, and are sufficient to prevent any other sale, transfer,
              assignment, pledge or hypothecation of the Mortgages and the
              Mortgage Notes by the Seller from being enforceable.

       This opinion is given to you for your sole benefit, and no other person
or entity is entitled to rely hereon except that the purchaser or purchasers to
which you initially and directly resell the Mortgage Loans may rely on this
opinion as if it were addressed to them as of its date.



                                                          Very truly yours,
