         The Servicer, as an independent contractor, shall service and
administer the Mortgage Loans from and after the Closing Date or Servicing
Transfer Date, as applicable, and shall have full power and authority, acting

administration which the Servicer may deem necessary or desirable, consistent
with the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted Servicing Practices.

         The Seller and the Servicer additionally agree as follows:

         (a) The Servicer shall (i) record or cause to be recorded the Mortgage
or the Assignment of Mortgage, as applicable, with respect to all MERS Eligible
Mortgage Loans, in the name of MERS, or shall ascertain that such have
previously been so recorded; (ii) with the cooperation of the Trustee, take such
actions as are necessary to cause the Trustee to be clearly identified as the
owner of each MERS Mortgage Loan and each MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan on the
records of MERS for purposes of the system of recording transfers of beneficial
ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS; (iii) prepare or cause to be prepared
all Assignments of Mortgage with respect to all Non-MERS Eligible Mortgage

all Assignments of Mortgage with respect to Non-MERS Mortgage Loans in the name
of the Trustee; (v) pay the recording costs pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof;
and/or (vi) track such Mortgages and Assignments of Mortgage to ensure they have
been recorded. The Servicer shall be entitled to be paid by the Seller fees for
the preparation and recordation of the Mortgages and Assignments of Mortgage.
After the expenses of such recording costs pursuant to Section 2.02 hereof shall
have been paid by the Servicer, the Servicer shall submit to the Seller a
reasonably detailed invoice for reimbursement of recording costs and fees it
incurred hereunder.

         (b) If applicable, the Servicer shall, in accordance with the relevant
provisions of the Cranston-Gonzales National Affordable Housing Act of 1990, as
the same may be amended from time to time, and the regulations provided in
accordance with the Real Estate Settlement Procedures Act, provide notice to the
Mortgagor of each Mortgage Loan of the transfer of the servicing thereto to the
Servicer.

         (c) The Servicer shall be responsible for the preparation of and costs
associated with notifications to Mortgagors of the assumption of servicing by
the Servicer.

         Consistent with the terms of this Agreement and except as provided in
Section 3.19, the Servicer may waive any late payment charge, assumption fee or
other fee that may be collected in the ordinary course of servicing the Mortgage
Loans. The Servicer shall not make any future advances to any obligor under any
Mortgage Loan, and (unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the
Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the Servicer, reasonably

                                      -14-
<PAGE>


foreseeable) the Servicer shall not permit any modification of any material term
of any Mortgage Loan, including any modification that would change the Mortgage
Interest Rate, defer or forgive the payment of principal or interest, reduce or
increase the outstanding principal balance (except for actual payments of
principal) or change the final maturity date on such Mortgage Loan. In the event
of any such modification which permits the deferral of interest or principal
payments on any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day
immediately preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such
principal or interest payment has been deferred, make a Monthly Advance in
accordance with Section 4.03, in an amount equal to the difference between (i)
such month's principal and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance
Rate on the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the amount
paid by the Mortgagor. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such
advances to the same extent as for all other advances made pursuant to Section
4.03. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer shall
continue, and is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on
behalf of itself and the Trustee, all instruments of satisfaction or
cancellation, or of partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable
instruments, with respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the
Mortgaged Properties. Upon the request of the Servicer, the Trustee shall
execute and deliver to the Servicer any powers of attorney and other documents,
furnished to it by the Servicer and reasonably satisfactory to the Trustee,
necessary or appropriate to enable the Servicer to carry out its servicing and
administrative duties under this Agreement. Notwithstanding anything contained
herein to the contrary, the Servicer shall not, without the Trustee's written
consent: (i) initiate any action, suit or proceeding solely under the Trustee's
name without indicating the Servicer's representative capacity; or (ii) take any
action with the intent to cause, and that actually causes the Trustee to be
registered to do business in any state. Promptly after the execution of any
assumption, modification, consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, the
Servicer shall forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents evidencing
such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in this Servicing Agreement, the Servicer
shall not make or permit any modification, waiver or amendment of any term of
any Mortgage Loan that would cause any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement
to fail to qualify as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax under
Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in this Agreement, the
Servicer shall not (unless the Servicer determines, in its own discretion, that
there exists a situation of extreme hardship to the Mortgagor), waive any
premium or penalty in connection with a prepayment of principal of any Mortgage
Loan, and shall not consent to the modification of any Mortgage Note to the
extent that such modification relates to payment of a prepayment premium or
penalty.

         In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer shall
employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same care
that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering
mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted
Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the requirements
of this Agreement, the Fannie Mae Guides, and the Master Servicer's and Seller's
reliance on the Servicer.

Agreement, the Servicer shall proceed diligently to collect all payments due
under each of the Mortgage Loans when the same shall become due and payable and
shall take special care in ascertaining and estimating Escrow Payments and all
other charges that will become due and payable with respect to the Mortgage

Servicer. The Custodial Account shall be an Eligible Deposit Account established
with an Eligible Institution. Any funds deposited in the Custodial Account may
be invested in Eligible Investments subject to the provisions of Section 3.11
hereof. Funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be drawn on by the Servicer
in accordance with Section 3.04. The creation of any Custodial Account shall be
evidenced by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit B. A copy of such
certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the Master Servicer and,

         connection with the deductible clause in any blanket hazard insurance
         policy;

                  (ix) any amounts received with respect to or related to any
         REO Property or REO Disposition Proceeds;

                  (x) any Prepayment Penalty Amount; and

                  (xi) any other amount required hereunder to be deposited by
         the Servicer in the Custodial Account.

         The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial Account shall
be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the
generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of the Servicing Fee and
Ancillary Income need not be deposited by the Servicer into the Custodial
Account.

         Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account by the
depository institution shall accrue to the benefit of the Servicer and the
Servicer shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the
Custodial Account pursuant to Section 3.04. Additionally, any other benefit
derived from the Custodial Account associated with the receipt, disbursement and
accumulation of principal, interest, taxes, hazard insurance, mortgage
insurance, etc. shall accrue to the Servicer.


         Section 3.04 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the
Custodial Account for the following purposes:

                  (i) to make payments to the Master Servicer in the amounts and
         in the manner provided for in Section 4.01;

                  (ii) with respect to each LPMI Loan, in the amount of the
         related LPMI Fee, to make payments with respect to premiums for LPMI
         Policies in accordance with Section 3.07;

                  (iii) in the event the Servicer has elected not to retain the
         Servicing Fee out of any Mortgagor payments on account of interest or
         other recovery of interest with respect to a particular Mortgage Loan
         (including late collections of interest on such Mortgage Loan, or
         interest portions of Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds or
         Liquidation Proceeds) prior to the deposit of such Mortgagor payment or
         recovery in the Custodial Account, to pay to itself the related
         Servicing Fee from all such Mortgagor payments on account of interest
         or other such recovery for interest with respect to that Mortgage Loan;

                                      -17-

                  (iv) to pay itself investment earnings on funds deposited in
         the Custodial Account;

                  (v) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon the
         termination of this Agreement;

                  (vi) to transfer funds to another Eligible Institution in
         accordance with Section 3.11 hereof;

                  (vii) to invest funds in certain Eligible Investments in
         accordance with Section 3.11 hereof;

                  (viii) to reimburse itself to the extent of funds in the
         Custodial Account for Monthly Advances of the Servicer's funds made
         pursuant to Section 4.03, the Servicer's right to reimburse itself
         pursuant to this subclause (viii) with respect to any Mortgage Loan
         being limited to amounts received on or in respect of the related
         Mortgage Loan which represent late recoveries of payments of principal
         or interest with respect to which a Monthly Advance was made, it being
         understood that, in the case of any such reimbursement, the Servicer's
         right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the Trust Fund, provided,
         however, that following the final liquidation of a Mortgage Loan, the
         Servicer may reimburse itself for previously unreimbursed Monthly
         Advances in excess of Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance Proceeds with
         respect to such Mortgage Loan from any funds in the Custodial Account,
         it being understood, in the case of any such reimbursement, that the
         Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the rights of the Trust
         Fund. The Servicer may recover at any time from amounts on deposit in
         the Custodial Account the amount of any Monthly Advances that the
         Servicer deems nonrecoverable or that remain unreimbursed to the
         Servicer from related Liquidation Proceeds after the final liquidation
         of the Mortgage Loan;

                  (ix) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Servicing Advances,
         and for any unpaid Servicing Fees, the Servicer's right to reimburse
         itself pursuant to this subclause (ix) with respect to any Mortgage
         Loan being limited to related Liquidation Proceeds, Condemnation
         Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, REO Disposition Proceeds and other
         amounts received in respect of the related REO Property, and such other
         amounts as may be collected by the Servicer from the Mortgagor or
         otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that, in
         the case of any such reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall
         be prior to the rights of the Trust Fund;

                  (x) to reimburse itself for remaining unreimbursed Servicing
         Advances with respect to any defaulted Mortgage Loan as to which the
         Servicer has determined that all amounts that it expects to recover on
         behalf of the Trust Fund from or on account of such Mortgage Loan have
         been recovered;

                  (xi) to reimburse itself for expenses incurred or reimbursable
         to the Servicer pursuant to Sections 3.07, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14 and 6.03 to
         the extent not previously reimbursed under clause (ix) of this Section
         3.04; and

                  (xii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

         Section 3.05 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account.

         The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received
pursuant to a Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and apart from
any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain one or
more Escrow Accounts, in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled as
directed by the Master Servicer. Each Escrow Account shall be an Eligible
Deposit Account established with an Eligible Institution in a manner that shall
provide maximum available insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow
Account may be drawn on by the Servicer in accordance with Section 3.06. The
creation of any Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a letter agreement in the
form of Exhibit C. A copy of such certification or letter agreement shall be
furnished to the Master Servicer and, upon request, to any subsequent owner of
the Mortgage Loans.

         The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts on a daily
basis, and retain therein:

                  (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the Mortgage
         Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such items as
         required under the terms of this Agreement; and

                  (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or
         Condemnation Proceeds that are to be applied to the restoration or
         repair of any Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account only to
effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth in
Section 3.06. The Servicer shall retain any interest paid on funds deposited in
the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than interest on
escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. Additionally, any
other benefit derived from the Escrow Account associated with the receipt,
disbursement and accumulation of principal, interest, taxes, hazard insurance,
mortgage insurance, etc. shall accrue to the Servicer. To the extent required by
law, the Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the Mortgagor
notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or that
interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.


         Section 3.06 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

         Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by the
Servicer only:

                  (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes,
         assessments, water rates, sewer rents, mortgage insurance premiums,
         condominium charges, fire and hazard insurance premiums or other items
         constituting Escrow Payments for the related Mortgage;

                  (ii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in
         excess of the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage
         Loan;

                  (iii) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application to
         reduce the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with
         the terms of the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

                                      -19-
<PAGE>


                  (iv) to reimburse the Servicer for any Servicing Advance made
         by the Servicer with respect to a related Mortgage Loan, but only from
         amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent late
         collections of Escrow Payments.

                  (v) for application to restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
         Property in accordance with the Fannie Mae Guides;

                  (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or any Mortgagor to the extent
         required by law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow
         Account

                  (vii) to remove funds inadvertently placed in the Escrow
         Account by the Servicer; and

                  (viii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the
         termination of this Agreement.


         Section 3.07 Maintenance of PMI Policy and/or LPMI Policy; Claims.

         The Servicer shall comply with all provisions of applicable state and
federal law relating to the cancellation of, or collection of premiums with
respect to, PMI Policies, including, but not limited to, the provisions of the
Homeowners Protection Act of 1998, and all regulations promulgated thereunder,
as amended from time to time.

         With respect to each Mortgage Loan (other than LPMI Loans) with a loan
to value ratio at origination in excess of 80%, the Servicer shall maintain or
cause the Mortgagor to maintain (to the extent that the Mortgage Loan requires
the Mortgagor to maintain such insurance) in full force and effect a PMI Policy,
and shall pay or shall cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a
timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the
event that such PMI Policy shall be terminated, the Servicer shall obtain from
another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage
equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy, at substantially
the same fee level. The Servicer shall not take any action which would result in
noncoverage under any applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for the
actions of the Servicer would have been covered thereunder. In connection with
any assumption or substitution agreements entered into or to be entered into
with respect to a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall promptly notify the insurer
under the related PMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of
liability in accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy and shall take all
actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation
of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI Policy is terminated as a result
of such assumption or substitution of liability, the Servicer shall obtain a
replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

         The Servicer shall take all such actions as are necessary to service,
maintain and administer the LPMI Loans in accordance with the LPMI Policy and to
perform and enforce the rights of the insured under such LPMI Policy. Except as
expressly set forth herein, the Servicer shall have full authority on behalf of
the Trust Fund to do anything it reasonably deems appropriate or desirable in
connection with the servicing, maintenance and administration of the LPMI
Policy. The Servicer shall not modify or assume a Mortgage Loan covered by the
LPMI Policy or take any other action with respect to such Mortgage Loan which
would result in non-

                                      -20-
<PAGE>


coverage under the LPMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the
Servicer, would have been covered thereunder. If the LPMI Insurer fails to pay a
claim under the LPMI Policy as a result of breach by the Servicer of its
obligations hereunder or under the LPMI Policy, the Servicer shall be required
to deposit in the Custodial Account on or prior to the next succeeding
Remittance Date an amount equal to such unpaid claim from its own funds without
any right to reimbursement from the Trust Fund. The Servicer shall cooperate
with the LPMI Insurer and the Master Servicer and shall use its best efforts to
furnish all reasonable aid, evidence and information in the possession of the
Servicer to which the Servicer has access with respect to any LPMI Loan;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in any
LPMI Policy, the Servicer shall not be required to submit any reports to the
LPMI Insurer until a reporting date that is at least 15 days after the Servicer
has received sufficient loan level information from each Seller, the Master
Servicer or the LPMI Insurer to appropriately code its servicing system in
accordance with the LPMI Insurer's requirements.

         In connection with its activities as servicer, the Servicer agrees to
prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Trustee, claims to the insurer
under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the
terms of such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action
as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy
respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Any amounts collected by the Servicer
under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited in the Custodial Account,
subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 3.04.


         Section 3.08 Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance.

         The Servicer shall keep in force during the term of this Agreement a
Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy. Such Fidelity Bond and
Errors and Omissions Insurance shall be maintained with recognized insurers and
shall be in such form and amount as would permit the Servicer to be qualified as
a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac seller-servicer. The Servicer shall be deemed to
have complied with this provision if an affiliate of the Servicer has such
errors and omissions and fidelity bond coverage and, by the terms of such
insurance policy or fidelity bond, the coverage afforded thereunder extends to
the Servicer. The Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer a copy of each
such bond and insurance policy if (i) the Master Servicer so requests and (ii)
the Servicer is not an affiliate of Lehman Brothers Inc. at the time of such
request.


         Section 3.09 Notification of Adjustments.

         With respect to each Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
adjust the Mortgage Interest Rate on the related interest rate adjustment date
and shall adjust the Monthly Payment on the related mortgage payment adjustment
date, if applicable, in compliance with the requirements of applicable law and
the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note. The Servicer shall execute and deliver
any and all necessary notices required under applicable law and the terms of the
related Mortgage Note and Mortgage regarding the Mortgage Interest Rate and
Monthly Payment adjustments. The Servicer shall promptly, upon written request
therefor, deliver to the Master Servicer such notifications and any additional
applicable data regarding such adjustments and the methods used to calculate and
implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery by the Servicer or the receipt of
notice from the Master Servicer that the Servicer has failed to adjust a

                                      -21-
<PAGE>


Mortgage Interest Rate or Monthly Payment in accordance with the terms of the
related Mortgage Note, the Servicer shall immediately deposit in the Custodial
Account from its own funds the amount of any interest loss or deferral caused
thereby.


         Section 3.10 Completion and Recordation of Assignments of Mortgage.

         As soon as practicable after the Closing Date, the Servicing Transfer
Date or the date on which a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan is delivered
pursuant to Section 2.05 of the Trust Agreement, as applicable (but in no event
more than 90 days thereafter except to the extent delays are caused by the
applicable public recording office), the Servicer shall cause the endorsements
on the Mortgage Note (if applicable), and the Assignments of Mortgage (subject
to Section 3.01(a)) to be completed in the name of the Trustee (or MERS, as
applicable).


         Section 3.11 Protection of Accounts.

         The Servicer may transfer any Custodial Account or any Escrow Account
to a different Eligible Institution from time to time; provided that in the
event the Custodial Account or any Escrow Account is held in a depository
institution or trust company that ceases to be an Eligible Institution, the
Servicer shall transfer such Custodial Account or Escrow Account, as the case
may be, to an Eligible Institution. The Servicer shall give notice to the Master
Servicer of any change in the location of the Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall bear any expenses, losses or damages sustained by
the Master Servicer or the Trustee if the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow
Account are not demand deposit accounts.

         Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow Account may
at the option of the Servicer be invested in Eligible Investments. Any such
Eligible Investment shall mature no later than the Business Day immediately
preceding the related Remittance Date; provided, however, that if such Eligible
Investment is an obligation of an Eligible Institution (other than the Servicer)
that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such Eligible
Investment may mature on the related Remittance Date. Any such Eligible
Investment shall be made in the name of the Servicer in trust for the benefit of
the Trustee. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Servicer and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Servicer. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be
deposited in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Servicer out of
its own funds immediately as realized.


         Section 3.12 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

         With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall maintain
accurate records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes, assessments,
water rates, sewer rents, and other charges which are or may become a lien upon
the Mortgaged Property and the status of PMI Policy and LPMI Policy (if any)
premiums and fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to
time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and
shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination
date, employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account
which shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts
sufficient for such purposes, as allowed

                                      -22-
<PAGE>


under the terms of the Mortgage. The Servicer shall not be required to maintain
records with respect to the payment of LPMI Premiums unless the Servicer shall
be required to make payment of such premiums and such requirement shall be
indicated on the Mortgage Loan Schedule with respect to each applicable Mortgage
Loan. The Servicer assumes full responsibility for the timely payment of all
such bills, shall effect timely payment of all such charges irrespective of each
Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the
Escrow Payments, and shall make advances from its own funds to effect such
payments. With regard to any Mortgage Loans for which the Mortgagor is not
required to escrow Escrow Payments with the Servicer, the Servicer shall use
reasonable efforts consistent with Accepted Servicing Practices to determine
that any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they first became
due and shall insure that the Mortgaged Property is not lost to a tax lien as a
result of nonpayment and that such Mortgage is not left uninsured and shall make
advances from its own funds to effect any such delinquent payments to avoid the
lapse of insurance coverage on the Mortgaged Property or to avoid the imposition
of a tax lien.


         Section 3.13 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

         The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage Loan hazard
insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are insured by a
generally acceptable insurer against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage
and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged Property
is located, in an amount which is at least equal to the greater of (i) the then
outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (ii) an amount such that
the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor or the loss
payee from becoming a co-insurer.

         If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged
Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by the Flood
Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood
insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a generally acceptable insurance carrier in an amount
representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum amount required,
under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any damage or loss on a
replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the mortgage if replacement
cost coverage is not available for the type of building insured) and (ii) the
maximum amount of insurance which is available under the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the term of the
Mortgage Loan, the Servicer determines in accordance with applicable law and
pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged Property is located in a
special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is covered in
an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973, as amended, the Servicer shall notify the related Mortgagor that the
Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if said Mortgagor fails
to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within forty-five (45) days
after such notification, the Servicer shall force place the required flood
insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.


         Section 3.14 Maintenance of Mortgage Blanket Insurance.

         The Servicer shall obtain and maintain a blanket policy insuring
against losses arising from fire and hazards covered under extended coverage on
all of the Mortgage Loans. To the

                                      -23-
<PAGE>


extent such policy provides coverage in an amount equal to the amount required
pursuant to Section 3.13 and otherwise complies with all other requirements of
Section 3.13, it shall conclusively be deemed to have satisfied its obligations
as set forth in Section 3.13. Any amounts collected by the Servicer under any
such policy relating to a Mortgage Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account or Escrow Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Sections 3.04 or
3.06. Such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in the event
that there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged Property a
policy complying with Section 3.13, and there shall have been a loss which would
have been covered by such policy, the Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial
Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable under the
blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to be deposited
from the Servicer's funds, without reimbursement therefor.


         Section 3.15 Restoration of Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer need not obtain the approval of the Trustee or the Master
Servicer prior to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to
the Mortgagor to be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged
Property if such release is in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices. At
a minimum, with respect to claims greater than $10,000, the Servicer shall
comply with the following conditions in connection with any such release of
Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds:

                  (i) the Servicer shall receive satisfactory independent
         verification of completion of repairs and issuance of any required
         approvals with respect thereto;

                  (ii) the Servicer shall take all steps necessary to preserve
         the priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
         requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;
         and

                  (iii) pending repairs or restoration, the Servicer shall place
         the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.


         Section 3.16 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property.

         In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in
foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale
shall be taken in the name of the Trustee or its nominee (or MERS, as
applicable), or in the event the Trustee is not authorized or permitted to hold
title to real property in the state where the REO Property is located, or would
be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax laws of such state by so
holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the name of
such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an Opinion of Counsel
obtained by the Servicer (with a copy delivered to the Trustee) from any
attorney duly licensed to practice law in the state where the REO Property is
located. The Person or Persons holding such title other than the Trustee shall
acknowledge in writing that such title is being held as nominee for the Trustee.

         The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO
Property for the Trustee solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and
sale. The Servicer, either itself or through an agent selected by the Servicer,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner
that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

property for its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in
the same locality as the REO Property is managed. The Servicer shall attempt to
sell the same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than
one year, except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as
the Servicer deems to be in the best interest of the Trustee. If the Servicer
determines that it is in the best interest of the Trustee to not proceed with
foreclosure or accept a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer shall have the
right to do so, whereupon the related Mortgage Loan shall be deemed to be
finally liquidated and the Servicer shall have the right to release the lien of
the Mortgage on the related Mortgage Property and the Servicer shall be entitled
to reimbursement for all outstanding unreimbursed Servicing Advances and Monthly
Advances from the Custodial Account in accordance with Section 3.04(viii).

         The Servicer may permit an obligor to pay off a non-performing Mortgage
Loan at less than its unpaid principal balance or chargeoff all or a portion of
such non-performing Mortgage Loan if such discounted payoff or chargeoff is in
accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices and the Servicer believes that such
discounted payoff or chargeoff is in the best interest of the Trust Fund;
provided that in the case of any proposed discounted payoff or proposed
chargeoff, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer, by telecopy and
telephone, of the proposed discounted payoff or chargeoff. The Master Servicer
shall be deemed to have approved the discounted payoff or chargeoff of any
Mortgage Loan unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in writing,
within five (5) Business Days after its receipt of the related notice, that it
disapproves of the discounted payoff or chargeoff, in which case the Servicer
shall not proceed with such discounted payoff or chargeoff.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Section
3.16, in connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
foreclosure, in the event the Servicer has reasonable cause to believe that a
Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
or if the Trustee or the Master Servicer otherwise requests, an environmental
inspection or review of such Mortgaged Property to be conducted by a qualified
inspector shall be arranged by the Servicer. Upon completion of the inspection,
the Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a written
report of such environmental inspection. In the event that the environmental
inspection report indicates that the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by
hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, the Servicer shall not proceed with
foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In the event that
the environmental inspection report is inconclusive as to the whether or not the
Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes,
the Servicer shall not, without the prior approval of the Master Servicer,
proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In such
instance, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have approved such foreclosure
or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure unless the Master Servicer
notifies the Servicer in writing, within two (2) Business Days after its receipt
of written notice of the proposed foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure
from the Servicer, that it disapproves of the related foreclosure or acceptance
of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Servicer shall be reimbursed for all
Servicing Advances made pursuant to this paragraph with respect to the related
Mortgaged Property from the Custodial Account.

         The Servicer shall use its Best Efforts to dispose of the REO Property
as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event within three
years after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless (a) a REMIC
election has not been made with respect to the arrangement

                                      -25-
<PAGE>


under which the Mortgage Loans and the REO Property are held, and (b) the
Servicer determines, and gives an appropriate notice to the Master Servicer to
such effect, that a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of
such REO Property. If a period longer than three years is permitted under the
foregoing sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Servicer
shall report monthly to the Master Servicer as to the progress being made in
selling such REO Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Trustee,
a purchase money mortgage is taken in connection with such sale, such purchase
money mortgage shall name the Servicer as mortgagee, and such purchase money
mortgage shall not be held pursuant to this Agreement, but instead a separate
participation agreement among the Servicer and Trustee shall be entered into
with respect to such purchase money mortgage. Notwithstanding anything herein to
the contrary, the Servicer shall not be required to provide financing for the
sale of any REO Property.

         The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and hazard
insurance with extended coverage in amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.

         Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Agreement, no REO Property
acquired by the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to continue to be rented)
or otherwise used or held by or on behalf of the Trust Fund in such a manner, or
pursuant to any terms or for a period that would: (i) cause such REO Property to
fail to qualify as "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section
860G(a)(8) of the Code or (ii) result in the imposition of any tax upon any
REMIC included in the Trust Fund. Subject to the approval of the Master Servicer
as described in this paragraph, the disposition of REO Property shall be carried
out by the Servicer at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the
Servicer deems to be in the best interests of the Trust Fund.

         Prior to acceptance by the Servicer of an offer to sell any REO
Property, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of such offer in writing
which notification shall set forth all material terms of said offer (each a
"Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer shall be deemed to have approved the sale
of any REO Property unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in writing,
within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of the related Notice of Sale,
that it disapproves of the related sale, in which case the Servicer shall not
proceed with the sale. With respect to any REO Property, upon a REO Disposition,
the Servicer shall be entitled to retain from REO Disposition Proceeds a
disposition fee equal to $1,500.

         The Servicer shall withdraw from the Custodial Account funds necessary
for the proper operation, management and maintenance of the REO Property,
including the cost of maintaining any hazard insurance pursuant to the Fannie
Mae Guides. The Servicer shall make monthly distributions on each Remittance
Date to the Master Servicer of the net cash flow from the REO Property (which
shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses described in
this Section 3.16 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to time to
be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

         Section 3.17 Real Estate Owned Reports.

         Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section 4.02, the
Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer on or before the Remittance Date
each month a statement with respect to any REO Property covering the operation
of such REO Property for the previous month and the Servicer's efforts in
connection with the sale of such REO Property and any rental of such REO
Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous month. That statement
shall be accompanied by such other information as the Master Servicer shall
reasonably request.

         Section 3.18 MERS.


         (a) So long as the Trustee is a member of MERS, the Servicer shall use
its Best Efforts to cause the Trustee to be identified as the owner of each MERS
Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for purposes of the system of recording
transfers of beneficial ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS.

         (b) The Servicer shall maintain in good standing its membership in
MERS. In addition, the Servicer shall comply with all rules, policies and
procedures of MERS, including the Rules of Membership, as amended, and the MERS
Procedures Manual, as amended.

         (c) With respect to all MERS Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder, the
Servicer shall promptly notify MERS as to any transfer of beneficial ownership
of such Mortgage Loans of which the Servicer has notice.

         (d) With respect to all MERS Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder, the
Servicer shall notify MERS as to any transfer of servicing pursuant to Section
9.01 within 10 Business Days of such transfer of servicing. The Servicer shall
cooperate with the Trustee, the Master Servicer and any successor servicer to
the extent necessary to ensure that such transfer of servicing is appropriately
reflected on the MERS system.

         Section 3.19 Waiver of Prepayment Penalty Amounts.

         Except as provided below, the Servicer or any designee of the Servicer
shall not waive any Prepayment Penalty Amount with respect to any Mortgage Loan.
If the Servicer or its designee fails to collect a Prepayment Penalty Amount at
the time of the related prepayment of any Mortgage Loan subject to such
Prepayment Penalty Amount, the Servicer shall pay to the Trust Fund at such time
(by deposit to the Custodial Account) an amount equal to the amount of the
Prepayment Penalty Amount not collected; provided, however, the Servicer shall
not have any obligation to pay the amount of any uncollected Prepayment Penalty
Amount under this Section 3.19 if the failure to collect such amount is the
result of inaccurate or incomplete information in the Prepayment Penalty Amount
Schedule provided by the Seller and which is included as part of the Mortgage
Loan Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A. The Prepayment Penalty Amounts
listed on the Prepayment Penalty Amount Schedule attached hereto as Exhibit A
are complete, true and accurate and may be relied on by the Servicer in its
calculation of Prepayment Penalty Amounts. If the Prepayment Penalty Amount data
set forth on Exhibit A is incorrect, then the Servicer shall have no liability
for any loss resulting from calculation of Prepayment Penalty Amounts using the
data provided. Notwithstanding the above, the Servicer or its designee may waive
a Prepayment Penalty Amount without paying to the Trust Fund the

                                      -27-
<PAGE>


amount of such Prepayment Penalty Amount only if such Prepayment Penalty Amount
(i) relates to a defaulted Mortgage Loan or a reasonably foreseeable default,
such waiver is standard and customary in servicing similar mortgage loans to the
Mortgage Loan, and such waiver, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer would
maximize recovery of total proceeds from the Mortgage Loan, taking into account
the amount of such Prepayment Charge and the related Mortgage Loan, or (ii)
relates to a prepayment charge the collection of which, if collected, would be a
violation of applicable laws.

                                   ARTICLE IV.

                           PAYMENTS TO MASTER SERVICER


         Section 4.01 Remittances.

         On each Remittance Date, no later than 3:00 p.m. Eastern Standard Time,
the Servicer shall remit on a scheduled/scheduled basis by wire transfer of
immediately available funds to the Master Servicer (i) all amounts deposited in
the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the last day of the related
Due Period (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 3.04), plus (ii) all Monthly Advances, if any, which the
Servicer is obligated to remit pursuant to Section 4.03 (and which the Servicer
has not already deposited in the Custodial Account pursuant to Section
3.03(viii)); minus (iii) any amounts attributable to Principal Prepayments,
Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds, Condemnation Proceeds or REO
Disposition Proceeds received after the applicable Prepayment Period, which
amounts shall be remitted on the following Remittance Date, together with any
additional interest required to be deposited in the Custodial Account in
connection with such Principal Prepayment in accordance with Section 3.03(vi),
and minus (iv) any amounts attributable to Monthly Payments collected but due on
a Due Date or Due Dates subsequent to the first day of the month in which such
Remittance Date occurs, which amounts shall be remitted on the Remittance Date
next succeeding the Due Date related to such Monthly Payment.

         With respect to any remittance received by the Master Servicer after
the Business Day on which such payment was due, the Servicer shall pay to the
Master Servicer interest on any such late payment at an annual rate equal to the
Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change, plus two (2) percentage
points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount permitted by applicable
law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial Account by the Servicer
on the date such late payment is made and shall cover the period commencing with
the day following such Business Day and ending with the Business Day on which
such payment is made, both inclusive. Such interest shall be remitted along with
the distribution payable on the next succeeding Remittance Date. The payment by
the Servicer of any such interest shall not be deemed an extension of time for
payment or a waiver by the Trustee or the Master Servicer of any Event of
Default.

         All remittances required to be made to the Master Servicer shall be
made to the following wire account or to such other account as may be specified
by the Master Servicer from time to time:

         Section 4.02 Statements to Master Servicer.

         Not later than the tenth (10th) calendar day of each month (or if such
calendar day is not a Business Day, the immediately preceding Business Day), the
Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer (i) a monthly remittance advice in
the format set forth in Exhibit D-1 hereto and a monthly defaulted loan report
in the format set forth in Exhibit D-2 hereto (or in such other format mutually
agreed between the Servicer and the Master Servicer) relating to the period
ending on the last day of the preceding calendar month and (ii) all such
information required pursuant to clause (i) above on a magnetic tape or other
similar media reasonably acceptable to the Master Servicer. The format of this
monthly reporting may be amended from time to time to the extent necessary to
comply with applicable law or the terms of the Trust Agreement.

         Not later than the seventeenth day of each month, the Servicer shall
furnish to the Master Servicer (a) a monthly payoff remittance advice regarding
any Principal Prepayments in full applied to the related Mortgage Loan on or
after the seventeenth day of the month preceding the month of such reporting
date, but on or before the sixteenth day of the month of such reporting date,
containing such information and in such format as is mutually acceptable to the
Master Servicer and the Servicer, and in any event containing sufficient
information to permit the Master Servicer to properly report Principal
Prepayment in full information to the Trustee under the Trust Agreement and (b)
all such information required pursuant to clause (a) above in electronic format,
on magnetic tape or other similar media reasonably acceptable to the Master
Servicer.

         In addition, not more than 60 days after the end of each calendar year,
commencing December 31, 2004, the Servicer shall furnish to each Person who was
an owner of the Mortgage Loans at any time during such calendar year as required
by applicable law or if not required by applicable law, at the request of such
owner as to the aggregate of remittances for the applicable portion of such
year.

         Such obligation of the Servicer shall be deemed to have been satisfied
to the extent that substantially comparable information shall be provided by the
Servicer pursuant to any requirements of the Internal Revenue Code as from time
to time are in force.

         The Master Servicer may request that the Servicer provide, at the
Master Servicer's expense, an appraisal or a broker price opinion on any
Mortgage Loan which is 90 days or more delinquent. The Servicer shall use its
best efforts to deliver such appraisal or broker price opinion to the Master
Servicer within 15 calendar days after such request.

                                      -29-

         Beginning with calendar year 2004, the Servicer shall provide the
Master Servicer with such information concerning the Mortgage Loans as is
necessary for the Trustee to prepare the Trust Fund's federal income tax return
as the Trustee may reasonably request from time to time.


         Section 4.03 Monthly Advances by Servicer.

         On the Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance Date, the
Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds or from
amounts held for future distribution, or both, an amount equal to the aggregate
of all Monthly Advances relating to Monthly Payments which were due on the
Mortgage Loans during the applicable Due Period and which were delinquent at the
close of business on the immediately preceding Determination Date or which were
deferred pursuant to Section 3.01. Any amounts held for future distribution and
so used shall be replaced by the Servicer by deposit in the Custodial Account on
or before any future Remittance Date if funds in the Custodial Account on such
Remittance Date shall be less than remittances to the Master Servicer required
to be made on such Remittance Date. The Servicer shall keep appropriate records
of such amounts and will provide such records to the Master Servicer upon
request. The Servicer's obligation to make such Monthly Advances as to any
Mortgage Loan will continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior to the
payment in full of the Mortgage Loan, or through the last Remittance Date prior
to the Remittance Date for the distribution of all Liquidation Proceeds and
other payments or recoveries (including Insurance Proceeds and Condemnation
Proceeds) with respect to the Mortgage Loan unless the Servicer deems such
Monthly Advances to be unrecoverable, as evidenced by an Officer's Certificate
of the Servicer delivered to the Master Servicer.

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES


         Section 5.01 Servicing Compensation.

         As consideration for servicing the Mortgage Loans subject to this
Agreement, the Servicer shall retain (i) the relevant Servicing Fee for each
Mortgage Loan remaining subject to this Agreement during any month and (ii)
Ancillary Income. In addition, if at any time the Servicer is the Retained
Interest Holder with respect to any Mortgage Loans, then the Servicer, as the
Retained Interest Holder, shall retain an amount equal to the Retained Interest
relating to such Mortgage Loans; provided, that (i) the Trustee and the Master
Servicer shall have no obligation to make payment of the Retained Interest to
the Servicer and (ii) the Servicer's right to retain the Retained Interest is
limited to (and the Retained Interest may only be retained from) the interest
portion (including recoveries with respect to interest from Liquidation
Proceeds) of the Monthly Payments collected by the Servicer with respect to
those Mortgage Loans for which payment is in fact made of the entire amount of
the Monthly Payment. The Servicing Fee shall be payable monthly. The Servicing
Fees shall be payable only at the time of and with respect to those Mortgage
Loans for which payment is in fact made of the entire amount of the Monthly
Payment or as otherwise provided in Section 3.04. The obligation of the Trust
Fund to pay the Servicing Fees is limited as provided in Section 3.04. The
aggregate of the Servicing Fees payable to the Servicer for any month with
respect to the Mortgage Loans shall be reduced by

                                      -30-
<PAGE>


any Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount with respect to such month. Any
Prepayment Interest Excess Amount shall be retained by, or paid to, the Servicer
as a part of the Servicing Fee.

         The Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in
connection with its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to
reimbursement thereof except as specifically provided for herein.


         Section 5.02 Annual Audit Report.

         On or before March 15th of each year, beginning with March 15, 2005,
Servicer shall, at its own expense, cause a firm of independent public
accountants (who may also render other services to Servicer), which is a member
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, to furnish to the
Seller and the Master Servicer (i) year-end audited (if available) financial
statements of the Servicer and (ii) a statement to the effect that such firm has
examined certain documents and records for the preceding fiscal year (or during
the period from the date of commencement of such Servicer's duties hereunder
until the end of such preceding fiscal year in the case of the first such
certificate) and that, on the basis of such examination conducted substantially
in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage Bankers,
or such other attestation program as may be required by applicable law or
regulation, such firm is of the opinion that Servicer's overall servicing
operations have been conducted in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation
Program for Mortgage Bankers, or such other attestation program as may be
required by applicable law or regulation, except for such exceptions that, in
the opinion of such firm, the Uniform Single Attestation Program for Mortgage
Bankers, or such other attestation program as may be required by applicable law
or regulation, requires it to report, in which case such exceptions shall be set
forth in such statement.


         Section 5.03 Annual Officer's Certificate.

         (a) On or before March 15th of each year, beginning with March 15,
2005, the Servicer, at its own expense, will deliver to each Seller, the
Trustee, the Depositor and the Master Servicer a Servicing Officer's
certificate, or such other certificates as may be required under applicable law
or regulation, stating, as to each signer thereof, that (i) a review of the
activities of the Servicer during such preceding fiscal year and of performance
under this Agreement has been made under such officers' supervision, and (ii) to
the best of such officers' knowledge, based on such review, the Servicer has
fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement for such year, or, if there
has been a default in the fulfillment of all such obligations, specifying each
such default known to such officers and the nature and status thereof including
the steps being taken by the Servicer to remedy such default.

         (b) For so long as a certificate under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002,
as amended, ("Sarbanes-Oxley") is required to be given on behalf of the Trust
Fund, no later than March 15th of each year (or if not a Business Day, the
immediately preceding Business Day), or at any other time that the Master
Servicer, the Depositor or the Trustee provides a certification pursuant to
Sarbanes-Oxley and upon thirty (30) days written request of such parties, an
officer of the Servicer shall execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate to
the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the Depositor for the benefit of the Trust
Fund and the Master Servicer, the Trustee and the

                                      -31-
<PAGE>


Depositor and their officers, directors and affiliates, in the form of Exhibit E
hereto or as may be required by applicable law or regulation.

         (c) The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Master Servicer,
the Depositor and their respective officers, directors, agents and affiliates
from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable
legal fees and related costs, judgments and other costs and expenses arising out
of or based upon a breach by the Servicer or any of its officers, directors,
agents or affiliates of its obligations under this Section 5.03 or the
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Servicer in connection
therewith. If the indemnification provided for herein is unavailable or
insufficient to hold harmless the Master Servicer and/or the Depositor, then the
Servicer agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by the
Master Servicer and/or the Depositor as a result of the losses, claims, damages
or liabilities of the Master Servicer and/or the Depositor in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the Master Servicer and/or the
Depositor on the one hand and the Servicer on the other in connection with a
breach of the Servicer's obligations under this Section 5.03 or the Servicer's
negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct in connection therewith.


         Section 5.04 Transfers of Mortgaged Property.

         The Servicer shall use its best efforts to enforce any "due-on-sale"
provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny assumption by
the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to be sold
whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or not the
Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to
the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, exercise its rights to
accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause
applicable thereto, provided, however, that the Servicer shall not exercise such
rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if the exercise of such rights
would impair or threaten to impair any recovery under the related PMI Policy or
LPMI Policy, if any.

         If the Servicer reasonably believes it is unable under applicable law
to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Servicer shall enter into (i) an
assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such property has
been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage
Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in the event the
Servicer is unable under applicable law to require that the original Mortgagor
remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Servicer has the prior consent of
the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of liability agreement
with the owner of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to which the original
Mortgagor is released from liability and the owner of the Mortgaged Property is
substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note; provided
that no such substitutions should be permitted unless such person satisfies the
underwriting criteria of the Servicer and has a credit risk rating at least
equal to that of the original Mortgagor. The Mortgage Loan, as assumed, shall
conform in all respects to the requirements, representations and warranties of
this Agreement. The Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer that any such
assumption or substitution agreement has been contemplated by forwarding to the
Master Servicer a copy of such assumption or substitution agreement (indicating
the Mortgage File to which it relates). The Servicer shall forward an original
copy of such agreement to the Custodian to be held by the Custodian with the
other documents related to

                                      -32-
<PAGE>


such Mortgage Loan. The Servicer shall be responsible for recording any such
assumption or substitution agreements. In connection with any such assumption or
substitution agreement, the Monthly Payment on the related Mortgage Loan shall
not be changed but shall remain as in effect immediately prior to the assumption
or substitution, the Mortgage Interest Rate, the stated maturity or the
outstanding principal amount of such Mortgage Loan shall not be changed nor
shall any required monthly payments of principal or interest be deferred or
forgiven. Any assumption fee collected by the Servicer for entering into an
assumption agreement shall be retained by the Servicer as additional servicing
compensation. In connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage
Interest Rate borne by the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan
nor the outstanding principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

                                  ARTICLE VI.

                           REPRESENTATIONS, WARRANTIES
                                 AND AGREEMENTS

organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the
jurisdiction of its organization and has all licenses necessary to carry on its
business as now being conducted and is licensed, qualified and in good standing
in each state where a Mortgaged Property is located if the laws of such state

the laws of any such state to the extent necessary to ensure the enforceability
of the terms of this Agreement; the Servicer has the full power and authority to
execute and deliver this Agreement and to perform in accordance herewith; the

authorized; this Agreement evidences the valid, binding and enforceable
obligation of the Servicer and all requisite action has been taken by the
Servicer to make this Agreement valid and binding upon the Servicer in
accordance with its terms;

         (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the transactions
contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of business of the
Servicer;

         (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the acquisition of the servicing responsibilities by the Servicer or the
transactions contemplated hereby, nor the fulfillment of or compliance with the
terms and conditions of this Agreement, will conflict with or result in a breach
of any of the terms, conditions or provisions of the Servicer's organizational
documents or any legal restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the
Servicer is now a party or by which it is bound, or constitute a default or
result in an acceleration under any of the foregoing, or result in the violation
of any law, rule, regulation,

                                      -33-

impair the ability of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans, or impair the
value of the Mortgage Loans;

         (d) Ability to Perform. The Servicer does not believe, nor does it have
any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and every covenant
contained in this Agreement;

         (e) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit, proceeding or
investigation pending or threatened against the Servicer which, either in any
one instance or in the aggregate, may result in any material adverse change in
the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of the
Servicer, or in any material impairment of the right or ability of the Servicer
to carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any material
liability on the part of the Servicer, or which would draw into question the
validity of this Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in connection
with the obligations of the Servicer contemplated herein, or which would be
likely to impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform under the
terms of this Agreement;

         (f) No Consent Required. No consent, approval, authorization or order
of any court or governmental agency or body is required for the execution,
delivery and performance by the Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with
this Agreement;

         (g) Ability to Service. The Servicer is an approved seller/servicer of
conventional residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with the

is in good standing to service mortgage loans for either Fannie Mae or Freddie
Mac. The Servicer is a member in good standing of the MERS system;

         (h) No Untrue Information. Neither this Agreement nor any statement,
report or other document furnished or to be furnished pursuant to this Agreement
or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby contains any untrue
statement of fact or omits to state a fact necessary to make the statements
contained therein not misleading; and

         (i) No Commissions to Third Parties. The Servicer has not dealt with
any broker or agent or anyone else who might be entitled to a fee or commission
in connection with this transaction other than the Seller.


         Section 6.02 Remedies for Breach of Representations and Warranties of
the Servicer.

         It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties set
forth in Section 6.01 shall survive the engagement of the Servicer to perform
the servicing responsibilities as of the Closing Date or Servicing Transfer
Date, as applicable, hereunder and the delivery of the Servicing Files to the
Servicer and shall inure to the benefit of the Seller and the Trustee. Upon
discovery by either the Servicer, the Master Servicer or the Seller of a breach
of any of the foregoing representations and warranties which materially and
adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects
the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority of the
security interest on such Mortgaged Property or the interest of the Seller or
the Trustee, the party discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice
to the other.

                                      -34-
<PAGE>


         Within 60 days of the earlier of either discovery by or notice to the
Servicer of any breach of a representation or warranty set forth in Section 6.01
which materially and adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to perform
its duties and obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially and
adversely affects the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the
priority of the security interest on such Mortgaged Property, the Servicer shall
use its Best Efforts promptly to cure such breach in all material respects and,
if such breach cannot be cured, the Servicer shall, at the Trustee's or the
Master Servicer's option, assign the Servicer's rights and obligations under
this Agreement (or respecting the affected Mortgage Loans) to a successor
Servicer. Such assignment shall be made in accordance with Section 9.01.

         In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify the Seller, the Trustee and
the Master Servicer (and each of their respective directors, officers, employees
and agents) and hold each of them harmless against any Costs resulting from any
claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or grounded upon, or resulting
from, a breach of the Servicer representations and warranties contained in this
Agreement. It is understood and agreed that the remedies set forth in this
Section 6.02 constitute the sole remedies of the Seller, the Master Servicer and
the Trustee respecting a breach of the foregoing representations and warranties.

         Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or arising out of
the breach of any representations and warranties made in Section 6.01 shall
accrue upon (i) discovery of such breach by the Servicer or notice thereof by
the Seller or the Master Servicer to the Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer
to cure such breach within the applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the
Servicer by the Seller or the Master Servicer for compliance with this
Agreement.

         Section 6.03 Additional Indemnification by the Servicer; Third Party
Claims.

         The Servicer shall indemnify the Seller, the Master Servicer, the
Depositor, the Trustee (and each of their respective directors, officers,
employees and agents) and the Trust Fund, and hold them harmless against any and
all Costs that any such indemnified party may sustain in any way related to (i)
the failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans
in material compliance with the terms of this Agreement (including, but not
limited to its obligation to provide the certification pursuant to Section
5.03(b) hereunder) or for any inaccurate or misleading information provided in
the certification required pursuant to Section 5.03(b) or (ii) the failure of
the Servicer to cause any event to occur or not to occur which would have
occurred or would not have occurred, as applicable, if the Servicer were
applying Accepted Servicing Practices under this Agreement. The Servicer shall
immediately notify the Seller, the Master Servicer, the Depositor, the Trustee
and the Trust Fund or any other relevant party if a claim is made by a third
party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume (with the
prior written consent of the indemnified party in the event of an indemnified
claim) the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
therewith, including counsel fees, promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against it or any other party in respect
of such claim and follow any written instructions received from such
indemnifying party in connection with such claim. Subject to the Servicer's
indemnification pursuant to Section 6.02, or the failure of the Servicer to
service and administer the Mortgage Loans in material compliance with the terms
of this Agreement, the Trust Fund shall indemnify the Servicer and hold the
Servicer harmless against any and all Costs that the Servicer may sustain in
connection with any legal action relating to this Agreement, the Certificates or
the

                                      -35-
<PAGE>


origination or Servicing of the Mortgage Loans by any prior owner or servicer,
other than any Costs incurred by reason of the Servicer's willful misfeasance,
bad faith or negligence in the performance of duties hereunder or by reason of
its reckless disregard of obligations and duties hereunder.


         Section 6.04 Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and Loss of
REMIC Status.

         In the event that any REMIC fails to qualify as a REMIC, loses its
status as a REMIC, or incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result of a
prohibited transaction or prohibited contribution under the REMIC Provisions due
to the negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set
forth herein, the Servicer shall indemnify the Holder of the related Residual
Certificate, the Master Servicer, the Trustee (and each of their respective
directors, officers, employees and agents) and the Trust Fund against any and
all losses, claims, damages, liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from
such negligence; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be liable for
any such Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Trustee, the
Depositor or the Holder of such Residual Certificate, as applicable, nor for any
such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by the Holder of such
Residual Certificate on which the Servicer has relied. The foregoing shall not
be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Holder of such
Residual Certificate, the Trustee and the Trust Fund now or hereafter existing
at law or in equity or otherwise. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no
event shall the Servicer have any liability (1) for any action or omission that
is taken in accordance with and in compliance with the express terms of, or
which is expressly permitted by the terms of, this Agreement, (2) for any Losses
other than arising out of a negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties
and obligations set forth herein, and (3) for any special or consequential
damages to Certificateholders (in addition to payment of principal and interest
on the Certificates).

                                  ARTICLE VII.

                                  THE SERVICER


         Section 7.01 Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer.

         The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights and
franchises as a corporation or a limited liability company, and shall obtain and
preserve its qualification to do business as a foreign entity in each
jurisdiction in which such qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the
validity and enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and
to perform its duties under this Agreement.

         Any Person into which the Servicer may be merged or consolidated, or
any corporation or limited liability company resulting from any merger,
conversion or consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or any
Person succeeding to the business of the Servicer, shall be the successor of the
Servicer hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further
act on the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person shall
be an institution (i) having a net worth of not less than $25,000,000, and (ii)
which is a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac approved servicer in good standing.

                                      -36-
<PAGE>


         Section 7.02 Limitation on Liability of the Servicer and Others.

         Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers, employees or
agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Seller, the Master
Servicer or the Trustee for any action taken or for refraining from the taking
of any action in good faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in
judgment; provided, however, that this provision shall not protect the Servicer
or any such person against any breach of warranties or representations made
herein, or failure to perform its obligations in strict compliance with any
standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any liability which would
otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms and conditions of this
Agreement. The Servicer and any director, officer, employee or agent of the
Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima facie properly
executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters arising hereunder.
The Servicer shall not be under any obligation to appear in, prosecute or defend
any legal action which is not incidental to its duties to service the Mortgage
Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which in its opinion may involve it
in any expense or liability, provided, however, that the Servicer may, with the
consent of the Master Servicer, undertake any such action which it may deem
necessary or desirable in respect of this Agreement and the rights and duties of
the parties hereto. In such event, the Servicer shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Trust Fund for the reasonable legal expenses and costs of
such action.


         Section 7.03 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by the Servicer.

         The Seller has entered into this Agreement with the Servicer in
reliance upon the independent status of the Servicer, and the representations as
to the adequacy of its servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and
procedures, its integrity, reputation and financial standing, and the
continuance thereof. Therefore, the Servicer shall neither assign its rights
under this Agreement or the servicing hereunder nor delegate its duties
hereunder or any portion thereof, or sell or otherwise dispose of all or
substantially all of its property or assets without, in each case, the prior
written consent of the Seller and the Master Servicer, which consent, in the
case of an assignment of rights or delegation of duties, shall be granted or
withheld in the discretion of the Seller and the Master Servicer, and which
consent, in the case of a sale or disposition of all or substantially all of the
property or assets of the Servicer, shall not be unreasonably withheld;
provided, that in each case, there must be delivered to the Master Servicer and
the Trustee a letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that such transfer of
servicing or sale or disposition of assets will not result in a qualification,
withdrawal or downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer, without the consent of the Seller,
the Master Servicer or the Trustee, may retain third party contractors to
perform certain servicing and loan administration functions, including without
limitation, hazard insurance administration, tax payment and administration,
flood certification and administration, collection services and similar
functions; provided, that the retention of such contractors by Servicer shall
not limit the obligation of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans pursuant
to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.

         The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby
imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Servicer and the Master Servicer
or upon the determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible
under applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Servicer. Any
such determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be

                                      -37-
<PAGE>

evidenced by an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Master
Servicer and the Trustee which Opinion of Counsel shall be in form and substance
acceptable to the Master Servicer and the Trustee. No such resignation shall
become effective until a successor shall have assumed the Servicer's
responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in Section
9.01.

         Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 7.03, in the
event that the Servicer either shall assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property
or assets, without the prior written consent of the Seller and the Master
Servicer, then the Seller or the Master Servicer shall have the right to
terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set forth in Section 8.01, without
any payment of any penalty or damages and without any liability whatsoever to
the Servicer or any third party.


         Section 7.04 Subservicing Agreements and Successor Subservicer.

                  (a) The Servicer may enter into subservicing agreements for
         any servicing and administration of the Mortgage Loans with any
         institution which (i) is an approved Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac
         Seller/Servicer and (ii) which represents and warrants that it is in
         compliance with the laws of each state as necessary to enable it to
         perform its obligations under such subservicing agreement. For this
         purpose, subservicing shall not be deemed to include the use of a tax
         service, or services for reconveyance, insurance, property inspection
         or brokering REO Property or the retention of third party contractors
         to perform certain servicing and loan administration functions,
         including without limitation, hazard insurance administration, tax
         payment and administration, flood certification and administration,
         collection services and similar functions. The Servicer shall give
         prior written notice to the Master Servicer and the Trustee of the
         appointment of any subservicer and shall furnish to the Master Servicer
         a copy of such subservicing agreement. For purposes of this Agreement,
         the Servicer shall be deemed to have received payments on Mortgage
         Loans immediately upon receipt by any subservicer of such payments. Any
         such subservicing agreement shall be consistent with and not violate
         the provisions of this Agreement. Each subservicing agreement shall
         provide that a successor servicer shall have the option to terminate
         such agreement without payment of any fees if the predecessor servicer
         is terminated or resigns.


                  (b) The Servicer may terminate any subservicing agreement to
         which it is a party in accordance with the terms and conditions of such
         subservicing agreement and either itself directly service the related
         Mortgage Loans or enter into a subservicing agreement with a successor
         subservicer that qualifies under Section 7.04(a).

                  (c) Notwithstanding any subservicing agreement or the
         provisions of this Agreement relating to agreements or arrangements
         between the Servicer and a subservicer or reference to actions taken
         through a subservicer or otherwise, the Servicer shall remain obligated
         and primarily liable to the Trustee, the Master Servicer and the
         Certificateholders for the servicing and administering of the Mortgage
         Loans in accordance with the provisions hereof without diminution of
         such obligation or liability by virtue of such subservicing agreements
         or arrangements or by virtue of indemnification from the subservicer
         and to the same extent and

                                      -38-
<PAGE>


         under the same terms and conditions as if the Servicer alone were
         servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall be
         entitled to enter into any agreement with a subservicer for
         indemnification of the Servicer by such subservicer and nothing
         contained in this Agreement shall be deemed to limit or modify such
         indemnification.

                                  ARTICLE VIII.

                                   TERMINATION


         Section 8.01 Termination for Cause.

         This Agreement shall be terminable at the option of the Seller or the
Master Servicer if any of the following events of default exist on the part of
the Servicer:

                  (i) any failure by the Servicer to remit to the Master
         Servicer any payment required to be made under the terms of this
         Agreement which continues unremedied for a period of two Business Days
         after the date upon which written notice of such failure, requiring the
         same to be remedied, shall have been given to the Servicer by the
         Master Servicer; or

                  (ii) failure by the Servicer duly to observe or perform in any
         material respect any other of the covenants or agreements on the part
         of the Servicer set forth in this Agreement which continues unremedied
         for a period of 30 days; or

                  (iii) failure by the Servicer to maintain its license to do
         business or service residential mortgage loans in any jurisdiction, if
         required by such jurisdiction, where the Mortgaged Properties are
         located; or

                  (iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or supervisory
         authority having jurisdiction for the appointment of a conservator or
         receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment of debt,
         including bankruptcy, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar
         proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its affairs, shall
         have been entered against the Servicer and such decree or order shall
         have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60
         days; or

                  (v) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of a
         conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
         of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of
         or relating to the Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially
         all of its property; or

                  (vi) the Servicer shall admit in writing its inability to pay
         its debts generally as they become due, file a petition to take
         advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or reorganization
         statute, make an assignment for the benefit of its creditors,
         voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations or cease its normal
         business operations for three Business Days; or

                  (vii) the Servicer ceases to meet the qualifications of a
         Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac seller/servicer; or

                  (viii) the Servicer attempts to assign the servicing of the
         Mortgage Loans or its right to servicing compensation hereunder or the
         Servicer attempts to sell or otherwise dispose of

                                      -39-
<PAGE>


         all or substantially all of its property or assets or to assign this
         Agreement or the servicing responsibilities hereunder or to delegate
         its duties hereunder or any portion thereof (to other than a third
         party in the case of outsourcing routine tasks including, but not
         limited to, taxes, insurance, property inspection, reconveyance,
         collection or brokering REO Property), in each case without complying
         fully with the provisions of Section 7.03.

         In each and every such case, so long as an event of default shall not
have been remedied, in addition to whatever rights the Seller or the Master
Servicer may have at law or equity to damages, including injunctive relief and
specific performance, the Seller or the Master Servicer, by notice in writing to
the Servicer, may terminate all the rights and obligations of the Servicer under
this Agreement and in and to the servicing contract established hereby and the
proceeds thereof.

         Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all authority and
power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect to the Mortgage
Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in a successor Servicer
appointed by the Seller and the Master Servicer. Upon written request from the
Seller, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity
designated by the Seller any and all documents and other instruments, place in
such successor's possession all Servicing Files relating to the Seller's
Mortgage Loans, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, including but
not limited to the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans
and related documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The Servicer shall
cooperate with the Seller and the Master Servicer and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

         By a written notice, the Seller and the Master Servicer may waive any
default by the Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its
consequences. Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to
exist, and any Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been
remedied for every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any
subsequent or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the
extent expressly so waived.

         Upon a termination for cause pursuant to Section 8.01, all unreimbursed
Servicing Fees, Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances still owing the Servicer
shall be paid by the Trust Fund as such amounts are received from the related
Mortgage Loans.


         Section 8.02 Termination Without Cause.

         This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a) the
distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on the last Mortgage
Loan to the Master Servicer (or advances by the Servicer for the same), and (b)
the disposition of all REO Property acquired upon foreclosure of the last
Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all funds due hereunder, (ii) mutual consent
of the Servicer, the Seller and the Master Servicer in writing or (iii) at the
sole discretion of the Seller (acting in its capacity as owner of the servicing
rights relating to the Mortgage

                                      -40-
<PAGE>


Loans). Any such termination pursuant to clause (iii) above shall be with 30
days' prior notice, in writing and delivered to the Trustee, the Master Servicer
and the Servicer by registered mail to the addresses set forth in Section 9.03
of this Agreement (in the case of the Servicer) or in the Trust Agreement (in
the case of the Trustee or the Master Servicer). The Servicer shall comply with
the termination procedures set forth in Sections 7.03, 8.01 and 9.01 hereof. The
Master Servicer or the Trustee shall have no right to terminate the Servicer
pursuant to this Section 8.02. In connection with a termination by the Seller
pursuant to clause (iii) of this Section 8.02, the Servicer shall be reimbursed
for all unreimbursed out-of-pocket Servicing Advances, Monthly Advances and
Servicing Fees and other reasonable and necessary out-of-pocket costs associated
with any transfer of servicing at the time of such transfer of servicing. Any
invoices received by the Servicer after termination will be forwarded to the
Seller or the successor servicer for payment within thirty (30) days of receipt
from the Servicer.

                                  ARTICLE IX.

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS


         Section 9.01 Successor to the Servicer.

         Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities
and duties under this Agreement (a) pursuant to Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.01 or
8.02(ii), the Master Servicer shall (i) succeed to and assume all of the
Servicer's responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this
Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor having the characteristics set forth in
clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01 and which shall succeed to all rights and
assume all of the responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under
this Agreement simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
responsibilities, duties and liabilities under this Agreement; or (b) pursuant
to a termination under Section 8.02(iii), the Seller shall appoint a successor
having the characteristics set forth in clauses (i) and (ii) of Section 7.01 and
which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties
and liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement simultaneously with the
termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and liabilities under
this Agreement (with respect to those related Mortgage Loans). Any successor to
the Servicer shall be subject to the approval of the Master Servicer and, to the
extent required by the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, shall be a member in good
standing of the MERS system (if any of the Mortgage Loans are MERS Eligible
Mortgage Loans, unless such Mortgage Loans are withdrawn from MERS and
Assignments of Mortgage are recorded in favor of the Trustee at the expense of
the successor Servicer). Any approval of a successor servicer by the Master
Servicer and, to the extent required by the Trust Agreement, the Trustee, shall,
if the successor servicer is not at that time a servicer of other Mortgage Loans
for the Trust Fund, be conditioned upon the receipt by the Master Servicer and
the Trustee of a letter from each Rating Agency to the effect that such transfer
of servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or downgrade of the
then-current rating of any of the Certificates. In connection with such
appointment and assumption, the Master Servicer or the Seller, as applicable,
may make such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
payments on Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall agree, provided,
however, that no such compensation shall be in excess of that permitted the
Servicer under this Agreement. In the event that the Servicer's duties,
responsibilities and liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated
pursuant to the aforementioned sections,

                                      -41-
<PAGE>


the Servicer shall discharge such duties and responsibilities during the period
from the date it acquires knowledge of such termination until the effective date
thereof with the same degree of diligence and prudence which it is obligated to
exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might
impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of its successor. The
resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant to the aforementioned sections
shall not become effective until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to this
Section 9.01 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the representations
and warranties made pursuant to Sections 6.01 and the remedies available to the
Master Servicer and the Seller under Section 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04, it being
understood and agreed that the provisions of such Sections 6.01, 6.02, 6.03 and
6.04 shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such resignation or
termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this Agreement. Neither the
Master Servicer, in its capacity as successor servicer, nor any other successor
servicer, shall be responsible for the lack of information and/or documents that
are not transferred to it by the Servicer and that it cannot otherwise obtain
through reasonable efforts.

         Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer than 30 days
of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall prepare, execute
and deliver to the successor entity any and all documents and other instruments,
place in such successor's possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be
done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of
such notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer and
endorsement of the Mortgage Notes and related documents, and the preparation and
recordation of Assignments of Mortgage. The Servicer shall cooperate with the
Trustee, the Master Servicer or the Seller, as applicable, and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received
with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

         Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute, acknowledge
and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer, the Master Servicer and the Seller an
instrument (i) accepting such appointment, wherein the successor shall make the
representations and warranties set forth in Section 6.01 (including a
representation that the successor Servicer is a member of MERS, unless none of
the Mortgage Loans are MERS Mortgage Loans or MERS Eligible Mortgage Loans or
any such Mortgage Loans have been withdrawn from MERS and Assignments of
Mortgage are recorded in favor of the Trustee) and provide for the same remedies
set forth in Sections 6.02, 6.03 and 6.04 herein and (ii) an assumption of the
due and punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition to be
performed and observed by the Servicer under this Agreement, whereupon such
successor shall become fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties,
responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect
as if originally named as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or
resignation of the Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
Sections 6.02, 7.03, 8.01 or 8.02 shall not affect any claims that the Master
Servicer or the Trustee may have against the Servicer arising out of the
Servicer's actions or failure to act prior to any such termination or
resignation. In addition, in the event any successor servicer is appointed
pursuant to Section 8.02(iii) of this Agreement, such successor servicer must
satisfy the conditions relating to the transfer of servicing set forth in the
Trust Agreement.

         Section 9.04 Severability Clause.

         Any part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which
is prohibited or which is held to be void or unenforceable shall be ineffective
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof. Any part, provision, representation or warranty of
this Agreement which is prohibited or unenforceable or is held to be void or
unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall be ineffective, as to such jurisdiction,
to the extent of such prohibition or unenforceability without invalidating the
remaining provisions hereof, and any such prohibition or unenforceability in any
jurisdiction as to any Mortgage Loan shall not invalidate or render
unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction. To the extent permitted
by applicable law, the parties hereto waive any provision of law which prohibits
or renders void or unenforceable any provision hereof. If the invalidity of any
part, provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement shall deprive any
party of the economic benefit intended to be conferred by this Agreement, the
parties shall negotiate, in good-faith, to develop

                                      -44-
<PAGE>

a structure the economic effect of which is as close as possible to the economic
effect of this Agreement without regard to such invalidity.


         Section 9.05 No Personal Solicitation.

         From and after the Closing Date, the Servicer hereby agrees that it
will not take any action or permit or cause any action to be taken by any of its
agents or affiliates, or by any independent contractors on the Servicer's
behalf, to personally, by telephone or mail, solicit the borrower or obligor
under any Mortgage Loan (on a targeted basis) for any purposes of prepayment,
refinancing or modification of the related Mortgage Loan, provided, however,
that this limitation shall not prohibit the Servicer from soliciting such
Mortgagor for purposes of prepayment, refinance or modification of any loan
owned or serviced by the Servicer other than a Mortgage Loan. Notwithstanding
the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that, among other marketing
activities, promotions and solicitations undertaken by the Servicer which are
directed of the general public at large or which are directed generally to a
segment of the then existing customers of the Servicer or any of its affiliates
(including, without limitation, the mailing of promotional materials to the
Servicer's or its affiliates' deposit customers by inserting such materials into
customer account statements, mass mailings based on commercially acquired
mailing lists and newspaper, radio and television advertisements and
solicitations made on the basis of information acquired by the Servicer or its
affiliates that indicates that a borrower may be planning to refinance) shall
not constitute solicitation under this section. In the event the Servicer does
refinance any Mortgage Loan as a result of a violation of the requirements set
forth in this Section 9.05, the Servicer hereby agrees to pay to the Trust Fund
an amount equal to the difference, if any, between the amount that the Trust
Fund would have received if it had sold the Mortgage Loan to a third party, and
the proceeds received by the Trust Fund as a result of such refinancing.


         Section 9.06 Counterparts.

         This Agreement may be executed simultaneously in any number of
counterparts. Each counterpart shall be deemed to be an original, and all such
counterparts shall constitute one and the same instrument.


         Section 9.07 Place of Delivery and Governing Law.

         This Agreement shall be deemed in effect when a fully executed
counterpart thereof is received by the Seller in the State of New York and shall
be deemed to have been made in the State of New York. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE
GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK,
WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS CONFLICT OF LAW PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401
OF THE GENERAL OBLIGATIONS LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE
PARTIES HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

                                      -45-

         Section 9.08 Further Agreements.

         The Seller and the Servicer each agree to execute and deliver to the
other such reasonable and appropriate additional documents, instruments or
agreements as may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate the purposes of this
Agreement.


         Section 9.09 Intention of the Parties.

         It is the intention of the parties that the Seller is conveying, and
the Servicer is receiving only a contract for servicing the Mortgage Loans.
Accordingly, the parties hereby acknowledge that the Trust Fund remains the sole
and absolute owner of the Mortgage Loans and all rights (other than the
servicing rights) related thereto.


         Section 9.10 Successors and Assigns; Assignment of Servicing Agreement.

         This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of and be
enforceable by the Servicer, each Seller, the Trustee and the Master Servicer
and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement shall not be
assigned, pledged or hypothecated by the Servicer to a third party except in
accordance with Section 7.03.


         Section 9.11 Assignment by the Seller.

         The Seller shall have the right, upon notice to but without the consent
of the Servicer, to assign, in whole or in part, its interest under this
Agreement to the Depositor, which in turn shall assign such rights to the
Trustee, and the Trustee then shall succeed to all rights of the Seller under
this Agreement. All references to the Seller in this Agreement shall be deemed
to include its assignee or designee and any subsequent assignee or designee,
specifically including the Trustee, except with respect to the Seller's retained
servicing rights pursuant to Section 8.02(iii).

         The Seller shall have the right, upon notice to but without the consent
of the Servicer, to assign, in whole or in part, its retained servicing rights.
All references to the Seller in this Agreement, in its capacity as an owner of
servicing rights, shall be deemed to include the assignee or designee and any
subsequent assignee or designee, of the Seller's rights arising pursuant to
Section 8.02(iii).


         Section 9.12 Amendment

         This Agreement may be amended from time to time by the written
agreement signed by the Master Servicer, the Seller and the Servicer; provided
that the party requesting such amendment shall, at its own expense, provide the
Trustee, the Master Servicer and the Seller with an Opinion of Counsel that such
amendment will not materially adversely affect the interest of the
Certificateholders in the Mortgage Loans. Any such amendment shall be deemed not
to adversely affect in any material respect any the interest of the
Certificateholders in the Mortgage Loans, if the Trustee receives written
confirmation from each Rating Agency that such amendment will not cause such
Rating Agency to reduce, qualify or withdraw the then current rating assigned to
the Certificates (and any Opinion of Counsel requested by the Trustee, the
Master Servicer and the Seller in connection with any such amendment may rely
expressly on such confirmation as the basis therefore).

such waiver or modification is sought to be enforced.

         The exhibits to this Agreement are hereby incorporated and made a part
hereof and are an integral part of this Agreement.
