                        RECONSTITUTED SERVICING AGREEMENT

         THIS RECONSTITUTED SERVICING AGREEMENT (this "Agreement"), entered into
as of the 1st day of November, 2004, by and between LEHMAN BROTHERS HOLDINGS,
INC., a Delaware corporation (the "Seller"), and FIRST NATIONAL BANK OF NEVADA,
a national banking association (the "Servicer"), having an office at 7373 North

AURORA LOAN SERVICES INC., a Delaware corporation ("Aurora"), and CITIBANK,
N.A., a national banking association (the "Trustee"), recites and provides as
follows:

                                    RECITALS

         WHEREAS, the Seller has conveyed certain Mortgage Loans identified on
Exhibit C hereto (the "Serviced Mortgage Loans") to Structured Asset Securities
Corporation, a Delaware special purpose corporation ("SASCO") pursuant to a
Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement dated as of November 1, 2004 (the
"Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement"), which in turn has conveyed the
Serviced Mortgage Loans to the Trustee, pursuant to a trust agreement, dated as
of November 1, 2004 (the "Trust Agreement"), among the Trustee, Aurora, as
master servicer (together with any successor master servicer appointed pursuant
to the provisions of the Trust Agreement, the "Master Servicer"), and SASCO.

         WHEREAS, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB ("Lehman Brothers Bank") acquired
the Serviced Mortgage Loans from the Servicer, which Serviced Mortgage Loans
were either originated or acquired by the Servicer pursuant to the Master
Mortgage Loan Purchase Agreement, dated as of August, 27, 2004 (the "Purchase
Agreement").

         WHEREAS, the Serviced Mortgage Loans are currently being serviced by
the Servicer for Lehman Brothers Bank pursuant to a Master Interim Servicing
Agreement for Conventional, Fixed Rate, Residential Mortgage Loans, dated as of
November 15, 2000 (the "Flow Interim Servicing Agreement"), by and between
Lehman Brothers Bank and the Servicer, as amended by Amendment Number 1 thereto
dated as of September 6, 2001 ("Amendment No. 1"), which is annexed hereto as
Exhibit B (the Flow Interim Servicing Agreement and Amendment No. 1 thereto
shall hereinafter collectively be referred to as the "Flow Agreement").

         WHEREAS, pursuant to an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as
of November 1, 2004 (the "Assignment and Assumption Agreement") and annexed
hereto as Exhibit F, Lehman Brothers Bank has assigned all of its rights, title
and interest in the Serviced Mortgage Loans as well as all of its rights and
obligations as purchaser under the Purchase Agreement and the Flow Agreement to
the Seller, and the Seller has accepted such assignment.

         WHEREAS, the Seller desires that the Servicer continue to service the
Serviced Mortgage Loans, and the Servicer has agreed to do so, subject to the
rights of the Seller (with the consent of the Master Servicer) to terminate the
rights and obligations of the Servicer hereunder at any time without cause and
to the other conditions set forth herein.

         WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer agree that the provisions of the
Flow Agreement shall continue to apply to the Serviced Mortgage Loans, but only
to the extent provided herein and that this Agreement shall govern the Serviced
Mortgage Loans for so long as such Serviced Mortgage Loans remain subject to the
provisions of the Trust Agreement and until the Transfer Date.

<PAGE>

         WHEREAS, the Seller and Servicer agree that on the Transfer Date the
Servicer shall no longer service the Mortgage Loans and shall transfer servicing
of the Mortgage Loans to the successor servicer designated by the Seller herein.

         WHEREAS, the Master Servicer and any successor master servicer shall be
obligated, among other things, to supervise the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans on behalf of the Trustee, and shall have the right under the
conditions specified herein to terminate for cause the rights and obligations of
the Servicer under this Agreement.

         WHEREAS, the Seller and the Servicer intend that each of the Master
Servicer and the Trustee is an intended third party beneficiary of this
Agreement.

         NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter
set forth and for other good and valuable consideration, the receipt and
adequacy of which are hereby acknowledged, the Seller and the Servicer hereby
agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

         1. Definitions. Capitalized terms used and not defined in this
Agreement, including Exhibit A hereto and any provisions of the Flow Agreement
incorporated by reference herein (regardless of whether such terms are defined
in the Flow Agreement or the Purchase Agreement), shall have the meanings
ascribed to such terms in the Trust Agreement.

         2. Custodianship. The parties hereto acknowledge that U.S. Bank
National Association will act as custodian of the Serviced Mortgage Files for
the Trustee pursuant to a Custodial Agreement, dated November 1, 2004, between
U.S. Bank National Association and the Trustee.

         3. Servicing Transfer Date. The Servicer agrees, with respect to the
Serviced Mortgage Loans, to perform and observe the duties, responsibilities and
obligations that are to be performed and observed under the provisions of the
Flow Agreement, except as otherwise provided herein and on Exhibit A hereto, and
that the provisions of the Flow Agreement, as so modified, are and shall be a
part of this Agreement to the same extent as if set forth herein in full. The
parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the Transfer Date with respect to the
Mortgage Loans is January 5, 2005. On such date, the Servicer shall transfer all
servicing of the Mortgage Loans in accordance with the Flow Agreement and the
Purchase Agreement to the successor servicer designated by the Seller. The
Seller hereby designates Aurora to act as the Servicer of the Mortgage Loans on
and after the Transfer Date and to service such Mortgage Loans pursuant to an
existing servicing agreement between the Seller and Aurora.

         4. Trust Cut-off Date. The parties hereto acknowledge that by operation
of Subsection 2.05 and Subsection 3.01 of the Flow Agreement, the remittance on
December 18, 2004 to the Trust Fund is to include principal due after November
1, 2004 (the "Trust Cut-off Date") plus interest, at the Mortgage Loan
Remittance Rate collected during the related Due Period exclusive of any portion
thereof allocable to a period prior to the Trust Cut-off Date, with the
adjustments specified in clause (b) of Subsection 3.01 of the Flow Agreement.

         5. Servicing Fee. The parties hereto acknowledge that with respect to
each Serviced Mortgage Loan and for each period of one full month during the
period commencing with the Cut-off Date (as defined in the Trust Agreement) and
ending with the Servicing Transfer Date (i.e., the date selected by mutual
agreement of the parties for the transfer of the servicing of the Serviced
Mortgage Loans to Aurora, but no later than January 5, 2005), the Servicing Fee
for purposes of this Agreement shall equal


                                       -2-

<PAGE>

one-twelfth of the product of (a) the Servicing Fee Rate of 0.25% and (b) the
outstanding principal balance of each Serviced Mortgage Loan. Such fee shall be
computed monthly on the same principal amount and period respecting which any
related interest payment on such Serviced Mortgage Loan is computed. The
obligation of the Trust Fund to pay such Servicing Fee is payable solely from
the interest portion (including recoveries with respect to interest from
Liquidation Proceeds, to the extent permitted by Section 2.05 of the Flow
Agreement) of the Monthly Payment collected by the Servicer or as otherwise
provided under Section 2.05.

         6. Master Servicing; Termination of Servicer. The Servicer, including
any successor servicer hereunder, shall be subject to the supervision of the
Master Servicer, which Master Servicer shall be obligated to ensure that the
Servicer services the Serviced Mortgage Loans in accordance with the provisions
of this Agreement. The Master Servicer, acting on behalf of the Trustee and the
SASCO 2004-22 Trust Fund (the "Trust Fund") created pursuant to the Trust
Agreement, shall have the same rights as Lehman Brothers Bank under the Flow
Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the Flow Agreement
and the term "Purchaser" as used in the Flow Agreement in connection with any
rights of the Purchaser shall refer to the Trust Fund or, as the context
requires, the Master Servicer acting in its capacity as agent for the Trust
Fund, except as otherwise specified in Exhibit A hereto. The Master Servicer
shall be entitled to terminate the rights and obligations of the Servicer under
this Agreement upon the failure of the Servicer to perform any of its
obligations under this Agreement, which failure results in an Event of Default
as provided in Article XI of the Flow Agreement. Notwithstanding anything herein
to the contrary, in no event shall the Master Servicer assume any of the
obligations of Lehman Brothers Bank under the Flow Agreement and in connection
with the performance of the Master Servicer's duties hereunder, the parties and
other signatories hereto agree that the Master Servicer shall be entitled to all
of the rights, protections and limitations of liability afforded to the Master
Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

         7. No Representations. Neither the Servicer nor the Master Servicer
shall be obligated or required to make any representations and warranties
regarding the characteristics of the Serviced Mortgage Loans in connection with
the transactions contemplated by the Trust Agreement and issuance of the
Certificates issued pursuant thereto.

         8. Notices. All notices and communications between or among the parties

                       Modifications to the Flow Agreement


1.     A new definition of "Best Efforts" is hereby added to Article I to
       immediately follow the definition of "Appropriate Federal Banking
       Agency", to read as follows:

              "Best Efforts": Efforts determined to be reasonably diligent by
              the Servicer in its sole discretion. Such efforts do not require
              the Servicer to enter into any litigation, arbitration or other
              legal or quasi-legal proceeding, nor do they require the Servicer
              to advance or expend fees or sums of money in addition to those
              specifically set forth in this Agreement.

2.     The definition "Due Period" is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
       follows:

              "Due Period": With respect to each Remittance Date, the period
              commencing on the second day of the month immediately preceding
              the month of such Remittance Date and ending on the first day of
              the month of such Remittance Date.

3.     The definition of "Eligible Investments" in Article I is hereby amended
       in its entirety to read as follows:

              "Eligible Investments": Any one or more of the obligations and
              securities listed below which investment provides for a date of
              maturity not later than the Determination Date in each month:

                     (i) direct obligations of, and obligations fully guaranteed
              as to timely payment of principal and interest by, the United
              States of America or any agency or instrumentality of the United
              States of America the obligations of which are backed by the full
              faith and credit of the United States of America ("Direct
              Obligations");

                     (ii) federal funds, or demand and time deposits in,
              certificates of deposits of, or bankers' acceptances issued by,
              any depository institution or trust company (including U.S.
              subsidiaries of foreign depositories and the Trustee or any agent
              of the Trustee, acting in its respective commercial capacity)
              incorporated or organized under the laws of the United States of
              America or any state thereof and subject to supervision and
              examination by federal or state banking authorities, so long as at
              the time of investment or the contractual commitment providing for
              such investment the commercial paper or other short-term debt
              obligations of such depository institution or trust company (or,
              in the case of a depository institution or trust company which is
              the principal subsidiary of a holding company, the commercial
              paper or other short-term debt or deposit obligations of such
              holding company or deposit institution, as the case may be) have
              been rated by each Rating Agency in its highest short-term rating
              category or one of its two highest long-term rating categories;

                     (iii) repurchase agreements collateralized by Direct

              contractual commitment providing for such investment, at least
              equal to one of the two highest long-term credit rating categories
              of each Rating Agency; provided, however, that securities issued
              by any particular corporation will not be Eligible Investments to
              the extent that investment therein will cause the then outstanding
              principal amount of securities issued by such corporation and held
              as part of the Trust Fund to exceed 20% of the sum of the
              aggregate principal balance of the Mortgage Loans; provided,
              further, that such securities will not be Eligible Investments if
              they are published as being under review with negative
              implications from any Rating Agency;

                     (v) commercial paper (including both non-interest-bearing
              discount obligations and interest-bearing obligations payable on
              demand or on a specified date not more than 180 days after the
              date of issuance thereof) rated by each Rating Agency in its
              highest short-term rating category;

              obligations of the United States of America or its agencies or
              instrumentalities (which obligations are backed by the full faith
              and credit of the United States of America) held by a custodian in
              safekeeping on behalf of the holders of such receipts; and

                     (viii) any other demand, money market, common trust fund or
              time deposit or obligation, or interest-bearing or other security
              or investment, (A) rated in the highest rating category by each
              Rating Agency or (B) that would not adversely affect the then
              current rating by each Rating Agency of any of the Certificates.
              Such investments in this subsection (viii) may include money
              market mutual funds or common trust funds, including any fund for
              which the Trustee, the Master Servicer or an affiliate thereof
              serves as an investment advisor, administrator, shareholder
              servicing agent, and/or custodian or subcustodian, notwithstanding
              that (x) the Trustee, the Master Servicer or an affiliate thereof
              charges and collects fees and expenses from such funds for
              services rendered, (y) the Trustee, the Master Servicer or an

              services rendered pursuant to this Agreement, and (z) services
              performed for such funds and pursuant to this Agreement may
              converge at any time; provided, however, that no such instrument
              shall be an Eligible Investment if such instrument evidences
              either (i) a right to receive only interest payments with respect
              to the obligations underlying such instrument, or (ii) both
              principal and interest payments derived from obligations
              underlying such instrument and the principal and interest payments
              with respect to such instrument provide a yield to maturity of
              greater than 120% of the yield to maturity at par of such
              underlying obligations.

                     (a) be an obligation of an insurance company or other
              corporation whose long-term debt is rated by each Rating Agency in
              one of its two highest rating categories or, if such insurance
              company has no long-term debt, whose claims paying ability is
              rated by each Rating Agency in one of its two highest rating
              categories, and whose short-term debt is rated by each Rating
              Agency in its highest rating category;

                     (b) provide that the Servicer may exercise all of the
              rights under such contract or surety bond without the necessity of
              taking any action by any other Person;

              standing of the obligor under such guaranteed investment contract
              is such that continued investment pursuant to such contract of
              funds would result in a downgrading of any rating of the Servicer,
              the Servicer shall terminate such contract without penalty and be
              entitled to the return of all funds previously invested
              thereunder, together with accrued interest thereon at the interest
              rate provided under such contract to the date of delivery of such
              funds to the Trustee;

                     (d) provide that the Servicer's interest therein shall be

                     (e) provide that the funds reinvested thereunder and
              accrued interest thereon be returnable to the Custodial Account,
              as the case may be, not later than the Business Day prior to any
              Determination Date.

              Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller may waive,
              modify or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the
              postponement of any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to
              any Mortgagor if in the Seller's reasonable and prudent
              determination such waiver, modification, postponement or
              indulgence is not materially adverse to the Purchaser, provided,
              however, that unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to
              the Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the
              Seller, imminent, the Seller shall not permit any modification
              with respect to any Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage
              Interest Rate, forgive the payment of principal or interest,
              reduce or increase the outstanding principal balance (except for
              actual payments of principal) or change the final maturity date on
              such Mortgage Loan.

       (ii)   by adding the following to the end of the second paragraph of such
              section:


                                      A-5
<PAGE>

              Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
              consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer
              shall forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents
              evidencing such assumption, modification, consolidation or
              extension. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
              the Flow Agreement, the Servicer shall not make or permit any
              modification, waiver or amendment of any term of any Mortgage Loan
              that would cause any REMIC created under the Trust Agreement to
              fail to qualify as a REMIC or result in the imposition of any tax
              under Section 860F(a) or Section 860G(d) of the Code.

13.    Section 2.03 (Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments) is hereby amended by
       replacing the words "Continuously from the date hereof until the related
       Transfer Date" in the first and second lines thereof to "Continuously
       from the Closing Date until the date the Mortgage Loan ceases to be
       subject to this Agreement."

14.    Section 2.04 (Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account) is
       hereby amended by replacing the words "Residential Fixed Rate Mortgage

                     (ix) to transfer funds to another Qualified Depository in
              accordance with Section 2.10 hereof.

16.    Section 2.06 (Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account) is hereby

17.    Section 2.17 (Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property) is
       hereby amended by:

              (i)    adding the following paragraph as the third paragraph of
                     such Section:

                     Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this
              Section 2.17, in connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a
              deed in lieu of foreclosure, in the event the Servicer has
              reasonable cause to believe that a Mortgaged Property is
              contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, or if the
              Trustee or the Master Servicer otherwise requests, an
              environmental inspection or review of such Mortgaged Property to
              be conducted by a qualified inspector shall be arranged by the
              Servicer. Upon completion of the inspection, the Servicer shall
              provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a written report
              of such environmental inspection. In the event that the
              environmental inspection report indicates that the Mortgaged
              Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or
              wastes, the Servicer shall not proceed with foreclosure or
              acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In the event that the
              environmental inspection report is inconclusive as to the whether
              or not the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or
              toxic substances or wastes, the Servicer shall not, without


                                      A-6
<PAGE>

              the prior approval of the Master Servicer, proceed with
              foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. In
              such instance, the Master Servicer shall be deemed to have
              approved such foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of
              foreclosure unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in
              writing, within two (2) Business Days after its receipt of written
              notice of the proposed foreclosure or deed in lieu of foreclosure
              from the Servicer, that it disapproves of the related foreclosure
              or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure. The Servicer shall
              be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances made pursuant to this
              paragraph with respect to the related Mortgaged Property from the
              Custodial Account.

              (ii)   by replacing the existing third paragraph of such section
                     (before the amendment made by (i) above) by the following
                     paragraph:

                     The Servicer shall use its Best Efforts to dispose of the
              REO Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property
              in any event within three years after title has been taken to such
              REO Property, unless (a) a REMIC election has not been made with
              respect to the arrangement under which the Mortgage Loans and the
              REO Property are held, and (b) the Servicer determines, and gives
              an appropriate notice to the Master Servicer to such effect, that
              a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such
              REO Property. If a period longer than three years is permitted
              under the foregoing sentence and is necessary to sell any REO
              Property, (i) the Servicer shall report monthly to the Master
              Servicer as to the progress being made in selling such REO
              Property and (ii) if, with the written consent of the Trustee, a
              purchase money mortgage is taken in connection with such sale,
              such purchase money mortgage shall name the Servicer as mortgagee,
              and such purchase money mortgage shall not be held pursuant to
              this Agreement, but instead a separate participation agreement
              among the Servicer and Trustee shall be entered into with respect
              to such purchase money mortgage. Notwithstanding anything herein
              to the contrary, the Servicer shall not be required to provide
              financing for the sale of any REO Property. Notwithstanding any
              other provisions of this Agreement, no REO Property acquired by
              the Trust Fund shall be rented (or allowed to continue to be
              rented) or otherwise used or held by or on behalf of the Trust
              Fund in such a manner, pursuant to any terms or for a period that
              would: (i) cause such REO Property to fail to qualify as
              "foreclosure property" within the meaning of Section 860G(a)(8) of
              the Code or (ii) result in the imposition of any tax upon any
              REMIC included in the Trust Fund.

              (iii)  by adding the following paragraph to the end of such
                     section:

                     Prior to acceptance by the Servicer of an offer to sell any
              REO Property, the Servicer shall notify the Master Servicer of
              such offer in writing which notification shall set forth all
              material terms of said offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master
              Servicer shall be deemed to have approved the sale of any REO
              Property unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in
              writing, within five (5) days after its receipt of the related
              Notice of Sale, that it disapproves of the related sale, in which
              case the Servicer shall not proceed with such sale.

18.    Section 3.01 (Remittances) is hereby amended and restated in its entirety
       to read as follows:

                     On each Remittance Date the Servicer shall remit by wire
              transfer of immediately available funds to the Master Servicer (a)
              all amounts deposited in the Custodial Account


                                      A-7
<PAGE>

       as of the close of business on the last day of the related Due Period
       (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account
       pursuant to Sections 2.04 and 2.05), minus (b) any amounts attributable
       to Principal Prepayments, Liquidation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds,
       Condemnation Proceeds or REO Disposition Proceeds received after the
       applicable Prepayment Period, which amounts shall be remitted on the
       following Remittance Date, together with any additional interest required
       to be deposited in the Custodial Account in connection with such
       Principal Prepayment in accordance with Section 2.04(xi), and minus (c)
       any amounts attributable to scheduled monthly payments on the Mortgage
       Loans collected but due on a Due Date or Due Dates subsequent to the
       first day of the month in which such Remittance Date occurs, which
       amounts shall be remitted on the Remittance Date next succeeding the Due
       Date related to such monthly payment.

              With respect to any remittance received by the Master Servicer
       after the Business Day on which such payment was due, the Servicer shall
       pay to the Master Servicer interest on any such late payment at an annual
       rate equal to the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change,
       plus two (2) percentage points, but in no event greater than the maximum
       amount permitted by applicable law. Such interest shall be deposited in
       the Custodial Account by the Servicer on the date such late payment is
       made and shall cover the period commencing with the day following such
       Business Day and ending with the Business Day on which such payment is
       made, both inclusive. Such interest shall be remitted along with the
       distribution payable on the next succeeding Remittance Date. The payment
       by the Servicer of any such interest shall not be deemed an extension of
       time for payment or a waiver of any Event of Default by the Servicer.

              All remittances required to be made to the Master Servicer shall
       be made to the following wire account or to such other account as may be
       specified by the Master Servicer from time to time:

19.    Section 3.02 (Statements to Purchaser) is hereby amended as follows:

              (i) by replacing the first paragraph of such Section in its
       entirety by the following two (2) paragraphs:

                     Not later than the fifth Business Day of each month, the
              Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer (a) a monthly
              remittance advice in the format set forth in Exhibit E-1 hereto

              the preceding Determination Date and (b) all such information

              or other filings for the portion of the tax year 2004 and the

              return as the Master Servicer may reasonably request from time to

              in strict compliance with the terms of this Agreement or the
              failure of the Servicer to comply with applicable law. The
              Servicer immediately shall notify Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc.,
              the Depositor, the Master Servicer and the Trustee or any other
              relevant party if a claim is made by a third party with respect to
              this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume (with the prior
              written consent of the indemnified party) the defense of any such
              claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith, including
              counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment
              or decree which may be entered against it or any of such parties
              in respect of such claim. The Servicer shall follow any written
              instructions received from the Trustee in connection with such
              claim. The Trustee, from the assets of the Trust Fund, promptly
              shall reimburse the Servicer for all amounts advanced by it
              pursuant to the preceding sentence except when the claim is in any
              way relates to the failure of the Servicer to service and
              administer the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with the terms
              of this Agreement.

                     The Trust Fund shall indemnify the Servicer and hold it
              harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties,
              fines, forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and
              related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses
              that the Servicer may sustain in any way related to the failure of
              the Trustee or the Master Servicer to perform its duties in
              compliance with the terms of this Agreement.

                     In the event a dispute arises between an indemnified party
              and the Servicer with respect to any of the rights and obligations
              of the parties pursuant to this Agreement and such dispute is
              adjudicated in a court of law, by an arbitration panel or any
              other judicial process, then the losing party shall indemnify and
              reimburse the winning party for all attorney's fees and other
              costs and expenses related to the adjudication of said dispute.

26.    The first paragraph of Section 8.03 (Limitation on Resignation and
       Assignment by Seller) is hereby amended in its entirety to read as
       follows:

                     The Servicer shall neither assign this Agreement or the
              servicing hereunder or delegate its rights or duties hereunder or
              any portion hereof (to other than a third party in the case of
              outsourcing routine tasks such as taxes, insurance and property
              inspection, in which case the Servicer shall be fully liable for
              such tasks as if the Servicer performed them itself) or sell or
              otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or
              assets without the prior written consent of the Trustee and the
              Master Servicer, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the
              reasonable discretion of such parties; provided, however, that the
              Servicer may assign its rights and obligations hereunder without
              prior written consent of the Trustee and the Master Servicer to
              any entity that is directly owned or controlled by the Servicer,
              and the Servicer guarantees the performance of such entity
              hereunder. In the event of such assignment by the Servicer, the
              Servicer shall provide the Trustee and the Master Servicer with a
              written statement guaranteeing the successor entity's performance
              of the Servicer's obligations under the Agreement.

27.    Section 11.01 (Events of Default) is hereby amended by replacing the last
       paragraph thereof with the following:


                                      A-10
<PAGE>

                     Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all
              authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether
              with respect to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and
              be vested in a successor Servicer appointed by Lehman Brothers
              Holdings Inc. and the Master Servicer. Upon written request from
              the Seller, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the
              successor entity designated by the Seller any and all documents
              and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
              Servicing Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or
              things necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
              notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer
              and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related
              documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The Servicer shall
              cooperate with Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the Master
              Servicer and such successor in effecting the termination of the
              Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder, including
              without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
              administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time
              be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial Account or Escrow
              Account or thereafter received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

28.    The parties hereto acknowledge that the word "Purchaser" in Section 11.02
       (Waiver of Defaults) shall refer to the "Master Servicer with the prior
       consent of the Trustee."

29.    A new Section 11.03 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby added to read
       as follows:

              Section 11.03 Termination Without Cause.

                     This Agreement shall terminate upon: (i) the later of (a)
              the distribution of the final payment or liquidation proceeds on
              the last Mortgage Loan to the Trust Fund (or advances by the
              Servicer for the same), and (b) the disposition of all REO
              Property acquired upon foreclosure of the last Mortgage Loan and
              the remittance of all funds due hereunder, or (ii) mutual consent
              of the Servicer, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and the Master
              Servicer in writing or (iii) at the sole option of the Lehman
              Brothers Holdings Inc., without cause, upon 30 days written
              notice. Any such notice of termination shall be in writing and
              delivered to the Servicer by registered mail to the address set
              forth at the beginning of this Agreement. The Master Servicer, the
              Trustee and the Servicer shall comply with the termination
              procedures set forth in Sections 11.01 and 11.03.

                     In connection with any such termination referred to in
              clause (ii) or (iii) above, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. will be
              responsible for reimbursing the Servicer for all unreimbursed
              out-of-pocket Servicing Advances within 15 Business Days following
              the date of termination and other reasonable and necessary
              out-of-pocket costs associated with any transfer of servicing.

30.    A new Section 11.04 (Successor to the Servicer) is hereby added to read
       as follows:

              Section 11.04 Successor to the Servicer.

                     Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
              responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to
              Sections 8.03, 11.01 or 11.03, the Master Servicer shall, in
              accordance with the provisions of the Trust Agreement (i) succeed
              to and assume all of the Servicer's responsibilities, rights,
              duties and obligations under this Agreement, or (ii) appoint a
              successor meeting the eligibility requirements of this Agreement
              and (iii) and which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of
              the responsibilities, duties and


                                      A-11
<PAGE>

              liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement with the
              termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
              liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the Servicer
              that is not at that time a Servicer of other mortgage loans for
              the Trust Fund shall be subject to the approval of the Master
              Servicer, Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., the Trustee and each
              Rating Agency (as such term is defined in the Trust Agreement).
              Unless the successor servicer is at that time a servicer of other
              mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating Agency must deliver
              to the Trustee a letter to the effect that such transfer of
              servicing will not result in a qualification, withdrawal or
              downgrade of the then-current rating of any of the Certificates.
              In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Master
              Servicer or Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc., as applicable, may make
              such arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
              payments on the Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall
              agree; provided, however, that no such compensation shall be in
              excess of that permitted the Servicer under this Agreement. In the
              event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities and liabilities
              under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the
              aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties
              and responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires
              knowledge of such termination until the effective date thereof
              with the same degree of diligence and prudence which it is
              obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall take no
              action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or
              financial condition of its successor. The resignation or removal
              of the Servicer pursuant to the aforementioned sections shall not
              become effective until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to
              this Section 11.04 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer of
              the representations and warranties made pursuant to Article X
              shall be applicable to the Servicer notwithstanding any such
              resignation or termination of the Servicer, or the termination of
              this Agreement.

                     Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
              than 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the
              Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the successor
              entity any and all documents and other instruments, place in such
              successor's possession all Servicing Files, and do or cause to be
              done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to effect
              the purposes of such notice of termination. The Servicer shall
              cooperate with the Trustee and the Master Servicer, as applicable,
              and such successor in effecting the termination of the Servicer's
              responsibilities and rights hereunder and the transfer of
              servicing responsibilities to the successor Servicer, including
              without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
              administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time
              be credited by the Servicer to the Custodial Account or any Escrow
              Account or thereafter received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

                     Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
              acknowledge and deliver to the Trustee, the Servicer and the
              Master Servicer an instrument (i) accepting such appointment,
              wherein the successor shall make an assumption of the due and
              punctual performance and observance of each covenant and condition
              to be performed and observed by the Servicer under this Agreement,
              whereupon such successor shall become fully vested with all the
              rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
              liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect as if originally
              named as a party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation
              of the Servicer or termination of this Agreement pursuant to
              Sections 11.01 or 11.03 shall not affect any claims that the
              Master Servicer or the Trustee may have against the Servicer
              arising out of the Servicer's actions or failure to act prior to
              any such termination or resignation.


                                      A-12
<PAGE>

                     The Servicer shall deliver within three (3) Business Days
              to the successor Servicer the funds in the Custodial Account and
              Escrow Account and all Mortgage Loan Documents and related
              documents and statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer
              shall account for all funds and shall execute and deliver such
              instruments and do such other things as may reasonably be required
              to more fully and definitively vest in the successor all such
              rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and
              liabilities of the Servicer.

                     Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
              Servicer shall notify the Trustee and Master Servicer of such
              appointment in accordance with the notice procedures set forth
              herein.

                     Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all
              reasonable costs and expenses incurred in connection with any
              transfer of servicing hereunder (whether as a result of
              termination or removal of the Servicer or resignation of the
              Servicer or otherwise), including, without limitation, the costs
              and expenses of the Master Servicer or any other Person in
              appointing a successor servicer, or of the Master Servicer in
              assuming the responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder, or of
              transferring the Servicing Files and the other necessary data to
              the successor servicer shall be paid by the terminated, removed or
              resigning Servicer from its own funds without reimbursement.

31.    A new Section 12.11 (Intended Third Party Beneficiaries) is hereby added
       to read as follows:

              Section 12.11 Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.

                     Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the
              parties to this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in
              furtherance of the intent of such parties as set forth herein,
              that the Master Servicer and the Trustee receive the benefit of
              the provisions of this Agreement as intended third party
              beneficiaries of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions.
              The Servicer shall have the same obligations to the Master
              Servicer and the Trustee as if they were parties to this
              Agreement, and the Master Servicer and the Trustee shall have the
              same rights and remedies to enforce the provisions of this
              Agreement as if they were parties to this Agreement. The Servicer
              shall only take direction from the Master Servicer (if direction
              by the Master Servicer is required under this Agreement) unless
              otherwise directed by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
              foregoing, all rights and obligations of the Master Servicer and
              the Trustee hereunder (other than the right to indemnification)
              shall terminate upon termination of the Trust Agreement and of the
              Trust Fund pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

32.    A new Section 12.12 (Acknowledgement) is hereby added to read as follows:

              Acknowledgement. The Servicer hereby acknowledges that the rights
              of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Servicing Agreement, as
              amended by this Agreement, will be assigned to SASCO under the
              Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement, and subsequently to
              the Trust Fund under the Trust Agreement and agrees that the
              Mortgage Loan Sale and Assignment Agreement and the Trust
              Agreement will each be an assignment and assumption agreement or
              other assignment document required pursuant to Section 8.04 of the
              Flow Agreement and will constitute an assignment and assumption of
              the rights of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. under the Servicing
              Agreement to SASCO and the Trust Fund, as applicable. In addition,
              the Trust Fund will

              make a REMIC election. The Servicer hereby consents to such
              assignment and assumption and acknowledges the Trust Fund's REMIC
              election.
