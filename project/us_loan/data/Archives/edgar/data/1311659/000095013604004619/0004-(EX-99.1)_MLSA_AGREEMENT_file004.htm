                                   ARTICLE I

                          CONVEYANCE OF MORTGAGE LOANS

Section 1.01      Mortgage Loans.

         (a) Sale of Mortgage Loans. Concurrently with the execution and
delivery of this Agreement, the Seller does hereby transfer, assign, set over,
deposit with and otherwise convey to the Depositor, without recourse, subject to
Sections 1.03 and 1.04, all the right, title and interest of the Seller in and
to the Mortgage Loans (exclusive of any Retained Interest on such Mortgage
Loans, if any) identified on Schedule A-1 and Schedule A-2 hereto, having an
aggregate principal balance as of the Cut-off Date of $322,668,769.23. Such
conveyance includes, without limitation, the right to all distributions of
principal and interest received on or with respect to the Mortgage Loans on or
after November 1, 2004 other than, (i) any amounts representing Retained
Interest, if any, and (ii) payments of principal and interest due on or before
such date, and all such payments due after such date but received prior to such
date and intended by the related Mortgagors to be applied after such date,
together with all of the Seller's right, title and interest in and to each
related account and all amounts from time to time credited to and the proceeds
of such account, any REO Property and the proceeds thereof, the Seller's rights
under any Insurance Policies relating to the Mortgage Loans, the Seller's
security interest in any collateral pledged to secure the Mortgage Loans,
including the Mortgaged Properties, and any proceeds of the foregoing.

         (b) Concurrently with the execution and delivery of this Agreement, the
Seller hereby assigns to the Depositor all of its rights and interest under each
Transfer Agreement and each Servicing Agreement, other than any right to receive
Retained Interest if any, and any servicing rights retained thereunder, and
delegates to the Depositor all of its obligations thereunder, to the extent
relating to the Mortgage Loans. The Seller and the Depositor further agree that
this Agreement incorporates the terms and conditions of any assignment and
assumption agreement or other assignment document required to be entered into
under any of the Transfer Agreements (any such document an "Assignment
Agreement") and this Agreement constitutes an Assignment Agreement under such
Transfer Agreement, and the Depositor hereby assumes the


                                       3
<PAGE>

obligations of the assignee under each such Assignment Agreement. Concurrently
with the execution hereof, the Depositor tenders the purchase price of
$322,668,769.23. The Depositor hereby accepts such assignment and delegation,
and shall be entitled to exercise all the rights of the Seller under each
Transfer Agreement and each Servicing Agreement, other than any servicing rights
thereunder, as if the Depositor had been a party to each such agreement.

         (c) Schedules of Mortgage Loans. The Depositor and the Seller have
agreed upon which of the Mortgage Loans owned by the Seller are to be purchased
by the Depositor pursuant to this Agreement and the Seller will prepare on or
prior to the Closing Date a final schedule describing such Mortgage Loans (the
"Mortgage Loan Schedule"). The Mortgage Loan Schedule shall conform to the
requirements of the Depositor as set forth in this Agreement and to the
definition of "Mortgage Loan Schedule" under the Trust Agreement. The Mortgage
Loan Schedule attached hereto as Schedule A-1 specifies those Mortgage Loans
that are Transferred Mortgage Loans and the Mortgage Loan Schedule attached
hereto as Schedule A-2 specifies those Mortgage Loans that are Bank Originated
Mortgage Loans and which have been assigned by the Bank to the Seller pursuant
to the Assignment and Assumption Agreement.

Section 1.02      Delivery of Documents.

         (a) In connection with such transfer and assignment of the Mortgage
Loans hereunder, the Seller, shall, at least three (3) Business Days prior to
the Closing Date, deliver, or cause to be delivered, to the Depositor (or its
designee) the documents or instruments with respect to each Mortgage Loan (each
a "Mortgage File") so transferred and assigned, as specified in the related
Transfer Agreements or Servicing Agreements.

         (b) For Mortgage Loans (if any) that have been prepaid in full on or
after the Cut-off Date and prior to the Closing Date, the Seller, in lieu of
delivering the related Mortgage Files, herewith delivers to the Depositor an
Officer's Certificate which shall include a statement to the effect that all
amounts received in connection with such prepayment that are required to be
deposited in the Collection Account maintained by the Master Servicer for such
purpose have been so deposited.

         Section 1.03. Review of Documentation. The Depositor, by execution and
delivery hereof, acknowledges receipt of the Mortgage Files pertaining to the
Mortgage Loans listed on the Mortgage Loan Schedule, subject to review thereof
by the custodian, LaSalle Bank National Association and U.S. Bank National
Association, as applicable (each, a "Custodian" and together, the "Custodians"),
for the Depositor. Each Custodian is required to review, within 45 days
following the Closing Date, each applicable Mortgage File. If in the course of
such review the related Custodian identifies any Material Defect, the Seller
shall be obligated to cure such Material Defect or to repurchase the related
Mortgage Loan from the Depositor (or, at the direction of and on behalf of the
Depositor, from the Trust Fund), or to substitute a Qualifying Substitute
Mortgage Loan therefor, in each case to the same extent and in the same manner
as the Depositor is obligated to the Trustee and the Trust Fund under Section
2.02(c) of the Trust Agreement.

         Section 1.04. Representations and Warranties of the Seller.

         (a) The Seller hereby represents and warrants to the Depositor that as
of the Closing Date:

              (i) The Seller is a corporation duly organized, validly existing
         and in good standing under the laws governing its creation and
         existence and has full corporate power and authority to own its
         property, to carry on its business as presently conducted, and to enter
         into and perform its obligations under this Agreement and the
         Assignment and Assumption Agreement;

              (ii) The execution and delivery by the Seller of this Agreement
         and the Assignment and Assumption Agreement have been duly authorized
         by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Seller; neither
         the execution and delivery of this Agreement or the Assignment and
         Assumption Agreement, nor the consummation of the transactions herein
         or therein contemplated, nor compliance with the provisions hereof or
         thereof, will conflict with or result in a breach of, or constitute a
         default under, any of the provisions of any law, governmental rule,
         regulation, judgment, decree or order binding on the Seller or its
         properties or the certificate of incorporation or bylaws of the Seller;

              (iii) The execution, delivery and performance by the Seller of
         this Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption Agreement and the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated hereby and thereby do not
         require the consent or approval of, the giving of notice to, the
         registration with, or the taking of any other action in respect of, any
         state, federal or other governmental authority or agency, except such
         as has been obtained, given, effected or taken prior to the date
         hereof;

              (iv) Each of this Agreement and the Assignment and Assumption
         Agreement has been duly executed and delivered by the Seller and,
         assuming due authorization, execution and delivery by the Bank, in the
         case of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement, and the Depositor, in
         the case of this Agreement, constitutes a valid and binding obligation
         of the Seller enforceable against it in accordance with its respective
         terms, except as such enforceability may be subject to (A) applicable
         bankruptcy and insolvency laws and other similar laws affecting the
         enforcement of the rights of creditors generally and (B) general
         principles of equity regardless of whether such enforcement is
         considered in a proceeding in equity or at law; and

              (v) There are no actions, suits or proceedings pending or, to the
         knowledge of the Seller, threatened or likely to be asserted against or
         affecting the Seller, before or by any court, administrative agency,
         arbitrator or governmental body (A) with respect to any of the
         transactions contemplated by this Agreement or the Assignment and
         Assumption Agreement or (B) with respect to any other matter which in
         the judgment of the Seller will be determined adversely to the Seller
         and will if determined adversely to the Seller materially and adversely
         affect it or its business, assets, operations or condition, financial
         or otherwise, or adversely affect its ability to perform its
         obligations under this Agreement or the Assignment and Assumption
         Agreement.

         (b) The representations and warranties of each Transferor with respect
to the Transferred Mortgage Loans in the applicable Transfer Agreement were made
as of the date of


                                       5
<PAGE>

such Transfer Agreement. To the extent that any fact, condition or event with
respect to a Transferred Mortgage Loan constitutes a breach of both (i) a
representation or warranty of a Transferor under the applicable Transfer
Agreement and (ii) a representation or warranty of the Seller under this
Agreement, the sole right or remedy of the Depositor with respect to a breach by
the Seller of such representation and warranty (other than a breach by the
Seller of the representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections
1.04(b)(xii), 1.04(b)(xvii), 1.04(b)(xviii), 1.04(b)(xix) and 1.04(b)(xx)) shall
be the right to enforce the obligations of such Transferor under any applicable
representation or warranty made by it. The representations made by the Seller
pursuant to Sections 1.04(b)(xii), 1.04(b)(xvii), 1.04(b)(xviii), 1.04(b)(xix)
and 1.04(b)(xx)) shall be direct obligations of the Seller. The Depositor
acknowledges and agrees that the representations and warranties of the Seller in
this Section 1.04(b) (other than the representations and warranties made
pursuant to Sections 1.04(b)(xii), 1.04(b)(xvii), 1.04(b)(xviii), 1.04(b)(xix)
and 1.04(b)(xx)) are applicable only to facts, conditions or events that do not
constitute a breach of any representation or warranty made by the related
Transferor in the applicable Transfer Agreement. The Seller shall have no
obligation or liability with respect to any breach of a representation or
warranty made by it with respect to the Transferred Mortgage Loans if the fact,
condition or event constituting such breach also constitutes a breach of a
representation or warranty made by the related Transferor in such Transfer
Agreement, without regard to whether the related Transferor fulfills its
contractual obligations in respect of such representation or warranty; provided,
however, that if the related Transferor fulfills its obligations under the
provisions of such Transfer Agreement by substituting for the affected Mortgage
Loan a mortgage loan which is not a Qualifying Substitute Mortgage Loan, the
Seller shall, in exchange for such substitute mortgage loan, provide the
Depositor (a) with the applicable Purchase Price for the affected Mortgage Loan
or (b) within the two-year period following the Closing Date, with a Qualified
Substitute Mortgage Loan for such affected Transferred Mortgage Loan. Subject to
the foregoing, the Seller represents and warrants upon delivery of the
Transferred Mortgage Loans to the Depositor hereunder on the Closing Date, as to
each, that:

              (i) The information set forth with respect to the Transferred
         Mortgage Loans on the Mortgage Loan Schedule provides an accurate
         listing of the Transferred Mortgage Loans, and the information with
         respect to each Transferred Mortgage Loan on the Mortgage Loan Schedule
         is true and correct in all material respects at the date or dates
         respecting which such information is given;

              (ii) There are no defaults (other than delinquency in payment) in
         complying with the terms of any Mortgage, and the Seller has no notice
         as to any taxes, governmental assessments, insurance premiums, water,
         sewer and municipal charges, leasehold payments or ground rents which
         previously became due and owing but which have not been paid;

              (iii) Except in the case of Cooperative Loans, if any, each
         Mortgage requires all buildings or other improvements on the related
         Mortgaged Property to be insured by a generally acceptable insurer
         against loss by fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other
         hazards as are customary in the area where the related Mortgaged
         Property is located pursuant to insurance policies conforming to the
         requirements of the guidelines of FNMA or FHLMC. If upon origination of
         the Transferred Mortgage Loan, the


                                       6
<PAGE>

         Mortgaged Property was in an area identified in the Federal Register by
         the Federal Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards
         (and such flood insurance has been made available) a flood insurance
         policy meeting the requirements of the current guidelines of the
         Federal Flood Insurance Administration is in effect which policy
         conforms to the requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal
         Flood Insurance Administration. Each Mortgage obligates the related
         Mortgagor thereunder to maintain the hazard insurance policy at the
         Mortgagor's cost and expense, and on the Mortgagor's failure to do so,
         authorizes the holder of the Mortgage to obtain and maintain such
         insurance at such Mortgagor's cost and expense, and to seek
         reimbursement therefor from the Mortgagor. Where required by state law
         or regulation, each Mortgagor has been given an opportunity to choose
         the carrier of the required hazard insurance, provided the policy is
         not a "master" or "blanket" hazard insurance policy covering the common
         facilities of a planned unit development. The hazard insurance policy
         is the valid and binding obligation of the insurer, is in full force
         and effect, and will be in full force and effect and inure to the
         benefit of the Depositor upon the consummation of the transactions
         contemplated by this Agreement;

              (iv) Each Mortgage has not been satisfied, cancelled, subordinated
         or rescinded, in whole or in part, and the Mortgaged Property has not
         been released from the lien of the Mortgage, in whole or in part, nor
         has any instrument been executed that would effect any such release,
         cancellation, subordination or rescission;

              (v) Each Mortgage evidences a valid, subsisting, enforceable and
         perfected first lien on the related Mortgaged Property (including all
         improvements on the Mortgaged Property). The lien of the Mortgage is
         subject only to: (1) liens of current real property taxes and
         assessments not yet due and payable and, if the related Mortgaged
         Property is a condominium unit, any lien for common charges permitted
         by statute, (2) covenants, conditions and restrictions, rights of way,
         easements and other matters of public record as of the date of
         recording of such Mortgage acceptable to mortgage lending institutions
         in the area in which the related Mortgaged Property is located and
         specifically referred to in the lender's Title Insurance Policy or
         attorney's opinion of title and abstract of title delivered to the
         originator of the applicable Transferred Mortgage Loan, and (3) such
         other matters to which like properties are commonly subject which do
         not, individually or in the aggregate, materially interfere with the
         benefits of the security intended to be provided by the Mortgage. Any
         security agreement, chattel mortgage or equivalent document related to,
         and delivered to the Trustee in connection with, a Transferred Mortgage
         Loan establishes a valid, subsisting and enforceable first lien on the
         property described therein and the Depositor has full right to sell and
         assign the same to the Trustee;

              (vi) Immediately prior to the transfer and assignment of the
         Transferred Mortgage Loans to the Depositor, the Seller was the sole
         owner of record and holder of each Transferred Mortgage Loan, and the
         Seller had good and marketable title thereto, and has full right to
         transfer and sell each Transferred Mortgage Loan to the Depositor free
         and clear, except as described in paragraph (v) above, of any
         encumbrance, equity, participation interest, lien, pledge, charge,
         claim or security interest, and has full right and



                                       7
<PAGE>

         authority, subject to no interest or participation of, or agreement
         with, any other party, to sell and assign each Transferred Mortgage
         Loan pursuant to this Agreement;

              (vii) Each Transferred Mortgage Loan other than any Cooperative
         Loan is covered by either (i) an attorney's opinion of title and
         abstract of title the form and substance of which is generally
         acceptable to mortgage lending institutions originating mortgage loans
         in the locality where the related Mortgaged Property is located or (ii)
         an ALTA mortgagee Title Insurance Policy or other generally acceptable
         form of policy of insurance, issued by a title insurer qualified to do
         business in the jurisdiction where the Mortgaged Property is located,
         insuring the originator of the Transferred Mortgage Loan, and its
         successors and assigns, as to the first priority lien of the Mortgage
         in the original principal amount of the Transferred Mortgage Loan
         (subject only to the exceptions described in paragraph (v) above). If
         the Mortgaged Property is a condominium unit located in a state in
         which a title insurer will generally issue an endorsement, then the
         related Title Insurance Policy contains an endorsement insuring the
         validity of the creation of the condominium form of ownership with
         respect to the project in which such unit is located. With respect to
         any Title Insurance Policy, the originator is the sole insured of such
         mortgagee Title Insurance Policy, such mortgagee Title Insurance Policy
         is in full force and effect and will inure to the benefit of the
         Depositor upon the consummation of the transactions contemplated by
         this Agreement, no claims have been made under such mortgagee Title
         Insurance Policy and no prior holder of the related Mortgage, including
         the Seller, has done, by act or omission, anything that would impair
         the coverage of such mortgagee Title Insurance Policy;

              (viii) To the best of the Seller's knowledge, no foreclosure
         action is being threatened or commenced with respect to any Transferred
         Mortgage Loan;

              (ix) There is no proceeding pending for the total or partial
         condemnation of any Mortgaged Property (or, in the case of any
         Cooperative Loan, the related cooperative unit) and each such property
         is undamaged by waste, fire, earthquake or earth movement, windstorm,
         flood, tornado or other casualty, so as to have a material adverse
         effect on the value of the related Mortgaged Property as security for
         the related Transferred Mortgage Loan or the use for which the premises
         were intended;

              (x) There are no mechanics' or similar liens or claims which have
         been filed for work, labor or material (and no rights are outstanding
         that under the law could give rise to such liens) affecting the related
         Mortgaged Property which are or may be liens prior to, or equal or
         coordinate with, the lien of the related Mortgage;

              (xi) Each Transferred Mortgage Loan was originated by a savings
         and loan association, savings bank, commercial bank, credit union,
         insurance company or similar institution that is supervised and
         examined by a Federal or State authority, or by a mortgagee approved by
         the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development pursuant to Sections 203
         and 211 of the National Housing Act;


                                       8
<PAGE>

              (xii) Each Transferred Mortgage Loan at the time it was made
         complied in all material respects with applicable local, state, and
         federal laws including, but not limited to, all applicable predatory
         and abusive lending laws;

              (xiii) As of the Closing Date, each Transferred Mortgage Loan is a
         "qualified mortgage" within the meaning of Section 860G of the Code and
         Treas. Reg. ss.1.860G-2 (determined without regard to Treas. Reg.
         ss.1.860G-2(f) or any similar rule that provides that a defective
         obligation is a qualified mortgage for a temporary period);

              (xiv) As of the Closing Date, other than with respect to any Class
         E Distributable Amount, no Transferred Mortgage Loan provides for
         interest other than at either (i) a single fixed rate in effect
         throughout the term of the Transferred Mortgage Loan or (ii) a single
         "variable rate" (within the meaning of Treas. Reg. ss.1.860G-1(a)(3))
         in effect throughout the term of the Transferred Mortgage Loan;

              (xv) As of the Closing Date, no Transferred Mortgage Loan is the
         subject of pending or final foreclosure proceedings;

              (xvi) As of the Closing Date, based on delinquencies in payment on
         the Transferred Mortgage Loans, the Seller would not initiate
         foreclosure proceedings with respect to any Transferred Mortgage Loan
         prior to the next scheduled payment date on such Transferred Mortgage
         Loan;

              (xvii) No Transferred Mortgage Loan is a "high-cost," "high-cost
         home," "covered," "high-risk home" or "predatory" loan under any
         applicable federal, state or local predatory or abusive lending law (or
         a similarly classified loan using different terminology under a law
         imposing heightened regulatory scrutiny or additional legal liability
         for residential mortgage loans having high interest rates, points
         and/or fees); no Transferred Mortgage Loan originated on or after
         November 27, 2003 is a "High-Cost Home Loan" subject to the New Jersey
         Home Ownership Security Act of 2003 (N.J.S.A. 46:10B-22 et seq.); no
         Transferred Mortgage Loan is a "High-Cost Home Loan" subject to the New
         Mexico Home Loan Protection Act (N.M. Stat. Ann. ss.ss. 58-21A-1 et
         seq.);

              (xviii) No Transferred Mortgage Loan was at the time of
         origination subject to the Home Ownership and Equity Protection Act of
         1994 (15 U.S.C. ss. 1602(c)), Regulation Z (12 CFR 226.32) or any
         comparable state law;

              (xix) No Transferred Mortgage Loan is a High Cost Loan or Covered
         Loan, as applicable (as such terms are defined in the then current
         Standard & Poor's LEVELS(R) Glossary which is now Version 5.6 Revised,
         Appendix E) and no Transferred Mortgage Loan originated on or after
         October 1, 2002 through March 6, 2003 is governed by the Georgia Fair
         Lending Act; and

              (xx) No Transferred Mortgage Loan that is secured by property
         located in Illinois is in violation of the provisions of the Illinois
         Interest Act (815 Ill. Comp. Stat. 205/1 et seq.).

         (c) In addition to the representations and warranties set forth in
Section 1.04(b), all of which are also made by the Seller with respect to the
Bank Originated Mortgage Loans as of the Closing Date (or as of such other date
as is specified in particular representations and warranties), the Seller hereby
represents and warrants to the Depositor upon the delivery to the Depositor on
the Closing Date of any Bank Originated Mortgage Loans, but solely as to each
Bank Originated Mortgage Loan, that, as of the Closing Date:

              (i) With respect to any hazard insurance policy covering a Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan and the related Mortgaged Property, the Seller
         has not engaged in, and has no knowledge of the Bank's or the
         Mortgagor's having engaged in, any act or omission which would impair
         the coverage of any such policy, the benefits of the endorsement
         provided for therein, or the validity and binding effect of either,
         including without limitation, no unlawful fee, commission, kickback or
         other unlawful compensation or value of any kind has been or will be
         received, retained or realized by any attorney, firm or other person or
         entity, and no such unlawful items have been received, retained or
         realized by the Seller;

              (ii) Neither the Seller nor the Bank has waived the performance by
         the Mortgagor of any action, if the Mortgagor's failure to perform such
         action would cause a Bank Originated Mortgage Loan to be in default,
         nor has the Seller or the Bank waived any default resulting from any
         action or inaction by the Mortgagor;

              (iii) The terms of the Mortgage Note and Mortgage have not been
         impaired, waived, altered or modified in any respect, except by a
         written instrument which has been recorded, if necessary to protect the
         interests of the Depositor and which has been delivered to the
         Custodian;

              (iv) The Mortgaged Property relating to each Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan is a fee simple property located in the state identified
         in the Mortgage Loan Schedule and consists of a parcel of real property
         with a detached single family residence erected thereon, or a two- to
         four-family dwelling, or an individual condominium unit in a low-rise
         condominium project, or an individual unit in a planned unit
         development; provided, however, that any condominium project or planned
         unit development shall conform with the applicable FNMA and FHLMC
         requirements regarding such dwellings. No portion of the Mortgaged
         Property is used for commercial purposes;

              (v) The Mortgage Note and the Mortgage are genuine, and each is
         the legal, valid and binding obligation of the maker thereof
         enforceable in accordance with its terms. All parties to the Mortgage
         Note and the Mortgage and any other related agreement had legal
         capacity to enter into the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan and to execute
         and deliver the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage and any other related
         agreement, and the Mortgage Note and the Mortgage have been duly and
         properly executed by such parties. The documents, instruments and
         agreements submitted for loan underwriting were not falsified and
         contain no untrue statement of material fact or omit to state a
         material fact required to be stated therein or necessary to make the
         information and statements therein not misleading. To the best of the
         Seller's knowledge, no fraud


                                       10
<PAGE>

         was committed in connection with the origination of the Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan;

              (vi) Each Bank Originated Mortgage Loan has been closed and the
         proceeds of the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan have been fully disbursed
         and there is no requirement for future advances thereunder, and any and
         all requirements as to completion of any on-site or off-site
         improvement and as to disbursements of any escrow funds therefor have
         been complied with. All costs, fees and expenses incurred in making or
         closing the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan and the recording of the
         Mortgage were paid, and the Mortgagor is not entitled to any refund of
         any amounts paid or due under the Mortgage Note or Mortgage;

              (vii) There is no default, breach, violation or event of
         acceleration existing under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and no
         event which, with the passage of time or with notice and the expiration
         of any grace or cure period, would constitute a default, breach,
         violation or event of acceleration, and neither the Seller nor its
         predecessors has waived any default, breach, violation or event of
         acceleration;

              (viii) All improvements which were considered in determining the
         Appraised Value of the Mortgaged Property lay wholly within the
         boundaries and building restriction lines of the Mortgaged Property and
         no improvements on adjoining properties encroach upon the Mortgaged
         Property. No improvement located on or being part of the Mortgaged
         Property is in violation of any applicable zoning law or regulation;

              (ix) Each Mortgage contains customary and enforceable provisions
         which render the rights and remedies of the holder thereof adequate for
         the realization against the related Mortgaged Property of the benefits
         of the security, including (A) in the case of a Mortgage designated as
         a deed of trust, by trustee's sale, and (B) otherwise by judicial or
         non-judicial foreclosure. There is no homestead or other exemption
         available to the related Mortgagor which would materially interfere
         with the right to sell the Mortgaged Property at a trustee's sale or
         the right to foreclose the Mortgage subject to the applicable federal
         and state laws and judicial precedent with respect to bankruptcy and
         rights of redemption. Upon default by a Mortgagor on a Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan and foreclosure on, or trustee's sale of, the Mortgaged
         Property pursuant to the proper procedures, the holder of the Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan will be able to deliver good and merchantable
         title to the property;

              (x) The Mortgage Note is not and has not been secured by any
         collateral except the lien of the corresponding Mortgage and the
         security interest of any applicable security agreement or chattel
         mortgage;

              (xi) In the event the Mortgage constitutes a deed of trust, a
         trustee, duly qualified under applicable law to serve as such, has been
         properly designated and currently so serves and is named in the
         Mortgage, and no fees or expenses are or will become payable by the
         Depositor to the trustee under the deed of trust, except in connection
         with a trustee's sale after default by the Mortgagor;


                                       11
<PAGE>

              (xii) The Mortgage Note, the Mortgage, the Assignment of Mortgage
         and any other documents required to be delivered for the Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan by the Seller under this Agreement as set
         forth in Section 1.02 hereof have been delivered to the Custodian. The
         Seller is in possession of a complete, true and accurate Mortgage File
         in compliance with Section 1.02 hereof, except for such documents the
         originals of which have been delivered to the Custodian;

              (xiii) The Assignment of Mortgage is in recordable form and is
         acceptable for recording under the laws of the jurisdiction in which
         the Mortgaged Property is located;

              (xiv) The Mortgage contains an enforceable provision for the
         acceleration of the payment of the unpaid principal balance of a Bank
         Originated Mortgage Loan in the event that the Mortgaged Property is
         sold or transferred without the prior written consent of the Mortgagee
         thereunder;

              (xv) No Bank Originated Mortgage Loan contains provisions pursuant
         to which Monthly Payments are paid or partially paid with funds
         deposited in any separate account established by the Mortgagor or
         anyone on behalf of the Mortgagor, or paid by any source other than the
         Mortgagor, nor does any Bank Originated Mortgage Loan contain any other
         similar provisions currently in effect which may constitute a "buydown"
         provision. No Bank Originated Mortgage Loan is a graduated payment
         mortgage loan and no Bank Originated Mortgage Loan has a shared
         appreciation or other contingent interest feature;

              (xvi) Any future advances made prior to the Cut-off Date have been
         consolidated with the outstanding principal amount secured by the
         Mortgage, and the secured principal amount, as consolidated, bears a
         single interest rate and single repayment term. The lien of the
         Mortgage securing the consolidated principal amount is insured by a
         title insurance policy, an endorsement to the policy insuring the
         mortgagee's consolidated interest or by other title evidence acceptable
         to FNMA and FHLMC. The consolidated principal amount does not exceed
         the original principal amount of any Bank Originated Mortgage Loan;

              (xvii) The origination and collection practices used with respect
         to each Bank Originated Mortgage Loan have been in accordance with
         Accepted Servicing Practices, and have been in all respects in
         compliance with all applicable laws and regulations. With respect to
         escrow deposits and escrow payments, all such payments are in the
         possession of the Seller and there exist no deficiencies in connection
         therewith for which customary arrangements for repayment thereof have
         not been made. All escrow payments have been collected in full
         compliance with state and federal law. An escrow of funds is not
         prohibited by applicable law and has been established in an amount
         sufficient to pay for every item which remains unpaid and which has
         been assessed but is not yet due and payable. No escrow deposits or
         escrow payments or other charges or payments due the Seller have been
         capitalized under the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note. All Mortgage
         Interest Rate adjustments have been made in strict compliance with
         state and federal law and the terms of the related Mortgage Note. Any
         interest required to be paid pursuant to state and local law has been
         properly paid and credited;


                                       12
<PAGE>

              (xviii) The Mortgage File contains an appraisal of the related
         Mortgage Property signed prior to the approval of the Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan application by a qualified appraiser, who had no
         interest, direct or indirect in the Mortgaged Property or in any loan
         made on the security thereof; and whose compensation is not affected by
         the approval or disapproval of the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan, and
         the appraisal and appraiser both satisfy the requirements of Title XI
         of the Federal Institutions Reform, Recovery, and Enforcement Act of
         1989 and the regulations promulgated thereunder, all as in effect on
         the date the Bank Originated Mortgage Loan was originated;

              (xix) The Mortgaged Property is free from any and all toxic or
         hazardous substances and there exists no violation of any local, state
         or federal environmental law, rule or regulation. There is no pending
         action or proceeding directly involving any Mortgaged Property of which
         the Seller is aware in which compliance with any environmental law,
         rule or regulation is an issue; and to the best of the Seller's
         knowledge, nothing further remains to be done to satisfy in full all
         requirements of each such law, rule or regulation;

              (xx) The Bank Originated Mortgage Loan does not contain a
         provision permitting or requiring conversion to a fixed interest rate
         Mortgage Loan;

              (xxi) No Bank Originated Mortgage Loan was made in connection with
         (i) the construction or rehabilitation of a Mortgaged Property or (ii)
         facilitating the trade-in or exchange of a Mortgaged Property;

              (xxii) No action, inaction or event has occurred and no state of
         facts exists or has existed that has resulted or will result in the
         exclusion from, denial of, or defense to coverage under any applicable
         pool insurance policy, special hazard insurance policy, primary
         mortgage loan insurance policy or bankruptcy bond, irrespective of the
         cause of such failure of coverage. In connection with the placement of
         any such insurance, no commission, fee or other compensation has been
         or will be received by the Seller or any designee of the Seller or any
         corporation in which the Seller or any officer, director or employee
         had a financial interest at the time of placement of such insurance;

              (xxiii) Each original Mortgage was recorded and, except for those
         Bank Originated Mortgage Loans subject to the MERS identification
         system, all subsequent assignments of the original Mortgage (other than
         the assignment to the Depositor) have been recorded in the appropriate
         jurisdictions wherein such recordation is necessary to perfect the
         liens thereof as against creditors of the Seller, or are in the process
         of being recorded; and

              (xxiv) Any and all requirements of any federal, state or local
         law, including, without limitation, usury, truth in lending, real
         estate settlement procedures, consumer credit protection, equal credit
         opportunity or disclosure laws applicable to each Bank Originated
         Mortgage Loan have been complied with.

         (d) It is understood and agreed that the representations and warranties
set forth in Sections 1.04(b) and 1.04(c) herein shall survive the Closing Date.
Upon discovery by either the


                                       13

Seller or the Depositor of a breach of any of the foregoing representations and
warranties (excluding a breach of subparagraphs (xi) and (xvi) under Section
1.04(b)), that adversely and materially affects the value of the related
Mortgage Loan, that does not also constitute a breach of a representation or
warranty of a Transferor in the related Transfer Agreement, the party
discovering such breach shall give prompt written notice to the other party;
provided, however, notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, this
paragraph shall be specifically applicable to a breach by the Seller of the
representations made pursuant to subparagraphs (xi) and (xvi) under Section
1.04(b) irrespective of the Transferor's breach of a comparable representation
or warranty in the Transfer Agreement. Within 60 days of the discovery of any
such breach, the Seller shall either (a) cure such breach in all material
respects, (b) repurchase such Mortgage Loan or any property acquired in respect
thereof from the Depositor at the applicable Purchase Price or (c) within the
two-year period following the Closing Date substitute a Qualifying Substitute
Mortgage Loan for the affected Mortgage Loan.

         Section 1.05. Grant Clause. It is intended that the conveyance of the
Seller's right, title and interest in and to the Mortgage Loans and other
property conveyed pursuant to this Agreement on the Closing Date shall
constitute, and shall be construed as, a sale of such property and not a grant
of a security interest to secure a loan. However, if any such conveyance is
deemed to be in respect of a loan, it is intended that: (1) the rights and
obligations of the parties shall be established pursuant to the terms of this
Agreement; (2) the Seller hereby grants to the Depositor a first priority
security interest in all of the Seller's right, title and interest in, to and
under, whether now owned or hereafter acquired, the Mortgage Loans and other
property; and (3) this Agreement shall constitute a security agreement under
applicable law.

         Section 1.06. Assignment by Depositor. The Depositor shall have the
right, upon notice to but without the consent of the Seller, to assign, in whole
or in part, its interest under this Agreement with respect to the Mortgage Loans
to the Trustee, and the Trustee then shall succeed to all rights of the
Depositor under this Agreement. All references to the rights of the Depositor in
this Agreement shall be deemed to be for the benefit of and exercisable by its
assignee or designee, specifically including the Trustee.

                                   ARTICLE II

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

         Section 2.01. Binding Nature of Agreement; Assignment. This Agreement
shall be binding upon and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their
respective successors and permitted assigns.

         Section 2.02. Entire Agreement. This Agreement contains the entire
agreement and understanding among the parties hereto with respect to the subject
matter hereof, and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous agreements,
understandings, inducements and conditions, express or implied, oral or written,
of any nature whatsoever with respect to the subject matter hereof. The express
terms hereof control and supersede any course of performance and/or usage of the
trade inconsistent with any of the terms hereof.

         Section 2.03. Amendment. This Agreement may be amended from time to
time by the Seller and the Depositor, without notice to or the consent of any of
the Holders, (i) to cure any ambiguity, (ii) to cause the provisions herein to
conform to or be consistent with or in furtherance of the statements made with
respect to the Certificates, the Trust Fund, the Trust Agreement or this
Agreement in the Prospectus Supplement; or to correct or supplement any
provision herein which may be inconsistent with any other provisions herein,
(iii) to make any other provisions with respect to matters or questions arising
under this Agreement or (iv) to add, delete, or amend any provisions to the
extent necessary or desirable to comply with any requirements imposed by the
Code and the REMIC Provisions. No such amendment effected pursuant to clause
(iii) of the preceding sentence shall adversely affect in any material respect
the interests of any Holder. Any such amendment shall be deemed not to adversely
affect in any material respect any Holder, if the Trustee receives written
confirmation from each Rating Agency that such amendment will not cause such
Rating Agency to reduce the then current rating assigned to the Certificates, if
any (and any Opinion of Counsel requested by the Trustee in connection with any
such amendment may rely expressly on such confirmation as the basis therefor).

         (a) This Agreement may also be amended from time to time by the Seller
and the Depositor with the consent of the Holders of not less than 66-2/3% of
the Class Principal Amount or Class Notional Amount (or Percentage Interest) of
each Class of Certificates affected thereby for the purpose of adding any
provisions to or changing in any manner or eliminating any of the provisions of
this Agreement or of modifying in any manner the rights of the Holders;
provided, however, that no such amendment may (i) reduce in any manner the
amount of, or delay the timing of, payments received on Mortgage Loans which are
required to be distributed on any Certificate without the consent of the Holder
of such Certificate or (ii) reduce the aforesaid percentages of Class Principal
Amount or Class Notional Amount (or Percentage Interest) of Certificates of each
Class, the Holders of which are required to consent to any such amendment
without the consent of the Holders of 100% of the Class Principal Amount or
Class Notional Amount (or Percentage Interest) of each Class of Certificates
affected thereby. For purposes of this paragraph, references to "Holder" or
"Holders" shall be deemed to include, in the case of any Class of Book-Entry
Certificates, the related Certificate Owners.

         (b) It shall not be necessary for the consent of Holders under this
Section 2.03 to approve the particular form of any proposed amendment, but it
shall be sufficient if such consent shall approve the substance thereof. The
manner of obtaining such consents and of evidencing the authorization of the
execution thereof by Holders shall be subject to such reasonable regulations as
the Trustee may prescribe.

         Section 2.04. Governing Law. THIS AGREEMENT SHALL BE CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REFERENCE TO ITS
CONFLICT OF LAWS PROVISIONS (OTHER THAN SECTION 5-1401 OF THE GENERAL
OBLIGATIONS LAW), AND THE OBLIGATIONS, RIGHTS AND REMEDIES OF THE PARTIES
HEREUNDER SHALL BE DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH LAWS.

         Section 2.05. Severability of Provisions. If any one or more of the
covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this Agreement shall be for any
reason whatsoever held


                                       15

invalid, then such covenants, agreements, provisions or terms shall be deemed
severable from the remaining covenants, agreements, provisions or terms of this
Agreement and shall in no way affect the validity or enforceability of the other
provisions of this Agreement.

         Section 2.06. Indulgences; No Waivers. Neither the failure nor any
delay on the part of a party to exercise any right, remedy, power or privilege
under this Agreement shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or
partial exercise of any right, remedy, power or privilege preclude any other or
further exercise of the same or of any other right, remedy, power or privilege,
nor shall any waiver of any right, remedy, power or privilege with respect to
any occurrence be construed as a waiver of such right, remedy, power or
privilege with respect to any other occurrence. No waiver shall be effective
unless it is in writing and is signed by the party asserted to have granted such
waiver.

         Section 2.07. Headings Not to Affect Interpretation. The headings
contained in this Agreement are for convenience of reference only, and they
shall not be used in the interpretation hereof.

         Section 2.08. Benefits of Agreement. Nothing in this Agreement, express
or implied, shall give to any Person, other than the parties to this Agreement
and their successors hereunder, any benefit or any legal or equitable right,
power, remedy or claim under this Agreement.

         Section 2.09. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in one or
more counterparts, each of which shall be deemed to be an original, and all of
which together shall constitute one and the same instrument.
