                                    SERVICING

     Section 2.01 Seller to Act as Servicer. With respect to the Mortgage Loans
in each Mortgage Loan Package purchased by the Purchaser, from and after the
related Closing Date, the Seller, as an independent contractor, shall, from time
to time, service and administer the Mortgage Loans, during the related Interim
Period, by execution and delivery of (a) the related Acknowledgement Agreement,
in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 9, and (b) the related Assignment and
Assumption Agreement, in the form attached hereto as Exhibit 10, and shall have
full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things in connection
with such servicing and administration which the Seller may deem necessary or
desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and with Accepted
Servicing Practices.

     Consistent with the terms of this Agreement, the Seller may waive, modify
or vary any term of any Mortgage Loan or consent to the postponement of strict
compliance with


                                      -9-
<PAGE>

any such term or in any manner grant indulgence to any Mortgagor if in the
Seller's reasonable and prudent determination such waiver, modification,
postponement or indulgence is not materially adverse to the Purchaser, provided,
however, that unless the Seller has obtained the prior written consent of the
Purchaser, the Seller shall not permit any modification with respect to any
Mortgage Loan that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate, defer or forgive the
payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the outstanding principal
balance (except for actual payments of principal) or change the final maturity
date on such Mortgage Loan. In the event of any such modification which permits
the deferral of interest or principal payments on any Mortgage Loan, the Seller
shall, on the Business Day immediately preceding the Remittance Date in any
month in which any such principal or interest payment has been deferred, deposit
in the Custodial Account from its own funds, in accordance with Section 2.04,
the difference between (a) such month's principal and one month's interest at
the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate on the unpaid principal balance of such
Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by the Mortgagor. The Seller shall be
entitled to reimbursement for such advances to the same extent as for all other
advances made pursuant to Section 2.05 or upon the related Transfer Date.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Seller shall continue, and
is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of itself
and the Purchaser, all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of
partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with
respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If
reasonably required by the Seller, the Purchaser shall furnish the Seller with
any powers of attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable
the Seller to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this
Agreement.

     In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the Seller shall employ
procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise the same care that it
customarily employs and exercises in servicing and administering mortgage loans
for its own account, giving due consideration to Accepted Servicing Practices
where such practices do not conflict with the requirements of this Agreement,
and the Purchaser's reliance on the Seller.

     The Seller shall keep at its servicing office books and records in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Seller shall
note transfers of Mortgage Loans. No transfer of a Mortgage Loan may be made
unless such transfer is in compliance with the terms hereof. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the Seller shall be under no obligation to deal with any Person
with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans unless the Seller has been
notified of such transfers as provided in this Section 2.01. The Purchaser may
sell and transfer, in whole or in part, the Mortgage Loans, provided that no
such sale and transfer shall be binding upon Seller unless such transferee shall
agree in writing in the form of the Assignment and Assumption Agreement attached
hereto Exhibit 8, to be bound by the terms of this Agreement, and an executed
copy of the same shall have been delivered to the Seller. Upon receipt thereof,
the Seller shall mark its books and records to reflect the ownership of the
Mortgage Loans by such assignee, and the previous Purchaser shall be released
from its obligations hereunder. This Agreement shall be binding upon and inure
to the benefit of the Purchaser and Seller and their permitted successors,
assignees and designees.

     Section 2.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans. In the event that any payment
due under any Mortgage Loan and not postponed pursuant to Section 2.01 is not
paid when the same becomes due and payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails
to perform any other covenant or

                                      -10-
<PAGE>

obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period, the Seller shall take such action as (1) the Seller
would take under similar circumstances with respect to a similar mortgage loan
held for its own account for investment, (2) shall be consistent with Accepted
Servicing Practices, (3) the Seller shall determine prudently to be in the best
interest of Purchaser, and (4) is consistent with any related PMI Policy or LPMI
Policy. In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan is not
postponed pursuant to Section 2.01 and remains delinquent for a period of 90
days or any other default continues for a period of 90 days beyond the
expiration of any grace or cure period, the Seller shall commence foreclosure
proceedings, provided that, prior to commencing foreclosure proceedings, the
Seller shall notify the Purchaser in writing of the Seller's intention to do so,
and the Seller shall not commence foreclosure proceedings if the Purchaser
objects to such action within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice. In such
connection, the Seller shall from its own funds make all necessary and proper
Servicing Advances, provided, however, that the Seller shall not be required to
expend its own funds in connection with any foreclosure or towards the
restoration or preservation of any Mortgaged Property, unless it shall determine
(a) that such preservation, restoration and/or foreclosure will increase the
proceeds of liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Purchaser after reimbursement to
itself for such expenses and (b) that such expenses will be recoverable by it
either through Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall have priority for
purposes of withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 2.05) or
through Insurance Proceeds (respecting which it shall have similar priority).

     Section 2.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments. Continuously from the
date hereof until the related Transfer Date, the Seller shall proceed diligently
to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans when the same shall
become due and payable and shall take special care in ascertaining and
estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will become due and
payable with respect to the Mortgage Loans and each related Mortgaged Property,
to the end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be sufficient to
pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

     Section 2.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial Account. The Seller
shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to the
Mortgage Loans separate and apart from any of its own funds and general assets
and shall establish and maintain one or more Custodial Accounts, in the form of
time deposit or demand accounts, titled "First National Bank of Nevada in trust
for Purchasers of Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage Loans, Group
No. 2004-1 and various Mortgagors". The Custodial Account shall be established
with a Qualified Depository acceptable to the Purchaser. Any funds deposited in
the Custodial Account shall at all times be fully insured to the full extent
permitted under applicable law. Funds deposited in the Custodial Account may be
drawn on by the Seller in accordance with Section 2.05. The creation of any
Custodial Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit 2
hereto, in the case of an account established with the Seller, or by a letter
agreement in the form of Exhibit 3 hereto, in the case of an account held by a
depository other than the Seller. A copy of such certification or letter
agreement shall be furnished to the Purchaser and, upon request, to any
subsequent Purchaser.

     The Seller shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily basis, and
retain therein, the following collections received by the Seller after the
related Cut-off Date:

                                      -11-

     and Section 2.16;

     pursuant to Section 2.01, 2.10, 2.17, 4.01 or 4.02;

     Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement; and

          (viii) any amounts required to be deposited by the Seller pursuant to
     Section 2.12 in connection with the deductible clause in any blanket hazard
     insurance policy.

     The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial Account shall be
exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without limiting the generality
of the foregoing, payments in the nature of assumption fees, to the extent
permitted by Section 4.01, need not be deposited by the Seller into the
Custodial Account. Any interest paid on funds deposited in the Custodial Account
by the depository institution shall accrue to the benefit of the Seller and the
Seller shall be entitled to retain and withdraw such interest from the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 2.05.

     Section 2.05 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account. The Seller
shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the Custodial Account for the

     otherwise relating to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that,

                                      -12-
<PAGE>

     in the case of any such reimbursement, the Seller's right thereto shall be
     prior to the rights of the Purchaser except that, where the Seller is
     required to repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 4.02 of this
     Agreement, the Seller's right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to

          (iv) to pay itself interest on funds deposited in the Custodial

Remittance Date, the Seller shall withdraw all funds from the Custodial Account
except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 3.01, the Seller is not
obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Seller may use such withdrawn
funds only for the purposes described in this Section 2.05.

     Section 2.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account. The Seller
shall segregate and hold all funds collected and received pursuant to a Mortgage
Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and apart from any of its own funds

in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, titled, "First National Bank of
Nevada in trust for Purchasers of Residential Fixed and Adjustable Rate Mortgage
Loans, Group No. 2004-1 and various Mortgagors". The Escrow Accounts shall be
established with a Qualified Depository, in a manner which shall provide maximum
available insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow Account may be
drawn on by the Seller in accordance with Section 2.07. The creation of any
Escrow Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit 4

<PAGE>


entitled to retain any interest paid on funds deposited in the Escrow Account by
the depository institution, other than interest on escrowed funds required by
law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the extent required by law, the Seller shall
pay interest on escrowed funds to the Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow
Account may be non-interest bearing or that interest paid thereon is
insufficient for such purposes.

the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by the Seller only:

          (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes, assessments,

     the related Mortgage;

          (ii) to reimburse the Seller for any Servicing Advance made by the

     the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage Loan;

          (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

     Section 2.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges. With respect to
each Mortgage Loan, the Seller shall maintain accurate records reflecting the
status of ground rents, taxes, assessments, water rates, sewer rents, and other
charges which are or may become a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the
status of PMI Policy premiums and fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall
obtain, from time to time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including
renewal premiums) and shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable
penalty or termination date, employing for such purpose deposits of the
Mortgagor in the Escrow Account which shall have been estimated and accumulated
by the Seller in amounts sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the
terms of the Mortgage. To the extent that a Mortgage does not provide for Escrow
Payments, the Seller shall determine that any such payments are made by the
Mortgagor at the time they first become due. The Seller assumes full
responsibility for the timely payment of all such bills and shall effect timely
payment of all such charges irrespective of each


                                      -14-
<PAGE>

Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or the making of the
Escrow Payments, and the Seller shall make advances from its own funds to effect
such payments.

     Section 2.09 PMI and LPMI Obligations. The Seller shall comply with all
provisions of applicable state and federal law relating to the cancellation of,
or collection of premiums with respect to, PMI Policies and LPMI Policies,
including, but not limited to, the provisions of the Homeowners Protection Act
of 1998, and all regulations promulgated thereunder, as amended from time to
time. The Seller shall be obligated to make premium payments with respect to (a)
LPMI Policies, and (b) if the Mortgagor fails to pay any PMI Policy premium,
such PMI Policy.

     Section 2.10 Protection of Accounts. The Seller may transfer the Custodial
Account or the Escrow Account to a different Qualified Depository from time to
time. Such transfer shall be made only upon obtaining the consent of the
Purchaser, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.

     The Seller shall bear any expenses, losses or damages sustained by the
Purchaser because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow Account are not demand
deposit accounts.

     Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow Account may at
the option of the Seller be invested in Eligible Investments; provided that in
the event that amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account
exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the "Insured Amount") the Seller
shall be obligated to invest the excess amount over the Insured Amount in
Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such excess amount becomes
present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account. Any such Eligible
Investment shall mature no later than the Determination Date next following the
date of such Eligible Investment, provided, however, that if such Eligible
Investment is an obligation of a Qualified Depository (other than the Seller)
that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such Eligible
Investment may mature on such Remittance Date. Any such Eligible Investment
shall be made in the name of the Seller in trust for the benefit of the
Purchaser. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Seller and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Seller. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Seller out of its own
funds immediately as realized.

     Section 2.11 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance. The Seller shall cause to be
maintained for each Mortgage Loan, hazard insurance such that all buildings upon
the Mortgaged Property are insured by a generally acceptable insurer rated A:VI
or better in the current Best's Key Rating Guide ("Best's") against loss by
fire, hazards of extended coverage and such other hazards as are customary in
the area where the Mortgaged Property is located, in an amount which is at least
equal to the lesser of (i) the maximum insurable value of the improvements
securing such Mortgage Loan and (ii) the greater of (a) the outstanding
principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and (b) an amount such that the proceeds
thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the Mortgagor or the loss payee from
becoming a co-insurer.

     If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related Mortgaged Property

Agency as having special flood hazards (and such flood insurance has
been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the requirements of the
current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration is in effect with a
generally acceptable insurance carrier rated A:VI or better in Best's in an
amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the minimum amount
required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any damage or loss on a
replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the mortgage if replacement
cost coverage is not available for the type of building insured) and (ii) the
maximum amount of insurance which is available under the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the term of the
Mortgage Loan, the Seller determines in accordance with applicable law and
Accepted Servicing Practices that a Mortgaged Property is located in a special
flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is covered in an
amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster Protection Act of
1973, as amended, the Seller shall notify the related Mortgagor that the
Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if said Mortgagor fails
to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within forty-five (45) days
after such notification, the Seller shall immediately force place the required
flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

     If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project, the Seller
shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association, including
hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained in
accordance with then current Accepted Servicing Practices, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Seller promptly of any change in
the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have a
material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.

     The Seller shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged Property
earthquake or such other or additional insurance as may be required pursuant to
such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in force and as
shall require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the requirements of any
private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to conform with
Accepted Servicing Practices.

     In the event that any Purchaser or the Seller shall determine that the
Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards and risks
not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the Mortgagor pursuant
to the terms of the Mortgage, the Seller shall, in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices, provide notice of such to the Mortgagor.

     All policies required hereunder shall name the Seller as loss
payee and shall be endorsed with standard or New York mortgagee clauses, without
contribution, which shall provide for at least 30 days prior written notice of
any cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage.

     The Seller shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom of choice in
selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however, that the
Seller shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance companies
unless such companies are rated A:VI or better in Best's and are licensed to do
business in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is located. The
Seller shall determine that such policies provide sufficient risk coverage and
amounts, that they insure the property owner, and that they properly describe
the property

                                      -16-

address. The Seller shall furnish to the Mortgagor a formal notice of expiration
of any such insurance in sufficient time for the Mortgagor to arrange for
renewal coverage by the expiration date.

     Pursuant to Section 2.04, any amounts collected by the Seller under any
such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the Escrow Account and
applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged Property, or
property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be released to the
Mortgagor, in accordance with the Seller's normal servicing procedures as
specified in Section 2.15) shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject
to withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.05.

     Section 2.12 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance. In the event
that the Seller shall obtain and maintain a blanket policy insuring against
losses arising from fire and hazards covered under extended coverage on all of
the Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an
amount equal to the amount required pursuant to Section 2.11 and otherwise
complies with all other requirements of Section 2.11, it shall conclusively be
deemed to have satisfied its obligations as set forth in Section 2.11. Any
amounts collected by the Seller under any such policy relating to a Mortgage
Loan shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject to withdrawal pursuant
to Section 2.05. Such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in
the event that there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged
Property a policy complying with Section 2.11, and there shall have been a loss
which would have been covered by such policy, the Seller shall deposit in the
Custodial Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable
under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to be
deposited from the Seller's funds, without reimbursement therefor. Upon request
of the Purchaser, the Seller shall cause to be delivered to the Purchaser a
certified true copy of such policy and a statement from the insurer thereunder
that such policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without
30 days' prior written notice to the Purchaser.

     Section 2.13 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance. The Seller shall maintain with responsible companies, at its own
expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy,
with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting in any
capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or papers
relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Seller Employees"). Any such Fidelity Bond and
Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the Mortgage
Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Seller against losses,
including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Seller Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the Seller against
losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No
provision of this Section 2.13 requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Seller from its duties
and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage under any
such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal [$5,000,000]. Upon the
request of the Purchaser, the Seller shall cause to be delivered to the
Purchaser a certified true copy of such fidelity bond and insurance policy and a
statement from the surety and the insurer that such fidelity bond and insurance
policy shall in no event be terminated or materially modified without 30 days'
prior written notice to the Purchaser.


                                      -17-

     Section 2.14 Inspections. The Seller shall inspect the Mortgaged Property
as often as deemed necessary by the Seller to assure itself that the value of
the Mortgaged Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage Loan is
more than 60 days delinquent, the Seller immediately shall inspect the Mortgaged
Property and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices or as may be required by the primary mortgage guaranty
insurer. The Seller shall keep a written report of each such inspection.

     Section 2.15 Restoration of Mortgaged Property. The Seller need not obtain
the approval of the Purchaser prior to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds to the Mortgagor to be applied to the restoration or
repair of the Mortgaged Property if such release is in accordance with Accepted
Servicing Practices. At a minimum, the Seller shall comply with the following
conditions in connection with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds:

          (i) the Seller shall receive satisfactory independent verification of
     completion of repairs and issuance of any required approvals with respect
     thereto;

          (ii) the Seller shall take all steps necessary to preserve the
     priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not limited to
     requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and materialmen's liens;

          (iii) the Seller shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is not in
     default; and

          (iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Seller shall place the
     Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow Account.

     If the Purchaser is named as an additional loss payee, the Seller is hereby
empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such a claim in the
name of the Purchaser.

     Section 2.16 Maintenance of PMI Policy and/or LPMI Policy; Claims. With
respect to each Mortgage Loan with a LTV in excess of 80%, the Seller shall:

          (i) with respect to Mortgage Loans which are not LPMI Loans, without
     any cost to the Owner, maintain or cause the Mortgagor to maintain in full
     force and effect a PMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan in
     excess of 75% (or such other percentage as stated in the related
     Acknowledgment Agreement) of value, and shall pay or shall cause the
     Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a timely basis, until the LTV of
     such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In the event that such PMI Policy
     shall be terminated, the Seller shall obtain from another Qualified Insurer
     a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage equal to the
     remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy, at substantially the same
     fee level. If the insurer shall cease to be a Qualified Insurer, the Seller
     shall determine whether recoveries under the PMI Policy are jeopardized for
     reasons related to the financial condition of such insurer, it being
     understood that the Seller shall in no event have any responsibility or
     liability for any failure to recover under the PMI Policy for such reason.
     If the Seller determines that recoveries are so jeopardized, it shall
     notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor, if required, and obtain from
     another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance policy. The Seller


                                      -18-
<PAGE>



     shall not take any action which would result in noncoverage under any
     applicable PMI Policy of any loss which, but for the actions of the Seller
     would have been covered thereunder. In connection with any assumption or
     substitution agreement entered into or to be entered into pursuant to
     Section 4.01, the Seller shall promptly notify the insurer under the
     related PMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution of liability
     in accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy and shall take all actions
     which may be required by such insurer as a condition to the continuation of
     coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI Policy is terminated as a
     result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the Seller shall
     obtain a replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

          (ii) with respect to LPMI Loans, maintain in full force and effect an
     LPMI Policy insuring that portion of the Mortgage Loan in excess of 75% (or
     such other percentage as stated in the related Acknowledgment Agreement) of
     value, and from time to time, withdraw the LPMI Fee with respect to such
     LPMI Loan from the Custodial Account in order to pay the premium thereon on
     a timely basis, until the LTV of such Mortgage Loan is reduced to 80%. In
     the event that the interest payments made with respect to any LPMI Loan are
     less than the LPMI Fee, the Seller shall advance from its own funds the
     amount of any such shortfall in the LPMI Fee, in payment of the premium on
     the related LPMI Policy. Any such advance shall be a Servicing Advance
     subject to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions on Section 2.05. In the
     event that such LPMI Policy shall be terminated, the Seller shall obtain
     from another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a
     total coverage equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated LPMI
     Policy, at substantially the same fee level. If the insurer shall cease to
     be a Qualified Insurer, the Seller shall determine whether recoveries under
     the LPMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial
     condition of such insurer, it being understood that the Seller shall in no
     event have any responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under
     the LPMI Policy for such reason. If the Seller determines that recoveries
     are so jeopardized, it shall notify the Purchaser and the Mortgagor, if
     required, and obtain from another Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance
     policy. The Seller shall not take any action which would result in
     noncoverage under any applicable LPMI Policy of any loss which, but for the
     actions of the Seller would have been covered thereunder. In connection
     with any assumption or substitution agreement entered into or to be entered
     into pursuant to Section 4.01, the Seller shall promptly notify the insurer
     under the related LPMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or substitution
     of liability in accordance with the terms of such LPMI Policy and shall
     take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to
     the continuation of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such LPMI Policy is
     terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the
     Seller shall obtain a replacement LPMI Policy as provided above.

     In connection with its activities as servicer, the Seller agrees to prepare
and present, on behalf of itself and the Owner, claims to the insurer under any
PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in accordance with the terms of
such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard, to take such action as shall
be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy respecting a
defaulted Mortgage Loan. Pursuant to Section 3.04, any amounts collected by the
Seller under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account, subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 2.05.

     Section 2.17 Title, Management and Disposition of REO Property. In the
event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired in foreclosure or by deed
in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of sale shall be taken in the
name of the Purchaser, or in the event the Purchaser is not authorized or
permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the REO Property is
located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing business" or tax laws
of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate of sale shall be
taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be consistent with an
Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Seller from any attorney duly licensed to
practice law in the state where the REO Property is located. The Person or
Persons holding such title other than the Purchaser shall acknowledge in writing
that such title is being held as nominee for the Purchaser.

     The Seller shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each REO Property
for the Purchaser solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and sale. The
Seller, either itself or through an agent selected by the Seller, shall manage,
conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner that it
manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for its own
account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same locality as
the REO Property is managed. The Seller shall attempt to sell the same (and may
temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than one year, except as
otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as the Seller deems to be
in the best interest of the Purchaser.

     The Seller shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO Property as
soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event within one year
after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless the Seller determines,
and gives an appropriate notice to the Purchaser to such effect, that a longer
period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of such REO Property. If a
period longer than one year is permitted under the foregoing sentence and is
necessary to sell any REO Property, (i) the Seller shall report monthly to the
Purchaser as to the progress being made in selling such REO Property and (ii)
if, with the written consent of the Purchaser, a purchase money mortgage is
taken in connection with such sale, such purchase money mortgage shall name the
Seller as mortgagee, and such purchase money mortgage shall not be held pursuant
to this Agreement, but instead a separate participation agreement among the
Seller and Purchaser shall be entered into with respect to such purchase money
mortgage.

     The Seller shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and hazard
insurance with extended coverage in an amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.

     The disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
Seller at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Seller deems to
be in the best interests of the Purchaser. The proceeds of sale of the REO
Property shall be promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as
practical thereafter the expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Seller
shall reimburse itself for any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid
Servicing Fees and unreimbursed advances made pursuant to this Section, and on
the Remittance Date immediately following the Principal Prepayment Period in
which such sale proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such sale
remaining in the Custodial Account shall be distributed to the Purchaser.

                                      -20-
<PAGE>


     With respect to each REO Property, the Seller shall hold all funds
collected and received in connection with the operation of the REO Property in
the Custodial Account. The Seller shall cause to be deposited on a daily basis
upon the receipt thereof in each Custodial Account all revenues received with
respect to the conservation and disposition of the related REO Property.

     Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to time, the
Purchaser may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to one or
more REO Properties as provided by Section 6.03(c).

     Section 2.18 Permitted Withdrawals with respect to REO Property. The Seller
shall withdraw REO funds on deposit in the Custodial Account with respect to
each related REO Property necessary for the proper operation, management and
maintenance of the REO Property, including the cost of maintaining any hazard
insurance pursuant to Section 2.11 and the fees of any managing agent acting on
behalf of the Seller. The Seller shall make monthly distributions on each
Remittance Date to the Purchaser of the net cash flow from the REO Property
(which shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses
described in Section 2.17 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to
time to be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

     Section 2.19 Real Estate Owned Reports. Together with the statement
furnished pursuant to Section 2.20, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser on
or before the 15th day of each month a statement with respect to any REO
Property covering the operation of such REO Property for the previous month and
the Seller's efforts in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any
rental of such REO Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous
month. That statement shall be accompanied by such other information as the
Purchaser shall reasonably request.

     Section 2.20 Liquidation Reports. Upon the foreclosure sale of any
Mortgaged Property or the acquisition thereof by the Purchaser pursuant to a
deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Seller shall submit to the Purchaser a
liquidation report with respect to such Mortgaged Property.

     Section 2.21 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of Mortgaged
Property. Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Seller shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.

                                  ARTICLE III

                              PAYMENTS TO PURCHASER

     Section 3.01 Remittances. On each Remittance Date the Seller shall remit by
wire transfer of immediately available funds to the Purchaser (a) all amounts
deposited in the Custodial Account as of the close of business on the
Determination Date (net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 2.05), plus (b) all amounts, if any, which the
Seller is obligated to distribute pursuant to Section 2.03.

     With respect to any remittance received by the Purchaser after the second
Business Day following the Business Day on which such payment was due, the
Seller shall pay


                                      -21-
<PAGE>

to the Purchaser interest on any such late payment at an annual rate equal to
the Prime Rate, adjusted as of the date of each change, plus three percentage
points, but in no event greater than the maximum amount permitted by applicable
law. Such interest shall be deposited in the Custodial Account by the Seller on
the date such late payment is made and shall cover the period commencing with
the day following such second Business Day and ending with the Business Day on
which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such interest shall be remitted
along with the distribution payable on the next succeeding Remittance Date. The
payment by the Seller of any such interest shall not be deemed an extension of
time for payment or a waiver of any Event of Default by the Seller.

     Section 3.02 Statements to Purchaser. Not later than the fifth Business Day
of each month, the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser a Monthly Remittance
Advice, with a trial balance report attached thereto, in the form of Exhibit 1
annexed hereto in hard copy and electronic medium mutually acceptable to the
parties as to the preceding remittance and the period ending on the preceding
Determination Date.

     In addition, not more than 60 days after the end of each calendar year, the
Seller shall furnish to each Person who was a Purchaser at any time during such
calendar year an annual statement in accordance with the requirements of
applicable federal income tax law as to the aggregate of remittances for the
applicable portion of such year.

     Such obligation of the Seller shall be deemed to have been satisfied to the
extent that substantially comparable information shall be provided by the Seller
pursuant to any requirements of the Internal Revenue Code as from time to time
are in force.

     The Seller shall prepare and file any and all tax returns, information
statements or other filings required to be delivered to any governmental taxing
authority or to the Purchaser pursuant to any applicable law with respect to the
Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated hereby. In addition, the Seller
shall provide the Purchaser with such information concerning the Mortgage Loans
as is necessary for the Purchaser to prepare its federal income tax return as
the Purchaser may reasonably request from time to time.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

     Section 4.01 Transfers of Mortgaged Property. The Seller shall use its best
efforts to enforce any "due-on-sale" provision contained in any Mortgage or
Mortgage Note and to deny assumption by the person to whom the Mortgaged
Property has been or is about to be sold whether by absolute conveyance or by
contract of sale, and whether or not the Mortgagor remains liable on the
Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by
the Mortgagor, the Seller shall, to the extent it has knowledge of such
conveyance, exercise its rights to accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan
under the "due-on-sale" clause applicable thereto, provided, however, that the
Seller shall not exercise such rights if prohibited by law from doing so or if
the exercise of such rights would impair or threaten to impair any recovery
under the related PMI Policy or LPMI Policy, if any.


                                      -22-
<PAGE>

     If the Seller reasonably believes it is unable under applicable law to
enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Seller shall enter into (i) an assumption
and modification agreement with the person to whom such property has been
conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under the Mortgage Note
and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in the event the
Seller is unable under applicable law to require that the original Mortgagor
remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Seller has the prior consent of
the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of liability agreement
with the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to which the original
Mortgagor is released from liability and the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property
is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the Mortgage Note. If an
assumption fee is collected by the Seller for entering into an assumption
agreement, a portion of such fee, up to an amount equal to one-half of one
percent (0.5%) of the outstanding principal balance of the related Mortgage
Loan, will be retained by the Seller as additional servicing compensation, and
any portion thereof in excess of one-half of one percent (0.5%) shall be
deposited in the Custodial Account for the benefit of the Purchaser. In
connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne by
the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

     To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the Seller shall inquire
diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed transferee, and shall use
the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of the proposed transferee
which are used by the Seller with respect to underwriting mortgage loans of the
same type as the Mortgage Loans. If the credit of the proposed transferee does
not meet such underwriting criteria, the Seller diligently shall, to the extent
permitted by the Mortgage or the Mortgage Note and by applicable law, accelerate
the maturity of the Mortgage Loan.

     Section 4.02 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage Files. Upon
the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt by the Seller of a
notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a manner customary for
such purposes, the Seller shall notify the Purchaser in the Monthly Remittance
Advice as provided in Section 3.02, and may request the release of any Mortgage
Loan Documents from the Purchaser in accordance with this Section 4.02 hereof.

     If the Seller satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first having
obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or should
the Seller otherwise prejudice any rights the Purchaser may have under the
mortgage instruments, upon written demand of the Purchaser, the Seller shall
repurchase the related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price by deposit thereof
in the Custodial Account within 2 Business Days of receipt of such demand by the
Purchaser. The Seller shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors and Omissions
Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 2.13 insuring the Seller against any
loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not satisfied in
accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

     Section 4.03 Servicing Compensation. As consideration for servicing the
Mortgage Loans during the Interim Period, the Seller shall retain a Servicing
Fee with respect to each Mortgage Loan, which amount shall be prorated for any
portion of a month during which the Mortgage Loan is serviced by the Seller
pursuant to this Agreement. The obligation of the

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

Purchaser to pay the Servicing Fee is limited to, and the Servicing Fee is
payable solely from, the interest portion (including recoveries with respect to
interest from Liquidation Proceeds, to the extent permitted by Section 2.05) of
such Monthly Payment collected by the Seller, or as otherwise provided under
Section 2.05.

     Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption fees, to the
extent provided in Section 4.01 and Ancillary Income, shall be retained by the
Seller to the extent not required to be deposited in the Custodial Account. The
Seller shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with
its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement
thereof except as specifically provided for herein.

     Section 4.04 Annual Statement as to Compliance. The Seller shall deliver to
the Purchaser, on or before March 31 each year beginning March 31, 2005, and on
the Transfer Date an Officer's Certificate, stating that (i) a review of the
activities of the Seller during the preceding calendar year and of performance
under this Agreement has been made under such officer's supervision, and (ii)
the Seller has complied fully with the provisions of Article II and Article IV,
and (iii) to the best of such officer's knowledge, based on such review, the
Seller has fulfilled all its obligations under this Agreement throughout such
year, or, if there has been a default in the fulfillment of any such obligation,
specifying each such default known to such officer and the nature and status
thereof and the action being taken by the Seller to cure such default.

     Section 4.05 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing Report. On or
before March 31st of each year beginning March 31, 2005, the Seller, at its
expense, shall cause a firm of independent public accountants which is a member
of the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants to furnish a statement
to each Purchaser to the effect that such firm has examined certain documents
and records relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans and this Agreement
and that such firm is of the opinion that the provisions of Article II and
Article III have been complied with, and that, on the basis of such examination
conducted substantially in compliance with the Single Audit Program for Mortgage
Bankers, nothing has come to their attention which would indicate that such
servicing has not been conducted in compliance therewith, except for (i) such
exceptions as such firm shall believe to be immaterial, and (ii) such other
exceptions as shall be set forth in such statement.

     Section 4.06 Right to Examine Seller Records. The Purchaser shall have the
right to examine and audit any and all of the books, records, or other
information of the Seller, whether held by the Seller or by another on its
behalf, with respect to or concerning this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans,
during business hours or at such other times as may be reasonable under
applicable circumstances, upon reasonable advance notice.

                                   ARTICLE V

                               SELLER TO COOPERATE

     Section 5.01 Provision of Information. During the term of this Agreement,
the Seller shall furnish to the Purchaser such periodic, special, or other

                                   TERMINATION

     Section 6.01 Damages. The Purchaser shall have the right at any time to
seek and recover from the Seller any damages or losses suffered by it as a
result of any failure by the Seller to observe or perform any duties,
obligations, covenants or agreements herein contained or contained in the
Purchase Agreement.

     Section 6.02 Termination Upon Transfer of Servicing.

     (a) Termination Procedures. This Agreement shall terminate with respect to
the Mortgage Loans or portion thereof transferred on the related Transfer Date
set forth in the related Terms Letter; provided that the Purchaser shall have
the option to extend the related Transfer Date for 2 months from the original
related Transfer Date upon written notice to the Seller at least 15 days prior
to the related Transfer Date of its intent to extend the related Transfer Date
for 2 months.

     The Purchaser may elect to terminate this Agreement and transfer the
servicing from the Seller prior to the Transfer Date with respect to all or any
portion of the Mortgage Loans by providing written notice to the Seller of its
intent to transfer servicing at least 30 days prior to the date on which it
intends to transfer the servicing from the Seller. On or before the

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

date specified by the Purchaser in accordance with this paragraph (a) for the
transfer of servicing from the Seller, the Seller shall prepare, execute and
deliver to the successor entity designated by the Purchaser any and all
documents and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
Mortgage Loan Documents necessary or appropriate to effect the purposes of such
notice of termination, including but not limited to the transfer and endorsement
or assignment of the Mortgage Loans and related documents, at the Seller's sole
expense. The Seller shall cooperate with the Purchaser and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Seller's responsibilities and rights hereunder.

     Section 6.03 Servicing Transfer Provisions. On or prior to the related
Transfer Date the Seller shall, at its sole cost and expense take such steps as
may be necessary or appropriate to effectuate and evidence the transfer of the
servicing of the Mortgage Loans to the Purchaser, or its designee, including but
not limited to the following:

     On the Transfer Date, the Seller shall comply with all of the provisions of
Section 14 of the Purchase Agreement to effect a complete transfer of the
Servicing Rights. On the related Transfer Date for each Mortgage Loan, this
Agreement, except for Articles VI, VIII, IX and X which shall survive the
Transfer Date, shall terminate.

     (a) Mortgage Loans in Foreclosure. The servicing with respect to Mortgage
Loans in foreclosure on or before the Transfer Date shall not be transferred
from the Seller to the Purchaser or the successor servicer, as the case may be,
and such Mortgage Loans shall continue to be serviced by the Seller pursuant to
the terms of this Agreement. However, if the Purchaser so elects, the Purchaser
may waive the provisions of this paragraph (a) and accept transfer of servicing
of such Mortgage Loans and all amounts received by the Seller thereunder.

     (b) Servicing Advances. Notwithstanding the fact that the Transfer Date has
occurred, the Seller shall not be reimbursed for any Servicing Advances with
respect to any Mortgage Loan until the Seller or the successor servicer receives
a Monthly Payment or Liquidation Proceeds with respect to such Mortgage Loan. At
such time, the Seller shall be entitled to be reimbursed for all unreimbursed
Servicing Advances with respect to such Mortgage Loan on a first priority basis
(but subject to any successor servicer's rights to reimbursement with respect to
Servicing Advances) from the Monthly Payment or Liquidation Proceeds received
with respect to such Mortgage Loan. This Section 6.03(b) shall survive the
Transfer Date.

     (c) Additional Termination Provisions. Notwithstanding and in addition to
the foregoing, in the event that (i) a Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a
period of 120 days or more (a "Delinquent Mortgage Loan") or (ii) a Mortgage
Loan becomes an REO Property, the Purchaser may at its election terminate this
Agreement with respect to such Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property, upon 15
days' written notice to the Seller.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                                BOOKS AND RECORDS

     Section 7.01 Possession of Servicing Files Prior to the Transfer Date.
Prior to the Transfer Date, the contents of each Servicing File are and shall be
held in trust by the Seller for the benefit of the Purchaser as the owner
thereof. The Seller shall maintain in the Servicing File a copy of the contents
of each Mortgage File and the originals of the documents in each Mortgage File
not delivered to the Purchaser. The possession of the Servicing File by the
Seller is at the will of the Purchaser for the sole purpose of servicing the
related Mortgage Loan, pursuant to this Agreement, and such retention and
possession by the Seller is in its capacity as Seller only and at the election
of the Purchaser. The Seller shall release its custody of the contents of any
Servicing File only in accordance with written instructions from the Purchaser,
unless such release is required as incidental to the Seller's servicing of the
Mortgage Loans pursuant to this Agreement or is in connection with a repurchase
of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 7 of the Purchase Agreement.

     The Seller shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall maintain, a
complete set of books and records for each Mortgage Loan which shall be marked
clearly to reflect the ownership of each Mortgage Loan by the Purchaser. In
particular, the Seller shall maintain in its possession, available for
inspection by the Purchaser or its designee, and shall deliver to the Purchaser
or its designee upon demand, evidence of compliance with all federal, state and
local laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to documentation as
to the method used in determining the applicability of the provisions of the
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, to the Mortgaged Property,
documentation evidencing insurance coverage and eligibility of any condominium
project for approval by Fannie Mae and periodic inspection reports as required
by Section 2.14.

     The Seller shall keep at its servicing office books and records in which,
subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe, the Seller shall
note transfers of Mortgage Loans. No transfer of a Mortgage Loan may be made
unless such transfer is in compliance with the terms hereof. For the purposes of
this Agreement, the Seller shall be under no obligation to deal with any person
with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans unless the books and
records show such person as the owner of the Mortgage Loan. The Purchaser may,
subject to the terms of this Agreement, sell or transfer one or more of the
Mortgage Loans, provided, however, that the transferee will not be deemed to be
a Purchaser hereunder binding upon the Seller unless such transferee shall agree
in writing to be bound by the terms of this Agreement and an original
counterpart of the instrument of transfer and an assignment and assumption of
this Agreement executed by the transferee shall have been delivered to the
Seller. The Purchaser also shall advise the Seller of the transfer. Upon receipt
of notice of the transfer, the Seller shall mark its books and records to
reflect the ownership of the Mortgage Loans of such assignee, and shall release
the previous Purchaser from its obligations hereunder with respect to the
Mortgage Loans sold or transferred.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                         INDEMNIFICATION AND ASSIGNMENT

     Section 8.01 Indemnification. The Seller shall indemnify the Purchaser and
hold it harmless against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines,
and forfeitures, including, but not limited to reasonable and necessary legal
fees and related costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that
the Purchaser may sustain in any way related to the failure of the Seller to (a)
perform its duties and service the Mortgage Loans in strict compliance with the
terms of this Agreement, and/or (b) comply with applicable law. The Seller
immediately shall notify the Purchaser if a claim is made by a third party with
respect to this Agreement, assume (with the prior written consent of the
Purchaser) the defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection
therewith, including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any
judgment or decree which may be entered against it or the Purchaser in respect
of such claim. The Seller shall follow any written instructions received from
the Purchaser in connection with such claim. The Purchaser promptly shall
reimburse the Seller for all amounts advanced by it pursuant to the preceding
sentence except when the claim is in any way related to the Seller's
indemnification pursuant to Section 8 of the Purchase Agreement, or the failure
of the Seller to (a) service and administer the Mortgage Loans in strict
compliance with the terms of this Agreement and/or (b) comply with applicable
law.

     Section 8.02 Limitation on Liability of Seller and Others. Neither the
Seller nor any of the directors, officers, employees or agents of the Seller
shall be under any liability to the Purchaser for any action taken or for
refraining from the taking of any action in good faith pursuant to this
Agreement, or for errors in judgment, provided, however, that this provision
shall not protect the Seller or any such person against any breach of warranties
or representations made herein, or failure to perform its obligations in strict
compliance with any standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Seller and any director, officer, employee
or agent of the Seller may rely in good faith on any document of any kind prima
facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any matters
arising hereunder. The Seller shall not be under any obligation to appear in,
prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to its duties to
service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which in its
opinion may involve it in any expense or liability, provided, however, that the
Seller may, with the consent of the Purchaser, undertake any such action which
it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement and the rights
and duties of the parties hereto. In such event, the Seller shall be entitled to
reimbursement from the Purchaser of the reasonable legal expenses and costs of
such action.

     Section 8.03 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by Seller. The
Purchaser has entered into this Agreement with the Seller and subsequent
Purchasers will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the independent
status of the Seller, and the representations as to the adequacy of its
servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and procedures, its integrity,
reputation and financial standing, and the continuance thereof. Therefore, the
Seller shall neither assign this Agreement or the servicing hereunder or
delegate its rights or duties hereunder or any portion hereof or sell or
otherwise dispose of all or


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

substantially all of its property or assets without the prior written consent of
the Purchaser, which consent shall be granted or withheld in the sole discretion
of the Purchaser.

     The Seller shall not resign from the obligations and duties hereby imposed
on it except by mutual consent of the Seller and the Purchaser or upon the
determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Seller. Any such
determination permitting the resignation of the Seller shall be evidenced by an
Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Purchaser which Opinion of
Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Purchaser. No such
resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the
Seller's responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in
Section 6.03.

     Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section 8.03, in the
event that the Seller either shall assign this Agreement or the servicing
responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any portion
thereof or sell or, subject to the provisions of the following paragraph,
otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets, without
the prior written consent of the Purchaser, then the Purchaser shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set forth in Section
6.03, without any payment of any penalty or damages and without any liability
whatsoever to the Seller or any third party.

     Any Person into which the Seller may be merged or consolidated, or any
corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or consolidation to which the
Seller shall be a party, or any Person succeeding to the business of the Seller,
shall be the successor of the Seller hereunder, without the execution or filing
of any paper or any further act on the part of any of the parties hereto,
anything herein to the contrary notwithstanding; provided, however, that the
successor or surviving Person shall be an institution whose deposits are insured
by FDIC or a company whose business is the origination and servicing of mortgage
loans and shall satisfy any requirements of this Agreement with respect to the
qualifications of a successor to the Seller; provided however, that the
successor or surviving Person shall have a net worth of at least $25,000,000.

     Section 8.04 Assignment by Purchaser. The Purchaser shall have the right,
without the consent of the Seller, to assign, in whole or in part, its interest
under this Agreement with respect to some or all of the Mortgage Loans, and
designate any person to exercise any rights of the Purchaser hereunder, by
executing an Assignment and Assumption Agreement in the form of Exhibit 8
hereto. Upon such assignment of rights and assumption of obligations, the
assignee or designee shall accede to the rights and obligations hereunder of the
Purchaser with respect to such Mortgage Loans and the Purchaser as assignor
shall be released from all obligations hereunder with respect to such Mortgage
Loans from and after the date of such assignment and assumption. All references
to the Purchaser in this Agreement shall be deemed to include its assignee or
designee.

identify the recorded document, (ii) state that the recorded document has not
been delivered to the Custodian due solely to a delay caused by the public
