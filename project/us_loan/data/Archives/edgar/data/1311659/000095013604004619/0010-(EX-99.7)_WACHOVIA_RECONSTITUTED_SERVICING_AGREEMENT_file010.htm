         WHEREAS, on or prior to the Closing Date (as defined herein), the Bank
and LBH will enter into an Assignment and Assumption Agreement, dated as of

Flow Agreement relates to the Mortgage Loans;

         WHEREAS, on the Closing Date, LBH will convey the Mortgage Loans to

agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

         1. Acknowledgement of Assignment and Assumption. The Servicer hereby
acknowledges that the rights and obligations of the Bank under the Bank Flow

be performed and observed under the provisions of the Bank Flow Agreement,
except as otherwise provided herein or modified by Exhibit A hereto, and that

part of this Agreement to the same extent as if such provisions were set forth

the Bank Flow Agreement to enforce the obligations of the Servicer under the
Bank Flow Agreement and the term "Purchaser" as used in the Bank Flow Agreement
in connection with any rights of the Purchaser shall refer to the Master
Servicer or the Trustee acting on behalf of the Trust Fund, except as otherwise

Servicer be required to assume any of obligations of the Seller under the Bank
Flow Agreement; and, in connection with the performance of the Master Servicer's
duties hereunder, the parties and other signatories hereto agree that the Master
Servicer shall be entitled to all of the rights, protections and limitations of
liability afforded to the Master Servicer under the Trust Agreement.

                  (b) For so long as a certificate under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act
                  of 2002, as amended, ("Sarbanes-Oxley") is required to be
                  given on behalf of the Trust Fund, on or before March 15th of
                  each calendar year, commencing March 15, 2005, or at any other
                  time that a Sarbanes Certifying Person provides a
                  certification pursuant to Sarbanes-Oxley and upon thirty (30)
                  days written request of such parties, an officer of the
                  Servicer shall execute and deliver an Officer's Certificate to
                  the Sarbanes Certifying Party for the benefit of the Trust
                  Fund and the Sarbanes Certifying Party and its officers,
                  directors and affiliates, in a form substantially similar to
                  Exhibit C hereto, or as may be required by law or regulation.

12.      Section 8.04 (Additional Indemnification by the Seller) is hereby
         amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                           The Servicer shall indemnify the Seller, the
                  Depositor, the Trust Fund, the Trustee and the Master Servicer
                  (each an "indemnified party") and hold each of them harmless
                  against any and all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines,
                  forfeitures, reasonable and necessary legal fees and related
                  costs, judgments, and any other costs, fees and expenses that
                  any of such parties may sustain in any way related to the
                  failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the
                  Mortgage Loans in compliance with the terms of this Agreement
                  (including, but not limited to its obligation to provide the
                  certification pursuant to Section 7.05(b) hereunder) or for
                  any inaccurate or misleading information provided in the
                  certification required pursuant to Section 7.05(b). The
                  Servicer immediately shall notify the relevant indemnified
                  party if a claim is made by a third party with respect to this
                  Agreement or the Mortgage Loans, assume (with the prior
                  written consent of the indemnified party, which consent shall
                  not be unreasonably withheld or delayed) the defense of any
                  such claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith,
                  including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and
                  satisfy any judgment or decree which may be entered against it
                  or any of such parties in respect of such claim. The Servicer
                  shall follow any written instructions received from the


                                      A-3
<PAGE>

                  Master Servicer or the Trustee in connection with such claim.
                  The Servicer shall provide the Trustee (with a copy to the
                  Master Servicer) with a written report of all expenses and
                  advances incurred by the Servicer pursuant to this Section
                  8.04, and the Trustee (after consultation with the Master
                  Servicer) from the assets of the Trust Fund promptly shall
                  reimburse the Servicer for all amounts advanced by it pursuant
                  to the preceding sentence except when the claim is in any way
                  relates to the failure of the Servicer to service and
                  administer the Mortgage Loans in compliance with the terms of
                  this Agreement or the gross negligence, bad faith or willful
                  misconduct of this Servicer. In the event a dispute arises
                  between the Servicer and the indemnified party with respect to
                  any of the rights and obligations of the parties pursuant to
                  this Agreement and such dispute is adjudicated in a court of
                  law by an arbitration panel or any others judicial process,
                  then the losing party shall indemnify and reimburse the
                  winning party for all attorney's fees and other costs and
                  expenses relating to the adjudication of said dispute.

13.      Section 10.02 (Waiver of Defaults) is hereby amended by changing the
         reference to "Purchaser" to "Master Servicer with the prior written
         consent of the Trustee".

14.      Section 11.01 (Termination) is hereby amended by restating subclause
         (ii) thereof to read as below and adding the following sentence as the
         second sentence of Section 11.01:

                  (ii)     mutual consent of the Servicer and the Master
                           Servicer in writing, provided such termination is
                           also acceptable to the Trustee and the Rating
                           Agencies.

                           At the time of any termination of the Servicer
                  pursuant to Section 11.01, the Servicer shall be entitled to
                  all accrued and unpaid Servicing Fees and unreimbursed
                  Servicing Advances and Monthly Advances; provided, however, in
                  the event of a termination for cause pursuant to Section 10.01
                  hereof, such unreimbursed amounts shall not be reimbursed to
                  the Servicer until such amounts are received by the Trust Fund
                  from the related Mortgage Loans or if such amounts are
                  unrecoverable, from general collections.

15.      Section 11.02 (Termination Without Cause) is hereby amended by
         replacing the reference to "Purchaser" in clause (iii) with "Seller
         (with the prior consent of the Trustee and the Rating Agencies)"

16.      The first paragraph of Section 12.01 (Successor to Seller) is hereby
         amended in its entirety to read as follows:

                           Simultaneously with the termination of the Servicer's
                  responsibilities and duties under this Agreement pursuant to
                  Sections 8.04, 10.01, 11.01(ii) or 11.02, the Master Servicer
                  shall, in accordance with the provisions of the Trust
                  Agreement (i) succeed to and assume all of the Servicer's
                  responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this
                  Agreement, or (ii) appoint a successor meeting the eligibility
                  requirements of this Agreement, and which shall succeed to all



                                      A-4
<PAGE>

                  rights and assume all of the responsibilities, duties and
                  liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement with the
                  termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
                  liabilities under this Agreement. Any successor to the
                  Servicer that is not at that time a Servicer of other mortgage
                  loans for the Trust Fund shall be subject to the approval of
                  the Master Servicer, the Seller, the Trustee and each Rating
                  Agency (as such term is defined in the Trust Agreement).
                  Unless the successor servicer is at that time a servicer of
                  other mortgage loans for the Trust Fund, each Rating Agency
                  must deliver to the Trustee a letter to the effect that such
                  transfer of servicing will not result in a qualification,
                  withdrawal or downgrade of the then-current rating of any of
                  the mortgage pass-through securities issued by the Trust Fund.
                  In connection with such appointment and assumption, the Master
                  Servicer or the Seller, as applicable, may make such
                  arrangements for the compensation of such successor out of
                  payments on the Mortgage Loans as it and such successor shall
                  agree; provided, however, that no such compensation shall be
                  in excess of that permitted the Servicer under this Agreement.
                  In the event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities and
                  liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant
                  to the aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge
                  such duties and responsibilities during the period from the
                  date it acquires knowledge of such termination until the
                  effective date thereof with the same degree of diligence and
                  prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this
                  Agreement, and shall take no action whatsoever that might
                  impair or prejudice the rights or financial condition of its
                  successor. The resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant
                  to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective
                  until a successor shall be appointed pursuant to this Section
                  12.01 and shall in no event relieve the Servicer of the
                  representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections 4.01
                  and 4.02 and the remedies available to the Trust Fund under
                  Section 4.03, it being understood and agreed that the
                  provisions of Section 4.01, 4.02 and 4.03 shall be applicable
                  to the Servicer notwithstanding any such resignation or
                  termination of the Servicer, or the termination of this
                  Agreement.

17.      Section 12.02 (Amendment) is hereby amended by replacing the words "by
         written agreement signed by the Seller, as servicer and the Purchaser"
         with "by written agreement signed by the Servicer and the Seller, with
         the written consent of the Master Servicer and the Trustee".

18.      A new Section 12.18 (Intended Third Party Beneficiary) is hereby added
         to the Bank Flow Agreement to read as follows:

                  Section 12.18 Intended Third Party Beneficiaries.
         Notwithstanding any provision herein to the contrary, the parties to
         this Agreement agree that it is appropriate, in furtherance of the
         intent of such parties as set forth herein, that the Trustee receive
         the benefit of the provisions of this Agreement as an intended third
         party beneficiary of this Agreement to the extent of such provisions.
         The Servicer shall have the same obligations to the Trustee as if they
         were parties to this Agreement, and the Trustee shall have the same
         rights and remedies to enforce the provisions of this Agreement as if
         it was a party to this Agreement. The Servicer shall only take
         direction from the Master Servicer (if



                                      A-5
<PAGE>

         direction by the Master Servicer is required under this Agreement)
         unless otherwise directed by this Agreement. Notwithstanding the
         foregoing, all rights and obligations of the Master Servicer and the
         Trustee hereunder (other than the right to indemnification) shall
         terminate upon termination of the Trust Agreement and of the Trust Fund
         created pursuant to the Trust Agreement.

19.      A new Section 12.19 (Reporting Requirements of the Commission and
         Indemnification) is hereby added to the Bank Flow Agreement to read as
         follows:

                  Section 12.19 Reporting Requirements of the Commission and
         Indemnification. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement,
         the Servicer (i) agrees to negotiate in good faith any amendment or
         modification (including an indemnification agreed to in connection
         therewith) to this Agreement as may be necessary, in the judgment of
         the Depositor and its counsel (as evidenced by an opinion of such
         counsel addressed to the Servicer), to comply with any rules
         promulgated by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (the
         "Commission") and any interpretations thereof by the staff of the
         Commission (collectively, "SEC Rules") and (ii) with reasonable notice
         and upon written request, provide to the Depositor for inclusion in any
         periodic report required to be filed under the Securities and Exchange
         Act of 1934, as amended (the "Exchange Act"), such items of information
         regarding this Agreement and matters related to the Servicer, including
         as applicable (by way of example and not limitation), a description of
         any material litigation or governmental action or proceeding involving
         the Servicer or its affiliates (collectively, the "Servicer
         Information"), provided, that such information shall be required to be
         provided by the Servicer only to the extent that such shall be
         determined by the Depositor and its counsel (as evidenced by an opinion
         of such counsel addressed to the Servicer) to be necessary to comply
         with any SEC Rules.

20.      Section 12.18 (Exhibits) and Section 12.19 (General Interpretive
         Principles) are renumbered Sections 12.20 and Section 12.21,
         respectively.

                              ANNUAL CERTIFICATION


         I,         ,         of          Wachovia. (the "Servicer"), certify to
[identify  the company  submitting to SEC], and its officers, directors, agents
and affiliates (in its role as [identify role] the "Sarbanes Certifying Party"),
and with the knowledge and intent that they will rely upon this
certification, that:

         (i)  Based on my knowledge, the information relating to the Mortgage
              Loans and the servicing thereof submitted by the Servicer to the
              Sarbanes Certifying Party which is used in connection with
              preparation of the reports on Form 8-K and the annual report on
              Form 10-K filed with the SEC with respect to each transaction
              listed on the attached Exhibit A, taken as a whole, does not
              contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state a
              material fact necessary to make the statements made, in light of
              the circumstances under which such statements were made, not
              misleading as of the date of this certification;

         (ii) The servicing information required to be provided to the Sarbanes
              Certifying Party by the Servicer under the relevant servicing
              agreements has been provided to the Sarbanes Certifying Party;

         (iii) I am responsible for reviewing the activities performed by the
              Servicer under the relevant servicing agreements and based upon
              the review required by the relevant servicing agreements, and
              except as disclosed in the Annual Statement of Compliance, the
              Annual Independent Public Accountant's Servicing Report and all
              servicing reports, officer's certificates and other information
              relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans submitted to the
              Sarbanes Certifying Party, the Servicer has, as of the date of
              this certification fulfilled its obligations under the relevant
              servicing agreements; and

         (iv) I have disclosed to the Sarbanes Certifying Party all significant
              deficiencies relating to the Servicer's compliance with the
              minimum servicing standards in accordance with a review conducted
              in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation Program for
              Mortgage Bankers or similar standard as set forth in the relevant
              servicing agreements.

         (v)  The Servicer shall indemnify and hold harmless the Sarbanes
              Certifying Party and its officers, directors, agents and
              affiliates from and against any losses, damages, penalties, fines,
              forfeitures, reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments
              and other costs and expenses arising out of or based upon a breach
              by the Servicer or any of its officers, directors, agents or
              affiliates of its obligations under this Certification or the
              negligence, bad faith or willful misconduct of the Servicer in
              connection therewith. If the indemnification provided for herein
              is unavailable or insufficient to hold harmless the Sarbanes
              Certifying Party, then the Servicer


                                      C-1
<PAGE>

              agrees that it shall contribute to the amount paid or payable by
              the Sarbanes Certifying Party as a result of the losses, claims,
              damages or liabilities of the Sarbanes Certifying Party in such
              proportion as is appropriate to reflect the relative fault of the
              Sarbanes Certifying Party on the one hand and the Servicer on the
              other in connection with a breach of the Servicer's obligations
              under this Certification or the Servicer's negligence, bad faith
              or willful misconduct in connection therewith.
