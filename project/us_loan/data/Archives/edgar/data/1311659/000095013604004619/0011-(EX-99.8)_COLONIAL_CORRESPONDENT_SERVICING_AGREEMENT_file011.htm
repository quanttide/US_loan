                  The Owner does hereby contract with the Servicer, subject to
the terms of this Agreement for the servicing of the Mortgage Loans. In respect

the Servicer shall maintain a Servicing File, available for inspection by the
Owner, consisting of a copy of the contents of each Mortgage File and the
originals of the documents in each Mortgage File not delivered to the Custodian,
as well as all other documents and records related to each Mortgage Loan. The
possession of each Servicing File by the Servicer is at the will of the Owner
for the sole purpose of servicing the related Mortgage Loan, and such retention
and possession by the Servicer is in a custodial capacity only. Upon the sale of
each Mortgage Loan pursuant to the Loan Purchase Agreement the ownership of each
Mortgage Note, the related Mortgage and the related Mortgage File and Servicing
File shall vest immediately in the Owner, and the ownership of all records and
documents with respect to the related Mortgage Loan prepared by or which come
into the possession of the Servicer shall vest immediately in the Owner and
shall be retained and maintained by the Servicer, in trust, at the will of the
Owner and only in such custodial capacity. Each Servicing File shall be
segregated from the other books and records of the Servicer and shall be marked
appropriately to reflect clearly the sale of the related Mortgage Loan to the
Owner. The Servicer shall release its custody of the contents of any Servicing
File only in accordance with written instructions from the Owner, unless such
release is required as incidental to the Servicer's servicing of the Mortgage
Loans or is in connection with a repurchase of any Mortgage Loan pursuant to
Section 6.02.

                  Section 2.02 Books and Records.

                  From and after the sale of any Mortgage Loans to the Owner all
rights arising out of such Mortgage Loan including but not limited to all funds
received on or in connection with such Mortgage Loan, shall be received and held
by the Servicer in trust for the benefit of the Owner as owner of the Mortgage
Loans, and subject to the following paragraph, the Servicer (or MERS) shall
retain record title to the related Mortgages for the sole purpose of
facilitating the servicing and the supervision of the servicing of the Mortgage
Loans.

                  The Servicer shall be responsible for maintaining, and shall
maintain, a complete set of books and records for each Mortgage Loan which shall
be marked clearly to reflect the ownership of each Mortgage Loan by the Owner.
In particular, the Servicer shall maintain in its possession, available for
inspection by the Owner, or its designee and shall deliver to the Owner upon
demand, evidence of compliance with all federal, state and local laws, rules and
regulations, and requirements of Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, including but not
limited to


                                      -11-

provisions of the Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, to the
Mortgaged Property, documentation evidencing insurance coverage and eligibility
of any condominium project for approval by Fannie Mae and periodic inspection
reports as required by Section 4.13. To the extent that original documents are
not required for purposes of realization of Liquidation Proceeds or Insurance
Proceeds, documents maintained by the Servicer may be in the form of microfilm
or microfiche or such other reliable means of recreating original documents,
including but not limited to, optical imagery techniques so long as the Servicer
complies with the requirements of the Fannie Mae Selling and Servicing Guide, as
amended from time to time.

                  This Agreement continuously, from the time of its execution,
shall be an official record of the Servicer and Servicer will maintain a copy of
this Agreement and each agreement related hereto in its official books and
records. The Servicer shall maintain with respect to each Mortgage Loan and
shall make available for inspection by any Owner or its designee the related
Servicing File during the time the Owner retains ownership of a Mortgage Loan
and thereafter in accordance with applicable laws and regulations.

                  The Servicer shall keep at its servicing office books and
records in which, subject to such reasonable regulations as it may prescribe,
the Servicer shall note transfers of Mortgage Loans. Upon receipt of notice of
any transfer of a Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall mark its books and records
to reflect the ownership of the Mortgage Loans of such assignee, and shall
release the previous Owner from its obligations hereunder with respect to the
Mortgage Loans sold or transferred.

                  Section 2.03 Commencement of Servicing Responsibilities.

                  In accordance with the terms and conditions set forth in this
Agreement, the Servicer shall service the Mortgage Loans for and on behalf of
the Owner from and after the Commencement Date for each Mortgage Loan. By
selling each Mortgage Loan to the Purchaser under the Loan Purchase Agreement,
the Servicer shall be deemed to agree to service the related Mortgage Loans for

for each Mortgage Loan, the Owner hereby appoints the Servicer to perform, and
the Servicer hereby assumes and accepts such appointment for, all servicing
responsibilities for the Mortgage Loans.

required to be delivered directly to the Owner pursuant to the Loan Purchase
Agreement, the Servicer shall forward to the Custodian original

documents evidencing an assumption, modification, consolidation or extension of
any Mortgage Loan entered into in accordance with this Agreement within one week
of their execution, provided, however, that the Servicer shall provide the
Custodian with a certified true copy of any such document submitted for
recordation within one week of its execution, and shall provide the original of
any document submitted for recordation or a copy of such document certified by
the appropriate public recording office to be a true and complete copy of the
original within sixty (60) days of its submission for recordation.

                  Upon becoming aware of the payment in full of any Mortgage
Loan, the Servicer shall request the Custodian, on the request for release
substantially in the form annexed hereto as Exhibit G (or such other form as may
be provided to the Servicer from time to time), to deliver to the Servicer the
related Mortgage File. Each individual designated as an authorized
representative of the Servicer (an "Authorized Representative") on Exhibit H
hereto, is authorized to give and receive notices, requests and instructions and
to deliver certificates and documents in connection with this Servicing
Agreement on behalf of the Servicer and the specimen signature for each such
Authorized Representative of the Servicer initially authorized hereunder is set
forth on Exhibits H. From time to time, the Servicer may, by delivering to the
Master Servicer and the Custodian a revised exhibit, change the information
previously given pursuant to this Section, but each of the parties hereto shall
be entitled to rely conclusively on the then current exhibit until receipt of a
superseding exhibit.

                  Section 2.05 Record Title.

                  Within thirty days after each Commencement Date (except to the
extent delays are caused by the applicable recording office), the Servicer, at
the Servicer's expense, shall cause the Mortgage or Assignment of Mortgage, as
applicable, with respect to each MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan, to be properly
recorded in the name of MERS in the public recording office in the applicable
jurisdiction, or shall ascertain that such have previously been so recorded and
the Servicer shall take such actions as are necessary to cause the Owner to be
clearly identified as the owner of each MERS Mortgage Loan on the records of
MERS for purposes of the system of recording transfers of beneficial ownership
of mortgages maintained by MERS. In connection with any Reconstitution, the
Servicer, at the direction of the Owner or the Master Servicer, shall take such
actions as are necessary to cause any new Owner identified in a Transfer Notice
to be clearly identified as the owner of each MERS Mortgage Loan on the records
of MERS for purposes of the system of recording transfers of beneficial
ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS

                  An Assignment of Mortgage in favor of the Owner or such Person
as the Owner may designate shall be recorded as to each Non-MERS Mortgage Loan
unless instructions to the contrary are delivered to the Servicer in writing by
the Master Servicer. Subject to the preceding sentence, as soon as practicable
after the Master Servicer instructs the Servicer to record Assignments of
Mortgage (but in no event more than 30 days thereafter except to the extent
delays are caused by the applicable recording office), the Servicer, at the
Servicer's expense, shall cause to be properly recorded in each public recording
office where such Non-MERS Eligible Mortgage Loans are recorded each Assignment
of Mortgage.

expense of the Owner and at the direction of the Owner or the Master Servicer,
shall cause an Assignment of Mortgage as to each Non-MERS Mortgage Loan in favor
of the new Owner identified in a Transfer Notice to be prepared and properly
recorded in each public recording office where such Non-MERS Mortgage Loans are
recorded as soon as practicable after the related Effective Date (but in no
event more than 90 days thereafter except to the extent delays are caused by the
applicable recording office). The Servicer shall track such Assignments of
Mortgage to ensure they have been recorded. Additionally, the Servicer shall
prepare and execute, at the direction of the Owner or the Master Servicer, any
note endorsements relating to any of the Non-MERS Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
shall be entitled to be reimbursed by the Owner or its designee, on behalf of
the Depositor, its out-of-pocket costs for the preparation and recordation of
the Assignments of Mortgage under this paragraph. After the expenses of such
recording costs shall have been paid by the Servicer, the Servicer shall submit
to the Master Servicer a reasonably detailed invoice for reimbursement of
recording costs incurred hereunder.

                  Section 3.01 Servicer Representations and Warranties.

                  The Servicer, as a condition to the consummation of the
transactions contemplated hereby, hereby represents and warrants to the Owner
that as of each Commencement Date:

                  (a) Due Organization and Authority. The Servicer is duly
organized, validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the United
States or the jurisdiction of its formation, as applicable, and has and shall
continue to maintain all licenses necessary to carry on its business as now
being conducted and is and will continue to be licensed, qualified and in good
standing in each state where a Mortgaged Property is located if the laws of such
state require licensing or qualification in order to conduct business of the
type conducted by the Servicer, and in any event the Servicer is and will
continue to be in compliance with the laws of any such state to the extent
necessary to ensure the enforceability of the related Mortgage Loan and the
servicing of such Mortgage Loan in accordance with the terms of this Agreement;
the Servicer has the full power and authority to execute and deliver this
Agreement and to perform in accordance herewith; the execution, delivery and
performance of this Agreement (including all instruments of transfer to be
delivered pursuant to this Agreement) by the Servicer and the consummation of
the transactions contemplated hereby have been duly and validly authorized; this
Agreement evidences the valid, binding and enforceable obligation of the
Servicer; and all requisite action has been taken by the Servicer to make this
Agreement valid and binding upon the Servicer in accordance with its terms;

                  (b) Ordinary Course of Business. The consummation of the
transactions contemplated by this Agreement are in the ordinary course of
business of the Servicer;

<PAGE>

                  (c) No Conflicts. Neither the execution and delivery of
this Agreement, the acquisition of the Mortgage Loans and the servicing
responsibilities by the Servicer, or the transactions contemplated hereby, nor
the fulfillment of or compliance with the terms and conditions of this
Agreement, will conflict with or result in a breach of any of the terms,
conditions or provisions of the Servicer's charter or by-laws or any legal
restriction or any agreement or instrument to which the Servicer is now a party
or by which it is bound, or constitute a default or result in an acceleration
under any of the foregoing, or result in the violation of any law, rule,
regulation, order, judgment or decree to which the Servicer or its property is
subject, or impair the ability of the Servicer to service the Mortgage Loans, or
impair the value of the Mortgage Loans;

                  (d) Ability to Service. The Servicer is an approved
servicer of residential mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, with the
facilities, procedures, and experienced personnel necessary for the sound
servicing of mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer
is in good standing to service mortgage loans for Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac, and
no event has occurred, including but not limited to a change in insurance
coverage, which would make the Servicer unable to comply with Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac eligibility requirements or which would require notification to
either Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac;

                  (e) Reasonable Servicing Fee. The Servicer acknowledges
and agrees that the Servicing Fee, as calculated at the Servicing Fee Rate,
represents reasonable compensation for performing such services and that the
entire Servicing Fee shall be treated by the Servicer, for accounting and tax
purposes, as compensation for the servicing and administration of the Mortgage
Loans pursuant to this Agreement;

                  (f) Ability to Perform. The Servicer does not believe,
nor does it have any reason or cause to believe, that it cannot perform each and
every covenant contained in this Agreement. The Servicer is solvent and the sale
of the Mortgage Loans is not undertaken to hinder, delay or defraud any of the
Servicer's creditors;

                  (g) No Litigation Pending. There is no action, suit,
proceeding or investigation pending or threatened against the Servicer which,
either in any one instance or in the aggregate, may result in any material
adverse change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or
assets of the Servicer, or in any material impairment of the right or ability of
the Servicer to carry on its business substantially as now conducted, or in any
material liability on the part of the Servicer, or which would draw into
question the validity of this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans or of any action
taken or to be taken in connection with the obligations of the Servicer
contemplated herein, or which would be likely to impair materially the ability
of the Servicer to perform under the terms of this Agreement;

                  (h) No Consent Required. No consent, approval,
authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or body is required
for the execution, delivery and performance by the Servicer of or compliance by
the Servicer with this Agreement, or if required, such approval has been
obtained prior to the Commencement Date;

                  (i) No Untrue Information. Neither this Agreement nor any
statement, report or other document furnished or to be furnished pursuant to
this Agreement or in connection with the transactions contemplated hereby
contains any untrue statement of fact or omits to state a fact necessary to make
the statements contained therein not materially misleading;

                  (j) Financial Statements. The Servicer has delivered to
the Owner financial statements as to its last three complete fiscal years and
any later quarter ended more than 60 days prior to the execution of this
Agreement. All such financial statements fairly present the pertinent results of
operations and changes in financial position at the end of each such period of
the Servicer and its subsidiaries and have been prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles consistently applied throughout the
periods involved, except as set forth in the notes thereto. There has been no
change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of
the Servicer since the date of the Servicer's financial statements that would
have a material adverse effect on its ability to perform its obligations under
this Agreement. The Servicer has completed any forms requested by the Owner in a
timely manner and in accordance with the provided instructions;

                  (k) No Brokers' Fees. The Servicer has not dealt with any
broker, investment banker, agent or other person that may be entitled to any
commission or compensation in connection with the sale of the Mortgage Loans;
and

                  (l) Insured Depository Institution Representations. If
the Servicer is an Insured Depository Institution, the Servicer makes the
following additional representations and warranties:

                     (i) This Agreement between the Owner and the Servicer
         conforms to all applicable statutory and regulatory requirements; and

                     (ii) This Agreement is (1) executed contemporaneously with
         the Loan Purchase Agreement, (2) approved by a specific corporate or
         banking association resolution by the Servicer's board of directors,
         which approval shall be reflected in the minutes of said board, and (3)
         an official record of the Servicer. A copy of such resolution,
         certified by a vice president or higher officer of the Servicer has
         been provided to the Owner.

                  Section 3.02 Remedies for Breach of Representations and
Warranties.

                  It is understood and agreed that the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.01 shall survive the engagement of the
Servicer to perform the servicing responsibilities as of each Commencement Date
and the delivery of the Servicing Files to the Servicer and shall inure to the
benefit of the Owner. Upon discovery by either the Servicer or the Owner of a
breach of any of the foregoing representations and warranties which materially
and adversely affects the ability of the Servicer to perform its duties and
obligations under this Agreement or otherwise materially and adversely affects
the value of the Mortgage Loans, the Mortgaged Property or the priority of the
security interest on such Mortgaged Property or the


                                      -16-
<PAGE>

interest of the Owner (in the case of any of the foregoing, a "Breach"), the
party discovering such Breach shall give prompt written notice to the other.

                  Within sixty (60) days of the earlier of either discovery by
or notice to the Servicer of any Breach of a representation or warranty, the
Servicer shall use its best efforts promptly to cure such Breach in all material
respects and, if such Breach cannot be cured, the Servicer shall, at the Owner's
option, assign the Servicer's rights and obligations under this Agreement (or
respecting the affected Mortgage Loans) to a successor servicer, subject to the
approval of the Owner, which approval shall be in the Owner's sole discretion.
Such assignment shall be in accordance with Section 12.01.

                  In addition, the Servicer shall indemnify the Owner, the
Master Servicer and each Reconstitution Party and hold each of them harmless
against any losses, damages, penalties, fines, forfeitures, reasonable and
necessary legal fees and related costs, judgments, and other costs and expenses
resulting from any claim, demand, defense or assertion based on or grounded
upon, or resulting from, a Breach of the Servicer representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement.

                  Any cause of action against the Servicer relating to or
arising out of the Breach of any representations and warranties made in Section
3.01 shall accrue as to any Mortgage Loan upon (i) discovery of such Breach by
the Owner or the Master Servicer or notice thereof by the Servicer to the Owner
or the Master Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer to cure such Breach as
specified above, and (iii) demand upon the Servicer by the Owner or the Master
Servicer for compliance with this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE IV

                 ADMINISTRATION AND SERVICING OF MORTGAGE LOANS

                  Section 4.01 Servicer to Act as Servicer.

                  From and after each Commencement Date, the Servicer, as an
independent contractor, shall service and administer the related Mortgage Loans
and shall have full power and authority, acting alone, to do any and all things
in connection with such servicing and administration which the Servicer may deem
necessary or desirable, consistent with the terms of this Agreement and with
Accepted Servicing Practices; provided that the Servicer shall not take any
action that is inconsistent with or prejudices the rights and interests of the
Owner in any Mortgage Loan or under this Agreement.

                  The Servicer shall not make any future advances with respect
to a Mortgage Loan and (unless the Mortgagor is in default with respect to the
Mortgage Loan or such default is, in the judgment of the Servicer, imminent and
the Servicer has obtained the prior written consent of the Master Servicer) the
Servicer shall not permit any modification of any material term of any Mortgage
Loan including any modifications that would change the Mortgage Interest Rate,
defer or forgive the payment of principal or interest, reduce or increase the
outstanding principal balance (except for actual payments of principal) or
change the final maturity date on such


                                      -17-
<PAGE>

Mortgage Loan. Except with the written permission of the Master Servicer, no
modification, recast, extension, or capitalization of delinquent payments of a
Mortgage Loan shall be permitted. Where applicable, the Servicer must satisfy
all requirements under the applicable PMI Policy and/or any applicable LPMI
Policy regarding the relief granted with respect to a delinquent Mortgage Loan,
including, without limitation, securing the prior written consent of the
respective Qualified Insurer regarding any change in any term of such Mortgage
Loan, the release of the related Mortgagor from any liability related to such
Mortgage Loan, or the release of any portion of, or interest in, the Mortgaged
Property from the lien of the related Mortgage. In the event of any modification
permitted hereunder which permits the deferral of interest or principal payments
on any Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall, on the Business Day immediately
preceding the Remittance Date in any month in which any such principal or
interest payment has been deferred, deposit in the Custodial Account from its
own funds, in accordance with Section 5.03, the difference between (a) such
month's principal and one month's interest at the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate
on the unpaid principal balance of such Mortgage Loan and (b) the amount paid by
the Mortgagor. The Servicer shall be entitled to reimbursement for such advances
to the same extent as for all other advances made pursuant to Section 5.03.
Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the Servicer shall continue,
and is hereby authorized and empowered, to execute and deliver on behalf of
itself and the Owner, all instruments of satisfaction or cancellation, or of
partial or full release, discharge and all other comparable instruments, with
respect to the Mortgage Loans and with respect to the Mortgaged Properties. If
reasonably required by the Servicer, the Owner shall furnish the Servicer with
any powers of attorney and other documents necessary or appropriate to enable
the Servicer to carry out its servicing and administrative duties under this
Agreement.

                  Promptly after the execution of any assumption, modification,
consolidation or extension of any Mortgage Loan, but in no event later than the
Reporting Date in the month following the date of execution of such instrument,
the Servicer shall forward to the Master Servicer copies of any documents
evidencing such assumption, modification, consolidation or extension.

                  In servicing and administering the Mortgage Loans, the
Servicer shall employ procedures (including collection procedures) and exercise
the same care that it customarily employs and exercises in servicing and
administering mortgage loans for its own account, giving due consideration to
Accepted Servicing Practices where such practices do not conflict with the
requirements of this Agreement, and the Owner's reliance on the Servicer.

                  Section 4.02 Liquidation of Mortgage Loans.

                  In the event that any payment due under any Mortgage Loan and
not postponed pursuant to Section 4.01 is not paid when the same becomes due and
payable, or in the event the Mortgagor fails to perform any other covenant or
obligation under the Mortgage Loan and such failure continues beyond any
applicable grace period, the Servicer shall take such action as (1) the Servicer
would take under similar circumstances with respect to a similar mortgage loan
held for its own account for investment, (2) shall be consistent with Accepted
Servicing Practices, (3) the Servicer shall determine prudently to be in the
best interest of the Owner, and (4) is consistent with any related PMI Policy or
LPMI Policy. In the event that any payment due under


                                      -18-
<PAGE>

any Mortgage Loan is not postponed pursuant to Section 4.01 and remains
delinquent for a period of ninety (90) days or any other default continues for a
period of 90 days beyond the expiration of any grace or cure period, the
Servicer shall commence foreclosure proceedings, provided that, prior to
commencing foreclosure proceedings, the Servicer shall notify the Master
Servicer in writing of the Servicer's intention to do so, and the Servicer shall
not commence foreclosure proceedings if the Master Servicer objects to such
action within 10 Business Days of receiving such notice. In such connection, the
Servicer shall from its own funds make all necessary and proper Servicing
Advances, provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be required to expend
its own funds in connection with any foreclosure or towards the restoration or
preservation of any Mortgaged Property, unless it shall determine (a) that such
preservation, restoration and/or foreclosure will increase the proceeds of
liquidation of the Mortgage Loan to Owner after reimbursement to itself for such
expenses and (b) that such expenses will be recoverable by it either through
Liquidation Proceeds (respecting which it shall have priority for purposes of
withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section 4.05) or through
Insurance Proceeds (respecting which it shall have similar priority).

                  Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in
connection with a foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, in
the event the Servicer has reasonable cause to believe that a Mortgaged Property
is contaminated by hazardous or toxic substances or wastes, or if the Owner or
the Master Servicer otherwise requests an environmental inspection or review of
such Mortgaged Property to be conducted by a qualified inspector, the Servicer
shall cause such an environmental inspection or review to be made by a qualified
inspector. Upon completion of the inspection, the Servicer shall promptly
provide the Owner with a written report of the environmental inspection.

                  After reviewing the environmental inspection report, the
Master Servicer shall determine how the Servicer shall proceed with respect to
the Mortgaged Property. In the event (a) the environmental inspection report
indicates that the Mortgaged Property is contaminated by hazardous or toxic
substances or wastes and (b) the Master Servicer directs the Servicer to proceed
with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer
shall be reimbursed for all reasonable costs associated with such foreclosure or
acceptance of a deed in lieu of foreclosure and any related environmental clean
up costs, as applicable, from the related Liquidation Proceeds, or if the
Liquidation Proceeds are insufficient to fully reimburse the Servicer, the
Servicer shall be entitled to be reimbursed from amounts in the Custodial
Account pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof. In the event the Master Servicer
directs the Servicer not to proceed with foreclosure or acceptance of a deed in
lieu of foreclosure, the Servicer shall be reimbursed for all Servicing Advances
made with respect to the related Mortgaged Property from the Custodial Account
pursuant to Section 4.05 hereof.

                  Section 4.03 Collection of Mortgage Loan Payments.

                  Continuously from the related Commencement Date until the date
each Mortgage Loan ceases to be subject to this Agreement, the Servicer shall
proceed diligently to collect all payments due under each of the Mortgage Loans
when the same shall become due and payable and shall take special care in
ascertaining and estimating Escrow Payments and all other charges that will
become due and payable with respect to the Mortgage Loan and the Mortgaged

                                      -19-
<PAGE>

Property, to the end that the installments payable by the Mortgagors will be
sufficient to pay such charges as and when they become due and payable.

                  Section 4.04 Establishment of and Deposits to Custodial
Account.

                  The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan separate and apart from any of its own
funds and general assets and shall establish and maintain two (2) separate
Custodial Accounts, each in the form of time deposit or demand accounts, one
account for funds collected and relating to Reconstituted Mortgage Loans and one
for funds collected and relating to all Mortgage Loans that are not subject to a
Reconstitution. The Custodial Account relating to all Mortgage Loans that are
not then subject to a Reconstitution shall be titled "[Name of Servicer] in
trust for the benefit of Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master Servicer and the
Owner of Residential Mortgage Loans". The Custodial Account relating to all
Reconstituted Mortgage Loans shall be titled "[Name of Servicer] in trust for
the benefit of Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master Servicer and the various
Owners of Residential Mortgage Loans." The Custodial Account shall be
established with a Qualified Depository acceptable to the Owner. Any funds
deposited in the Custodial Account shall at all times be fully insured to the
full extent permitted under applicable law. Funds deposited in the Custodial
Account may be drawn on by the Servicer in accordance with Section 4.05. The
creation of any Custodial Account shall be evidenced by a certification in the
form of Exhibit A-1 hereto, in the case of an account established with the
Servicer, or by a letter agreement in the form of Exhibit A-2 hereto, in the
case of an account held by a depository other than the Servicer. A copy of such
certification or letter agreement shall be furnished to the Owner and, upon
request, to any subsequent Owner.

                  The Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account on a daily
basis, and retain therein, the following collections received by the Servicer
and payments made by the Servicer after the related Commencement Date with
respect to the Mortgage Loans (including payments received by the Servicer prior
to the related Commencement Date but allocable to a period subsequent thereto):

                     (i) all payments on account of principal on the Mortgage
         Loans, including all Principal Prepayments;

                     (ii) all payments on account of interest on the Mortgage
         Loans adjusted to the Mortgage Loan Remittance Rate;

                     (iii) all Liquidation Proceeds;

                     (iv) all Insurance Proceeds including amounts required to
         be deposited pursuant to Section 4.10 (other than proceeds to be held
         in the Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the
         Mortgaged Property or released to the Mortgagor in accordance with
         Section 4.14), Section 4.11 and Section 4.15;

                                      -20-
<PAGE>

                     (v) all Condemnation Proceeds which are not applied to the
         restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property or released to the
         Mortgagor in accordance with Section 4.14;

                     (vi) any amount required to be deposited in the Custodial
         Account pursuant to Section 4.01, 4.09, 4.19, 4.22, 5.03, 6.01 or 6.02;

                     (vii) with respect to each Principal Prepayment in full or
         in part, the Prepayment Interest Shortfall Amount, if any, for the
         month of distribution. Such deposit shall be made from the Servicer's
         own funds, without reimbursement therefor;

                     (viii) any amounts required to be deposited by the Servicer
         pursuant to Section 4.11 in connection with the deductible clause in
         any blanket hazard insurance policy;

                     (ix) any amounts received with respect to or related to any
         REO Property and all REO Disposition Proceeds pursuant to Section 4.16;
         and

                     (x) any other amount required hereunder to be deposited by
         the Servicer in the Custodial Account.

                  The foregoing requirements for deposit into the Custodial
Account shall be exclusive, it being understood and agreed that, without
limiting the generality of the foregoing, payments in the nature of late payment
charges and assumption fees, to the extent permitted by Section 6.01, need not
be deposited by the Servicer into the Custodial Account. Any interest paid on
funds deposited in the Custodial Account by the depository institution shall
accrue to the benefit of the Servicer and the Servicer shall be entitled to
retain and withdraw such interest from the Custodial Account pursuant to Section
4.05.

                  Section 4.05 Permitted Withdrawals From Custodial Account.

                  The Servicer shall, from time to time, withdraw funds from the
Custodial Account for the following purposes:

                     (i) to make payments to the Owner in the amounts and in the
         manner provided for in Section 5.01;

                     (ii) to reimburse itself for Monthly Advances of the
         Servicer's funds made pursuant to Section 5.03, the Servicer's right to
         reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause (ii) being limited to
         amounts received on the related Mortgage Loan which represent late
         payments of principal and/or interest respecting which any such advance
         was made, it being understood that, in the case of any such
         reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the
         rights of the Owner, except that, where the Servicer is required to
         repurchase a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 6.02, the Servicer's
         right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to the payment to the
         Owner of the Repurchase Price pursuant to such section and all other
         amounts required to be paid to the Owner with respect to such Mortgage
         Loan;

                                      -21-
<PAGE>

                     (iii) to reimburse itself for unreimbursed Servicing
         Advances, and for any unpaid Servicing Fees, the Servicer's right to
         reimburse itself pursuant to this subclause (iii) with respect to any
         Mortgage Loan being limited to related Liquidation Proceeds,
         Condemnation Proceeds, Insurance Proceeds and such other amounts as may
         be collected by the Servicer from the Mortgagor or otherwise relating
         to the Mortgage Loan, it being understood that, in the case of any such
         reimbursement, the Servicer's right thereto shall be prior to the
         rights of the Owner except where the Servicer is required to repurchase
         a Mortgage Loan pursuant to Section 6.02, in which case the Servicer's
         right to such reimbursement shall be subsequent to the payment to the
         Owner of the Repurchase Price pursuant to such section and all other
         amounts required to be paid to the Owner with respect to such Mortgage
         Loan;

                     (iv) to pay itself interest earned on funds deposited in
         the Custodial Account;

                     (v) to reimburse itself for expenses incurred and
         reimbursable to it pursuant to Section 9.01, but only to the extent
         such amounts are determined to be reimbursable by the Owner pursuant to
         Section 9.01;

                     (vi) with respect to each Mortgage Loan that is covered by
         an LPMI Policy, in the amount of the related premiums for the LPMI
         Policy (if applicable);

                     (vii) to clear and terminate the Custodial Account upon the
         termination of this Agreement; and

                     (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

                  In connection with withdrawals pursuant to subclauses (ii) and
(iii) above, the Servicer's entitlement thereto is limited to collections or
other recoveries on the related Mortgage Loan. The Servicer shall therefore keep
and maintain a separate accounting for each Mortgage Loan it services for the
purpose of justifying any withdrawal from the Collection Account it maintains
pursuant to such subclause (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v).

                  In the event that the Custodial Account is interest bearing,
on each Remittance Date, the Servicer shall withdraw all funds from the
Custodial Account except for those amounts which, pursuant to Section 5.01, the
Servicer is not obligated to remit on such Remittance Date. The Servicer may use
such withdrawn funds only for the purposes described in this Section 4.05.

                  Section 4.06 Establishment of and Deposits to Escrow Account.

                  The Servicer shall segregate and hold all funds collected and
received pursuant to a Mortgage Loan constituting Escrow Payments separate and
apart from any of its own funds and general assets and shall establish and
maintain two (2) separate Escrow Accounts, each in the form of time deposit or
demand accounts, one account for Escrow Payments relating to Reconstituted
Mortgage Loans and one for Escrow Payments relating to all Mortgage Loans that
are not subject to a Reconstitution. The Escrow Account relating to all Mortgage
Loans that are not then subject to a Reconstitution shall be titled "[Name of
Servicer] in trust for the benefit of Aurora Loan Services Inc., as Master
Servicer and the Owner of Residential Mortgage Loans and




                                      -22-
<PAGE>

various Mortgagors". The Escrow Account relating to all Reconstituted Mortgage
Loans shall be titled "[Name of Servicer] in trust for the benefit of Aurora
Loan Services Inc., as Master Servicer and the various Owners of Residential
Mortgage Loans and various Mortgagors." The Escrow Accounts shall be established
with a Qualified Depository, in a manner which shall provide maximum available
insurance thereunder. Funds deposited in the Escrow Account may be drawn on by
the Servicer in accordance with Section 4.07. The creation of any Escrow Account
shall be evidenced by a certification in the form of Exhibit B-1 hereto, in the
case of an account established with the Servicer, or by a letter agreement in
the form of Exhibit B-2 hereto, in the case of an account held by a depository
other than the Servicer. A copy of such certification shall be furnished to the
Owner and, upon request, to any subsequent Owner.

                  The Servicer shall deposit in the Escrow Account or Accounts
on a daily basis, and retain therein:

                     (i) all Escrow Payments collected on account of the
         Mortgage Loans, for the purpose of effecting timely payment of any such
         items as required under the terms of this Agreement; and

                     (ii) all amounts representing Insurance Proceeds or
         Condemnation Proceeds which are to be applied to the restoration or
         repair of any Mortgaged Property.

                  The Servicer shall make withdrawals from the Escrow Account
only to effect such payments as are required under this Agreement, as set forth
in Section 4.07. The Servicer shall be entitled to retain any interest paid on
funds deposited in the Escrow Account by the depository institution, other than
interest on escrowed funds required by law to be paid to the Mortgagor. To the
extent required by law, the Servicer shall pay interest on escrowed funds to the
Mortgagor notwithstanding that the Escrow Account may be non-interest bearing or
that interest paid thereon is insufficient for such purposes.

                  Section 4.07 Permitted Withdrawals From Escrow Account.

                  Withdrawals from the Escrow Account or Accounts may be made by
the Servicer only:

                     (i) to effect timely payments of ground rents, taxes,
         assessments, water rates, mortgage insurance premiums, condominium
         charges, fire and hazard insurance premiums or other items constituting
         Escrow Payments for the related Mortgage;

                     (ii) to reimburse the Servicer for any Servicing Advances
         made by the Servicer pursuant to Section 4.08 with respect to a related
         Mortgage Loan, but only from amounts received on the related Mortgage
         Loan which represent late collections of Escrow Payments thereunder;

                     (iii) to refund to any Mortgagor any funds found to be in
         excess of the amounts required under the terms of the related Mortgage
         Loan;

                                      -23-
<PAGE>

                     (iv) for transfer to the Custodial Account and application
         to reduce the principal balance of the Mortgage Loan in accordance with
         the terms of the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note;

                     (v) for application to restoration or repair of the
         Mortgaged Property in accordance with the procedures outlined in
         Section 4.14;

                     (vi) to pay to the Servicer, or any Mortgagor to the extent
         required by law, any interest paid on the funds deposited in the Escrow
         Account;

                     (vii) to clear and terminate the Escrow Account on the
         termination of this Agreement; and

                     (viii) to withdraw funds deposited in error.

                  Section 4.08 Payment of Taxes, Insurance and Other Charges.

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
maintain accurate records reflecting the status of ground rents, taxes,
assessments, water rates, sewer rents, and other charges which are or may become
a lien upon the Mortgaged Property and the status of PMI Policy and LPMI Policy
premiums and fire and hazard insurance coverage and shall obtain, from time to
time, all bills for the payment of such charges (including renewal premiums) and
shall effect payment thereof prior to the applicable penalty or termination
date, employing for such purpose deposits of the Mortgagor in the Escrow Account
which shall have been estimated and accumulated by the Servicer in amounts
sufficient for such purposes, as allowed under the terms of the Mortgage. To the
extent that a Mortgage does not provide for Escrow Payments, the Servicer shall
determine that any such payments are made by the Mortgagor at the time they
first become due. The Servicer assumes full responsibility for the timely
payment of all such bills and shall effect timely payment of all such charges
irrespective of each Mortgagor's faithful performance in the payment of same or
the making of the Escrow Payments, and the Servicer shall make advances from its
own funds to effect such payments; provided, however, that the Servicer shall
not be required to make an advance of its own funds for any such payments if
such advance would, if made, be, in the Servicer's reasonable judgment,
non-recoverable from future recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loan or
Mortgaged Property. The determination by the Servicer that any advance of funds
is or would be non-recoverable shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of
the Servicer delivered to the Master Servicer.

                  Section 4.09 Protection of Accounts.

                  The Servicer may transfer the Custodial Account or the Escrow
Account to a different Qualified Depository from time to time. Such transfer
shall be made only upon obtaining the consent of the Owner and the Master
Servicer, which consent shall not be withheld unreasonably.

                  The Servicer shall bear any expenses, losses or damages
sustained by the Owner because the Custodial Account and/or the Escrow Account
are not demand deposit accounts.

                                      -24-
<PAGE>

                  Amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account and the Escrow
Account may at the option of the Servicer be invested in Eligible Investments;
provided that in the event that amounts on deposit in the Custodial Account or
the Escrow Account exceed the amount fully insured by the FDIC (the "Insured
Amount") the Servicer shall be obligated to invest the excess amount over the
Insured Amount in Eligible Investments on the same Business Day as such excess
amount becomes present in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account. Any such
Eligible Investment shall mature no later than the Determination Date next
following the date of such Eligible Investment, provided, however, that if such
Eligible Investment is an obligation of a Qualified Depository (other than the
Servicer) that maintains the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, then such
Eligible Investment may mature on such Remittance Date. Any such Eligible
Investment shall be made in the name of the Servicer in trust for the benefit of
the Owner. All income on or gain realized from any such Eligible Investment
shall be for the benefit of the Servicer and may be withdrawn at any time by the
Servicer. Any losses incurred in respect of any such investment shall be
deposited in the Custodial Account or the Escrow Account, by the Servicer out of
its own funds immediately as realized.

                  Section 4.10 Maintenance of Hazard Insurance.

                  The Servicer shall cause to be maintained for each Mortgage
Loan hazard insurance such that all buildings upon the Mortgaged Property are
insured by a generally acceptable insurer rated A:VI or better in the current
Best's Key Rating Guide ("Best's") against loss by fire, hazards of extended
coverage and such other hazards as are customary in the area where the Mortgaged
Property is located, in an amount which is at least equal to the lesser of (i)
the replacement value of the improvements securing such Mortgage Loan and (ii)
the greater of (a) the outstanding principal balance of the Mortgage Loan and
(b) an amount such that the proceeds thereof shall be sufficient to prevent the
Mortgagor or the loss payee from becoming a co-insurer.

                  If upon origination of the Mortgage Loan, the related
Mortgaged Property was located in an area identified in the Federal Register by
the Flood Emergency Management Agency as having special flood hazards (and such
flood insurance has been made available) a flood insurance policy meeting the
requirements of the current guidelines of the Federal Insurance Administration
is in effect with a generally acceptable insurance carrier rated A:VI or better
in Best's in an amount representing coverage equal to the lesser of (i) the
minimum amount required, under the terms of coverage, to compensate for any
damage or loss on a replacement cost basis (or the unpaid balance of the
mortgage if replacement cost coverage is not available for the type of building
insured) and (ii) the maximum amount of insurance which is available under the
Flood Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended. If at any time during the
term of the Mortgage Loan, the Servicer determines in accordance with applicable
law and pursuant to the Fannie Mae Guides that a Mortgaged Property is located
in a special flood hazard area and is not covered by flood insurance or is
covered in an amount less than the amount required by the Flood Disaster
Protection Act of 1973, as amended, the Servicer shall notify the related
Mortgagor that the Mortgagor must obtain such flood insurance coverage, and if
said Mortgagor fails to obtain the required flood insurance coverage within
forty-five (45) days after such notification, the Servicer shall immediately
force place the required flood insurance on the Mortgagor's behalf.

                                      -25-
<PAGE>

                  If a Mortgage is secured by a unit in a condominium project,
the Servicer shall verify that the coverage required of the owner's association,
including hazard, flood, liability, and fidelity coverage, is being maintained
in accordance with then current Fannie Mae requirements, and secure from the
owner's association its agreement to notify the Servicer promptly of any change
in the insurance coverage or of any condemnation or casualty loss that may have
a material effect on the value of the Mortgaged Property as security.

                  The Servicer shall cause to be maintained on each Mortgaged
Property earthquake or such other or additional insurance as may be required
pursuant to such applicable laws and regulations as shall at any time be in
force and as shall require such additional insurance, or pursuant to the
requirements of any private mortgage guaranty insurer, or as may be required to
conform with Accepted Servicing Practices.

                  In the event that any Owner or the Servicer shall determine
that the Mortgaged Property should be insured against loss or damage by hazards
and risks not covered by the insurance required to be maintained by the
Mortgagor pursuant to the terms of the Mortgage, the Servicer shall communicate
and consult with the Mortgagor with respect to the need for such insurance and
bring to the Mortgagor's attention the desirability of protection of the
Mortgaged Property.

                  All policies required hereunder shall name the Servicer as
loss payee and shall be endorsed with standard or union mortgagee clauses,
without contribution, which shall provide for at least 30 days prior written
notice of any cancellation, reduction in amount or material change in coverage.

                  The Servicer shall not interfere with the Mortgagor's freedom
of choice in selecting either his insurance carrier or agent, provided, however,
that the Servicer shall not accept any such insurance policies from insurance
companies unless such companies are rated A:VI or better in Best's and are
licensed to do business in the jurisdiction in which the Mortgaged Property is
located. The Servicer shall determine that such policies provide sufficient risk
coverage and amounts, that they insure the property owner, and that they
properly describe the property address. The Servicer shall furnish to the
Mortgagor a formal notice of expiration of any such insurance in sufficient time
for the Mortgagor to arrange for renewal coverage by the expiration date.

                  Pursuant to Section 4.04, any amounts collected by the
Servicer under any such policies (other than amounts to be deposited in the
Escrow Account and applied to the restoration or repair of the related Mortgaged
Property, or property acquired in liquidation of the Mortgage Loan, or to be
released to the Mortgagor, in accordance with the Servicer's normal servicing
procedures as specified in Section 4.14) shall be deposited in the Custodial
Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to Section 4.05.

                  Section 4.11 Maintenance of Mortgage Impairment Insurance.

                  In the event that the Servicer shall obtain and maintain a
blanket policy insuring against losses arising from fire and hazards covered
under extended coverage on all of the


                                      -26-
<PAGE>

Mortgage Loans, then, to the extent such policy provides coverage in an amount
equal to the amount required pursuant to Section 4.10 and otherwise complies
with all other requirements of Section 4.10, it shall conclusively be deemed to
have satisfied its obligations as set forth in Section 4.10. Any amounts
collected by the Servicer under any such policy relating to a Mortgage Loan
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account subject to withdrawal pursuant to
Section 4.05. Such policy may contain a deductible clause, in which case, in the
event that there shall not have been maintained on the related Mortgaged
Property a policy complying with Section 4.10, and there shall have been a loss
which would have been covered by such policy, the Servicer shall deposit in the
Custodial Account at the time of such loss the amount not otherwise payable
under the blanket policy because of such deductible clause, such amount to
deposited from the Servicer's funds, without reimbursement therefor. Upon
request of the Master Servicer, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to the
Master Servicer a certified true copy of such policy and a statement from the
insurer thereunder that such policy shall in no event be terminated or
materially modified without 30 days' prior written notice to the Master
Servicer.

                  Section 4.12 Maintenance of Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance.

                  The Servicer shall maintain with responsible companies, at its
own expense, a blanket Fidelity Bond and an Errors and Omissions Insurance
Policy, with broad coverage on all officers, employees or other persons acting
in any capacity requiring such persons to handle funds, money, documents or
papers relating to the Mortgage Loans ("Servicer Employees"). Any such Fidelity
Bond and Errors and Omissions Insurance Policy shall be in the form of the
Mortgage Banker's Blanket Bond and shall protect and insure the Servicer against
losses, including forgery, theft, embezzlement, fraud, errors and omissions and
negligent acts of such Servicer Employees. Such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy also shall protect and insure the Servicer against
losses in connection with the release or satisfaction of a Mortgage Loan without
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured thereby. No
provision of this Section 4.12 requiring such Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy shall diminish or relieve the Servicer from its
duties and obligations as set forth in this Agreement. The minimum coverage
under any such bond and insurance policy shall be at least equal to the
corresponding amounts required by the Master Servicer in the Servicer's Guide,
or, in the absence of such requirement, the corresponding amounts required by
Fannie Mae in the Fannie Mae Mortgage-Backed Securities Selling and Servicing
Guide and by Freddie Mac in the Freddie Mac Sellers' & Servicers' Guide. Upon
the request of the Master Servicer, the Servicer shall cause to be delivered to
the Master Servicer certificates evidencing that such policy and bond is in
effect and shall furnish to the Master Servicer a statement from the surety and
the insurer that such fidelity bond and insurance policy shall in no event be
terminated or materially modified without 30 days' prior written notice to the
Master Servicer.

                  Section 4.13 Inspections.

                  The Servicer shall inspect the Mortgaged Property as often as
deemed necessary by the Servicer to assure itself that the value of the
Mortgaged Property is being preserved. In addition, if any Mortgage Loan is more
than 60 days delinquent, the Servicer immediately shall inspect the Mortgaged
Property and shall conduct subsequent inspections in accordance with


                                      -27-
<PAGE>

Accepted Servicing Practices or as may be required by the primary mortgage
guaranty insurer. The Servicer shall keep a written report of each such
inspection.

                  Section 4.14 Restoration of Mortgaged Property.

                  The Servicer need not obtain the approval of the Owner prior
to releasing any Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds to the Mortgagor to
be applied to the restoration or repair of the Mortgaged Property if such
release is in accordance with Accepted Servicing Practices and in an amount not
in excess of $5,000. At a minimum, the Servicer shall comply with the following
conditions in connection with any such release of Insurance Proceeds or
Condemnation Proceeds:

                     (i) the Servicer shall receive satisfactory independent
         verification of completion of repairs and issuance of any required
         approvals with respect thereto;

                     (ii) the Servicer shall take all steps necessary to
         preserve the priority of the lien of the Mortgage, including, but not
         limited to requiring waivers with respect to mechanics' and
         materialmen's liens;

                     (iii) the Servicer shall verify that the Mortgage Loan is
         not in default; and

                     (iv) pending repairs or restoration, the Servicer shall
         place the Insurance Proceeds or Condemnation Proceeds in the Escrow
         Account.

                  If the Owner is named as an additional loss payee, the
Servicer is hereby empowered to endorse any loss draft issued in respect of such
a claim in the name of the Owner.

                  Section 4.15 Servicing and Administration of Mortgage
Insurance Policies.

                  (a) With respect to each Mortgage Loan covered by a PMI
Policy, the Servicer shall, without any cost to the Owner, maintain or cause the
Mortgagor to maintain in full force and effect such PMI Policy and shall pay or
shall cause the Mortgagor to pay the premium thereon on a timely basis. In the
event that such PMI Policy shall be terminated, the Servicer shall obtain from
another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a total coverage
equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated PMI Policy. Subject to
Accepted Servicing Practices and applicable law (including the Homeowner's
Protection Act of 1998, as amended, and its implementing regulations), the
Servicer may cancel a PMI Policy, provided all requirements of applicable law
are met for the cancellation of such policy. If the insurer shall cease to be a
Qualified Insurer, the Servicer shall determine whether recoveries under the PMI
Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial condition of such
insurer, it being understood that the Servicer shall in no event have any
responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under the PMI Policy for
such reason. If the Servicer determines that recoveries are so jeopardized, it
shall notify the Owner and the Mortgagor, if required, and obtain from another
Qualified Insurer a replacement insurance policy. The Servicer shall not take
any action which would result in noncoverage under any applicable PMI Policy of
any loss which, but for the actions of the Servicer would have been covered
thereunder. In connection with any assumption or substitution agreement entered
into or to be entered into pursuant to Section 6.01, the Servicer


                                      -28-
<PAGE>

shall promptly notify the insurer under the related PMI Policy, if any, of such
assumption or substitution of liability in accordance with the terms of such PMI
Policy and shall take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a
condition to the continuation of coverage under such PMI Policy. If such PMI
Policy is terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of
liability, the Servicer shall obtain a replacement PMI Policy as provided above.

                  (b) With respect to each Mortgage Loan which has an LPMI
Policy, the Servicer shall maintain in full force and effect such LPMI Policy,
and from time to time, withdraw the premium with respect to such Mortgage Loans
from the Custodial Account in order to pay the premium thereon on a timely
basis. In the event that the interest payments made with respect to the Mortgage
Loan are less than the premium with respect to the LPMI Policy, the Servicer
shall advance from its own funds the amount of any such shortfall in the LPMI
Policy premiums, in payment of such premium. Any such advance shall be a
Servicing Advance subject to reimbursement pursuant to the provisions on Section
4.05. In the event that such LPMI Policy shall be terminated, the Servicer shall
obtain from another Qualified Insurer a comparable replacement policy, with a
total coverage equal to the remaining coverage of such terminated LPMI Policy,
at substantially the same fee level. If the insurer shall cease to be a
Qualified Insurer, the Servicer shall determine whether recoveries under the
LPMI Policy are jeopardized for reasons related to the financial condition of
such insurer, it being understood that the Servicer shall in no event have any
responsibility or liability for any failure to recover under the LPMI Policy for
such reason. If the Servicer determines that recoveries are so jeopardized, it
shall notify the Master Servicer and obtain from another Qualified Insurer a
replacement insurance policy. The Servicer shall not take any action which would
result in noncoverage under any applicable LPMI Policy of any loss which, but
for the actions of the Servicer would have been covered thereunder. In
connection with any assumption or substitution agreement entered into or to be
entered into pursuant to Section 6.01, the Servicer shall promptly notify the
insurer under the related LPMI Policy, if any, of such assumption or
substitution of liability in accordance with the terms of such LPMI Policy and
shall take all actions which may be required by such insurer as a condition to
the continuation of coverage under such LPMI Policy. If such LPMI Policy is
terminated as a result of such assumption or substitution of liability, the
Servicer shall obtain a replacement LPMI Policy as provided above.

                  (c) In connection with its activities as servicer, the
Servicer agrees to prepare and present, on behalf of itself and the Owner,
claims to the insurer under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy in a timely fashion in
accordance with the terms of such PMI Policy or LPMI Policy and, in this regard,
to take such action as shall be necessary to permit recovery under any PMI
Policy or LPMI Policy respecting a defaulted Mortgage Loan. Any amounts
collected by the Servicer under any PMI Policy or LPMI Policy shall be deposited
in the Custodial Account.

                  (d) The Owner, in its sole discretion, at any time, may
(i) either obtain an additional PMI Policy on any Mortgage Loan which already
has an PMI Policy in place, or (ii) obtain a PMI Policy for any Mortgage Loan
which does not already have a PMI Policy in place. In any event, the Servicer
agrees to administer such PMI Policies or LPMI Policies in accordance with this
Agreement.

                  Section 4.16 Title, Management and Disposition of REO
Property.

                  In the event that title to any Mortgaged Property is acquired
in foreclosure or by deed in lieu of foreclosure, the deed or certificate of
sale shall be taken in the name of the Servicer or its designee (or MERS, as
applicable) or such other Person as may be designated by the Master Servicer, or
in the event the Servicer or its designee (or MERS, as applicable) is not
authorized or permitted to hold title to real property in the state where the
REO Property is located, or would be adversely affected under the "doing
business" or tax laws of such state by so holding title, the deed or certificate
of sale shall be taken in the name of such Person or Persons as shall be
consistent with an Opinion of Counsel obtained by the Servicer from any attorney
duly licensed to practice law in the state where the REO Property is located.
The Person or Persons holding such title other than the Owner shall acknowledge
in writing that such title is being held as nominee for the Owner.

                  The Servicer shall manage, conserve, protect and operate each
REO Property for the Owner solely for the purpose of its prompt disposition and
sale. The Servicer, either itself or through an agent selected by the Servicer,
shall manage, conserve, protect and operate the REO Property in the same manner
that it manages, conserves, protects and operates other foreclosed property for
its own account, and in the same manner that similar property in the same
locality as the REO Property is managed. The Servicer shall attempt to sell the
same (and may temporarily rent the same for a period not greater than one year,
except as otherwise provided below) on such terms and conditions as the Servicer
deems to be in the best interest of the Owner.

                  The Servicer shall use its best efforts to dispose of the REO
Property as soon as possible and shall sell such REO Property in any event
within three years after title has been taken to such REO Property, unless (i) a
REMIC, FASIT or REIT election has not been made with respect to the arrangement
under which the Mortgage Loans and the REO Property are held and (ii) the
Servicer determines, and gives an appropriate notice to the Master Servicer to
such effect, that a longer period is necessary for the orderly liquidation of
such REO Property. If a period longer than three years is permitted under the
foregoing sentence and is necessary to sell any REO Property, the Servicer shall
report monthly to the Master Servicer as to the progress being made in selling
such REO Property. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Servicer
shall not be required to provide financing for the sale of any REO Property.

                  The Servicer shall also maintain on each REO Property fire and
hazard insurance with extended coverage in amount which is at least equal to the
maximum insurable value of the improvements which are a part of such property,
liability insurance and, to the extent required and available under the Flood
Disaster Protection Act of 1973, as amended, flood insurance in the amount
required above.

                  Subject to the approval of the Master Servicer as described in
this paragraph, the disposition of REO Property shall be carried out by the
Servicer at such price, and upon such terms and conditions, as the Servicer
deems to be in the best interests of the Owner. Prior to acceptance by the
Servicer of an offer to sell any REO Property, the Servicer shall notify the
Master Servicer of such offer in writing which notification shall set forth all
material terms of said offer (each a "Notice of Sale"). The Master Servicer
shall be deemed to have approved the


                                      -30-
<PAGE>

sale of any REO Property unless the Master Servicer notifies the Servicer in
writing, within five (5) days after its receipt of the related Notice of Sale,
that it disapproves of the related sale, in which case the Servicer shall not
proceed with such sale. The proceeds of sale of the REO Property shall be
promptly deposited in the Custodial Account. As soon as practical thereafter the
expenses of such sale shall be paid and the Servicer shall reimburse itself for
any related unreimbursed Servicing Advances, unpaid Servicing Fees and
unreimbursed advances made pursuant to Section 5.03, and on the Remittance Date
immediately following the Principal Prepayment Period in which such sale
proceeds are received the net cash proceeds of such sale remaining in the
Custodial Account shall be distributed to the Owner.

                  With the prior consent of the Master Servicer, the Servicer
shall withdraw from the Custodial Account funds necessary to reimburse the
Servicer for costs and expenses approved by the Master Servicer and incurred by
the Servicer in connection with the proper operation, management and maintenance
of the REO Property, including the cost of maintaining any hazard insurance
pursuant to Section 4.10. The Servicer shall make monthly distributions on each
Remittance Date to the Owner of the net cash flow from the REO Property (which
shall equal the revenues from such REO Property net of the expenses described in
this Section 4.16 and of any reserves reasonably required from time to time to
be maintained to satisfy anticipated liabilities for such expenses).

                  Notwithstanding the foregoing, at any time and from time to
time, the Owner may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to one
or more REO Properties as provided by Section 11.02.

                  Section 4.17 Real Estate Owned Reports.

                  Together with the statement furnished pursuant to Section
5.02, the Servicer shall furnish to the Master Servicer on or before the
Reporting Date of each month a statement with respect to any REO Property
covering the operation of such REO Property for the previous month and the
Servicer's efforts in connection with the sale of such REO Property and any
rental of such REO Property incidental to the sale thereof for the previous
month. That statement shall be accompanied by such other information as the
Master Servicer or the Owner shall reasonably request.

                  Section 4.18 Liquidation Reports.

                  Upon the foreclosure sale of any Mortgaged Property or the
acquisition thereof by the Owner pursuant to a deed in lieu of foreclosure, the
Servicer shall submit to the Master Servicer a liquidation report with respect
to such Mortgaged Property.

                  Section 4.19 Notification of Adjustments.

                  With respect to each Mortgage Loan that is an ARM Mortgage
Loan, the Servicer shall adjust the Mortgage Interest Rate on the related
Interest Rate Adjustment Date in compliance with the requirements of applicable
law and the related Mortgage and Mortgage Note. The Servicer shall execute and
deliver any and all necessary notices required under


                                      -31-
<PAGE>

applicable law and the terms of the related Mortgage Note and Mortgage regarding
the Mortgage Interest Rate adjustments. The Servicer shall promptly, upon
written request therefor, deliver to the Owner such notifications and any
additional applicable data regarding such adjustments and the methods used to
calculate and implement such adjustments. Upon the discovery by the Servicer or
the receipt of notice from the Owner that the Servicer has failed to adjust a
Mortgage Interest Rate in accordance with the terms of the related Mortgage
Note, the Servicer shall immediately deposit in the Custodial Account from its
own funds the amount of any interest loss or deferral caused the Owner thereby.

                  Section 4.20 Reports of Foreclosures and Abandonments of
Mortgaged Property.

                  Following the foreclosure sale or abandonment of any Mortgaged
Property, the Servicer shall report such foreclosure or abandonment as required
pursuant to Section 6050J of the Code.

                  Section 4.21. MERS.

                  In the case of each MERS Eligible Mortgage Loan, at the
request of the Master Servicer, the Servicer shall record the Assignment of
Mortgage into MERS and shall create MERS identification numbers relating to each
Mortgage Loan in the manner required by MERS. The Servicer shall pay all MERS
registration fees. As soon as practicable after the Master Servicer's request
from time to time (but in no event more than 30 days thereafter with respect to
each Mortgage Loan that was a MERS Mortgage Loan as of the Commencement Date, or
90 days thereafter with respect to each Mortgage Loan that was a MERS Eligible
Mortgage Loan as of the Commencement Date), the Servicer shall take such actions
as are necessary to cause the Owner or any successor Owner to be clearly
identified as the owner of each MERS Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for
purposes of the system of recording transfers of beneficial ownership of
mortgages maintained by MERS. The Servicer shall maintain in good standing its
membership in MERS. In addition, the Servicer shall comply with all rules,
policies and procedures of MERS, including the Rules of Membership, as amended,
and the MERS Procedures Manual, as amended. With respect to all MERS Mortgage
Loans serviced hereunder, the Servicer shall promptly notify MERS as to any
transfer of beneficial ownership or release of any security interest in such
Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall cooperate with the Owner, the Master Servicer
and any successor owner or successor servicer to the extent necessary to ensure
that any transfer of ownership or servicing is appropriately reflected on the
MERS system.

                  Section 4.22 Waiver of Prepayment Charges.

                  Except as provided below, the Servicer or any designee of the
Servicer shall not waive any Prepayment Charge with respect to any Mortgage
Loan. If the Servicer or its designee fails to collect a Prepayment Charge at
the time of the related prepayment of any Mortgage Loan subject to such
Prepayment Charge, the Servicer shall pay to the Owner at such time (by deposit
to the Custodial Account) an amount equal to the amount of the Prepayment Charge
not collected. Notwithstanding the above, the Servicer or its designee may waive

Charge only if the related

prepayment is not the result of a refinancing by the Servicer or its designee
and such waiver (i) relates to a defaulted Mortgage Loan or a reasonably
foreseeable default, such waiver is standard and customary in servicing similar
mortgage loans to the Mortgage Loans, and such waiver, in the reasonable
judgment of the Servicer, would maximize recovery of total proceeds from the
Mortgage Loan, taking into account the amount of such Prepayment Charge and the
related Mortgage Loan, or (ii) relates to a Prepayment Charge the collection of
which, in the reasonable judgment of the Servicer, would be a violation of
applicable laws.

                  Section 4.23. Compliance With REMIC Provisions

                  If a REMIC election has been made with respect to the
arrangement under which any Mortgage Loans and REO Property are held, the
Servicer shall not take any action, cause the REMIC to take any action or fail
to take (or fail to cause to be taken) any action that, under the REMIC
Provisions, if taken or not taken, as the case may be, could (i) endanger the
status of the REMIC as a REMIC, or (ii) result in the imposition of a tax upon
the REMIC (including but not limited to the tax on "prohibited transactions" as
defined in Section 860F(a)(2) of the Code and the tax on "contributions" to a
REMIC set forth in Section 860G(d) of the Code) unless the Servicer has received
an Opinion of Counsel (at the expense of the party seeking to take such action)
to the effect that the contemplated action will not endanger such REMIC status
or result in the imposition of any such tax.

(net of charges against or withdrawals from the Custodial Account pursuant to
Section 4.05), plus (b) all amounts, if any, which the Servicer is obligated to

Principal Prepayments received after the applicable Principal Prepayment Period

any additional interest required to be deposited in the Custodial Account in
connection with such Principal Prepayment in accordance with Section 4.04(vii),
and minus (d) any amounts attributable to Monthly Payments collected but due on

both Reconstituted Mortgage Loans and Mortgage Loans that have not been subject

transfers to the Master Servicer, one relating to Reconstituted Mortgage Loans
and one relating to all Mortgage Loans that are not then subject to a
Reconstitution.

the Servicer shall pay to the Owner interest on any such late payment at an

with the Business Day on which such payment is made, both inclusive. Such
interest shall be remitted along with the distribution payable on the next

                  Section 5.02 Statements to Master Servicer.

                  Not later than the Reporting Date of each month, the Servicer
shall furnish to the Master Servicer a monthly remittance advice, with a trial
balance report attached thereto, in the form of Exhibit D-1 annexed hereto,
together with a delinquency report in the form of Exhibit D-2 annexed hereto, in
hard copy and electronic medium mutually acceptable to the parties as to the
period ending on the Record Date in the preceding calendar month. Such monthly
remittance advice shall also be accompanied with a supplemental report provided
to the Master Servicer and any other party designated by the Master Servicer
which includes on an aggregate basis for the previous Due Period (i) the amount
of claims filed under PMI Policies and LPMI Policies, (ii) the amount of any
claim payments made under PMI Policies and LPMI Policies, (iii) the amount of
claims denied or curtailed under PMI Policies and LPMI Policies and (iv) PMI
Policies canceled with respect to those Mortgage Loans covered by any PMI Policy
purchased by the Owner.

                  With respect to any month in which the Servicer is servicing
both Reconstituted Mortgage Loans and Mortgage Loans that have not been subject
to a Reconstitution, the Servicer shall submit all information required
hereunder in two (2) separate reports, one relating to Reconstituted Mortgage
Loans and one relating to all Mortgage Loans that are not then subject to a
Reconstitution.

                  Upon reasonable advance notice, the Servicer shall provide to
any Owner that is a savings and loan association, a bank, an insurance company
or other regulated or supervised entity reports and access to information and
documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated
hereby sufficient to permit the Owner to comply with the applicable regulations
of relevant regulatory or supervisory authorities with respect to its investment
in the Mortgage Loans and the Owner's internal and third-party audit
requirements.

                  The Servicer shall prepare and file any and all tax returns,
information statements or other filings required to be delivered to any
governmental taxing authority or to any Owner pursuant to any applicable law
with respect to the Mortgage Loans and the transactions contemplated hereby. In
addition, the Servicer shall provide each Owner and the Master Servicer with
such information concerning the Mortgage Loans as is necessary for such Owner to
prepare its federal income tax return as any Owner or the Master Servicer may
reasonably request from time to time.

                  Section 5.03 Monthly Advances by Servicer.

                  On the Business Day immediately preceding each Remittance
Date, the Servicer shall deposit in the Custodial Account from its own funds an
amount equal to all Monthly Payments (with interest adjusted to the Mortgage
Loan Remittance Rate) which were due on the Mortgage Loans during the applicable
Due Period and which were delinquent at the close of business on the immediately
preceding Determination Date or which were deferred pursuant to Section 4.01.
The Servicer's obligation to make such Monthly Advances as to any Mortgage Loan
will continue through the last Monthly Payment due prior to the payment in full
of the Mortgage Loan, or through the last Remittance Date prior to the
Remittance Date for the distribution of all Liquidation Proceeds and other
payments or recoveries (including Insurance


                                      -35-
<PAGE>

Proceeds and Condemnation Proceeds) with respect to the Mortgage Loan.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Servicer shall not be required to make a
Monthly Advance with respect to a Mortgage Loan if such advance would, if made,
be, in the Servicer's reasonable judgment, non-recoverable from future
recoveries in respect of the Mortgage Loan or Mortgaged Property. The
determination by the Servicer that any advance of funds is or would be
non-recoverable shall be evidenced by an Officer's Certificate of the Servicer
delivered to the Master Servicer.

                  Section 5.04 Failure to Provide Timely Reports.

                  In the event the Services fails to provide any reports
required hereunder to the Owner and Master Servicer accurately, completely and
timely, in order to compensate the Master servicer for the additional
administrative burden of processing such inaccurate, incomplete or untimely
reports, and in addition to any other rights or remedies that the Owner or the
Master Servicer may have, the Servicer shall pay the following fees to the
Master Servicer.

                    1.   For the first such failure, the amount of $1,000;

                    2.   For the second such failure, the amount of $1,500; and

                    3.   For the third such failure and each failure thereafter,
                         the amount of $2,500;

                  Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the fourth
such failure in any successive twenty-four month period shall, at the option of
the Master Servicer, constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement without
any cure period available to the Servicer.

                  Section 5.05 Credit Reporting.

                  For each Mortgage Loan, in accordance with Accepted Servicing
Practices, the Servicer will accurately and fully report its underlying borrower
credit files to each of the following credit repositories or their successors:
Equifax Credit Information Services, Inc., Trans Union, LLC and Experian
Information Solution, Inc., on a monthly basis in a timely manner.


                                   ARTICLE VI

                          GENERAL SERVICING PROCEDURES

                  Section 6.01 Transfers of Mortgaged Property.

                  The Servicer shall use its best efforts to enforce any
"due-on-sale" provision contained in any Mortgage or Mortgage Note and to deny
assumption by the person to whom the Mortgaged Property has been or is about to
be sold whether by absolute conveyance or by contract of sale, and whether or
not the Mortgagor remains liable on the Mortgage and the Mortgage Note. When the
Mortgaged Property has been conveyed by the Mortgagor, the Servicer shall, to
the extent it has knowledge of such conveyance, exercise its rights to
accelerate the maturity of such Mortgage Loan under the "due-on-sale" clause
applicable thereto, provided,


                                      -36-
<PAGE>

however, that the Servicer shall not exercise such rights if prohibited by law
from doing so or if the exercise of such rights would impair or threaten to
impair any recovery under the related PMI Policy or LPMI Policy, if any.

                  If the Servicer reasonably believes it is unable under
applicable law to enforce such "due-on-sale" clause, the Servicer shall enter
into (i) an assumption and modification agreement with the person to whom such
property has been conveyed, pursuant to which such person becomes liable under
the Mortgage Note and the original Mortgagor remains liable thereon or (ii) in
the event the Servicer is unable under applicable law to require that the
original Mortgagor remain liable under the Mortgage Note and the Servicer has
the prior consent of the primary mortgage guaranty insurer, a substitution of
liability agreement with the purchaser of the Mortgaged Property pursuant to
which the original Mortgagor is released from liability and the purchaser of the
Mortgaged Property is substituted as Mortgagor and becomes liable under the
Mortgage Note. If an assumption fee is collected by the Servicer for entering
into an assumption agreement, a portion of such fee, up to an amount equal to
one-half of one percent (0.5%) of the outstanding principal balance of the
related Mortgage Loan, will be retained by the Servicer as additional servicing
compensation, and any portion thereof in excess of one-half of one percent
(0.5%) shall be deposited in the Custodial Account for the benefit of the Owner.
In connection with any such assumption, neither the Mortgage Interest Rate borne
by the related Mortgage Note, the term of the Mortgage Loan nor the outstanding
principal amount of the Mortgage Loan shall be changed.

                  To the extent that any Mortgage Loan is assumable, the
Servicer shall inquire diligently into the creditworthiness of the proposed
transferee, and shall use the underwriting criteria for approving the credit of
the proposed transferee which are used by Fannie Mae with respect to
underwriting mortgage loans of the same type as the Mortgage Loans. If the
credit of the proposed transferee does not meet such underwriting criteria, the
Servicer diligently shall, to the extent permitted by the Mortgage or the
Mortgage Note and by applicable law, accelerate the maturity of the Mortgage
Loan.

                  Section 6.02 Satisfaction of Mortgages and Release of Mortgage
Files.

                  Upon the payment in full of any Mortgage Loan, or the receipt
by the Servicer of a notification that payment in full will be escrowed in a
manner customary for such purposes, the Servicer shall notify the Owner and the
Master Servicer in the Monthly Remittance Advice as provided in Section 5.02,
and may request the release of any Mortgage Loan Documents.

                  If the Servicer satisfies or releases a Mortgage without first
having obtained payment in full of the indebtedness secured by the Mortgage or
should the Servicer otherwise prejudice any rights the Owner may have under the
mortgage instruments, upon written demand of the Owner, the Servicer shall
repurchase the related Mortgage Loan at the Repurchase Price by deposit thereof
in the Custodial Account within two (2) Business Days of receipt of such demand
by the Owner. The Servicer shall maintain the Fidelity Bond and Errors and
Omissions Insurance Policy as provided for in Section 4.12 insuring the Servicer
against any loss it may sustain with respect to any Mortgage Loan not satisfied
in accordance with the procedures set forth herein.

                  Section 6.03 Servicing Compensation.

                  As compensation for its services hereunder, the Servicer shall
be entitled to withdraw from the Custodial Account or to retain from interest
payments on the Mortgage Loans the amount of its Servicing Fee. The Servicing
Fee shall be payable monthly and shall be computed on the basis of the same
unpaid principal balance and for the period respecting which any related
interest payment on a Mortgage Loan is computed. The Servicing Fee shall be
payable only at the time of and with respect to those Mortgage Loans for which
payment is in fact made of the entire amount of the Monthly Payment. The
obligation of the Owner to pay the Servicing Fee is limited to, and payable
solely from, the interest portion of such Monthly Payments collected by the
Servicer.

                  Additional servicing compensation in the form of assumption
fees, to the extent provided in Section 6.01, and late payment charges shall be
retained by the Servicer to the extent not required to be deposited in the
Custodial Account. Prepayment Charges shall be the property of the Owner and
shall be deposited in the Custodial Account in accordance with Section 4.22. The
Servicer shall be required to pay all expenses incurred by it in connection with
its servicing activities hereunder and shall not be entitled to reimbursement
thereof except as specifically provided for herein.

                  Section 6.04 Annual Statement as to Compliance.

                  The Servicer shall deliver to the Master Servicer, on or
before March 31 each year beginning with March 31 of the year following the date
of the execution and delivery of this Agreement, an Officer's Certificate,
stating that (i) a review of the activities of the Servicer during the preceding
calendar year and of performance under this Agreement has been made under such
officer's supervision, (ii) the Servicer has complied fully with the provisions
of Article II and Article IV, and (iii) to the best of such officer's knowledge,
based on such review, the Servicer has fulfilled all its obligations under this
Agreement throughout such year, or, if there has been a default in the
fulfillment of any such obligation, specifying each such default known to such
officer and the nature and status thereof and the action being taken by the
Servicer to cure such default.

                  Section 6.05 Annual Independent Public Accountants' Servicing
Report.

                  On or before March 31st of each year beginning with March 31
of the year following the date of the execution and delivery of this Agreement,
the Servicer, at its expense, shall cause a firm of independent public
accountants which is a member of the American Institute of Certified Public
Accountants to furnish a statement to the Master Servicer to the effect that,
with respect to the most recently ended fiscal year, such firm has examined
certain documents and records relating to the servicing of the Mortgage Loans
and the Servicer's performance of its servicing obligations under this Agreement
and that such firm is of the opinion that the provisions of Article II and
Article IV have been complied with, and that, on the basis of such examination
conducted substantially in compliance with the Uniform Single Attestation
Program for Mortgage Bankers, nothing has come to their attention which would
indicate that such servicing has not been conducted in compliance therewith,
except for (i) such exceptions as such


                                      -38-
<PAGE>

firm shall believe to be immaterial; and (ii) such other exceptions as shall be
set forth in such statement.

                  Section 6.06 Right to Examine Servicer Records.

                  The Owner and the Master Servicer shall have the right to
examine and audit any and all of the books, records, or other information of the
Servicer, whether held by the Servicer or by another on its behalf, with respect
to or concerning this Agreement or the Mortgage Loans or the performance by the
Servicer of its obligations hereunder, during business hours or at such other
times as may be reasonable under applicable circumstances, upon reasonable
advance notice.

                  The Servicer shall provide to the Owner, the Master Servicer
and any supervisory agents or examiners representing a state or federal
governmental agency having jurisdiction over the Owner or the Master Servicer,
including without limitation the OTS, the FDIC and other similar entities,
access to any documentation regarding the Mortgage Loans in the possession of
the Servicer that is required by any applicable regulations. Such access shall
be afforded without charge, upon reasonable request, during normal business
hours, at the offices of the Servicer and in accordance with any applicable
regulations.

                         RECONSTITUTION; MASTER SERVICER

                  Section 7.01 Reconstitution.

                  The Owner and the Servicer agree that with respect to some or
all of the Mortgage Loans, from time to time the Owner shall effect an Agency
Transfer, a Pass-Through Transfer or a Whole Loan Transfer, in each case
retaining the Servicer as the servicer thereof, or as applicable, the
"seller/servicer". Any Mortgage Loans that have been transferred by the initial
Owner pursuant to an Agency Transfer, a Pass-Through Transfer or a Whole Loan
Transfer may be referred to as "Reconstituted Mortgage Loans",

                  The Servicer shall cooperate fully with the Owner in
connection with any Reconstitution contemplated by the Owner pursuant to this
Section 7.01, including without limitation providing requested information and
reports to, and otherwise cooperating with, rating agencies, trustees,
securities administrators, guarantors, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, third party
purchasers or credit risk managers, as applicable. In that connection, the
Servicer shall provide to Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee, master servicer
or a third party purchaser, as the case may be, and/or the Owner: (i) any and
all information and appropriate verification of information which may be
reasonably available to the Servicer, including the Servicer's foreclosure and
delinquency experience, whether through letters of its auditors and counsel or
otherwise, as the Owner shall request; and (ii) such additional representations,
warranties, covenants, opinions of counsel, letters from auditors, and
certificates of public officials or officers of the Servicer as are reasonably
believed necessary by any Reconstitution Party, rating agency or the Owner, as
the case may be, in connection with such Reconstitution transactions. In
addition, the Servicer shall


                                      -39-
<PAGE>

indemnify the Owner and any Reconstitution Party for any material misstatements
contained in the information provided pursuant to the preceding sentence that
the Owner may disclose in any securitization offering materials.

                  The Owner or the Master Servicer shall provide the Servicer
with notice with respect to any such Reconstitution in the form of Exhibit F
hereto (each, a "Transfer Notice"), including a schedule of Mortgage Loans which
have been transferred and the effective date of the Reconstitution (the
"Effective Date"), the Cut-Off Date, the Master Servicer, the new Owner, and
whether or not the Mortgage Loans are owned by a REMIC. Upon receipt of a
Transfer Notcie, the Servicer shall promptly countersign and return the Transfer
Notice to the Master Servicer. Upon the Effective Date of such a transfer, (A)
the Servicer and Owner agree that the provisions of this Agreement shall remain
in effect, and (B) the Servicer agrees to recognize Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the
trustee, trust or third party purchaser of the transferred Mortgage Loans in
such Reconstitution as the "Owner" of such Mortgage Loans, having the same
rights under this Agreement as the initial Owner with respect to such
transferred Mortgage Loans.

                  In connection with any Reconstitution and at the request of
the Owner or the Master Servicer, on not less than five (5) days notice, the
Servicer shall execute and deliver a certificate, in form and substance
acceptable to the Owner, acknowledging and certifying to the Owner and the
Master Servicer that: (i) the Servicer has received the Transfer Notice, and
attaching the related schedule of Mortgage Loans included in such Reconstitution
(which schedule shall include such Mortgage Loan data as may reasonably be
requested by the Owner or the Master Servicer), (ii) this Agreement is in full
force and effect in accordance with its terms, (iii) no Event of Default has
occurred under this Agreement, nor does there exist any state of facts that,
with the giving of notice or passage of time, or both, would constitute an Event
of Default under this Agreement, (iv) each of the representations and warranties
of the Servicer contained in Section 3.01 are true and correct as of the related
Effective Date as if made on such date and (v) the Servicer agrees to recognize
Fannie Mae, Freddie Mace, the trustee, trust or third party purchaser of the
transferred Mortgage Loans in such Agency Transfer, Whole Loan Transfer or
Pass-Through Transfer as the "Owner" of the related Mortgage Loans, having the
same rights under this Agreement as the initial Owner with respect to such
Mortgage Loans

                  With respect to each MERS Mortgage Loan, the Servicer shall
take such actions as are necessary to cause Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, the trustee
or such third party, as the case may be, to be clearly identified as the owner
of each MERS Mortgage Loan on the records of MERS for purposes of the system of
recording transfers of beneficial ownership of mortgages maintained by MERS.

                  Section 7.02 Master Servicer; Servicer's Guide.

                  (a) The Owner has appointed Aurora Loan Services Inc., or
such other master servicer as may be identified in a Transfer Notice, to act as
master servicer of the Mortgage Loans. The Servicer shall correspond,
communicate and report solely to the Master Servicer, as if the Master Servicer
were the "Owner" hereunder. All amounts due to the Owner under this Agreement
shall be remitted to the Master Servicer in accordance with the Master
Servicer's instructions. Furthermore, the Master Servicer shall have all rights
as designee of the Owner to


                                      -40-
<PAGE>

enforce the representations and warranties, and all other covenants and
conditions set forth in this Agreement, and the Servicer shall follow and shall
be entitled to rely on the instructions of the Master Servicer under this
Agreement as if such instructions were the instructions of the Owner. The Master
Servicer shall have the right to give any waivers or consents required or
allowed under this Agreement on behalf of the Owner, and the Servicer shall have
the right to rely on all such waivers and consents. The Master Servicer shall be
empowered to enter into and execute and deliver any amendments or modifications
to this Agreement as the Owner's designee hereunder, and such amendments or
modifications shall be binding upon the Owner as if the Owner had executed and
delivered the same. The Master Servicer may, at any time, without the Servicer's
consent, direct in writing that all or part of the functions of the Master
Servicer be performed by another entity designated by the Master Servicer for
such functions and time periods as the Master Servicer deems appropriate. The
Owner may, at any time (but subject to any agreements between the Owner and the
Master Servicer), without the Servicer's consent, appoint a successor master
servicer to act as master servicer with respect to some or all of the Mortgage
Loans serviced by the Servicer hereunder. In such case, any successor Master
Servicer has the right to assume the Master Servicer's rights and obligations
and to enforce Servicer's obligations hereunder.

                  (b) Upon thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the
Servicer, the Master Servicer may publish a Servicer's Guide (as the same may be
modified or amended from time to time, the "Servicer's Guide"), which shall set
forth various terms, provisions and procedures governing the administration and
servicing of the Mortgage Loans; provided, that the Servicer's Guide shall not
materially and adversely increase the obligations of the Servicer arising under
this Agreement. If the Servicer does not notify the Master Servicer in writing
within such thirty (30) day period that the Servicer objects to the Servicer's
Guide or any provisions thereof, the Servicer shall be deemed to have agreed to
be bound and abide by the procedures, terms and conditions set forth in the
Servicer's Guide. Thereafter, the Master Servicer may amend the Servicer's Guide
from time to time to: (i) correct ambiguous or erroneous provisions; (ii) make
changes necessary or helpful to maintain compliance with Acceptable Servicing
Practices; or (iii) make such other modifications that the Master Servicer deems
advisable that do not materially and adversely increase the obligations of, or
decrease the benefits to, the Servicer. Each such amendment will be made by
means of a written notice to the Servicer. The written notice will specify the
terms of the amendment and the effective date. If the Servicer does not notify
the Master Servicer in writing that the Servicer objects to such amendment prior
to the proposed effective date specified in the Notice, the Servicer shall be
deemed to have agreed to the amendment, and such amendment shall automatically
become effective without any further notice or action on the part of the Master
Servicer or the Servicer. Amendments to the Servicer's Guide shall be made with
the consent of the Owner of the Mortgage Loans, which consent shall not
unreasonably be withheld or delayed; provided, that the failure of the Master
Servicer to obtain the consent of the Owner to any amendment shall not impair
the enforceability of any such amendment against the Servicer. To the extent of
any conflict between the express provisions of this Agreement and the provisions
of the Servicer's Guide, the express provisions of this Agreement shall control.
The failure by the Servicer to perform obligations under the Servicer's Guide
shall constitute an Event of Default under this Agreement.

                              SERVICER TO COOPERATE

                  Section 8.01 Provision of Information.

                  During the term of this Agreement, the Servicer shall furnish
to the Owner such periodic, special, or other reports or information and copies
or originals of any documents contained in the Servicing File for each Mortgage
Loan, whether or not provided for herein, as shall be necessary, reasonable, or
appropriate with respect to the Owner, any regulatory requirement pertaining to
the Owner or the purposes of this Agreement. All such reports, documents or
information shall be provided by and in accordance with all reasonable
instructions and directions which the Owner may give.

                  The Servicer shall execute and deliver all such instruments
and take all such action as the Owner may reasonably request from time to time,
in order to effectuate the purposes and to carry out the terms of this
Agreement.

statement is available, as well as a Consolidated Statement of Condition at the
end of the last two fiscal years covered by such Consolidated Statement of
Operations. The Servicer also shall make available any comparable interim
statements to the extent any such statements have been prepared by or on behalf
of the Servicer (and are available upon request to members or stockholders of
the Servicer or to the public at large). If it has not already done so, the
Servicer shall furnish promptly to the Owner copies of the statement specified

                  The Servicer also shall make available to the Owner or
prospective Owner a knowledgeable financial or accounting officer for the
purpose of answering questions respecting recent developments affecting the

of satisfying such prospective Owner that the Servicer have the ability to
service the Mortgage Loans as provided in this Agreement.

                                  THE SERVICER

                  Section 9.01 Indemnification; Third Party Claims.

                  The Servicer shall indemnify the Owner, the Master Servicer
and each Reconstitution Party, and hold each of them harmless against any and
all claims, losses, damages, penalties, fines, and forfeitures, including, but
not limited to reasonable legal fees and related costs, judgments, and any other
costs, fees and expenses that either of them may sustain in any way related to
(i) the failure of the Servicer to perform its duties and service the Mortgage
Loans in material compliance with the terms of this Agreement or (ii) the
failure of the Servicer to cause any event to occur which would have occurred if
the Servicer were applying Accepted Servicing Practices under this Agreement.
The Servicer immediately shall notify the Owner and the Master Servicer if a
claim is made by a third party with respect to this Agreement or the Mortgage
Loans, assume (with the prior written consent of the Master Servicer) the
defense of any such claim and pay all expenses in connection therewith,
including counsel fees, and promptly pay, discharge and satisfy any judgment or
decree which may be entered against it or the Owner, the Master Servicer or any
Reconstitution Party in respect of such claim. The Servicer shall follow any
written instructions received from the Owner or the Master Servicer in
connection with such claim.

                  Section 9.02 Merger or Consolidation of the Servicer.

                  The Servicer shall keep in full effect its existence, rights
and franchises as a corporation, and shall obtain and preserve its qualification
to do business as a foreign corporation in each jurisdiction in which such
qualification is or shall be necessary to protect the validity and
enforceability of this Agreement or any of the Mortgage Loans and to perform its
duties under this Agreement.

                  Any person into which the Servicer may be merged or
consolidated, or any corporation resulting from any merger, conversion or
consolidation to which the Servicer shall be a party, or any Person succeeding
to the business of the Servicer, shall be the successor of the Servicer
hereunder, without the execution or filing of any paper or any further act on
the part of any of the parties hereto, anything herein to the contrary
notwithstanding, provided, however, that the successor or surviving Person shall
be an institution (i) having a net worth of not less than $15,000,000 and (ii)
which is a Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac-approved servicer in good standing.

                  Section 9.03 Limitation on Liability of Servicer and Others.

                  Neither the Servicer nor any of the directors, officers,
employees or agents of the Servicer shall be under any liability to the Owner
for any action taken or for refraining from the taking of any action in good
faith pursuant to this Agreement, or for errors in judgment, provided, however,
that this provision shall not protect the Servicer or any such person against
any Breach of warranties or representations made herein, or failure to perform
its obligations in


                                      -43-
<PAGE>

strict compliance with any standard of care set forth in this Agreement, or any
liability which would otherwise be imposed by reason of any breach of the terms
and conditions of this Agreement. The Servicer and any director, officer,
employee or agent of the Servicer may rely in good faith on any document of any
kind prima facie properly executed and submitted by any Person respecting any
matters arising hereunder. The Servicer shall not be under any obligation to
appear in, prosecute or defend any legal action which is not incidental to its
duties to service the Mortgage Loans in accordance with this Agreement and which
in its opinion may involve it in any expense or liability, provided, however,
that the Servicer may, with the consent of the Owner, undertake any such action
which it may deem necessary or desirable in respect to this Agreement and the
rights and duties of the parties hereto. In such event, the Servicer shall be
entitled to reimbursement from the Owner the reasonable legal expenses and costs
of such action.

                  Section 9.04 Limitation on Resignation and Assignment by
Servicer.

                  The Owner has entered into this Agreement with the Servicer
and subsequent Owners will purchase the Mortgage Loans in reliance upon the
independent status of the Servicer, and the representations as to the adequacy
of its servicing facilities, plant, personnel, records and procedures, its
integrity, reputation and financial standing, and the continuance thereof.
Therefore, the Servicer shall neither assign this Agreement or the servicing
hereunder or delegate its rights or duties hereunder or any portion hereof or
sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its property or assets
without the prior written consent of the Owner, which consent shall be granted
or withheld in the sole discretion of the Owner. For purposes hereof, a merger,
consolidation or sale of a majority of the equity interests or voting power of
the Servicer shall be deemed an assignment of this Agreement.

                  The Servicer shall not resign from the obligations and duties
hereby imposed on it except by mutual consent of the Servicer and the Owner or
upon the determination that its duties hereunder are no longer permissible under
applicable law and such incapacity cannot be cured by the Servicer. Any such
determination permitting the resignation of the Servicer shall be evidenced by
an Opinion of Counsel to such effect delivered to the Owner which Opinion of
Counsel shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Owner. No such
resignation shall become effective until a successor shall have assumed the
Servicer's responsibilities and obligations hereunder in the manner provided in
Section 12.01.

                  Without in any way limiting the generality of this Section
9.04, in the event that the Servicer either shall assign this Agreement or the
servicing responsibilities hereunder or delegate its duties hereunder or any
portion thereof or sell or otherwise dispose of all or substantially all of its
property or assets, without the prior written consent of the Owner, then the
Owner shall have the right to terminate this Agreement upon notice given as set
forth in Section 10.01, without any payment of any penalty or damages and
without any liability whatsoever to the Servicer or any third party.

                  Section 9.05 Indemnification with Respect to Certain Taxes and
Loss of REMIC Status.

                  In the event that any REMIC under which any of the Mortgage
Loans are held


                                      -44-
<PAGE>

from time to time fails to qualify as a REMIC, loses its status as a REMIC, or
incurs federal, state or local taxes as a result of a prohibited transaction or
prohibited contribution under the REMIC Provisions due to the negligent
performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set forth herein, the
Servicer shall indemnify the Reconstitution Parties against any and all losses,
claims, damages, liabilities or expenses ("Losses") resulting from such
negligence; provided, however, that the Servicer shall not be liable for any
such Losses attributable to the action or inaction of the Reconstitution
Parties, nor for any such Losses resulting from misinformation provided by the
Reconstitution Parties on which the Servicer has relied. The foregoing shall not
be deemed to limit or restrict the rights and remedies of the Reconstitution
Parties now or hereafter existing at law or in equity or otherwise.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, in no event shall the Servicer have any
liability (1) for any action or omission that is taken in accordance with and in
compliance with the express terms of, or which is expressly permitted by the
terms of, this Agreement, (2) for any Losses other than arising out of a
negligent performance by the Servicer of its duties and obligations set forth
herein, and (3) for any special or consequential damages.

                  Each of the following shall constitute an Event of Default on
the part of the Servicer:

         any payment required to be made under the terms of this Agreement which
         continues unremedied for a period of two days after the date when such
         payment is due hereunder; or

                           (ii) failure by the Servicer duly to observe or
         perform in any material respect any other of the covenants or

         the case of a failure to provide any monthly reports required pursuant
         to this Agreement and (y)10 days, in the case of a failure to maintain
         any insurance policy required to be maintained pursuant to this
         Agreement) after the date on which written notice of such failure,
         requiring the same to be remedied, shall have been given to the
         Servicer by the Master Servicer, the Owner or by the Custodian; or

                           (iii) failure by the Servicer to maintain its license
         to do business in any jurisdiction where the Mortgage Property is
         located; or

                           (iv) a decree or order of a court or agency or

         similar proceedings, or for the winding-up or liquidation of its
         affairs, shall

<PAGE>

         have been entered against the Servicer and such decree or order shall
         have remained in force undischarged or unstayed for a period of 60
         days; or

                           (v) the Servicer shall consent to the appointment of
         a conservator or receiver or liquidator in any insolvency, readjustment
         of debt, marshaling of assets and liabilities or similar proceedings of
         or relating to the Servicer or of or relating to all or substantially
         all of its property; or

                           (vi) the Servicer shall admit in writing its
         inability to pay its debts generally as they become due, file a
         petition to take advantage of any applicable insolvency, bankruptcy or

         creditors, voluntarily suspend payment of its obligations or cease its
         normal business operations for three (3) Business Days; or

                           (vii) the Servicer ceases to meet the qualifications
         of a Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac approved servicer; or

                           (viii) the Servicer fails to maintain a minimum net
         worth, determined in accordance with United States Generally Accepted
         Accounting Principles, of $15,000,000 as of any date; or

                           (ix) the Servicer, if it is an Insured Depository
         Institution, shall become the subject of a cease and desist order of
         the Appropriate Federal Banking Agency or enter into a memorandum of
         understanding, consent agreement or any similar agreement with the
         Appropriate Federal Banking Agency, any of which, would have or is
         purportedly the result of, any condition which would have a material
         adverse effect on the Mortgage Loans, the Servicer, or the Servicer's
         ability to service the Mortgage Loans as provided hereunder; or

                           (x) the Servicer, if it is an Insured Depository

         or the servicing responsibilities hereunder or to delegate its duties
         hereunder or any portion thereof in violation of Section 9.04; or

                           (xii) an Event of Default arising under Section 5.04
         hereof.

                  In each and every such case, so long as an Event of Default
shall not have been remedied, in addition to whatsoever rights the Owner or the
Master Servicer may have at law or equity to damages, including injunctive
relief and specific performance, the Owner or the Master Servicer, by notice in
writing to the Servicer, may terminate all the rights and obligations of the
Servicer under this Agreement and in and to the Mortgage Loans and the proceeds
thereof.

                                      -46-
<PAGE>

                  Upon receipt by the Servicer of such written notice, all
authority and power of the Servicer under this Agreement, whether with respect
to the Mortgage Loans or otherwise, shall pass to and be vested in the successor
appointed pursuant to Section 12.01. Upon written request from any Owner or the
Master Servicer, the Servicer shall prepare, execute and deliver to the
successor entity designated by the Owner or the Master Servicer any and all
documents and other instruments, place in such successor's possession all
Mortgage Files, and do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or
appropriate to effect the purposes of such notice of termination, including but
not limited to the transfer and endorsement or assignment of the Mortgage Loans
and related documents, at the Servicer's sole expense. The Servicer shall
cooperate with the Owner, the Master Servicer and such successor in effecting
the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights hereunder,
including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for administration
by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by the Servicer to
the Custodial Account or Escrow Account or thereafter received with respect to
the Mortgage Loans.

                  Section 10.02 Waiver of Defaults.

                  By a written notice, the Owner may waive any default by the
Servicer in the performance of its obligations hereunder and its consequences.
Upon any waiver of a past default, such default shall cease to exist, and any
Event of Default arising therefrom shall be deemed to have been remedied for
every purpose of this Agreement. No such waiver shall extend to any subsequent
or other default or impair any right consequent thereon except to the extent
expressly so waived.

                  Section 10.03. Survival of Obligations and Liabilities of the
Servicer.

                  The representations, warranties, covenants, indemnities and
agreements of the parties provided in this Agreement and the parties'
obligations hereunder shall survive the execution and delivery and the
termination or expiration of this Agreement. Notwithstanding any termination of
the rights and obligations of the Servicer pursuant to this Article 10, the
Servicer shall remain liable for any actions of the Servicer taken prior to the
effective time of such termination. Any cause of action against the Servicer
relating to or arising out of the breach of its obligations under this Agreement
shall accrue upon (i) discovery of such Breach by the Servicer or notice thereof
by the Owner to the Servicer, (ii) failure by the Servicer to cure such breach
within the applicable cure period, and (iii) demand upon the Servicer by the
Owner for compliance with this Agreement.


                                   ARTICLE XI

                                   TERMINATION

                  Section 11.01 Termination.

                  This Agreement shall terminate upon either: (i) the later of
the final payment or other liquidation (or any advance with respect thereto) of
the last Mortgage Loan or the disposition of any REO Property with respect to
the last Mortgage Loan and the remittance of all


                                      -47-
<PAGE>

funds due hereunder; (ii) mutual consent of the Servicer and the Owner in
writing; or (iii) termination with or without cause under the terms of this
Agreement.

                  Section 11.02 Termination Without Cause.

                  The Initial Owner may terminate, at its sole option, any
rights the Servicer may have hereunder, without cause, as provided in this
Section 11.02. Any such notice of termination shall be in writing and delivered
to the Servicer by mail as provided in Section 12.05. The Owner and the Servicer
shall comply with the termination procedures set forth in Section 12.01 hereof,
provided that, in the event that the Initial Owner terminates this Agreement
without cause in accordance with this Section, the Initial Owner shall pay to
the Servicer a termination fee equal to two percent (2.0%) of the aggregate
unpaid principal balance of the Mortgage Loans as of the termination date.
Notwithstanding and in addition to the foregoing, in the event that (i) a
Mortgage Loan becomes delinquent for a period of 120 days or more (a "Delinquent
Mortgage Loan"), (ii) a Mortgage Loan becomes an REO Property or (iii) at any
time after the second anniversary of the date hereof there are fewer than [20]
Mortgage Loans that are not Reconstituted Mortgage Loans serviced hereunder, the
Owner may at its election terminate this Agreement with respect to such
Delinquent Mortgage Loan or REO Property or, in the case of (iii) above, all of
the remaining Mortgage Loans that are not Reconstituted Mortgage Loans, without
payment of a termination fee therefor, upon 15 days' written notice to the
Servicer.


                                   ARTICLE XII

                            MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS

                  Section 12.01 Successor to Servicer.

                  Prior to termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and
duties under this Agreement pursuant to Sections 9.04, 10.01, 11.01(ii) or
11.02, the Master Servicer shall (i) succeed to and assume all of the Servicer's
responsibilities, rights, duties and obligations under this Agreement or (ii)
appoint a successor having the characteristics set forth in clauses (i) and (ii)
of Section 9.02 and which shall succeed to all rights and assume all of the
responsibilities, duties and liabilities of the Servicer under this Agreement
prior to the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities, duties and
liabilities under this Agreement. In connection with such appointment and
assumption, the Master Servicer may make such arrangements for the compensation
of such successor out of payments on Mortgage Loans as it and such successor
shall agree. In the event that the Servicer's duties, responsibilities and
liabilities under this Agreement should be terminated pursuant to the
aforementioned sections, the Servicer shall discharge such duties and
responsibilities during the period from the date it acquires knowledge of such
termination until the effective date thereof with the same degree of diligence
and prudence which it is obligated to exercise under this Agreement, and shall
take no action whatsoever that might impair or prejudice the rights or financial
condition of its successor. The resignation or removal of the Servicer pursuant
to the aforementioned sections shall not become effective until a successor
shall be appointed pursuant to this Section 12.01 and shall in no event relieve
the Servicer of the representations and warranties made pursuant to Sections
3.01 and the remedies available to the Owner under Section 3.02, it being
understood and agreed that the


                                      -48-
<PAGE>

provisions of such Sections 3.01 and 3.02 shall be applicable to the Servicer
notwithstanding any such sale, assignment, resignation or termination of the
Servicer, or the termination of this Agreement.

                  Within a reasonable period of time, but in no event longer
than 30 days of the appointment of a successor entity, the Servicer shall
prepare, execute and deliver to the successor entity any and all documents and
other instruments, place in such successor's possession all Servicing Files, and
do or cause to be done all other acts or things necessary or appropriate to
effect the purposes of such notice of termination. The Servicer shall cooperate
with the Owner and the Master Servicer, as applicable, and such successor in
effecting the termination of the Servicer's responsibilities and rights
hereunder and the transfer of servicing responsibilities to the successor
Servicer, including without limitation, the transfer to such successor for
administration by it of all cash amounts which shall at the time be credited by
the Servicer to the Custodial Account or any Escrow Account or thereafter
received with respect to the Mortgage Loans.

                  Any successor appointed as provided herein shall execute,
acknowledge and deliver to the Servicer and to the Owner an instrument accepting
such appointment, wherein the successor shall make the representations and
warranties set forth in Section 3.01, whereupon such successor shall become
fully vested with all the rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations
and liabilities of the Servicer, with like effect as if originally named as a
party to this Agreement. Any termination or resignation of the Servicer or
termination of this Agreement pursuant to Section 9.04, 10.01, 11.01 or 11.02
shall not affect any claims that any Owner or the Master Servicer may have
against the Servicer arising out of the Servicer's actions or failure to act
prior to any such termination or resignation.

                  The Servicer shall deliver promptly (but in all events within
ten (10) Business Days) to the successor servicer the funds in the Custodial
Account and Escrow Account and all Mortgage Files and related documents and
statements held by it hereunder and the Servicer shall account for all funds and
shall execute and deliver such instruments and do such other things as may
reasonably be required to more fully and definitively vest in the successor all
such rights, powers, duties, responsibilities, obligations and liabilities of
the Servicer.

                  Upon a successor's acceptance of appointment as such, the
Servicer shall notify the Owner and Master Servicer of such appointment in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 12.05.

                  Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement, all reasonable
costs and expenses incurred in connection with any transfer of servicing as a
consequence of termination or removal of the Servicer pursuant to Section 10.01,
including, without limitation, the costs and expenses of the Owner or Master
Servicer or any other Person in appointing a successor servicer, or of the
Master Servicer in assuming the responsibilities of the Servicer hereunder, or
of transferring the Servicing Files and the other necessary data to the
successor servicer shall be paid by the terminated, removed or resigning
Servicer from its own funds without reimbursement.

provision, representation or warranty of this Agreement which is prohibited or
unenforceable or is held to be void or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall
be ineffective, as to such jurisdiction, to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any

invalidity.

executed, shall be deemed to be an original; such counterparts, together, shall
constitute one and the same agreement. Subject to Section 9.04, this Agreement
shall inure to the benefit of and be binding upon the Servicer and the Owner and
their respective successors and assigns.

Assignments of Mortgage is subject to recordation in all appropriate public
offices for real property records in all the counties or other comparable
jurisdictions in which any or all of the Mortgaged Properties are situated, and
in any other appropriate public recording office or elsewhere, such recordation
to be effected at the Owner's expense in the event recordation is either
necessary under applicable law or requested by the Owner at its sole option.

                  Section 12.10 Assignment by Owner.

                  The Owner shall have the right, without the consent of the
Servicer but subject to Section 7.01 hereof, to assign, in whole or in part, its
interest under this Agreement with respect to some or all of the Mortgage Loans,

designee shall accede to the rights and obligations hereunder of the Owner with

hereby agrees that it will not take any action or permit or cause any action to

or independent mortgage brokerage companies on the Servicer's behalf, to

the foregoing, it is understood and agreed that promotions undertaken by the
Servicer or any affiliate of the Servicer which are directed to the general
public at large, including, without limitation, mass mailing based on
commercially acquired mailing lists, newspaper, radio and television
advertisements shall not constitute solicitation under this Section.

                  Section 12.12 Protection of Confidential Information.

                  The Servicer shall keep confidential and shall not divulge to

auditors, taxing authorities or other governmental agencies.

                                     FORM OF
                              OFFICER'S CERTIFICATE

I, ____________________, hereby certify that I am the duly elected [Vice]
President of [_______________], a corporation organized under the laws of the
State of [_________], (the "Servicer") and further as follows: --------

                  1. Attached hereto as Attachment 1 is a true, correct and
         complete copy of the Articles of Incorporation of the Servicer which is
         in full force and effect on the date hereof and which has been in
         effect without amendment, waiver, rescission or modification since
         ____________.

                  2. Attached hereto as Attachment 2 is a true, correct and
         complete copy of the bylaws of the Servicer which are in effect on the
         date hereof and which have been in effect without amendment, waiver,
         rescission or modification.

                  3. Attached hereto as Attachment 3 is an original certificate
         of good standing of the Servicer, issued within ____ days of the date
         hereof by the secretary of State of the state of ________________, and
         no event has occurred since the date thereof which would impair such
         standing.

                  4. Each person who, as an officer or representative of the
         Servicer, signed the Correspondent Servicing Agreement, dated as of
         [DATE] (the "Servicing Agreement"), by and between the Servicer, Lehman
         Brothers Bank, FSB (the "Owner") and Aurora Loan Services Inc. (the
         "Master Servicer"), and any other document delivered prior hereto or on
         the date hereof in connection with the Agreement, was, at the
         respective times of such signing and delivery, and is now, a duly
         elected or appointed, qualified and acting officer or representative of
         the Servicer, and the signatures of such persons appearing on such
         documents are their genuine signatures.

                  5. To the best of my knowledge, either (i) no consent,
         approval, authorization or order of any court or governmental agency or
         body is required for the execution, delivery and performance by the
         Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with the Agreement or the
         consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Agreement; or (ii)
         any required consent, approval, authorization or order has been
         obtained by the Servicer.

                  6. To the best of my knowledge, neither the consummation of
         the transactions contemplated by, nor the fulfillment of the terms of
         the Servicing Agreement, conflicts or will conflict with or results or
         will result in a breach of or constitutes or will constitute a default
         under the charter or by-laws of the Servicer, the terms of any
         indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Servicer is a
         party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or any statute
         or order, rule, regulations,

                                      -D-1-

<PAGE>

         writ, injunction or decree of any court, governmental authority or
         regulatory body to which the Servicer is subject or by which it is
         bound.

                  7. To the best of my knowledge, there is no action, suit,
         proceeding or investigation pending or threatened against the Servicer
         which, in my judgment, either in any one instance or in the aggregate,
         may result in any material adverse change in the business, operations,
         financial condition, properties or assets of the Servicer or in any
         material impairment of the right or ability of the Servicer to carry on
         its business substantially as now conducted or in any material
         liability on the part of the Servicer or which would draw into question
         the validity of the Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in
         connection with the transactions contemplated hereby, or which would be
         likely to impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform
         under the terms of the Agreement.

                  9. The Servicer is duly authorized to engage in the
         transactions described and contemplated in the Servicing Agreement.

IN WITNESS WHEREOF, I have hereunto signed my name and affixed the seal of the
Servicer.

                                     FORM OF
                               OPINION OF COUNSEL


[DATE]




Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB
Three World Financial Center
New York, New York 10285

Aurora Loan Services Inc.
2530 South Parker Road
Suite 600
Aurora, Colorado 80014

Ladies and Gentlemen:

You have requested my opinion, as legal counsel to COLONIAL SAVINGS, F.A. (the
"Servicer"), with respect to certain matters in connection with the servicing by
the Servicer of the Mortgage Loans pursuant to that certain Correspondent
Servicing Agreement, dated as of [DATE] (the "Servicing Agreement"), by and
between the Servicer, Lehman Brothers Bank, FSB (the "Owner") and Aurora Loan
Services Inc. (the "Master Servicer"). Capitalized terms not otherwise defined
herein have the meanings set forth in the Agreement.

I have examined the Servicing Agreement and such other documents, records and
papers as I have deemed necessary and relevant as a basis for this opinion.

To the extent I have deemed necessary and proper, I have relied upon the
representations and warranties of the Servicer contained in the Servicing
Agreement. I have assumed the authenticity of all documents submitted to me as
originals, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of natural
persons and the conformity to the originals of all documents.

Subject to the foregoing, it is my opinion that:

1. The Servicer is a duly organized, validly existing corporation in good
standing under the laws of the State of [____________] and is authorized to
service and administer the Mortgage Loans in the states where the Mortgaged
Properties are located.

2. The Servicer has the power to engage in the transactions contemplated by the
Servicing Agreement and all requisite power, authority and legal right to
execute and deliver the Servicing Agreement, and to perform and observe the
terms and conditions of such instrument.

                                      -E-1-
<PAGE>

3. The Servicing Agreement has been duly authorized, executed and delivered by
the Servicer and is a legal, valid and binding agreement enforceable in
accordance with its respective terms against the Servicer, subject to bankruptcy
laws and other similar laws of general application affecting rights of creditors
and subject to the application of the rules of equity, including those
respecting the availability of specific performance.

4. Either (i) no consent, approval, authorization or order of any court or
governmental agency or body is required for the execution, delivery and
performance by the Servicer of or compliance by the Servicer with the Servicing
Agreement, or the servicing of the Mortgage Loans or the consummation of the
transactions contemplated by the Servicing Agreement; or (ii) any required
consent, approval, authorization or order has been obtained by the Servicer.

5. Neither the consummation of the transactions contemplated by, nor the
fulfillment of the terms of, the Servicing Agreement conflicts or will conflict
with or results or will result in a breach of, or constitutes or will constitute
a default under, the organization documents of the Servicer, the terms of any
material indenture or other agreement or instrument to which the Servicer is a
party or by which it is bound or to which it is subject, or violates any statute
or order, rule, regulations, writ, injunction or decree of any court,
governmental authority or regulatory body to which the Servicer is subject or by
which it is bound.

6. There is no action, suit, proceeding or investigation pending or, to the best
of my knowledge, threatened against the Servicer which, in my judgment, either
in any one instance or in the aggregate, may result in any material adverse
change in the business, operations, financial condition, properties or assets of
the Servicer or in any material impairment of the right or ability of the
Servicer to carry on its business substantially as now conducted or in any
material liability on the part of the Servicer or which would draw into question
the validity of the Servicing Agreement or of any action taken or to be taken in
connection with the transactions contemplated thereby, or which would be likely
to impair materially the ability of the Servicer to perform under the terms of
the Servicing Agreement.


                                            Very truly yours,
