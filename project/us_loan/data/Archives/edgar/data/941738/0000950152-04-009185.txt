Section 1 - Registrant's Business and Operations

         Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 23, 2004, Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation ("WPSC"), a
wholly owned subsidiary of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Corporation (the "Company"),
entered into a Letter of Intent (the "LOI") with Severstal North America, Inc.
("SNA"). A press release dated December 28, 2004 regarding the LOI is attached
hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and is incorporated herein by reference.

         Under the non-binding terms of the LOI, WPSC and SNA, or its affiliate,
would form a Delaware limited liability company (the "LLC") for the production
of coke and coke related products (the "Proposed Project"). As part of the
Proposed Project, WPSC would contribute its coke producing batteries and certain
related facilities and assets located at its facility in Follansbee, West
Virginia (the "Coke Facilities") and SNA is expected to make cash contributions
in the amount of $140 million to the LLC over four years. At the closing of the
Proposed Project, which is subject to each party's ongoing investigation of the
other, approval by each party's board of directors and the negotiation of
definitive documentation that will contain customary conditions, SNA would also
deliver cash in the amount of $20 million to WPSC.

         Under the binding terms of the LOI, WPSC has agreed not to solicit or
entertain offers from or negotiate any proposal or arrangement with any other
person relating to the formation of a joint venture to acquire the Coke
Facilities until at least 120 days following the termination date as defined in
the LOI. The termination date is the earlier of the date on which either party
provides the other party written notice of termination or March 31, 2005. The
LOI does not prohibit WPSC or its affiliates from pursuing any financing
activities, any sales of securities, any sales of assets, a sale of all or
substantially all its assets or other general corporate activities, even if the
pursuit of such activities would result in the termination of the LOI.

         Until the date that is six months after the termination date, SNA and
its affiliates and representatives have agreed not to, directly or indirectly,
without the prior written consent of WPSC duly authorized by a majority of its
board of directors: (a) acquire, directly or indirectly, by purchase or
otherwise, any securities of the Company; (b) solicit proxies in opposition to
the recommendation of the majority of the directors of the Company with respect
to any matter; (c) take any action to acquire or affect control of the Company
or to encourage or assist any other person to do so; or (d) initiate, propose or
otherwise solicit the Company's shareholders for the approval of one or more
shareholder proposals at any time, or induce or attempt to induce any other
person to initiate any shareholder proposal.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


     WHEELING-PITTSBURGH STEEL CORPORATION AND SEVERSTAL NORTH AMERICA, INC.
         SIGN NON-BINDING LETTER OF INTENT FOR COKE PLANT JOINT VENTURE

WHEELING, WV, December 28, 2004 - Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel Corporation and
Severstal North America, Inc. on December 23, 2004, signed a non-binding letter
of intent to create a joint venture involving Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel's Coke
Plant, located in Follansbee, WV. The letter of intent calls for entering into a
definitive joint venture closing on or before March 31, 2005.

         At the closing of a definitive joint venture agreement,
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel will contribute the assets of its Follansbee Coke
Plant to the joint venture and Severstal will contribute most of the capital to
rebuild the facility over the next four years. Severstal is expected to commit
$140 million to the joint venture over four years, which will be used for such
coke plant capital improvements. In addition, Severstal would make a $20 million
payment directly to Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel at the closing of the joint
venture. The proposed agreement, after all capital contributions are received
from Severstal, would provide Severstal with a 50 percent ownership of the joint
venture. At that time each party would take 50 percent of the coke produced by
the joint venture.

         The Follansbee Coke Plant is located on the Ohio River and consists of
one six-meter battery and three three-meter batteries. Total cokemaking capacity
is expected to be in excess of one million tons per year after completion of the
capital improvements. The letter of intent also provides for a management
agreement to be entered into at the closing of the joint venture, pursuant to
which Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel would continue to operate the facility for the
joint venture. The joint venture will produce coke for the benefit of
Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel and Severstal.

President and CEO of Wheeling-Pittsburgh Steel. "It would ensure a significant
investment in West Virginia and in domestic cokemaking."

         Bradley added, "The coke market has been highly volatile. This
transaction minimizes our risk while assuring an adequate coke supply for our
remaining blast furnace and freeing up capital for potential future value-added
downstream investments."
