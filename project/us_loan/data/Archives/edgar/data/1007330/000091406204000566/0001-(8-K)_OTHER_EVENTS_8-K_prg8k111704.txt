ITEM 8.01.  OTHER EVENTS.

     On December 16,  2004,  PRG-Schultz  International,  Inc.  (the  "Company")
announced that it has been awarded a contract to provide audit recovery services
to the State of Arizona.  The press release  announcing the contract is filed as
Exhibit 99.1 to this report on Form 8-K and is incorporated herein by reference.

     Except  for  the  historical  information  contained  in this  report,  the
statements  made by the  Company in this report are  forward-looking  statements
that  involve  risks  and  uncertainties,   including   statements  and  implied
assertions  regarding:  whether other governmental  entities may pursue recovery
audit services,  whether those who do so will retain the Company to provide such
services,  whether and to what extent  such  audits  will  identify  significant
overpayments,  and whether the Company's  audit will  ultimately  save money for
Arizona taxpayers. All such statements are subject to the safe harbor created by
the  Private  Securities  Litigation  Reform Act of 1995.  PRG-Schultz's  future
financial  performance  and future  events could differ  significantly  from the
expectations  of management  and from results  expressed or implied in the Press
Release.  The  outcome  of such  contingencies  may be  affected  by a number of
factors.  See the "Risk Factors" section of PRG-Schultz's  Form 10-K filed March
5, 2004 with the Securities and Exchange Commission, for a discussion of certain
risks  and  uncertainties  that may  impact  such  forward  looking  statements.
PRG-Schultz  disclaims  any  obligation  or  duty  to  update  or  modify  these
forward-looking statements.
