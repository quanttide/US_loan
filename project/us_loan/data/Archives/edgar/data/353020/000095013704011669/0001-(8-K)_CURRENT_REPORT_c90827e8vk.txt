Item 2.06         Material Impairments.
                  --------------------

         On December 30, 2004, the Board of Directors of Insituform Italia Srl
("Insituform Italia"), an Italian company in which the Registrant has a 50%
ownership interest, voted to convene a meeting of the quotaholders
(stockholders) of Insituform Italia for the purpose of approving a liquidation
or a recapitalization of the company. The Registrant intends to vote for
Insituform Italia's liquidation at the quotaholders (stockholders) meeting based
upon its belief that the company is no longer financially viable.

         Insituform Italia, which the Registrant accounts for under the equity
method, has incurred losses since inception (2000). As reported in the
Registrant's Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30,
2004, the Registrant had previously written off the entire carrying value of its
equity investment in Insituform Italia. Accordingly, the liquidation of
Insituform Italia will not result in an additional impairment of the
Registrant's equity investment in Insituform Italia.

         As of November 30, 2004, Insituform Italia owed approximately EUR
375,000 (approximately US $499,000) to Insituform Linings Public Limited Company
("Insituform Linings"), a company incorporated in England and Wales in which the
Registrant has a 75% ownership interest, and approximately EUR 710,000
(approximately US $944,000) to Insituform Rohrsanierungstechnik GmbH ("IRG"), a
German company in which the Registrant has a 50% ownership interest. The
Registrant does not believe that either Insituform Linings or IRG will receive
any payment on these amounts in connection with the liquidation of Insituform
Italia. Consequently, the Registrant's investment in IRG will be reduced by
approximately EUR 213,000 (approximately US $283,000) and the Registrant will
take an after-tax charge in Insituform Linings of approximately EUR 183,000
(approximately US $243,000). The Registrant also anticipates that it will incur
approximately US $150,000 in other expenses, including legal fees, in connection
with the liquidation of Insituform Italia.
