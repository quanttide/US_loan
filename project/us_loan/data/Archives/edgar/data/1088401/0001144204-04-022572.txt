Section 2 - Financial Information

Item 2.05 Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities

      On December 16, 2004, Registrant determined that as a result of a material
impairment of its wholly owned subsidiary Practical Business Solutions 2000,
Inc. ("PBS2000"), it will wind down and close the PBS 2000 operation (See Item
2.06 Material Impairments below). Registrant has estimated that a charge of
approximately $125,000 will be recorded for this process. Registrant estimates
that the closing process will be completed before March 31, 2005.

      Additionally, Registrant is investigating Mr. Dale Diercks activities
while employed by PBS 2000 and subsequent to his departure. Mr. Diercks was the
PBS 2000 principal officer and Registrant is reviewing all options available to
as a result of the investigation including legal action against Mr. Diercks.

Item 2.06 Material Impairments

      On December 16, 2004, Registrant determined that as a result of the loss
of the key employee as related to PBS 2000, its valuation has been significantly
impaired. As a result of Registrant's impairment analysis, the entire goodwill
recorded from the acquisition of PBS 2000 in the amount of $401,033 is impaired
and Registrant will record this amount as an impairment expense.
