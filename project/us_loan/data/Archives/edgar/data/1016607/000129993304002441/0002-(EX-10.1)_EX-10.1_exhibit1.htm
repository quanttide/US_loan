<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">WHEREAS, the Company and Waller desire to amend the Original Agreement as set forth in this
Amendment in connection with Waller&#146;s service as a director of the Company;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 12pt; text-indent: 4%">NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the premises and mutual covenants and agreements contained
