Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

SmartServ Online,  Inc. (the "Company")  entered into a Stock Purchase Agreement
by and among  Nimesh  Patel,  Ashok  Patel  and Kala  Patel  (collectively,  the
"Sellers") and the Company, dated December 19, 2004 ("Agreement"). The Agreement
provides that the Company will acquire all of the  outstanding  shares of KPCCD,
Inc.  ("KPCCD")  from its three  shareholders,  the  Sellers,  in  exchange  for
1,000,000  shares  of  common  stock of the  Company,  $.01 par  value per share
("Common  Stock").  KPCCD is a New York City-based  distributor of international
prepaid calling cards.

The closing of the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Agreement  is subject to
various conditions,  including,  among other things,  completion of schedules to
the  Agreement  and execution  and delivery of various  closing  documents.  The
closing is expected to be completed in January of 2005.

Item  3.02  Unregistered Sale of Equity Securities

Pursuant to the terms of the Agreement,  on December 19, 2004 the Company agreed
that it will issue  1,000,000  shares of Common  Stock in the  aggregate  to the
Sellers  upon the closing of the  transactions  contemplated  by the  Agreement.
These shares are being issued by the Company as  consideration  for the purchase
of all of the outstanding  shares of KPCCD. As described above, the closing (and
the related grant of these shares) is subject to various  closing  conditions as
set forth in the  Agreement.  These shares are expected to be issued in reliance
upon the exemption from registration  provided by Section 4(2) of the Securities
Act of 1933, as amended. Each Seller is an accredited investor and had access to
our most recent Form 10-KSB/A,  all quarterly and other  periodic  reports filed
subsequent to such Form 10-KSB/A and our most recent proxy materials.
