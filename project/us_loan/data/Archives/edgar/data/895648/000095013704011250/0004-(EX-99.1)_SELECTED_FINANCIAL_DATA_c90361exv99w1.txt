Accepted Accounting Principles to Funds from Operations" below for a
reconciliation of Net Income to FFO.

FUNDS FROM OPERATIONS

General Growth, consistent with real estate industry and investment community
preferences, uses Funds from Operations ("FFO") as a supplemental measure of the
operating performance for a real estate investment trust. The National
Association of Real Estate Investment Trusts ("NAREIT") defines FFO as net
income (loss) (computed in accordance with GAAP), excluding gains or losses from
cumulative effects of accounting changes, extraordinary items and sales of
properties, plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after
adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures. As discussed in
Note 13, the treatment of debt extinguishment costs as extraordinary items was
suspended with the effectiveness of the rescission of FASB Statement No. 4 in
2003. Accordingly, such previously recorded extraordinary items were
reclassified to interest expense and no longer can be considered as excluded
from the computation of FFO. Therefore, in the following presentation of its
Funds from Operations, the Company has revised its computation of FFO for the
years 2002, 2001 and 1999. In addition, the Company also has revised its FFO
presentation for 2000 for certain losses on the sale of development property,
for 2001 for the loss provision for network discontinuance costs and 2002 for
minimum rent recognized for acquired below-market leases in order to be
comparable to its 2003 FFO presentation and to reflect interpretations of the
NAREIT approved presentation of such items that has changed since the Company's
original presentation.

The Company considers FFO a supplemental measure for equity REITs and a
complement to GAAP measures because it facilitates an understanding of the
operating performance of the Company's properties. FFO does not give effect to
real estate depreciation and amortization since these amounts are computed to
allocate the cost of a property over its useful life. Since values for
well-maintained real estate assets have historically increased or decreased
based upon prevailing market conditions, the Company believes that FFO provides
investors with a clearer view of the Company's operating performance.

In order to provide a better understanding of the relationship between FFO and
GAAP net income, a reconciliation of GAAP net income to FFO has been provided.
FFO does not represent cash flow from operating activities in accordance with
GAAP, should not be considered as an alternative to GAAP net income and is not
necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs.
