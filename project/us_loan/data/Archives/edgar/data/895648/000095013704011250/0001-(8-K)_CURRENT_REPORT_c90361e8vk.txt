ITEM 8.01         OTHER EVENTS.

On August 11, 2004, the Board of Directors of General Growth Properties, Inc.
(the "Company") approved plans to dispose of the industrial properties
originally acquired in the JP Realty acquisition (the "JP Industrial
Properties") in July 2002. The sales closed on November 1, 2004. In accordance
with applicable generally accepted accounting principles, the Company presented
the operating results of the aforementioned properties in continuing operations
for all years included in its Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2003, filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on March
12, 2004. In accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of Long-Lived Assets," the
Company reported the results of operations of the disposed properties as
discontinued operations in its Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended
September 30, 2004.

The following information (which is attached as exhibits hereto and incorporated
by reference herein), which was originally presented in the Company's Annual
Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003, has been revised to
present the JP industrial properties as discontinued operations:

- -     Selected Financial Data for the five years ended December 31, 2003

- -     Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
      Operations ("MD&A") for the three years ended December 31, 2003

- -     Consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and 2002 and for
      the three years ended December 31, 2003

Investors are cautioned that the MD&A presented herein has been revised solely
to present the JP industrial properties as discontinued operations. It does not
update the MD&A for any information, uncertainties, transactions, risks, events
or trends occurring or known to management. Investors should read the
information contained in this Current Report together with the other information
contained in the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2003, its Forms 10-Q for the quarters ended March 31, 2004, June
30, 2004 and September 30, 2004, and other information filed with or furnished
