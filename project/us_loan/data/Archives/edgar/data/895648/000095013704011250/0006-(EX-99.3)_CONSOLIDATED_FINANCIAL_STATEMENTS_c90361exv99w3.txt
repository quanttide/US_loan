             REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

Board of Directors and Stockholders
General Growth Properties, Inc.

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of General Growth
Properties, Inc. (the "Company") as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the
related consolidated statements of operations and comprehensive income,
stockholders' equity and cash flows for each of the three years in the period
ended December 31, 2003. These consolidated financial statements are the
responsibility of the Company's management. Our responsibility is to express an
opinion on these consolidated financial statements based on our audits. We did
not audit the consolidated financial statements of GGP/Homart, Inc. and
GGP/Homart II L.L.C., the Company's investments in which are accounted for by
use of the equity method. The Company's equity of $150,170,000 and $197,737,000
in GGP/Homart, Inc.'s net assets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively,
and $23,815,000, $23,418,000 and $21,822,000 in GGP/Homart, Inc.'s net income,
respectively, for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003
are included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The
Company's equity of $259,363,000 and $190,597,000 in GGP/Homart II L.L.C.'s net
assets as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and of $33,448,000,
$26,421,000 and $23,995,000 in GGP/Homart II L.L.C.'s net income, respectively,
for each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003 are included
in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. The consolidated
financial statements of GGP/Homart, Inc. and GGP/Homart II L.L.C. were audited
by other auditors whose reports have been furnished to us, and our opinion,
insofar as it relates to the amounts included for such companies, is based
solely on the reports of such other auditors.

We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the Public Company
Accounting Oversight Board (United States). Those standards require that we plan
and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a
test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements. An audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. We believe that our audits and the reports of
the other auditors provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.

In our opinion, based on our audits and the reports of the other auditors, such
consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the
financial position of General Growth Properties, Inc. at December 31, 2003 and
2002, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended December 31, 2003 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
changed its method of accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities in 2001 and as discussed in Note 13 to the consolidated financial
statements, the Company changed its method of accounting for debt extinguishment
costs in 2003.

                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

NOTE 1 ORGANIZATION

GENERAL

General Growth Properties, Inc., a Delaware corporation ("General Growth"), was
formed in 1986 to own and operate regional mall shopping centers. The Company
conducts substantially all of its business through GGP Limited Partnership (the
"Operating Partnership" or "GGPLP") which is majority owned by General Growth
and which was formed in 1993 in conjunction with General Growth's initial public
offering of its common stock ("Common Stock") to succeed to substantially all of
the interests in regional mall general partnerships owned and controlled by the
Company and its original stockholders. All references to the "Company" in these
notes to Consolidated Financial Statements include General Growth and those
entities owned or controlled by General Growth (including the Operating
Partnership and the LLC as described below), unless the context indicates
otherwise. In addition, the Company completed a three-for-one split of its
Common Stock (effective December 5, 2003), as described below. In the
accompanying consolidated financial statements, unless otherwise noted, all
previous applicable share or per share disclosure amounts have been reflected on
a post-split basis.

On January 1, 2001, the Operating Partnership acquired for nominal cash
consideration 100% of the common stock of General Growth Management, Inc.
("GGMI"). GGMI has continued to manage, lease, and perform various other
services for the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates (as defined below) and
other properties owned by unaffiliated third parties. During 2001, the Company
elected that GGMI be treated as a taxable REIT subsidiary (a "TRS") as permitted
under the Tax Relief Extension Act of 1999.

During December 2001, General Growth completed a public offering of 27,600,000
shares of Common Stock (the "2001 Offering"). General Growth received net
proceeds of approximately $345,000 which was used to reduce outstanding
indebtedness and increase working capital.

General Growth has reserved for issuance up to 3,000,000 shares of Common Stock
for issuance under the Dividend Reinvestment and Stock Purchase Plan ("DRSP").
The DRSP allows, in general, participants in the plan to make purchases of
Common Stock from dividends received or additional cash investments. Although
the purchase price of the Common Stock is determined by the current market
price, the purchases will be made without fees or commissions. General Growth
has and will satisfy DRSP Common Stock purchase needs through the issuance of
new shares of Common Stock or by repurchases of currently outstanding Common
Stock. As of December 31, 2003, an aggregate of 377,528 shares of Common Stock
have been issued under the DRSP.

On October 1, 2003, the Company's Board of Directors approved a proposed
amendment to the Company's Charter to effectuate a three-for-one split of the
Common Stock, increase the number of authorized shares of Common Stock from 210
million to 875 million shares and change the par value of the Common Stock from
$.10 to $.01 per share. The Charter amendment was approved by the shareholders
at a special shareholder meeting held on November 20, 2003. The record date for
the stock split was November 20, 2003 with a distribution date of December 5,
2003. When the change in par value became effective, it resulted in an
approximate $5 million reclassification of common stock-par value to additional
paid-in capital. In addition, the Operating Partnership currently has common
units of limited partnership interest ("Units") outstanding that may be
exchanged by their holders, under certain circumstances, for shares of Common
Stock on a one-for-one basis as described below in Note 2-Minority Interest
Common. These common units were also split on a three-for-one basis so that they
continue to be exchangeable on a one-for-one basis into shares of Common Stock.
In the accompanying consolidated financial statements, all previous applicable
Unit and per Unit disclosure amounts have been reflected on a post-split basis.

PREFERRED STOCK

General Growth had issued 13,500,000 Depositary Shares, each representing 1/40
of a share of 7.25% Preferred Income Equity Redeemable Stock, Series A
("PIERS"), or a total of 337,500 PIERS. During May 2003, General Growth called
all of its outstanding PIERS and Depositary Shares for redemption on July 15,
2003. The Depositary Shares (and the related PIERS) were converted at the rate
of 1.8891 shares of Common Stock per Depositary Share and therefore, a

                                       7

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

total of 12,540,186 shares of Common Stock were issued on July 15, 2003 as a
result of this redemption and approximately $17 was paid in cash to redeem
fractional shares of PIERS held.

In order to enable General Growth to comply with its obligations with respect to
the PIERS, General Growth had owned preferred units of limited partnership
interest in the Operating Partnership (the "Preferred Units") which had rights,
preferences and other privileges, including distribution, liquidation,
conversion and redemption rights, that mirrored those of the PIERS. Accordingly,
the Operating Partnership was required to make all required distributions on the
Preferred Units prior to any distribution of cash or assets to the holders of
the Units. The Depositary Shares had been convertible at any time, at the option
of the holder, into shares of Common Stock at the rate of 1.8891 shares of
Common Stock per Depositary Share. Although no Depositary Shares had been
converted at December 31, 2002, through July 14, 2003, holders of approximately
6,861,800 Depositary Shares had voluntarily elected to convert such Depositary
Shares, and such Depositary Shares were converted to, 12,963,357 shares of
Common Stock. The PIERS and the Depositary Shares had been subject to mandatory
redemption by General Growth on July 15, 2008 at a price of $1,000 per PIERS,
plus accrued and unpaid dividends, if any, to the redemption date. Accordingly,
the PIERS were reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial statements
at such liquidation or redemption value.

During 2002 and 2003, other classes of preferred stock of General Growth were
created to permit the future conversion of certain equity interests assumed by
the Company in conjunction with the JP Realty acquisition or created in
conjunction with other acquisitions (Note 3) into General Growth equity
interests. As no such preferred stock has been issued and, for certain classes
of such preferred stock the conditions to allow such a conversion have not yet
occurred, such additional classes of preferred stock have not been presented in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets for December 31, 2003 and 2002.

SHAREHOLDER RIGHTS PLAN

General Growth has a shareholder rights plan pursuant to which one preferred
share purchase right (a "Right") is attached to each currently outstanding or
subsequently issued share of Common Stock. Prior to becoming exercisable, the
Rights trade together with the Common Stock. In general, the Rights will become
exercisable if a person or group acquires or announces a tender or exchange
offer for 15% or more of the Common Stock. Each Right will initially entitle the
holder to purchase from General Growth one third of one-thousandth of a share of
Series A junior Participating Preferred Stock, par value $100 per share (the
"Preferred Stock"), at an exercise price of $148 per one one-thousandth of a
share, subject to adjustment. In the event that a person or group acquires 15%
or more of the Common Stock, each Right will entitle the holder (other than the
acquirer) to purchase shares of Common Stock (or, in certain circumstances, cash
or other securities) having a market value of twice the exercise price of a
Right at such time. Under certain circumstances, each Right will entitle the
holder (other than the acquirer) to purchase Common Stock of the acquirer having
a market value of twice the exercise price of a Right at such time. In addition,
under certain circumstances, the Board of Directors of General Growth may
exchange each Right (other than those held by the acquirer) for one share of
Common Stock, subject to adjustment. If the Rights become exercisable, holders
of common units of partnership interest in the Operating Partnership, other than
General Growth, will receive the number of Rights they would have received if
their units had been redeemed and the purchase price paid in Common Stock. The
Rights expire on November 18, 2008, unless earlier redeemed by the General
Growth Board of Directors for one third of $0.01 per Right or such expiration
date is extended.

OPERATING PARTNERSHIP

As of December 31, 2003, the Company either directly or through the Operating
Partnership and subsidiaries owned 120 operating retail properties (regional
malls and community centers), collectively, the "Consolidated Centers" as well
as 100% of General Growth Management, Inc. ("GGMI") and other miscellaneous
mixed-use commercial business properties and potential development sites.

As of December 31, 2003, the Company holds ownership interests in the following
joint ventures, collectively, the "Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates", as
described in Note 4:

*Including 3 regional mall shopping centers owned jointly with venture partners.

For the purposes of this report, the 43 regional mall shopping centers listed
above are collectively referred to as the "Unconsolidated Centers" and, together
with the Consolidated Centers, comprise the "Company Portfolio".

During May 2000, the Operating Partnership formed GGPLP L.L.C., a Delaware
limited liability company (the "LLC"), by contributing its interest in a
portfolio of 44 Consolidated Centers to the LLC in exchange for all of the
common units of membership interest in the LLC. As of December 31, 2003, the
LLC, due to subsequent acquisitions by the Company, owns 104 of the Consolidated
Centers. A total of 940,000 redeemable preferred units of membership interest in
the LLC (the "RPUs") have been issued by the LLC. Holders of the RPUs are
entitled to receive cumulative preferential cash distributions per RPU at a per
annum rate of 8.95% of the $250 liquidation preference thereof (or $5.59375 per
quarter) prior to any distributions by the LLC to the Operating Partnership.
Subject to certain limitations, the RPUs may be redeemed in cash by the LLC for
the liquidation preference amount plus accrued and unpaid distributions and may
be exchanged by the holders of the RPUs for an equivalent amount of redeemable
preferred stock of General Growth. Such preferred stock provides for an
equivalent 8.95% annual preferred distribution and is redeemable at the option
of General Growth for cash equal to the liquidation preference amount plus
accrued and unpaid distributions. The RPUs outstanding at December 31, 2003 and
December 31, 2002 have been reflected in the accompanying consolidated financial
statements as a component of minority interest-preferred as detailed in Note 2.

In addition, 20,000 8.25% cumulative preferred units (the "CPUs") have been
issued by the LLC. The holders of these CPUs are entitled to receive cumulative
preferential cash distributions per CPU at a per annum rate of 8.25% of the $250
liquidation preference thereof (or $5.15625 per quarter), prior to any
distributions by the LLC to the Operating Partnership also as detailed in Note
2.

As of December 31, 2003, General Growth owned an approximate 80% general
partnership interest in the Operating Partnership. The remaining approximate 20%
minority interest in the Operating Partnership is held by limited partners that
include trusts for the benefit of the families of the original stockholders who
initially owned and controlled the Company and subsequent contributors of
properties to the Company. These minority interests are represented by common
units of limited partnership interest in the Operating Partnership (the
"Units"). In addition, holders of certain preferred units of limited partnership
(see Minority Interest-Preferred, Note 2) in the Operating Partnership have
rights to convert such holdings to Units. Under certain circumstances, the Units
can be redeemed at the option of the holders for cash or, at General Growth's
election, for shares of Common Stock on a one-for-one basis. The holders of the
Units also share equally with General Growth's common stockholders on a per
share basis in any

distributions by the Operating Partnership on the basis that one Unit is
equivalent to one share of Common Stock.

BUSINESS SEGMENT INFORMATION

The Financial Accounting Standards Board (the "FASB") has issued Statement No.
131, "Disclosures about Segments of an Enterprise and Related Information"
("Statement 131") which requires disclosure of certain operating and financial
data with respect to separate business activities within an enterprise. The
primary business of General Growth and its consolidated affiliates is the owning
and operation of shopping centers. General Growth evaluates operating results
and allocates resources on a property-by-property basis. General Growth does not
distinguish or group its consolidated operations on a geographic basis.
Accordingly, General Growth has concluded it currently has a single reportable
segment for Statement 131 purposes. Further, all material operations are within
the United States and no customer or tenant comprises more than 10% of
consolidated revenues.

NOTE 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company including the Consolidated Centers, GGMI and the unconsolidated
investments in GGP/Homart, GGP/Homart II, GGP/Teachers, GGP Ivanhoe, GGP Ivanhoe
III, GGP Ivanhoe IV, Circle T, Quail Springs, and Town East. Included in the
consolidated financial statements are four joint ventures, acquired in the JP
Realty acquisition (Note 3), which are partnerships with non-controlling
independent joint venture partners. Income allocated to minority interests
includes the share of such properties' operations (computed as the respective
joint venture partner ownership percentage) applicable to such non-controlling
venture partners. All significant intercompany balances and transactions have
been eliminated.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

Minimum rent revenues are recognized on a straight-line basis over the terms of
the related leases. As of December 31, 2003, approximately $77,397 has been
recognized as straight-line rents receivable (representing the current net
cumulative rents recognized prior to when billed and collectible as provided by
the terms of the leases), all of which is included in tenant accounts
receivable, net in the accompanying consolidated financial statements. Also
included in consolidated minimum rents in 2003 is approximately $16,551 of
accretion related to above and below-market leases at properties acquired as
provided by FASB Statements No. 141, "Business Combinations", ("SFAS 141") and
No. 142, "Goodwill and Intangible Assets", ("SFAS 142"). Overage rents are
recognized on an accrual basis once tenant sales revenues exceed contractual
tenant lease thresholds. Recoveries from tenants computed as a formula related
to taxes, insurance and other shopping center operating expenses are recognized
as revenues in the period the applicable costs are incurred. Amounts collected
from tenants to allow the termination of their leases prior to their scheduled
termination dates, approximately $9,694, $8,303 and $7,500 in 2003, 2002 and
2001, respectively, have been included in minimum rents. Fee income primarily
represents GGMI management and leasing fees, financing fees and fees for other
ancillary services performed by the Company for the benefit of its
Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates and certain properties managed for
independent third-party investors. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001, GGMI has recognized $62,960, $52,646 and $45,079, respectively, in
fees from the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. Management and leasing fees
of GGMI are recognized as services are rendered.

The Company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts against the portion of
accounts receivable, including straight-line rents, which is estimated to be
uncollectible. Such allowances are reviewed periodically based upon the recovery
experience of the Company. With respect to straight-line rents, the Company
evaluates the probability of collection of the portion of future rent to be
recognized presently under a straight-line methodology. This analysis considers
the long-term nature of the Company's leases, as a certain portion of the
deferred rent currently recognizable will not be billed to the tenant until many
years into the future. The Company's experience relative to unbilled deferred
rent receivable is that a certain portion of the amounts straight-lined into
revenue are never collected from (or billed to) the tenant due to early lease
terminations. For that portion of the otherwise recognizable deferred rent that
is not deemed to be probable of collection, no revenue is recognized. Accounts
receivable in the accompanying consolidated

              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

balance sheets are shown net of an allowance for doubtful accounts of $12,940
and $7,817 as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

The Company considers all highly liquid investments purchased with original
maturities of three months or less to be cash equivalents. The cash and cash
equivalents of the Company are held at two financial institutions.

DEFERRED EXPENSES

Deferred expenses consist principally of financing fees which are amortized over
the terms of the respective agreements and leasing costs and commissions which
are amortized over the average life of the tenant leases. Deferred expenses in
the accompanying consolidated balance sheets are shown at cost, net of
accumulated amortization of $94,525 and $73,546 as of December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

Statement No. 107, "Disclosure about the Fair Value of Financial Instruments",
("SFAS 107"), issued by the FASB, requires the disclosure of the fair value of
the Company's financial instruments for which it is practicable to estimate that
value. SFAS 107 does not apply to all balance sheet items and the Company has
utilized market information as available or present value techniques to estimate
the amounts required to be disclosed. Since such amounts are estimates, there
can be no assurance that the disclosed value of any financial instrument could
be realized by immediate settlement of the instrument. The Company considers the
carrying value of its cash and cash equivalents to approximate the fair value
due to the short maturity of these investments. Based on borrowing rates
available to the Company at the end of 2003 and 2002 for mortgage loans with
similar terms and maturities, the fair value of the mortgage notes and other
debts payable approximates the carrying value at December 31, 2003 and 2002. In
addition, the Company estimates that the fair value of its interest rate cap and
swap agreements (Note 5) related to consolidated debt at December 31, 2003 and
2002 is approximately $(15,546) and $(28,292), respectively.

The Company held approximately $155,100 of marketable securities (bearing
interest at a weighted average variable annual rate of 2.9% at December 31, 2001
and having a weighted average maturity of approximately 3.63 years). Such
securities, which were subsequently sold in May 2002 to finance certain
acquisitions (Note 3), represented a portion of the commercial mortgage
pass-through certificates issued in December 2001 as more fully described in
Note 5. At December 31, 2002, the Company held approximately $476 of common
stock of certain former tenants who had settled their previous obligations by
transferring such common stock to the Company. These equity securities had been
reflected at their respective market values and were sold in February 2003 at
prices approximating such assigned values. In addition at December 31, 2003, the
Company has certain derivative financial instruments as described below and in
Note 5.

The Company's only hedging activities are the cash flow hedges represented by
its interest rate cap and swap agreements relating to its commercial
mortgage-backed securities (Note 5). These agreements either place a limit on
the effective rate of interest the Company will bear on such variable rate
obligations or fix the effective interest rate on such obligations to a certain
rate. The Company has concluded that these agreements are highly effective in
achieving its objective of eliminating its exposure to variability in cash flows
relating to these variable rate obligations in any interest rate environment for
loans subject to swap agreements and for loans with related cap agreements, when
LIBOR rates exceed the strike rates of the agreements. The Company values the
interest rate cap and swap agreements as of the end of each reporting period.
Interest rates have declined since these agreements were obtained. The Company
recorded at January 1, 2001 a loss to earnings of $3,334 as a cumulative-effect
type transition adjustment to recognize at fair value the time-value portion of
all the interest rate cap agreements that were previously designated as part of
a hedging relationship. Included in the $3,334 loss is $704 related to interest
rate cap agreements held by Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. The Company
also recorded $112 to other comprehensive income at January 1, 2001 to reflect
the then fair value of the intrinsic portion of the interest rate cap
agreements. Subsequent changes in the fair value of these agreements and
additional cap agreements subsequently entered into have been reflected in

                                       11
<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

current earnings and accumulated other comprehensive income. During 2003, 2002
and 2001, the Company recorded approximately $12,542, ($30,774) and $2,389,
respectively, of net additional other comprehensive income (loss) to reflect
changes in the fair value of its interest rate cap and swap agreements.

In conjunction with the GGP MPTC financing (as defined and described in Note 5),
all of the debt hedged by the Company's then existing interest rate cap
agreements was refinanced. As the related fair values of the previous cap
agreements were nominal on the refinancing date, these cap agreements were not
terminated and any subsequent changes in the fair value of these cap agreements
were reflected in interest expense. Further, certain caps were purchased and
sold in conjunction with GGP MPTC financing. These purchased and sold caps do
not qualify for hedge accounting and changes in the fair values of these
agreements are reflected in interest expense. Finally, certain interest rate
swap agreements were entered into to partially fix the interest rates on a
portion of the GGP MPTC financing. These swap agreements have been designated as
cash flow hedges on $500,000 of the Company's consolidated variable rate debt
(see also Note 5).

ACQUISITIONS

Acquisitions of properties are accounted for utilizing the purchase method and,
accordingly, the results of operations are included in the Company's results of
operations from the respective dates of acquisition. The Company has used
estimates of future cash flows and other valuation techniques to allocate the
purchase price of acquired property between land, buildings and improvements,
equipment and other identifiable debit and credit intangibles such as amounts
related to in-place at-market leases, acquired above and below-market leases and
tenant relationships. The Company has estimated the fair value of acquired
in-place at-market leases as the costs the Company would have incurred to lease
the property to the occupancy level of the property at the date of acquisition.
Such estimate includes the fair value of leasing commissions, legal costs and
tenant coordination costs that would be incurred to lease the property to this
occupancy level. Additionally, the Company evaluates the time period over which
such occupancy level would be achieved and includes an estimate of the net
operating costs (primarily real estate taxes, insurance and utilities) incurred
during the lease-up period, which generally ranges up to one year. Above-market
and below-market in-place lease values for owned properties are recorded based
on the present value (using an interest rate which reflects the risks associated
with the leases acquired) of the difference between (i) the contractual amounts
to be paid pursuant to the in-place leases and (ii) the Company's estimate of
fair market lease rates for the corresponding in-place leases, measured over a
period equal to the remaining non-cancelable term of the lease. The capitalized
above- and below-market lease values are amortized as adjustments to rental
income over the remaining non-cancelable terms of the respective leases.

This allocation has resulted in the recognition upon acquisition of additional
consolidated intangible assets (acquired above-market and in-place leases) and
deferred credits (acquired below-market leases) relating to the Company's 2003
real estate purchases of approximately $35,144 and $54,058, respectively. These
intangible assets and liabilities, and similar assets and liabilities from the
Company's 2002 acquisitions including those by the Unconsolidated Real Estate
Affiliates, are being amortized over the terms of the acquired leases. As a
result, the Company reported additional amortization expense of approximately
$2,763 and additional amortization expense from its Unconsolidated Real Estate
Affiliates of approximately $1,093. Due to existing contacts and relationships
with tenants at its currently owned properties and at properties currently
managed for others, no significant value has been ascribed to the tenant
relationships which exist at the properties acquired.

PROPERTIES

Real estate assets are stated at cost. For redevelopment of existing operating
properties, the net book value of the existing property under redevelopment plus
the cost for the construction and improvements incurred in connection with the
redevelopment are capitalized to the extent the capitalized costs of the
property do not exceed the estimated fair value of the redeveloped property when
complete. Real estate taxes incurred during construction periods are capitalized
and amortized on the same basis as the related assets. Interest costs are
capitalized during periods of active construction for qualified expenditures
based upon interest rates in place during the construction period until
construction is substantially complete. Capitalized interest costs are

                                       12
<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

amortized over the lives consistent with the constructed assets.

Pre-acquisition costs, which generally include legal and professional fees and
other third-party costs related directly to the acquisition of the property, are
capitalized as part of the acquired property. In the event an acquisition is no
longer deemed to be probable, the costs previously capitalized are written off
as a component of operating expenses. The real estate assets of the Company are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. A real estate asset is
considered to be impaired when the estimated future undiscounted operating cash
flow is less than its carrying value. To the extent an impairment has occurred,
the excess of carrying value of the asset over its estimated fair value will be
charged to operations. Depreciation or amortization expense is computed using
the straight-line method based upon the following estimated useful lives:

</TABLE>

Construction allowances paid to tenants are capitalized and depreciated over the
average lease term. Maintenance and repairs are charged to expense when
incurred. Expenditures for significant betterments and improvements are
capitalized.

INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED REAL ESTATE AFFILIATES

The Company accounts for its investments in Unconsolidated Real Estate
Affiliates using the equity method whereby the cost of an investment is adjusted
for the Company's share of equity in earnings of such Unconsolidated Real Estate
Affiliates from the date of acquisition and reduced by distributions received.
Generally, the operating agreements with respect to these Unconsolidated Real
Estate Affiliates (Note 4) provide that elements of assets, liabilities and
funding obligations are shared in accordance with the Company's ownership
percentages (50% or 51% depending on the affiliate). Therefore, the Company
generally shares in the profit and losses, cash flows and other matters relating
to its Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates in accordance with its respective
ownership percentages. In addition, the differences between the Company's
carrying value of its investment in the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates
and the Company's share of the underlying equity of such Unconsolidated Real
Estate Affiliates (approximately $49,044 and $53,103 at December 31, 2003 and
2002, respectively) are, except for Retained Debt (as described and defined in
Note 4), amortized over lives ranging from five to forty years. Further, any
advances to or loans (see Note 5) from the Unconsolidated Real Estate
Affiliates, (loans equal approximately $8,867 and $102,053 at December 31, 2003
and 2002, respectively) have been included in the Company's investment in
Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates.

INCOME TAXES

General Growth elected to be taxed as a real estate investment ("REIT") trust
under sections 856-860 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 (the "Code"),
commencing with its taxable year beginning January 1, 1993. To qualify as a
REIT, General Growth must meet a number of organizational and operational
requirements, including requirements to distribute at least 90% of its ordinary
taxable income and to distribute to stockholders or pay tax on 100% of capital
gains and to meet certain asset and income tests. It is management's current
intention to adhere to these requirements.

As a REIT, General Growth will generally not be subject to corporate level
Federal income tax on taxable income it distributes currently to its
stockholders. If General Growth fails to qualify as a REIT in any taxable year,
it will be subject to Federal income taxes at regular corporate rates (including
any applicable alternative minimum tax) and may not be able to qualify as a REIT
for four subsequent taxable years. Accordingly, the consolidated statements of
operations do not reflect a provision for General Growth's income taxes since
its taxable income is included in the taxable income of its stockholders. Even
if the Company qualifies for taxation as a REIT, General Growth may be subject
to certain state and local taxes on its income or property, and to Federal
income and excise taxes on its undistributed taxable income.

<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

Deferred income taxes relate primarily to one of the Company's subsidiaries,
GGMI, and are accounted for using the asset and liability method, which reflect
the impact of the temporary differences between the amounts of assets and
liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the bases of such assets and
liabilities as measured for tax purposes. Deferred income taxes also reflect the
impact of operating loss and tax credit carryforwards based on enacted tax rates
expected to be in effect when such amounts are realized or settled. Deferred tax
assets are reduced by a valuation allowance to the amount where realization is
more likely than not assured after considering all available evidence, including
tax planning strategies and other factors. Temporary differences primarily
related to depreciation (Note 6).

Earnings and profits, which determine the taxability of dividends to
stockholders, differ from net income reported for financial reporting purposes
due to differences for Federal income tax reporting purposes in, among other
things, estimated useful lives, depreciable basis of properties and permanent
and temporary differences on the inclusion of deductibility of elements of
income and deductibility of expense for such purposes.

STOCK OPTIONS

During the second quarter of 2002, the Company elected to adopt the fair value
based employee stock-based compensation expense recognition provisions of
Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 123, "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation" ("SFAS 123"), prospectively. The Company previously applied the
intrinsic value based expense recognition provisions set forth in APB Opinion
No. 25, "Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees" ("APB 25"). SFAS 123 states
that the adoption of the fair value based method is a change to a preferable
method of accounting. In applying APB 25 in accounting for the 1993 Stock
Incentive Plan, the 1998 Incentive Plan and the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, no
compensation costs had been recognized in 2001. Had compensation costs for the
Company's plans been determined based on the fair value at the grant date for
options granted in 2001 and prior years in accordance with the method required
by SFAS 123, the Company's net income available to common stockholders would
have been nominally reduced but there would have been no effect on reported
basic or diluted earnings per share.

EARNINGS PER SHARE ("EPS")

Basic and diluted per share amounts are based on the weighted average of common
shares and dilutive securities outstanding for the respective periods. The
effect of the issuance of the PIERS is anti-dilutive with respect to the
Company's calculation of diluted earnings per share for the year ended December
31, 2001 and therefore has been excluded. In addition, 21,000, 384,375, and
737,693 options, outstanding for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively, were not
included in the computation of diluted earnings per share either because the
exercise price of the options was higher than the average market price of the
Common Stock for the applicable periods and therefore, the effect would be
anti-dilutive or because the conditions which must be satisfied prior to the
issuance of any such shares were not achieved during the applicable periods. The
outstanding Units have been excluded from the diluted earnings per share
calculation as there would be no effect of the EPS amounts since the minority
interests' share of income would also be added back to net income.

The following are the reconciliations of the numerators and denominators of the
basic and diluted EPS:

      issuance of the PIERS is dilutive and, therefore, no adjustment of net
      income is made as the PIERS dilution is reflected in the denominator of
      the diluted EPS calculation.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

In August 2004, the Company's Board of Directors approved plans to dispose of
the industrial properties originally acquired in the JP Realty acquisition in
July 2002. The sales closed on November 1, 2004 for $67,000 and a gain of
approximately $11,000 was recognized.

On March 31, 2003, the Company sold McCreless Mall in San Antonio, Texas for
aggregate consideration of $15,000 (which was paid in cash at closing). The
Company recorded a gain of approximately $4,000 for financial reporting purposes
on the sale of the mall. McCreless Mall was purchased in 1998 as part of a
portfolio of eight shopping centers. Pursuant to SFAS 144, the Company has
reclassified the operations of McCreless Mall (approximately $859, $3,789 and
$4,344 in revenues and $292, $1,361 and $1,866 in net income in the years ended
December 31, 2003, 2002, and 2001, respectively) to discontinued operations in

MINORITY INTEREST

COMMON

Income is allocated to the holders of the Units (the "OP Minority Interests")
based on their ownership percentage of the Operating Partnership. The ownership
percentage is determined by

dividing the number of Operating Partnership Units held by the OP Minority
Interests by the total Operating Partnership Units (excluding Preferred Units)
outstanding. The issuance of additional shares of Common Stock or Operating
Partnership Units are capital transactions that change this percentage as well
as the total net assets of the Operating Partnership. Such capital transactions
result in an allocation between stockholders' equity and OP Minority Interests
in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to account for the change in the
OP Minority Interests ownership percentage as well as the change in the total
net assets of the Operating Partnership. Therefore, all such capital
transactions result in an allocation between stockholders' equity and OP
Minority Interests in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets to account
for the change in the OP Minority Interests' ownership percentage as well as the
change in total net assets of the Operating Partnership. Due to the number of
such capital transactions that occur each period, the Company has presented a
single net effect of all such allocations for the period as the "Adjustment for
Minority Interest" (rather than separately allocating the minority interest for
each individual capital transaction) to arrive at a presentation of each
transaction as net of such a minority interest allocation.

Changes in outstanding Operating Partnership Units (excluding the Preferred
Units) for the three years ended December 31, 2003, are as follows:

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

FASB Statement of No. 130, "Reporting Comprehensive Income", requires that
the Company disclose comprehensive income in addition to net income.
Comprehensive income is a more inclusive financial reporting methodology
that encompasses net income and all other changes in equity except those
resulting from investments by and distributions to equity holders.

Included in comprehensive income but not net income are unrealized holding
gains or losses on marketable securities classified as available-for-sale
and unrealized gains or losses on financial instruments designated as cash
flow hedges. Also included in comprehensive loss for 2003 and 2002 is
approximately $308 and $740, respectively, representing the changes in the
fair value of plan assets relating to a frozen pension plan of Victoria
Ward assumed by the Company upon acquisition (Note 3). In addition, one of
the Company's unconsolidated affiliates received common stock of a large
publicly-traded real estate company as part of a 1998 transaction. During
2001, portions of the Company's holdings of the stock were sold and the
prior unrealized losses on such stock sold were realized. For the year
ended December 31, 2002, there were no unrealized losses as the remaining
stock was sold in March 2002 and the remaining cumulative unrealized
losses pertaining to such stock holdings were realized.

USE OF ESTIMATES

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions. These estimates and
assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the
financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses
during the reporting period. For example, significant estimates and
assumptions have been made with respect to useful lives of assets,
capitalization of development and leasing costs, recoverable amounts of
receivables and deferred taxes, initial valuations and related
amortization periods of deferred costs and intangibles, particularly with
respect to property acquisitions. Actual results could differ from those
estimates.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

Certain amounts in the 2002 and 2001 consolidated financial statements,
including discontinued operations (Note 16), have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation.

CONSOLIDATED PROPERTIES

2004

On January 7, 2004, the Company acquired a 50% membership interest in a newly
formed limited liability company ("Burlington LLC") which owns Burlington Town
Center, an enclosed mall in Burlington, Vermont. The aggregate consideration for
the 50% ownership interest in Burlington Town Center was approximately $10,250
(subject to certain prorations and adjustments). Approximately $9,000 was funded
in cash by the Company at closing with the remaining amounts to be funded in
cash in 2004 when certain conditions related to the property are satisfied. In
addition, at closing the Company made a $31,500 mortgage loan to Burlington LLC
to replace the existing mortgage financing which had been collateralized by the
property. The new mortgage loan requires monthly payments of principal and
interest, bears interest at a rate per annum of 5.5% and is scheduled to mature
in January 2009. The Company has an annual preferential return of 10% on its
initial investment and has an option to purchase the remaining 50% interest in
Burlington LLC until in January 2007 at a price computed based on a formula
related to the Company's initial purchase price. Finally, management and leasing
responsibilities for the property were assumed by GGMI effective on the closing
date. Due to substantive participating rights held by the unaffiliated venture
partners, this investment is expected to be accounted for by the Company on the
equity method.

On January 16, 2004, the Company acquired Redlands Mall, an enclosed mall in
Redlands, California. The purchase price paid for Redlands Mall was
approximately $14,250 (subject to certain prorations and adjustments). The

On March 5, 2004, the Company acquired Four Seasons Town Centre, an enclosed
mall in Greensboro, North Carolina. The purchase price paid for Four Seasons
Towne Centre Mall was approximately $161,000 (subject to certain prorations and
adjustments). The consideration was paid by the assumption of approximately
$134,000 in existing long-term non-recourse mortgage debt (bearing interest at a
rate per annum of approximately 5.6% and scheduled to mature in November 2013),
approximately $25,100 in 7% preferred units of Operating Partnership interest
and the remaining amounts in cash, primarily from amounts borrowed under the
Company's credit facilities. Immediately following the closing, the Company
prepaid approximately $22,000 of such debt using cash on hand.

On April 30, 2003, the Company acquired Peachtree Mall, an enclosed regional
mall located in Columbus, Georgia. The purchase price was approximately $87,600,
which was paid at closing with an interest-only acquisition loan of
approximately $53,000 (bearing interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 85
basis points and maturing in April 2008, assuming all no-cost extension options
are exercised) and the balance from cash on hand and amounts borrowed under the
Company's credit facilities.

On June 11, 2003, the Company acquired Saint Louis Galleria, an enclosed mall in
St. Louis, Missouri. The aggregate consideration paid for Saint Louis Galleria
was approximately $235,000 (subject to certain prorations and adjustments). The
consideration was paid from cash on hand, including proceeds from refinancings
of existing long-term debt and an approximately $176,000 acquisition loan which
initially bore interest at LIBOR plus 105 basis points. In October 2003,
pursuant to the original loan terms, the interest rate spread on the loan was
reset to 165 basis points. The loan requires monthly payments of interest-only
and is scheduled to mature in June 2008 assuming all no-cost extension options
are exercised.

On June 11, 2003, the Company acquired Coronado Center, an enclosed mall in
Albuquerque, New Mexico. The aggregate consideration paid for Coronado Center
was approximately $175,000 (subject to certain prorations and adjustments). The
consideration was paid in the form of cash borrowed under the Company's credit
facilities and an approximately $131,000 acquisition loan which initially bore

$30,000 was repaid under the acquisition loan and, pursuant to the original loan
terms, the interest rate spread on the loan was reset to 91 basis points. The
loan requires monthly payments of interest-only and is scheduled to mature in
October 2008 assuming all three no-cost extension options are exercised.

On July 1, 2003, the Company acquired the 49% ownership interest in GGP Ivanhoe
III, Inc. ("GGP Ivanhoe III") which was held by the Company's joint venture
partner (an affiliate of Ivanhoe Cambridge, Inc. of Montreal, Canada
("Ivanhoe")), thereby increasing the Company's ownership interest to 100%. The
aggregate consideration for the 49% ownership interest in Ivanhoe III was
approximately $459,000 (subject to certain prorations and adjustments).
Concurrently with this transaction, a new joint venture, GGP Ivanhoe IV, Inc.,
("GGP Ivanhoe IV") was created between the Company and Ivanhoe to own Eastridge
Mall, which previously had been owned by GGP Ivanhoe III (Note 4). The Company's
ownership interest in GGP Ivanhoe IV is 51% and Ivanhoe's ownership interest is
49%.

On August 27, 2003, the Company acquired Lynnhaven Mall, an enclosed mall in
Virginia Beach, Virginia for approximately $256,500. The consideration (after
certain prorations and adjustments) was paid in the form of cash borrowed under
an existing unsecured credit facility and a $180,000 interest-only acquisition
loan. The acquisition loan currently bears interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR
plus 125 basis points and is scheduled to mature in August 2008, (assuming the
exercise of three one-year, no-cost extension options).

On October 14, 2003, the Company acquired Sikes Senter, an enclosed mall located
in Wichita Falls, Texas. The purchase price was approximately $61,000, which was
paid at closing with an interest-only acquisition loan of approximately $41,500
(bearing interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 70 basis points and
scheduled to mature in November 2008, assuming all no-cost extension options are
exercised) and the balance from cash on hand and amounts borrowed under the
Company's credit facilities.

On October 29, 2003, the Company acquired The Maine Mall, an enclosed mall in
Portland, Maine. The purchase price paid for The Maine Mall was approximately
$270,000 (subject to certain prorations and adjustments). The consideration was

approximately $202,500 acquisition loan which initially bears interest at LIBOR
plus 92 basis points. After May 14, 2004, depending upon certain factors, the

points. The loan requires monthly payments of interest-only and matures in
October 2008 (assuming the exercise by the Company of all no-cost extension
options).

On October 31, 2003, the Company acquired Glenbrook Square, an enclosed mall in
Fort Wayne, Indiana. The purchase price paid for Glenbrook Square was

that currently bears interest at a rate per annum of 7.0%. The loan requires
monthly payments of principal and interest and is scheduled to mature in March
2005.

On December 23, 2003, the Company acquired Rogue Valley Mall, an enclosed mall
in Medford, Oregon. The purchase price paid for Rogue Valley Mall was
approximately $57,495 (subject to certain prorations and adjustments). The
consideration was paid from cash on hand, including proceeds from borrowings
under the Company's credit facilities, and by the assumption of approximately
$28,000 in existing long-term mortgage indebtedness that currently bears
interest at a rate per annum of 7.85%. The loan requires monthly payments of
principal and interest and is scheduled to mature in January 2011.

2002

On May 28, 2002, the Company acquired the stock of Victoria Ward, Limited, a
privately held real estate corporation ("Victoria Ward"). The total acquisition
price was approximately $250,000, including the assumption of approximately
$50,000 of existing debt, substantially all of which was repaid immediately
following the closing. The $250,000 total cash requirement was funded from the
proceeds of the sale of the Company's investment in marketable securities
(related to the GGP MPTC financing (Note 5)) and from available cash and cash
equivalents. The principal Victoria Ward assets include 65 fee simple acres in
Kakaako, central Honolulu, Hawaii, currently improved with, among other uses, an
entertainment, shopping and dining district which includes Ward Entertainment
Center, Ward Warehouse, Ward Village and Village Shops. At acquisition, Victoria
Ward owned in total 17 land parcels each of which was individually ground leased
to tenants and 29 owned buildings containing in the aggregate approximately
878,000 square feet of retail space, as well as approximately 441,000 square
feet of office, commercial and industrial leaseable area. In 2002 and subsequent
years, Victoria Ward has been and will be taxed as a REIT.

On July 10, 2002, the Company acquired JP Realty, Inc. ("JP Realty"), a
publicly-held real estate investment trust, and its operating partnership
subsidiary, Price Development Company, Limited Partnership ("PDC"). The total
acquisition price was approximately $1,100,000 which included the assumption of
approximately $460,000 in existing debt and approximately $116,000 of existing
cumulative preferred operating partnership units in PDC (510,000 PDC Series A
8.75% units redeemable commencing April 23, 2004, 3,800,000 PDC Series B 8.95%
units redeemable commencing July 28, 2004 and 320,000 PDC Series C 8.75% units
redeemable commencing May 1, 2005). Each unit of each series of the cumulative
redeemable preferred units in PDC has a liquidation value of $25 per unit and is
convertible at the option of the preferred unit holder in 2009 (2010 for the PDC
Series C Units) into 0.025 shares of a newly created series of General Growth
preferred stock ($1,000 per share base liquidation preference) with payment and
liquidation rights comparable to such preferred unit. Pursuant to the terms of
the merger agreement, the outstanding shares of JP Realty common stock were
converted into $26.10 per share of cash (approximately $431,470). Holders of
common units of limited partnership interest in PDC were entitled to receive
$26.10 per unit in cash or, at the election of the holder, .522 8.5% Series B
Preferred Units (Note 2) per unit. Based upon the elections of such holders,
1,426,393 Series B Preferred Units were issued and the holders of the remaining
common units of limited partnership interest of PDC received approximately
$23,600 in cash. JP Realty owned or had an interest in 51 properties, including
18 enclosed regional mall centers (two of which were owned through controlling
general partnership interests), 26 anchored community centers (two of which were
owned through controlling general partnership interests), one free-standing
retail property and 6 mixed-use commercial/business properties, containing an
aggregate of over 15,200,000 square feet of GLA in 10 western states. The cash
portion of the acquisition price was funded from the net proceeds of certain new
mortgage loans, a new $350,000 acquisition loan (Note 5), and available cash and
cash equivalents.

On August 5, 2002, the Operating Partnership acquired from GGP/Homart, the
Prince Kuhio

                                       20

Plaza in Hilo, Hawaii for approximately $39,000. Prince Kuhio Plaza, which
contains approximately 504,000 square feet of GLA, was acquired by the
assumption by the Operating Partnership of the allocated share of the GGP MPTC
financing (Note 4) pertaining to Prince Kuhio Plaza (approximately $24,000) and
the payment to GGP/Homart of $7,500 in cash and $7,500 in the form of a
promissory note. Immediately following the acquisition, GGP/Homart issued a
dividend of $15,000 to its two co-investors, paid in the form of $7,500 in cash
to NYSCRF (as defined in Note 4 below) and the $7,500 promissory note to the
Operating Partnership. Upon receipt of the promissory note as a dividend, the
Operating Partnership caused the promissory note to GGP/Homart to be cancelled.

On August 26, 2002, concurrent with the formation of GGP/Teachers (Note 3), the
Company, through GGP/Teachers, acquired Galleria at Tyler in Riverside,
California, Kenwood Towne Centre in Cincinnati, Ohio and Silver City Galleria in
Taunton, Massachusetts from an institutional investor for an aggregate purchase
price of approximately $477,000. Two existing non-recourse loans on Silver City
Galleria, aggregating a total of $75,000 and bearing interest at a rate per
annum of 7.41%, were assumed and three new non-recourse mortgage loans totaling
approximately $337,000 were obtained. The new loans bear interest at a weighted
average rate per annum of LIBOR plus 76 basis points.

On September 13, 2002, the Company acquired Pecanland Mall, an enclosed regional
mall in Monroe, Louisiana, for approximately $72,000. The acquisition was funded
by approximately $22,000 of cash on hand and the assumption of a $50,000
existing non-recourse loan that bore interest at a rate per annum equal to the
sum of 3.0% plus the greater of (i) LIBOR or (ii) 3.5%. The loan was scheduled
to mature in January of 2005 and was refinanced in February 2004. The new
$66,000 non-recourse mortgage loan bears interest at a rate of 4.28% per annum,
requires monthly payments of principal and interest and is scheduled to mature
in March 2010.

On December 4, 2002, the Company acquired Southland Mall, an enclosed regional
mall in Hayward, California. The aggregate consideration paid was approximately
$89,000. The purchase was financed with approximately $24,000 of cash on hand
and a new 5-year (assuming all options to extend are exercised) $65,000 mortgage
loan that bears interest at LIBOR plus 75 basis points. The Company currently
plans to refinance this loan in March 2004 with a new $90,000 long-term,
non-recourse, fixed rate amortizing mortgage loan.

2001

During April 2001, GGP-Tucson Mall, L.L.C., a consolidated subsidiary of the
Operating Partnership ("GGP-Tucson"), agreed to advance $20,000 to an
unaffiliated developer in the form of a secured promissory note (bearing
interest at 8% per annum) collateralized by such developer's ownership interest
in Tucson Mall, a 1.3 million square foot enclosed regional mall in Tucson,
Arizona. The promissory note required installment payments of interest-only and
was due on demand. GGP-Tucson had also entered into an option agreement to
purchase Tucson Mall from such developer and its co-tenants in title to the
property. On August 15, 2001, the promissory note was repaid in conjunction with
GGP-Tucson's completion of its acquisition of Tucson Mall pursuant to the option
agreement. The aggregate consideration paid by GGP-Tucson for Tucson Mall was
approximately $180,000 (subject to prorations and to certain adjustments and
payments to be made by GGP-Tucson). The consideration was paid in the form of
cash borrowed under the Operating Partnership's revolving line of credit and an
approximately $150,000 short-term floating rate acquisition loan which was
scheduled to mature in December 2001 but was refinanced in December 2001 in
conjunction with the GGP MPTC financing (Note 5).

DEVELOPMENTS

The Company has an ongoing program of renovations and expansions at its
properties including the following significant projects (projected expenditure

      -     Newpark Mall in Newark (San Francisco), California (owned by
            GGP/Homart)

The above listed projects represent a total projected expenditure (including the
amount of the Unconsolidated Centers at the Company's ownership percentage) of
approximately $370,000.

During 1998, the Company formed the Circle T joint venture to develop a regional
mall in Westlake (Dallas), Texas as further described in Note 4 below. As of
December 31, 2003, the Company had invested approximately $18,311 in the joint
venture. The Company is currently obligated to fund additional pre-development
costs of approximately $539. Total development costs are not finalized or
committed but are anticipated to be funded from a construction loan that is
expected to be obtained. The retail site, part of a planned community which is
expected to contain a resort hotel, a golf course, luxury homes and corporate
offices, is currently planned to contain up to 1.3 million square feet of tenant
space including up to nine anchor stores, an ice rink and a multi-screen
theater. The construction project is currently anticipated to be completed in
2006.

On June 23, 2002, the Company commenced construction of the Jordan Creek Town
Center on a 200 acre site in West Des Moines, Iowa. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company had invested approximately $80,012 in the project, including land costs.
Total development costs are estimated to be approximately $200,000 and are
anticipated to be funded from operating cash flow, current unsecured revolving
credit facilities and/or a future project loan. At completion, currently
scheduled for August 2004, the regional mall is planned to contain up to two
million square feet of tenant space with up to three anchor stores, a hotel and
an amphitheater.

The Company also owns and/or is investigating certain other potential
development sites (representing a net investment of approximately $34,005),
including sites in Toledo, Ohio and South Sacramento, California but there can
be no assurance that development of these sites will proceed.

NOTE 4 INVESTMENTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED AFFILIATES

GGP/HOMART

The Company owns 50% of the common stock of GGP/Homart with the remaining
ownership interest held by the New York State Common Retirement Fund ("NYSCRF").
GGP/Homart has elected to be taxed as a REIT. NYSCRF has an exchange right under
the GGP/Homart Stockholders' Agreement, which permits it to convert its
ownership interest in GGP/Homart to shares of Common Stock of General Growth. If
such exchange right is exercised, the Company may alternatively satisfy such
exchange in cash.

During 2002, as further described in Note 3, GGP/Homart sold its interest in
Prince Kuhio Plaza to the Company for approximately $39,000. In addition,
GGP/Homart acquired on December 19, 2002, for a purchase price of approximately
$50,000, the 50% interest that it did not own in The Woodlands Mall in Houston,
Texas. An additional $50,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at a rate per annum
of LIBOR plus 250 basis points was placed at the property on December 31, 2002
which is scheduled to mature in December 2006.

GGP/HOMART II

In November 1999, the Company, together with NYSCRF, the Company's co-investor
in GGP/Homart, formed GGP/Homart II, a limited liability company which is owned
equally by the Company and NYSCRF. According to the membership agreement between
the venture partners, the Company and its joint venture partner share in the
profits and losses, cash flows and other matters relating to GGP/Homart II in
accordance with their respective ownership percentages.

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

At the time of its formation, GGP/Homart II owned 100% interests in Stonebriar
Centre in Frisco (Dallas), Texas, Altamonte Mall in Altamonte Springs (Orlando),
Florida, Natick Mall in Natick (Boston), Massachusetts, and Northbrook Court in
Northbrook (Chicago), Illinois which were contributed by the Company, and 100%
interests in Alderwood Mall in Lynnwood (Seattle), Washington, Carolina Place in
Charlotte, North Carolina and Montclair Plaza in Los Angeles, California which
were contributed by NYSCRF. Certain of these seven malls were contributed
subject to existing financing ("Retained Debt") in order to balance the net
equity values of the malls contributed by each of the venture partners. Such
contribution arrangements between the Company and NYSCRF have the effect of the
Company having an additional contingent obligation to fund all amounts related
to such debt including any shortfalls GGP/Homart II may incur if the
non-recourse debt (approximately $164,000 at December 31, 2003) related to
Natick Mall is not funded by proceeds from any subsequent sales or refinancing
of Natick Mall.

Subsequent to its formation, GGP/Homart II made three additional acquisitions.
Specifically, during March 2001, GGP/Homart II acquired a 100% ownership
interest in Willowbrook Mall in Houston, Texas for a purchase price of
approximately $145,000. GGP/Homart II financed the Willowbrook acquisition with
a new $102,000 10-year mortgage loan bearing interest at 6.93% per annum and
approximately $43,000 in financing proceeds from a new mortgage loan
collateralized by Stonebriar Centre. Glendale Galleria was acquired by
GGP/Homart II on November 27, 2002, for approximately $415,000. A portion of the
purchase price was paid by the Operating Partnership's issuance of 822,626
convertible preferred Operating Partnership units ("Series C") having a base
liquidation preference of approximately $41,000 (Note 2). In addition, on
December 30, 2002, GGP/Homart II acquired First Colony Mall, an enclosed
regional mall in Sugar Land, Texas for approximately $105,000. The acquisition
was funded by cash on hand and a new $67,000 mortgage loan bearing interest at a
rate per annum of LIBOR plus 80 basis points with a scheduled maturity of
January 2006.

GGP/TEACHERS

On August 26, 2002, the Company formed GGP/Teachers, a new limited liability
company owned 50% by the Company and 50% by Teachers' Retirement System of the
State of Illinois ("Illinois Teachers"). Upon formation of GGP/Teachers,
Clackamas Town Center in Portland, Oregon, which was 100% owned by Illinois
Teachers, was contributed to GGP/Teachers. In addition, concurrent with its
formation, GGP/Teachers acquired Galleria at Tyler in Riverside, California,
Kenwood Towne Centre in Cincinnati, Ohio, and Silver City Galleria in Taunton,
Massachusetts, as described in Note 3. The Company's share (approximately
$112,000) of the equity of GGP/Teachers was funded by a portion of new unsecured
loans that total $150,000 (see note 5) and bear interest at LIBOR plus 100 basis
points. According to the operating agreement between the venture partners, the
Company and Illinois Teachers generally share in the profits and losses, cash
flows and other matters relating to GGP/Teachers in accordance with their
respective 50% ownership percentages. Also pursuant to the operating agreement,
and in exchange for a reduced initial cash contribution by the Company, certain
debt (approximately $19,389 at December 31, 2003) related to the properties was
deemed to be Retained Debt and therefore, solely attributable to the Company.
The Company would be obligated to fund all amounts related to such debt
including any shortfalls of any subsequent sale or refinancing proceeds of the
properties against their respective loan balances to the extent of such Retained
Debt.

In addition, on December 19, 2002, Florence Mall in Florence, Kentucky was
acquired by GGP/Teachers for a purchase price of approximately $97,000 including
a new, two-year $60,000 mortgage loan that bears interest at a rate per annum of
LIBOR plus 89 basis points and matures in January 2008 (assuming an exercise of
both no-cost extension options).

GGP IVANHOE III

On July 1, 2003, the Operating Partnership acquired the 49% common stock
ownership interest in GGP Ivanhoe III which was held by the Company's joint
venture partner (Ivanhoe Cambridge, Inc. of Montreal, Canada ("Ivanhoe")),
thereby increasing the Company's

                                       23

<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

ownership interest to a full 100%. Following the completion of the transaction
described below, GGP Ivanhoe III holds a 100% ownership in 7 enclosed regional
malls.

The aggregate consideration for the 49% ownership interest in GGP Ivanhoe III
was approximately $459,000 (subject to certain prorations and adjustments).
Approximately $268,000 of existing mortgage debt was assumed in connection with
this acquisition with the balance of the aggregate consideration, or
approximately $191,000, being funded from proceeds from the refinancing of
existing long-term debt and new mortgage loans on previously unencumbered
properties.

GGP IVANHOE IV

Concurrently with the July 1, 2003 GGP Ivanhoe III transaction described above,
a new joint venture, GGP Ivanhoe IV was created between the Operating
Partnership and Ivanhoe to own Eastridge Mall, which previously had been owned
by GGP Ivanhoe III. No gain or loss was recognized on the transfer of Eastridge
Mall by GGP Ivanhoe III. The Company and Ivanhoe share in the profits and
losses, cash flows and other matters relating to GGP Ivanhoe IV in accordance
with their respective common stock ownership percentages (51% and 49%,
respectively) except that certain major operating and capital decisions (as
defined in the stockholders' agreement) requires the approval of both
stockholders. Accordingly, the Company is accounting for GGP Ivanhoe IV using
the equity method. GGP Ivanhoe IV will elect to be taxed as a REIT.
Additionally, the stockholders' agreement provides that during certain periods
in 2006 or certain periods in 2009, Ivanhoe shall have the right to require the
Company to purchase all of the GGP Ivanhoe IV common stock held by Ivanhoe for a
purchase price equal to the value of such GGP Ivanhoe IV common stock. The
Company can satisfy this obligation in any combination of cash or Common Stock.
Also in exchange for a reduced cash portion of the total purchase price paid by
the Company in connection with the acquisition of Ivanhoe's interest in GGP
Ivanhoe III, certain debt related to the property (approximately $39,284 at
December 31, 2003) was deemed to be Retained Debt, and therefore, solely
attributable to the Company. Following the acquisition of Ivanhoe's interest in
GGP Ivanhoe III, the Company is obligated to fund all amounts related to such
Retained Debt including any shortfalls of any subsequent sale or refinancing
proceeds of the property against the respective loan balance to the extent of
such Retained Debt.

GGP IVANHOE

GGP Ivanhoe owns The Oaks Mall in Gainesville, Florida and Westroads Mall in
Omaha, Nebraska. The Company contributed approximately $43,700 for its 51%
common stock ownership interest in GGP Ivanhoe and Ivanhoe owns the remaining
49% ownership interest. Other than the absence of a right of Ivanhoe to require
the Company to purchase the GGP Ivanhoe common stock held by Ivanhoe, the terms
of the stockholders' agreement are generally similar to those of GGP Ivanhoe IV
and GGP Ivanhoe has elected to be taxed as a REIT. As certain major decisions
concerning GGP Ivanhoe must be made jointly by the Company and Ivanhoe, the
Company is accounting for GGP Ivanhoe using the equity method.

TOWN EAST/ QUAIL SPRINGS

The Company owns a 50% general partnership interest in Town East Mall, located
in Mesquite, Texas and a 50% general partnership interest in Quail Springs Mall
in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. The Company shares in the profits and losses, cash
flows and other matters relating to Town East and Quail Springs in accordance
with its respective ownership percentages.

On March 1, 2004 the Company acquired the remaining 50% general partnership
interest in Town East from its unaffiliated joint venture partner. The purchase
price for the 50% ownership interest was approximately $44,500, which was paid
in cash from cash on hand, including proceeds from borrowings under the
Company's credit facilities.

CIRCLE T

At December 31, 2003, the Company, through a wholly-owned subsidiary, owns a 50%
general partnership interest in Westlake Retail Associates, Ltd. ("Circle T").
AIL Investment, LP, an affiliate of Hillwood Development Company ("Hillwood"),
is the limited partner of Circle T. Circle T is currently developing the Circle
T Ranch Mall, a regional mall in Dallas, Texas,

a construction loan to be obtained by the joint venture and capital
contributions by the joint venture partners. As of December 31, 2003, the
Company has made contributions of approximately $18,311 to the project for
pre-development costs (and is currently obligated to fund approximately $539 of
additional specified pre-development costs) and Hillwood has contributed
approximately $11,200, mostly in the form of land costs and related
pre-development costs.

Land, buildings and equipment related to the mortgage notes payable with an
aggregate cost of approximately $9,467,917 at December 31, 2003 have been
pledged as collateral. Certain properties, including those within the portfolios
collateralized by commercial mortgage-backed securities, are subject to
financial performance covenants, primarily debt service coverage ratios.

FIXED RATE DEBT

MORTGAGE NOTES AND OTHER DEBT PAYABLE

Mortgage notes and other debt payable consist primarily of fixed rate
non-recourse notes collateralized by individual or groups of properties or
equipment. Also included in mortgage notes and other debt payable as of December
31, 2003 are $100,000 of ten-year senior unsecured notes, bearing interest at a
fixed rate of 7.29% per annum, which were issued by PDC in March 1998 and were
assumed by the Company in conjunction with the acquisition of JP Realty (Note
2). Interest payments on these notes are due semi-annually on March 11 and
September 11 of each year and principal payments of $25,000 are due annually
beginning March 2005. The fixed rate notes bear interest ranging from 1.81% to
10.00% per annum (weighted average of 6.42% per annum), and require monthly
payments of principal and/or interest. Certain properties are pledged as
collateral for the related mortgage notes. Substantially all of the mortgage
notes payable as of December 31, 2003 are non-recourse to the Company. Certain
mortgage notes payable may be prepaid but are generally subject to prepayment
penalty of a yield-maintenance premium or a percentage of the loan balance.
Certain loans have cross-default provisions and are cross-collateralized as part
of a group of properties. Under certain cross-default provisions, a default
under any mortgage notes included in a cross-defaulted package may constitute a
default under all such mortgage notes and may lead to acceleration of the
indebtedness due on each property within the collateral package. In general, the
cross-defaulted properties are under common ownership. However, GGP Ivanhoe debt
collateralized by two GGP Ivanhoe centers (totaling $125,000) is cross-defaulted
and cross-collateralized with debt collateralized (totaling $435,000) by 11
Consolidated Centers.

VARIABLE RATE DEBT

MORTGAGE NOTES AND OTHER DEBT PAYABLE

Variable rate mortgage notes and other debt payable at December 31, 2003
consisted primarily of approximately $495,746 of collateralized mortgage-backed
securities, approximately $1,176,750 of mortgage notes collateralized by
individual properties and $924,750 of unsecured debt of which $789,000 is
outstanding under the Company's 2003 Credit Facility as described below.
Approximately $500,000 of the variable rate debt is currently subject to fixed
rate swap agreements as described below. The loans bear interest at a rate per
annum equal to LIBOR plus 60 to 250 basis points.

COMMERCIAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES

In August 1999, the Company issued $500,000 of commercial mortgage-backed
securities (the "Ala Moana CMBS") collateralized by the Ala Moana Center. The
securities were comprised of notes which bore interest at rates per annum
ranging from LIBOR plus 50 basis points to LIBOR plus 275 basis points (weighted
average equal to LIBOR plus 95 basis points), calculated and payable monthly.
The notes were repaid in December 2001 with a portion of the proceeds of the GGP
MPTC financing described below. In conjunction with the issuance of the Ala
Moana CMBS, the Company arranged for an interest rate cap agreement, the effect
of which was to limit the maximum interest rate the Company would be required to
pay on the securities to 9% per annum.

In September 1999, the Company issued $700,229 of commercial mortgage-backed
securities (the "GGP-Ivanhoe CMBS") cross-collateralized and cross-defaulted by
a portfolio of nine regional malls and an office complex adjacent to one of the
regional malls (four regional malls and the office complex owned by GGP Ivanhoe
III and five regional malls 100% owned by the Company). The GGP-Ivanhoe CMBS was
comprised of notes which bore interest at rates per annum ranging from LIBOR
plus 52 basis points to LIBOR plus 325 basis points (weighted average equal to
LIBOR plus approximately 109 basis points), calculated and payable monthly. The
notes were repaid in December 2001 with a portion of the proceeds of the GGP
MPTC financing described below. In conjunction with the issuance of the
GGP-Ivanhoe CMBS, the Company arranged for an interest rate cap agreement, the
effect of which was to limit the maximum interest rate the Company would be
required to pay on the securities to 9.03% per annum.

In early December 2001, the Operating Partnership and certain Unconsolidated
Real Estate

                                       29

<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

Affiliates completed the placement of $2,550,000 of non-recourse commercial
mortgage pass-through certificates (the "GGP MPTC"). The GGP MPTC was initially
collateralized by 27 malls and one office building, including 19 malls owned by
certain Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates. At December 31, 2003, the GGP
MPTC has a current outstanding balance of approximately $1,600,000 ($734,304 by
Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates) and is collateralized by 17 malls and one
office building, including 10 malls owned by Unconsolidated Real Estate
Affiliates.

The GGP MPTC is comprised of both variable rate and fixed rate notes which
require monthly payments of principal and interest. The certificates represent
beneficial interests in three loan groups made by three sets of borrowers
(GGP/Homart-GGP/Homart II, GGPLP and GGP Ivanhoe III). The original principal
amount of the GGP MPTC was comprised of $1,235,000 attributed to the Operating
Partnership, $900,000 to GGP/Homart and GGP/Homart II and $415,000 to GGP
Ivanhoe III. The three loan groups are comprised of variable rate notes with a
36 month initial maturity (with two no cost 12-month extension options),
variable rate notes with a 51 month initial maturity (with two no cost 18-month
extension options) and fixed rate notes with a 5 year maturity. The 36 month
variable rate notes bear interest at rates per annum ranging from LIBOR plus 60
to 235 basis points (weighted average equal to 79 basis points), the 51 month
variable rate notes bear interest at rates per annum ranging from LIBOR plus 70
to 250 basis points (weighted average equal to 103 basis points) and the 5 year
fixed rate notes bear interest at rates per annum ranging from approximately
5.01% to 6.18% (weighted average equal to 5.38%). The extension options with
respect to the variable rate notes are subject to obtaining extensions of the
interest rate protection agreements which were required to be obtained in
conjunction with the GGP MPTC. The GGP MPTC yielded approximately $470,000
(including amounts attributed to the Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates)
which were utilized for loan repayments on other properties and temporary
investments in cash equivalents and marketable securities. On closing of the GGP
MPTC financing, approximately $94,996 of such proceeds attributable to
GGP/Homart and GGP/Homart II were loaned to the Operating Partnership. The
$16,596 loan by GGP/Homart was repaid by the Operating Partnership in October
2002. The $78,400 loan by GGP/Homart II currently bears interest at a rate per
annum of LIBOR plus 135 basis points on the remaining outstanding balance
(approximately $8,867 at December 31, 2003). Although the loan is currently
scheduled to mature on March 31, 2005 (Note 4), the Operating Partnership
currently expects to repay this loan in full by the end of 2004.

Concurrent with the issuance of the certificates, the Company purchased interest
rate protection agreements (structured to limit the Company's exposure to
interest rate fluctuations), and simultaneously an equal amount of interest rate
protection agreements were sold to fully offset the effect of these agreements
and to recoup a substantial portion of the cost of such agreements. Further, to
achieve a more desirable balance between fixed and variable rate debt, the
Company initially entered into certain swap agreements (notational amount equal
to $666,933). Approximately $575,000 of such swap agreements were with
independent financial services firms. The notional amounts of such swap
agreements decline over time to an aggregate of $25,000 at maturity of the 51
month variable rate loans (assuming both 18 month no-cost extension options are
exercised). These swap agreements convert the related variable rate debt to
fixed rate debt currently bearing interest at a weighted average rate of 4.47%
per annum. Such swap agreements have been designated as cash flow hedges and
hedge the Company's exposure to forecasted interest payments on the related
variable rate debt. The remaining approximately $91,933 of such swap agreements
were with GGP Ivanhoe III to provide Ivanhoe with only variable rate debt. As of
July 1, 2003, in conjunction with the acquisition of the remaining 49% of GGP
Ivanhoe III, the swap agreements between the Company and GGP Ivanhoe III were
cancelled (Note 4).

CREDIT FACILITIES

As of July 31, 2000, the Company obtained an unsecured revolving credit facility
(the "Revolver") in a maximum aggregate principal amount of $135,000
(cumulatively increased to $185,000 through December 2001). The outstanding
balance of the Revolver was fully repaid from a portion of the proceeds of the
GGP MPTC financing described above and the Revolver was terminated. The Revolver
bore interest at a floating rate per annum equal to

                                       30

<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

LIBOR plus 100 to 190 basis points, depending on the Company's average leverage
ratio. The Revolver was subject to financial performance covenants including
debt to value and net worth ratios, earnings ratios and minimum equity values.

In January 2001, GGMI borrowed $37,500 under a new revolving line of credit
obtained by GGMI and an affiliate, which was guaranteed by General Growth and
the Operating Partnership. This revolving line of credit was scheduled to mature
in July 2003 but was fully repaid in December 2001 from a portion of the
proceeds of the GGP MPTC financing described above and the line of credit was
terminated. The interest rate per annum with respect to any borrowings varied
from LIBOR plus 100 to 190 basis points depending on the Company's average
leverage ratio.

In conjunction with the 2002 acquisition of JP Realty, an existing $200,000
unsecured credit facility (the "PDC Credit Facility") with a balance of
approximately $120,000 was assumed. At December 31, 2002, approximately $130,000
was outstanding on the PDC Credit Facility, all of which was repaid in 2003
primarily from the proceeds from a new credit facility obtained in April 2003
described below. The PDC Credit Facility had a scheduled maturity of July 2003
and bore interest at the option of the Company at (i) the higher of the federal
funds rate plus 50 basis points or the prime rate of Bank One, NA, or (ii) LIBOR
plus a spread of 85 to 145 basis points as determined by PDC's credit rating.

In April 2003, the Company reached an agreement with a group of banks to
establish a new revolving credit facility and term loan (the "2003 Credit
Facility") with initial borrowing availability of approximately $779,000 (which
was subsequently increased to approximately $1,250,000). At closing,
approximately $619,000 was borrowed under the 2003 Credit Facility, which has a
term of three years and provides for partial amortization of the principal
balance in the second and third years (currently approximately $28,293 in 2004
and $36,101 in 2005). The proceeds were used to repay and consolidate existing
financing including amounts due on the PDC Credit Facility (which was terminated
upon repayment), the Term Loan and the JP Realty acquisition loan. The amount
outstanding on the 2003 Credit Facility at December 31, 2003 was approximately
$789,000. Amounts borrowed under the 2003 Credit Facility bear interest at a
rate per annum of LIBOR plus 100 to 175 basis points depending upon the
Company's leverage ratio. As of December 31, 2003, the applicable weighted
average interest rate was 2.5%.

INTERIM FINANCING

As of July 31, 2000, the Company obtained an unsecured term loan (the "Term
Loan") in a maximum principal amount of $100,000. As of September 30, 2001, the
maximum principal amount of the Term Loan was increased to $255,000 and, as of
such date, all amounts available under the Term Loan were fully drawn. Term Loan
proceeds were used to fund ongoing redevelopment projects and repay a portion of
the remaining balance of the bank loan described in the prior paragraph
immediately above. During the fourth quarter of 2001, approximately $48,000 of
the principal amount of the Term Loan was repaid from a portion of the 2001
Offering. The Term Loan, which was repaid in April 2003 by the 2003 Credit
Facility, bore interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 100 to 170 basis
points depending on the Company's average leverage ratio.

In July 2002, in conjunction with the JP Realty acquisition, the Company
obtained a new $350,000 loan from a group of banks. The loan, with an
outstanding principal balance of $275,000 at December 31, 2002, bore interest at
a rate (as elected by the borrower) per annum equal to LIBOR plus 150 basis
points and was scheduled to mature on July 9, 2003. The loan was refinanced in
April 2003 by the 2003 Credit Facility.

During August 2002, the Company, through Victoria Ward, arranged for an
aggregate of $150,000 in loans from two separate groups of banks. On August 23,
2002, the Company borrowed an initial $80,000 and, on September 19, 2002, the
Company borrowed an additional $70,000. The two-year loans provide for quarterly
partial amortization of principal, bear interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR
plus 100 basis points, and require the remaining balance to be paid at maturity
(unless extended, under certain conditions, for an

additional nine months).

During June 2003, the Company obtained two new acquisition loans totaling
approximately $307,000 for the purchases of Saint Louis Galleria and Coronado
Center as described in Note 3. The $176,000 loan collateralized by Saint Louis
Galleria currently bears interest at a rate per annum of LIBOR plus 165 basis
points and the loan collateralized by Coronado Center (approximately $101,000 as
of the date of this report) currently bears interest at a rate per annum of
LIBOR plus 91 basis points. Both loans require monthly payments of interest-only
and are scheduled to mature in five years assuming the exercise by the Company
of three one-year, no-cost extension options on each of the loans.

In addition and as described in Note 3, the Company also obtained in 2003 four
new acquisition loans totaling approximately $588,250 for the purchases of
Lynnhaven Mall, Sikes Senter, The Maine Mall and Glenbrook Square. The loans
initially bear interest at LIBOR plus a range of 70 to 125 basis points and
generally mature in five years assuming the exercise by the Company of all
no-cost extension options.

CONSTRUCTION LOAN

In connection with the acquisition of JP Realty, the Company assumed a $47,340
construction loan of Spokane Mall Development Company Limited Partnership, and a
$50,000 construction loan of Provo Mall Development Company, Ltd., in both of
which PDC is the general partner. The loans, which bore interest at a rate per
annum of LIBOR plus 150 basis points, were scheduled to mature in July 2003 but
were replaced in January 2003 with a new long-term non-recourse mortgage loan.
The new loan, allocated $53,000 to the Provo Mall and $42,000 to the Spokane
Mall, is collateralized by the two malls, bears interest at a rate per annum of
4.42% and matures in February 2008.

LETTERS OF CREDIT

As of December 31, 2003 and 2002, the Company had outstanding letters of credit
of $11,830 and $12,104, respectively, primarily in connection with special real
estate assessments and insurance requirements.

NOTE 6 INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAXES

GGMI, one of the Company's subsidiaries, is a taxable corporation and
accordingly, Federal and state income taxes on its net taxable income are
payable by GGMI. For the years ended December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the
Company's Federal income tax expense was zero as a result of prior (and current
year losses in 2001) net operating losses incurred by GGMI. State and local
income and other taxes have not been and are not expected to be significant.

GGMI has recognized a benefit provided for income taxes in the amount of $810,
$2,696 and $0 for 2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively. A net deferred tax asset,
net of valuation allowance, is included in other liabilities at December 31,
2003 and 2002 and is summarized as follows:

</TABLE>

The net deferred tax asset is primarily comprised of net operating loss
carryforwards which are currently scheduled to expire in subsequent years
through 2021. At December 31, 2003, the Company concluded that it was more
likely than not that this net deferred tax asset will be realized in future
periods.

Distributions paid on the Company's common and preferred stock and their tax
status are presented in the following tables. The tax status of the Company's
distributions in 2003, 2002 and 2001 may not be indicative of future periods.
The portion of distributions paid in 2003 shown below as unrecaptured Section
1250 capital gains are designated as capital gain distributions for tax
purposes.

NOTE 7 RENTALS UNDER OPERATING LEASES

The Company receives rental income from the leasing of retail shopping center
space under operating leases. The minimum future rentals based on operating
leases of Consolidated Centers held as of December 31, 2003 are as follows:

Subsequent                      1,498,570
</TABLE>

Minimum future rentals do not include amounts which are payable by certain
tenants based upon a percentage of their gross sales or as reimbursement of
shopping center operating expenses.

Such operating leases are with a variety of tenants, including national and
regional retail chains and local retailers, and consequently, the Company's
credit risk is concentrated in the retail industry.

NOTE 8 TRANSACTIONS WITH AFFILIATES

NOTES RECEIVABLE-OFFICERS

From 1998 through April 30, 2002 certain officers of the Company issued to the
Company an aggregate of $24,997 of promissory notes in connection with their
exercise of options to purchase an aggregate of 2,703,000 shares
(split-adjusted) of the Company's Common Stock.

As of April 30, 2002, the Company's Board of Directors decided to terminate the
availability of loans to officers to exercise options on the Common Stock. In
conjunction with this decision, the Company and the officers restructured the
terms of the promissory notes, including the approximately $2,823 previously
advanced in the form of income tax withholding payments made by the Company on
behalf of such officers. The previous notes, which bore interest at a rate equal
to LIBOR plus 50 basis points, were full recourse to the officers, were
collateralized by the shares of Common Stock issued upon exercise of such
options, provided for quarterly payments of interest and were payable to the
Company on demand. Each of the officers repaid no less than 60% of the principal
and 100% of the interest due under such officer's note as of April 30, 2002 and
the remaining amounts, approximately $10,141 as of April 30, 2002, were
represented by the amended and restated promissory notes. These amended and
restated, fully recourse notes are payable in monthly installments of principal
and interest (at a market rate which varies monthly computed at LIBOR plus 125
basis points per annum) until fully repaid in May 2009 (or within 90 days of the
officer's separation from the Company, if earlier). In October 2002, a voluntary
prepayment of approximately $500 was received from one of the officers. As of
December 31, 2003, the current outstanding balance under the promissory notes
was $7,250, of which approximately $775 relating to income tax withholding
payments has been reflected in prepaid expenses and other assets and
approximately $6,475 has been reflected as a reduction of Stockholders' Equity.

NOTE 9 EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND STOCK PLANS

1993/2003 INCENTIVE PLANS

The Company's 1993 Stock Incentive Plan (which expired according to its terms in
April 2003) provided incentives to attract and retain officers and key
employees. In addition to certain grants of restricted stock as discussed below,
options were granted by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors at
an exercise price of not less than 100% of the fair market value of the Common
Stock on the date of the grant. The term of the options were fixed by the
Compensation Committee, but no option was exercisable more than 10 years after
the date of the grant. Options granted to officers and key employees were for
10-year terms and were generally exercisable in either 33 1/3% or 20% annual
increments from the date of the grants. However, during 2000, 159,957 options
were granted to certain employees under the 1993 Stock Incentive Plan with the
same terms as the TSOs granted in 2000 under the 1998 Incentive Plan as
described and defined below. Options granted to non-employee directors were
exercisable in full commencing on the date of grant and were scheduled to expire
on the tenth anniversary of the date of the grant.

In February 2003, the Company's Board of Directors recommended the adoption of
the Company's 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, to replace the 1993 Stock Incentive
Plan. The 2003 Incentive Stock Plan, which was approved by the shareholders at
the May 2003 annual meeting, provides for the issuance of up to 9,000,000 shares
of Common Stock.

A summary of the status of options granted under the Company's 1993 Stock
Incentive Plan and the 2003 Incentive Stock Plan as of December 31, 2003, 2002
and 2001 and changes during the years ended on those dates is presented below.

1998 INCENTIVE PLAN

General Growth also has an incentive stock plan entitled the 1998 Incentive
Stock Plan (the "1998 Incentive Plan"). Under the 1998 Incentive Plan, stock
incentive awards in the form of threshold-vesting stock options ("TSOs") may be
granted to employees. The exercise price of the TSOs to be granted to a
participant will be the Fair Market Value ("FMV") of a share of Common Stock on
the date the TSO may be granted. The threshold price (the "Threshold Price")
which must be achieved in order for the TSO to vest will be determined by
multiplying the FMV on the date of grant by the Estimated Annual Growth Rate
(currently set at 7% in the 1998 Incentive Plan) and compounding the product
over a five-year period. Shares of the Common Stock must achieve and sustain the
Threshold Price for at least 20 consecutive trading days at any time over the
five years following the date of grant in order for the TSO to vest. TSOs
granted may have a term of up to 10 years but must vest within 5 years of the
grant date in order to avoid forfeiture. Increases in the price of the Common
Stock since the respective grant dates caused the TSOs granted in 1999, 2000 and
2001 to become vested in 2002 and the TSOs granted in 2002 and 2003 to become
vested in 2003 as detailed below. The vesting of the TSOs resulted in the
recognition of approximately $14,908 and $11,818 of compensation expense in the
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 respectively. The aggregate number of
shares of Common Stock which may be subject to TSOs issued pursuant to the 1998
Incentive Plan may not exceed 6,000,000, subject to certain customary
adjustments to prevent dilution.

The following is a summary of the options under the 1998 Incentive Plan that
have been awarded as of December 31, 2003:

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

During 1999, General Growth established the General Growth Properties, Inc.
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the "ESPP") to assist eligible employees in
acquiring a stock ownership interest in General Growth. A maximum of 1,500,000
shares of Common Stock is reserved for issuance under the ESPP. Under the ESPP,
eligible employees make payroll deductions over a six-month purchase period, at
which time the amounts withheld are used to purchase shares of Common Stock at a
purchase price equal to 85% of the lesser of the closing price of a share on
Common Stock on the first or last trading day of the purchase period. Purchases
of stock under the ESPP are made on the first business day of the next month
after the close of the purchase

              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

period. As of January 2, 2004, an aggregate of 870,569 shares of Common Stock
have been sold under the ESPP, including 76,055 shares for the purchase period
ending December 31, 2003 which were purchased at a price of $17.98 per share.

RESTRICTED STOCK

In September 2002 and February 2003, certain officers were granted an aggregate
of 150,000 and 105,000 shares, respectively, of restricted Common Stock pursuant
to the 1993 Stock Incentive Plan. As the restricted stock represents an
incentive for future periods, the compensation expense of approximately $3,245
for such restricted stock will be recognized ratably over the applicable vesting
periods of the Common Stock (through September 2005 and February 2006,
respectively). In addition, in February 2004, certain officers were granted an
aggregate of 55,000 shares of Common Stock pursuant to the 2003 Stock Incentive
Plan, subject only to a one year restriction on sale. Accordingly, the Company
will recognize the full compensation cost of approximately $1,701 in the first
quarter of 2004.

MANAGEMENT SAVINGS PLAN

The Company sponsors the General Growth Management Savings Plan and Employee
Stock Ownership Plan (the "401(k) Plan") which permits all eligible employees to
defer a portion of their compensation in accordance with the provisions of
Section 401(k) of the Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, the Company may make, but is
not obligated to make, contributions to match the contributions of the
employees. For the years ending December 31, 2003, 2002 and 2001, the Company
has elected to make matching contributions of approximately $4,397, $4,196, and
$3,851 respectively.

NOTE 10 DISTRIBUTIONS PAYABLE

On January 5, 2004, the Company declared a cash distribution of $.30 per share
that was paid on January 30, 2004, to stockholders of record (2,081 owners of
record) on January 15, 2004, totaling $65,193. Also on January 30, 2004, a
distribution of $16,714 was paid to the limited partners of the Operating
Partnership. As such declaration relating to the fourth quarter of 2003 did not
occur until 2004, no amounts reflecting distributions payable to stockholders
have been accrued at December 31, 2003 in the accompanying consolidated
financial statements.

On December 12, 2002, the Company declared a cash distribution of $0.24 per
share that was paid on January 31, 2003, to stockholders of record (1,762 owners
of record) on January 6, 2003, totaling $44,937. Also on January 31, 2003, a
distribution of $14,080 was paid to the limited partners of the Operating
Partnership. Also on December 12, 2002, the Company declared the fourth quarter
2002 preferred stock dividend, for the period from October 1, 2002 through
December 31, 2002, in the amount of $0.4531 per share, payable to preferred
stockholders of record on January 6, 2003 and paid on January 15, 2003. As
described in Note 1, such preferred stock dividend was in the same amount as the
Operating Partnership's distribution to the Company of the same date with
respect to the PIERS Preferred Units held by the Company.

NOTE 11 NETWORK DISCONTINUANCE COSTS

During 2000 and 2001, the Company installed a broadband wiring and routing
system that provides tenants at the Company's properties with the supporting
equipment (the "Broadband System") to allow such tenants and mall locations to
arrange high-speed cable access to the Internet. Certain of the properties
acquired subsequent to July 1, 2001 do not have such an installation.

Also during 2000 and 2001, the Company had also been engaged in Network Services
development activities, an effort to create for retailers a suite of broadband
applications to support retail tenant operations, on-line sales, and private
wide area network services to be delivered by the Broadband System. The Company
discontinued its Network Services development activities on June 29, 2001, as
retailer demand for such services had not developed as anticipated.

The discontinuance of the Network Services development activities resulted in a
non-recurring, pre-tax charge to 2001 earnings of $66,000. The $66,000 charge
was comprised of an

<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

approximately $11,800 reduction in the carrying value of equipment that was
intended to allow tenants access to the Network Services applications and
approximately $54,200 in the write-off of capitalized Network Services
development costs including approximately $9,600 in reserves for future costs
and/or settlements of disputes with vendors. Reductions have subsequently been
made in the Network discontinuance reserve as settlement discussions are
continuing with other vendors and the Company has and will continue to reduce
the Network discontinuance reserve as additional settlements are agreed to,
which are currently expected to be fully settled in 2004 or 2005. The Company
believes the remaining reserved amount is adequate to satisfy any remaining
potential liabilities. The Company's investment in the Broadband System, which
is comprised primarily of mall equipment and mall wiring, has been retained by
the Company. The Company has a net carrying investment of approximately $32,800
in the Broadband System as of December 31, 2003. This net investment has been
reflected in buildings and equipment and investment in Unconsolidated Real
Estate Affiliates in the accompanying consolidated financial statements.

NOTE 12 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

In the normal course of business, from time to time, the Company is involved in
legal actions relating to the ownership and operations of its properties. In
management's opinion, the liabilities, if any that may ultimately result from
such legal actions are not expected to have a material adverse effect on the
consolidated financial position, results of operations or liquidity of the
Company.

The Company leases land or buildings at certain properties from third parties.
The leases generally provide for a right of first refusal in favor of the
Company in the event of a proposed sale of the property by the landlord. All of
the Company's ground leases with such third party landlords are classified as
operating leases as none of the criteria that would require classification as a
capital lease are present in such ground leases. Accordingly, rental payments
are expensed as incurred and have, to the extent applicable, been straight-lined
over the term of the lease. Rental expense including participation rent related
to these leases was $2,467, $1,642 and $664 for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001, respectively.

From time to time the Company has entered into contingent agreements for the
acquisition of properties. Each acquisition is subject to satisfactory
completion of due diligence and, in the case of developments, completion and
occupancy of the project.

The following table aggregates the Company's contracted obligations and
commitments subsequent to December 31, 2003:

NOTE 13 RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

In August 2001, the FASB issued Statement No. 143, "Accounting for Asset
Retirement Obligations" ("SFAS 143"). SFAS 143 addresses the financial
accounting and reporting for asset retirement costs and related obligations and
was adopted by the Company on January 1, 2003. The Company does not believe the
impact of the adoption of SFAS 143 on its current or future operations or
financial results will be significant.

In February 2002, the FASB announced the rescission of Statement No. 4,
"Reporting Gains and Losses from Extinguishment of Debt". Generally, such
rescission has the effect of suspending the treatment of debt extinguishment
costs as extraordinary items. The rescission is effective for the year ended
December 31, 2003. Accordingly, in the comparative

                                       37
<PAGE>

                         GENERAL GROWTH PROPERTIES, INC.
                   NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
              (Dollars in thousands, except for per share amounts)

statements presented in 2003, the Company has reclassified to other interest
costs approximately $1,343 and $14,022 of debt extinguishment costs recorded in
2002 and 2001, respectively, that had been classified under then current
accounting standards as extraordinary items.

On November 25, 2002, the FASB published Interpretation No. 45, "Guarantor's
Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including Indirect
Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others" ("FIN 45") prescribes the disclosures to
be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about
obligations under certain guarantees it has issued. FIN 45 also reaffirms that a
guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN 45 are applicable
on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after December 31, 2002.
The disclosure requirements of FIN 45 are effective for the Company's December
31, 2002 consolidated financial statements. As the Company does not typically
issue guarantees on behalf of its unconsolidated affiliates or other
third-parties, the adoption of FIN 45 did not have a significant impact on the
Company's financial statements or disclosures.

In January 2004, the FASB issued Interpretation No. 46 ("FIN 46"),
"Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities" ("VIEs"), to improve financial
reporting of special purpose and other entities. The Company has adopted FIN 46
as of December 31, 2003. Certain VIEs that are qualifying special purpose
entities ("QSPEs") will not be required to be consolidated under the provisions
of FIN 46. In addition, FIN 46 expands the disclosure requirements for the
beneficiary of a significant or a majority of the variable interests to provide
information regarding the nature, purpose and financial characteristics of the
entities. The Company has certain special purpose entities, primarily created to
facilitate the issuance of its commercial mortgage-backed securities (Note 5)
and other securitized debt or to facilitate the tax-increment financing of
certain improvements at its properties. Because these special purpose entities
are QSPEs, which are exempted from consolidation, these special purpose entities
are not required to be consolidated in the Company's consolidated financial
statements. As the Company's Unconsolidated Real Estate Affiliates constitute
businesses (as defined in FIN 46) or have operating agreements granting the
independent third-party joint venturers substantive participating rights, the
implementation of FIN 46 did not result in the consolidation of any previously
unconsolidated affiliates.

In May 2003, the FASB issued Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No.
150, "Accounting for Certain Financial Instruments with Characteristics of Both
Liabilities and Equity," which establishes standards for how an issuer
classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of
both liabilities and equity. It requires that an issuer classify a financial
instrument that is within its scope as a liability. The effective date of a
portion of the Statement has been indefinitely postponed by the FASB. The
Company did not enter into new financial instruments subsequent to May 2003
which would fall within the scope of this statement. No transactions,
arrangements or financial instruments of the Company have been identified that
appear to meet the criteria for liability recognition in accordance with
paragraphs 9 and 10 under SFAS 150 due to the indefinite life of the joint
venture arrangements. Accordingly, even if the effectiveness of the measurement
and classification provision of these paragraphs is no longer postponed, the
Company does not expect that it will be required to reclassify the liquidation
amounts of such minority interests to liabilities.

NOTE 14 PRO FORMA FINANCIAL INFORMATION (UNAUDITED)

Due to the impact of the acquisitions made or committed to during 2001, 2002 and
2003 as described in Note 3, historical results of operations may not be
indicative of future results of operations. The pro forma condensed consolidated
statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2003 includes
adjustments for the acquisitions made or committed to during 2003 as described
in Notes 3 and 4 as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2003.

The pro forma condensed consolidated statement of operations for the year ended
December 31, 2002 includes adjustments for the acquisitions made or committed to
during 2003 plus the acquisitions made in 2002 (as described in Notes 3 and 4),
as if such transactions had occurred on January 1, 2002. The pro forma condensed
consolidated statement of operations for the year ended December 31, 2001
includes the 2003 and 2002 acquisitions described above plus the 2001
acquisitions (as described in Notes 3 and 4), as if all such transactions had
occurred on January 1, 2001. The pro forma information is based upon the
historical consolidated statements of operations excluding extraordinary items,
cumulative effect of accounting change and income (loss) from discontinued
operations and does not purport to present what actual results would have been
had the acquisitions, and related transactions, in fact occurred at the
previously mentioned dates, or to project results for any future period.
