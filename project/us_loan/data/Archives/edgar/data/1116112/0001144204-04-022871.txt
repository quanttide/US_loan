Item 3.02         Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

      On December 23, 2004, we compensated John Dempsey with the payment of
150,000 restricted shares. We valued the stock compensation at $46,500.

      We believe these securities were sold in a private transaction
pursuant to Section 4(2) of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, (the, "Act")
and are deemed restricted securities and may not be publicly resold, without
registration under the Act or unless exempt from the registration requirements.

                                   SIGNATURES

      Pursuant to the requirements of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, the
registrant has duly caused this report to be signed on its behalf by the
undersigned hereunto duly authorized.

                                                     Nuclear Solutions, Inc.
