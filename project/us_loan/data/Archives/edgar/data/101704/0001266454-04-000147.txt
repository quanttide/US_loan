Item 3.02   Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

     On December 17, 2004, we issued an aggregate of 417,600 shares of
restricted stock at a deemed price of $0.90 per share to several persons
pursuant to three agreements in consideration for financial advisory services
rendered to our company. The issuance of these securities was made in reliance
on Section 4(2) of the Securities Act as a transaction not involving any public
offering. No advertising or general solicitation was employed in offering the
securities, the offerings and sales were made to a limited number of person, and
we restricted transfer of the securities in accordance with the requirements of
the Securities Act. The recipients of the securities represented their intention
to acquire the securities for investment only and not with a view to or for sale
in connection with any distribution thereof, and appropriate legends were
affixed to the securities issued in such transactions.
