ITEM 3.02         UNREGISTERED SALES OF EQUITY SECURITIES.

         On December 15, 2004, Icad, Inc. (the "Company") has issued to seven
institutional and accredited investors an aggregate of (i) 1,872,222 shares (the
"Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common
Stock"), and warrants to purchase 936,111 shares of Common Stock (the
"Warrants"). The aggregate purchase price for the Shares and Warrants was
$8,425,000. Each Warrant is exercisable to purchase one share of the Company's
Common Stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share during the five (5)-year
period commencing on December 15, 2004. The Shares and Warrants were issued to
the purchasers without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"), in reliance upon the exemptions from registration provided under
4(2) of the Act. The issuances did not involve any public offering; the Company
made no solicitation in connection with the transactions other than
communications with the purchasers; the Company obtained representations from
the purchasers regarding their investment intent, experience and sophistication;
the purchasers either received or had access to adequate information about the
Company in order to make informed investment decisions; the Company reasonably
believed that the purchasers were sophisticated within the meaning of Section
4(2) of the Act; and the Shares and Warrants were issued with restricted
securities legends. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in
connection with the issuances to date.
