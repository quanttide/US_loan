institutional and accredited investors an aggregate of (i) 1,872,222 shares (the
"Shares") of the Company's common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Common
Stock"), and warrants to purchase 936,111 shares of Common Stock (the

the purchasers without registration under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended
(the "Act"), in reliance upon the exemptions from registration provided under

the purchasers regarding their investment intent, experience and sophistication;
the purchasers either received or had access to adequate information about the
Company in order to make informed investment decisions; the Company reasonably
believed that the purchasers were sophisticated within the meaning of Section

connection with the issuances to date.

                   iCAD ANNOUNCES $8,425,000 PRIVATE PLACEMENT

  FINANCING WILL REDUCE DEBT, ELIMINATE CERTAIN CONVERSION RIGHTS, AND PROVIDE
         WORKING CAPITAL RESERVES TO SUPPORT AGGRESSIVE GROWTH STRATEGY


NASHUA, New Hampshire, December 15, 2004 -- iCAD, Inc. (Nasdaq: ICAD), which
designs, develops and markets Computer Aided Detection (CAD) imaging technology
and systems for the early detection of breast cancer and other medical
applications, today announced that an aggregate of 1,166,666 shares of the
Company's common stock (the "Shares"), along with five-year warrants (the
"Warrants") to purchase 583,333 shares of common stock, have been sold to three
institutional and accredited investors for a total price of $5,250,000. Each
Warrant allows the warrant holder to purchase one share of the Company's common
stock at an exercise price of $5.50 per share. The Company has agreed to
register the Shares and the shares of common stock underlying the Warrants with
the Securities and Exchange Commission. iCAD has also received commitments from
an additional limited number of institutional and accredited investors for up to
$3,175,000 of additional equity financing on the same terms, and expects to
close upon such commitments upon receipt of the funds.


iCAD expects to use approximately $3.3 million of the proceeds from this private
placement to reduce borrowings under a line of credit with the Company's
Chairman (the "Line of Credit") and an additional $625,000 to reduce accrued
interest and related obligations. This transaction will reduce the Company's
annual interest expense by approximately $240,000 and lower the amount of common
stock issuable under conversion rights associated with the Line of Credit by
approximately 1.3 million shares.


"This financing will allow us to reduce our credit line borrowings, reduce
interest expenses, and enhance the liquidity of iCAD's balance sheet," stated W.
Scott Parr, President and CEO of iCAD, Inc. "Any dilution associated with the
financing will be largely offset by the reduction in potential dilution
associated with the paydown of our convertible line of credit."


"We believe this transaction will play a key role in positioning iCAD for
significant growth in coming years," concluded Mr. Parr.
