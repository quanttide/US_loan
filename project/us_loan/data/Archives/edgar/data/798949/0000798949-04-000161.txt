Item 1.01  Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.
           -------------------------------------------

     Effective December 14, 2004, the Compensation Committee of the Board of
Directors of Unit Corporation (the "Company") amended in certain respects the
Company's Separation Benefit Plan of Unit Corporation and Participating
Subsidiaries (Plan A), the Company's Separation Benefit Plan for Senior
Management (Plan B) and the Company's Special Separation Benefit Plan (Plan C).
Plan A allows eligible employees whose employment with the Company is
involuntarily terminated or, in the case of an employee who has completed 20
years of service, voluntarily or involuntarily terminated, to receive benefits
equivalent to 4 weeks salary for every whole year of service completed with the
Company up to a maximum of 104 weeks. To receive payments the recipient must
waive any claims against the Company in exchange for receiving the separation
benefits. Plan B provides certain officers and key executives of the Company
with benefits generally equivalent to Plan A. The compensation committee of the
Board of Directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the individuals
covered in Plan B. Plan C is identical to Plan A with the exception that the
benefits under that plan vest on the earliest of the participant's reaching the
age of 65 or serving 20 years with the Company. The compensation committee of
the Board of Directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the
individuals covered in Plan C. Currently there are no participants in Plan C.

     The majority of the amendments were to bring the plans into compliance with
applicable Oklahoma law and to conform the plans' change in control provisions
to match those contained in other documents relevant to the Company. The
following chart shows the more significant amendments made to each plan:

    Plan Amended         Summary of Amendment            Reason for Amendment
    ------------         --------------------            --------------------

Plan A and Plan B     The definition of Discharge     This change was made
                      for Cause was amended by        to allow the Company
                      removing the term "willful"     greater certainty in
                      in subsections 2.12 (i) and     defining a Discharge
                      (ii).                           for Cause.


Plan A and Plan B     The provisions in the plans     Comply with applicable
                      providing for Forfeiture of     law.
                      Separation Benefit Payments
                      by Competition were revised
                      to bring them into compliance
                      with recent Oklahoma law that
                      restricts the Company's
                      ability to limit a former
                      employee's ability to compete
                      against the Company.
                      Corresponding changes were
                      also made to the Release
                      Agreements that a participant
                      is required to sign to get
                      the benefits under the plan.


Plans A, B and C.     The definition of Change in      This change was made

                      soon as practicable (as
                      determined, in good faith, by
                      the Board of Directors of the
                      Company), of beneficial

            this definition and (E) if the Board of Directors of the Company
            determines in good faith that a Person became the beneficial owner
            of 15% or more of the Outstanding Company Common Stock inadvertently
            (including, without limitation, because (A) such Person was unaware
            that it beneficially owned a percentage of Outstanding Company
            Common Stock that would cause a Change of Control or (B) such Person
            was aware of the extent of its beneficial ownership of Outstanding
            Company Common Stock but had no actual knowledge of the consequences
            of such beneficial ownership under this Plan) and without any
            intention of changing or influencing control of the Company, then

            determined, in good faith, by the Board of Directors of the
            Company), of beneficial ownership of a sufficient number of
            Outstanding Company Common Stock so that such Person's beneficial
            ownership of Outstanding Company Common Stock would no longer
            otherwise qualify as a Change of Control;

      (ii)  individuals who, as of the date hereof, constitute the Board of

            Exchange act, or any other actual or threatened solicitation of
            proxies or consents by or on behalf of any Person other than the
            Board shall not be deemed a member of the Incumbent Board;

      (iii) approval by the stockholders of the company of a reorganization,

      Benefit payable to any Participant under this Plan shall never exceed the
      lesser of (i) 104 Weekly Separation Benefit payments; or (ii) the amount
      permitted under ERISA to maintain this Plan as a welfare benefit plan. The
      benefits payable under this Plan shall be inclusive of and offset by any
      other severance or termination payments made by an Employing Company,

      taxes or otherwise to any federal, state, local or foreign government. In
      determining the amount of any applicable tax, the Employing Company shall

      form(s) filed by the Participant with the Employing Company for purposes
      of income tax withholding on regular wages.

      Entitlement to the unpaid balance of any Separation Benefit amount due a
      Participant under this Plan shall be revoked immediately upon reemployment
      of the person as an employee of an Employing Company. Such unpaid balance
      shall not be payable in any future period.

      However, if the person's re-employment is subsequently terminated and he
      or she then becomes entitled to a Separation Benefit under this Plan,
      Years of Service for the period of re-employment shall be added to that
      portion of his or her prior service represented by the unpaid balance or
      the revoked entitlement for the prior Separation Benefit.

2.7   Integration with Disability Benefits

      The Separation Benefit payable to a Participant with respect to any
      Separation Period shall be reduced (but not below zero) by the amount of
      any disability benefit payable from any disability plan or program
      sponsored or contributed to by an employing Company. The amount of any
      such reduction shall not be paid to the Participant in any future period.

2.8   Plan Benefit Offset

      The amount of any severance or separation type payment that an Employing
      Company is or was obligated to pay to a Participant under any law, decree,
      court award, contract, program or other arrangement because of the
      Participant's separation from service from an Employing Company shall
      reduce the amount of Separation Benefit otherwise payable under this Plan.

      shall be paid in accordance with the greater of (1) the Plan provisions in
      effect immediately prior to the termination of this Plan, and (2) the Plan

      Change in Control of the Company, all Participant shall be vested in
      his/her Separation Benefit as of the date of the Change in Control based
      on such Participant's then Years of Service as determined by reference to
      the schedule set forth in Section 2.3.1 of this Plan. Any Separation
      Benefit deemed to have vested pursuant to this Section shall be payable

      Company and shall be paid in accordance with the Plan provisions in effect
      immediately prior to the Change in Control.

                                Method of Payment

3.1   Separation Benefit Payment

      Separation Benefit payments shall, unless deferred pursuant to Subsection
      3.1.1 or unless otherwise determined by the Committee, be paid in the same
      manner as wages were paid to the Participant.

      3.1.1 Each Participant, upon selection for participation in this Plan, may
            make an election to defer payment of the Separation Benefit to a
            date specified in the deferral election that will be provided in a
            form prescribed by the Administrative Committee. A Participant who
            elects to defer payment of his or her Separation Benefit will also
            be permitted to elect between payment of the deferred Separation
            Benefit in the form of a lump sum or installment payments over a
            24-month period. A Participant may change his or her election so

                                       8
<PAGE>

            long as such change is submitted to the Administrative Committee at
            least twelve months prior to the date payment of a Separation
            Benefit would have otherwise commenced.

3.2   Protection of Business

      Any Participant who receives Separation Benefits under Section 3.3 of this
      Plan agrees that, in consideration of the Separation Benefits, the
      Participant will not, in any capacity, directly or indirectly, and on his
      or her own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity, during the
      period of time he or she is receiving such Separation Benefits, either (a)
      solicit or attempt to induce any current customer of the Company to cease
      doing business with the Company or (b) solicit or attempt to induce any
      employee of the Company to sever the employment relationship
      (collectively, the "Protection of Business Requirements"). Except as
      provided in the next paragraph and/or the Separation Agreement, in the
      event the Participant violates the Protection of Business Requirements of
      this Section (or the like provisions of his or her Separation Agreement),
      the Participant shall not be entitled to any further payments of
      Separation Benefits under this Plan and shall be obligated to repay the
      Employing Company all monies previously received as Separation Benefits.
      In the event of a Change in Control, Participant's obligations under this
      Section shall expire and be canceled, and Participant shall be entitled to
      Separation Benefits under this Plan in accordance with its terms even if
      he or she engages in conduct that would otherwise violate the Protection
      of Business Requirements in this Section.

3.3   Death Subsequent to Termination of Employment

      If the death of a Participant occurs subsequent to the date of Termination
      of Employment and before receipt of the full Separation Benefit to which
      he or she was entitled, the computed lump sum value of the unpaid balance
      of the Separation Benefit amount shall be paid to such Participant's
      Beneficiary. If there is no designated living Beneficiary, the computed
      lump sum value shall be paid to the executor or administrator of the
      Participant's estate.

attached to this Plan as Attachment A (except as may be modified from time to
time), by which the Participant waives and releases the Company, its
subsidiaries and their officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates
from all claims arising or alleged to arise out of his or her employment or the

Agreement being given in exchange for and in consideration of payment of the
Separation Benefit, to which the Participant would not otherwise be entitled.

modified from time to time): the Participant shall be advised in writing, by
receiving the written text of the Separation Agreement so stating, to consult a
lawyer before signing the Separation Agreement; the Participant shall be given

Agreement; and the Separation Agreement shall not take effect until that seven
day period shall have passed.

6.7   Claims Review Procedure

      Consistent with the requirements of ERISA and the regulations thereunder
      as promulgated by the Secretary of Labor from time to time, the following
      claims review procedure shall be followed with respect to the denial of
      Separation Benefits to any Participant:

      6.7.1 Within thirty (30) days from the date of a Participant's Termination
            of Employment, the Employing Company shall furnish such Participant
            with an agreement and release offering Separation Benefits under the
            Plan or notice of such Participant's ineligibility for or denial of
            Separation Benefits, either in whole or in part. Such notice from
            the Employing Company will be in writing and sent to the
            Participant's or the legal representatives of his estate stating the
            reasons for such ineligibility or denial and, if applicable, a
            description of additional information that might cause a
            reconsideration by the Administrative Committee or its delegate of
            the decision and an explanation for the Plan's claims review
            procedure. In the event such notice is not furnished within thirty
            (30) days, any claim for Separation Benefits shall be deemed denied
            and the Participant shall be permitted to proceed to Section 6.7.2
            below.

      6.7.2 Each Participant may submit a claim for benefits to the
            Administrative Committee (or to such other person as may be
            designated by the Administrative Committee) in writing in such form
            as is permitted by the Administrative Committee. A Participant shall
            have no right to seek review of a denial of benefits, or to bring
            any action in any court to enforce a claim for benefits prior to his
            filing a claim for benefits and exhausting his or her rights to
            review under this Section.

            When claim for benefits has been filed properly, such claim for
            benefits shall be evaluated and the Participant shall be notified of
            the approval or the denial within ninety (90) days after the receipt
            of such claim unless special circumstances require an extension of
            time for processing the claim. If such an extension of time for
            processing is required, written notice of the extension shall be
            furnished to the Participant prior to the termination of the initial
            ninety (90) day period which shall specify the special circumstances
            requiring an extension and the date by which a final decision shall
            be reached (which date shall not be later than one hundred and
            eighty (180) days after the date on which the claim was filed). The
            Participant shall be given a written notice in which the Participant
            shall be advised as to whether the claim is granted or denied, in
            whole or in part. If a claim is denied by the Administrative
            Committee, in whole or in part, the Participant shall be given
            written notice which shall contain (1) the specific reasons for the
            denial, (2) references to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the
            denial is based, (3) a description of any additional material or
            information necessary to perfect the claim and an explanation of why
            such material or information is necessary, and (4) the Participant's
            rights to seek review of the denial.

                                       12
<PAGE>

      6.7.3 If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Participant shall
            have the right to request that the Administrative Committee review
            the denial, provided that the Participant files a written request
            for review with the Administrative Committee within sixty (60) days
            after the date on which the Participant received written
            notification of the denial. The Participant (or his duly authorized
            representative) may review pertinent documents and submit issues and
            comments in writing to the Administrative Committee. Within a
            reasonable period, which shall not be later than sixty (60) days
            after a request for review is received, the review shall be made and
            the Participant shall be advised in writing of the decision on
            review, unless special circumstances require an extension of time
            for processing the review, in which case the Participant shall be
            given a written notification within such initial sixty (60) day
            period specifying the reasons for the extension and when such review
            shall be completed (provided that such review shall be completed
            within one hundred and twenty (120) days after the date on which the
            request for review was filed). The decision on review shall be
            forwarded to the Participant in writing and shall include specific
            reasons for the decision and references to Plan provisions upon
            which the decision is based. A decision on review shall be final and
            binding on all persons.

      6.7.4 If a Participant fails to file a request for review in accordance
            with the procedures herein outlined, such Participant shall have no
            rights to review and shall have no right to bring action in any
            court and the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on
            all persons for all purposes.

      6.7.5 The determination whether to grant or to deny any claims for
            benefits under this Plan shall be made by the Administrative
            Committee, in its sole and absolute discretion, and all such
            determinations shall be conclusive and binding on all persons to the
            maximum extent permitted by law.

6.8   Modification and Termination

      The Company may at any time, without notice or consent of any person,
      terminate or modify this Plan in whole or in part, and such termination or
      modification shall apply to existing as well as to future Participants,
      but such actions shall not affect any Separation Benefit that has become
      payable to an Participant, and such benefit shall continue to be paid in
      accordance with the Plan provisions in effect on the date of the
      Termination of Employment.

6.9   Indemnification

      To the extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and hold
      harmless the members of the Board of Directors, the Administrative
      Committee members, and any employee to whom any fiduciary responsibility
      with respect to this Plan is allocated or delegated to, and against any
      and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by any such person as a
      result of any act, or omission to act, in connection with the performance
      of his/her duties, responsibilities and obligations under this Plan, ERISA
      and other applicable law, other than such liabilities, costs and expenses
      as may result from the gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such

                                       13
<PAGE>

      person. The foregoing right of indemnification shall be in addition to any
      other right to which any such person may be entitled as a matter of law or
      otherwise. The Company may obtain, pay for and keep current a policy or
      policies of insurance, insuring the members of the Board of Directors, the
      Administrative Committee members and any other employees who have any
      fiduciary responsibility with respect to this Plan from and against any
      and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by any such person as a
      result of any act, or omission, in connection with the performance of
      his/her duties, responsibilities and obligations under this Plan and under
      ERISA.

6.10  Successful Defense

      A person who has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in
      the defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding or claim or demand
      of the character described in Section 6.9 above shall be entitled to
      indemnification as authorized in such Section 6.9.

6.11  Unsuccessful Defense

      Except as provided in Section 6.10 above, any indemnification under
      Section 6.9 above, unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction,
      shall be made by the Company only if authorized in the specific case:

      6.11.1 By the Board of Directors acting by a quorum consisting of
            directors who are not parties to such action, proceeding, claim or
            demand, upon a finding that the member of the Administrative
            Committee has met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.9
            above; or

      6.11.2 If a quorum under Section 6.11.1 above is not obtainable with due
            diligence by the Board of Directors upon the opinion in writing of
            independent legal counsel (who may be counsel to any Employing
            Company) that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because
            the standard of conduct set forth in Section 6.9 above has been met
            by such member of the Administrative Committee.

6.12  Advance Payments

      Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding or
      claim or demand may be paid by the Company or Employing Company, as
      applicable, in advance of the final disposition of such action or
      proceeding, claim or demand, if authorized in the manner specified in
      Section 6.11 above, except that, in view of the obligation of repayment
      set forth in Section 6.13 below, there need be no finding or opinion that
      the required standard of conduct has been met.

6.13  Repayment of Advance Payments

      All expenses incurred, in defending a civil or criminal action or
      proceeding, claim or demand, which are advanced by the Company or
      Employing Company, as applicable, under Section 6.12 above shall be repaid
      in case the person receiving such advance is ultimately found, under the

                                       14
<PAGE>

      procedures set forth in this Article Six, not to be entitled to the extent
      the expenses so advanced by the Company exceed the indemnification to
      which he or she is entitled.

6.14  Right of Indemnification

      Notwithstanding the failure of the Company or Employing Company, as
      applicable, to provide indemnification in the manner set forth in Sections
      6.11 and 6.12 above, and despite any contrary resolution of the Board of
      Directors or of the shareholders in the specific case, if the member of
      the Administrative Committee has met the standard of conduct set forth in
      Section 6.9 above, the person made or threatened to be made a party to the
      action or proceeding or against whom the claim or demand has been made,
      shall have the legal right to indemnification from the Company or
      Employing Company, as applicable, as a matter of contract by virtue of
      this Plan, it being the intention that each such person shall have the
      right to enforce such right of indemnification against the Company or
      Employing Company, as applicable, in any court of competent jurisdiction.

<PAGE>

                                    Exhibit A

To receive a Separation Benefit, a participant must sign the following
Separation Agreement provided by the Company:

                              SEPARATION AGREEMENT

[Name of Employing Company] ("Unit") and _______________________________________
("Participant") hereby agree as follows:

      Participant's employment will end on ____________________, 20__.

      Unit will pay to Participant a Separation Benefit of $_________________ in
      accordance with and subject to the terms of the Unit Corporation
      Separation Benefit Plan for Senior Management (the "Plan").

      Participant knows that state and federal laws, including the Age
      Discrimination in Employment Act, prohibit employment discrimination based
      on age, sex, race, color, national origin, religion, handicap, disability,
      or veteran status, and that these laws are enforced through the United
      States Equal Employment Opportunity Commission ("EEOC"), United States
      Department of Labor, and State Human Rights Agencies.

      PARTICIPANT IS ADVISED TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY PRIOR TO SIGNING THIS
      AGREEMENT.

      PARTICIPANT HAS TWENTY-ONE DAYS AFTER RECEIVING THIS AGREEMENT TO CONSIDER
      WHETHER TO SIGN IT.

      AFTER SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, PARTICIPANT HAS ANOTHER SEVEN DAYS IN WHICH
      TO REVOKE IT, AND IT DOES NOT TAKE EFFECT UNTIL THOSE SEVEN DAYS HAVE
      ENDED.

      In exchange for the Separation Benefit described above, to which
      Participant is not otherwise entitled, Participant forever releases and
      discharges Unit Corporation, and its subsidiaries, their officers,
      directors, agents, employees, and affiliates from all claims, liabilities,
      and lawsuits arising out of Participant's employment or the termination of
      that employment and agrees not to assert any such claim, liability, or
      lawsuit. This includes any claim under the Age Discrimination in
      Employment Act or under any other federal, state, or local statute or
      regulation relating to employment discrimination. It also includes any
      claim under any other statute or regulation or common law rule relating to
      Participant's employment or the termination of that employment. This
      Agreement does not have any effect with respect to acts or events
      occurring after the date upon which Participant signs it. This Agreement
      does not limit any benefits to which Participant is entitled under any
      retirement plans, if any.

      As further consideration for the payment of the Separation Benefit
      described above, Participant agrees that if Participant's Separation
      Benefit is received pursuant to Section 2.3.2 "Voluntary Separation" of
      the Plan, Participant will not in any capacity directly or indirectly and

                                      A-1
<PAGE>

      on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other person or entity,
      during the period of time he or she is receiving such Separation Benefits,
      either (a) solicit or attempt to induce any current customer of the
      Company to cease doing business with the Company or (b) solicit or attempt
      to induce any employee of the Company to sever the employment relationship
      with the Company (collectively, the "Protection of Business
      Requirements").

      Except as provided in the next paragraph, in the event Participant
      violates the Protection of Business Requirements hereof, Participant shall
      not be entitled to any further payments of Separation Benefits under the
      Plan or this Agreement and shall be obligated to repay Unit all Separation
      Benefit payments previously received under the Plan and this Agreement.

      In the event of a Change in Control (as defined in the Plan),
      Participant's obligations regarding the Protection of Business
      Requirements under this Agreement shall expire and be canceled, and
      Participant shall be entitled to the Separation Benefits provided under
      the Plan in accordance with the terms of the Plan, notwithstanding whether
      Participant thereafter engages in conduct that would otherwise violate the
      Protection of Business Requirements described in this Agreement.

      Participant has carefully read and fully understands all the provisions of
      this Agreement. This Agreement and the Plan constitute the entire
      agreement between the parties and is legally binding and enforceable.
      Participant has not relied upon any representation or statement, written
      or oral, not set forth in this Agreement.

      This Agreement shall be governed and interpreted under federal law and the
      laws of Oklahoma.

      Participant knowingly and voluntarily signs this Agreement.

      Section 3.4    Separation Benefit Limitation

      Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, the Separation
Benefit payable to any Eligible Employee under this Plan shall never exceed the
lesser of (i) 104 Weekly Separation Benefit payments; or (ii) the amount

      However, if the person's re-employment is subsequently terminated and he
or she then becomes entitled to a Separation Benefit under this Plan, Years of
Service for the period of re-employment shall be added to that portion of his or
her prior service represented by the unpaid balance or the revoked entitlement
for the prior Separation Benefit.

      Section 3.7    Integration with Disability Benefits

      The Separation Benefit payable to an Eligible Employee with respect to any

Company is or was obligated to pay to an Eligible Employee under any law,
decree, court award, contract, program or other arrangement because of the
Eligible Employee's separation from service from an Employing Company shall
reduce the amount of Separation Benefit otherwise payable under this Plan.

to this section shall be payable upon such Employee's Termination of Employment
with the Employing Company and shall be paid in accordance with the greater of
(1) the Plan provisions in effect immediately prior to the termination of this
Plan, and (2) the Plan provisions in effect on the date the Employee completed

Company or (b) solicit or attempt to induce any employee of the Company to sever
the employment relationship (collectively, the "Protection of Business
Requirements"). Except as provided in the next paragraph and/or the Separation

Business Requirements of this Section (or the like provisions of his or her
Separation Agreement), the Eligible Employee shall not be entitled to any
further payments of Separation Benefits under this Plan and shall be obligated
to repay the Employing Company all monies previously received as Separation
Benefits. In the event of a Change in Control, Employee's obligations under this
Section shall expire and be canceled, and Employee shall be entitled to
Separation Benefits under this Plan in accordance with its terms even if he or
she engages in conduct that would otherwise violate the Protection of Business

Separation Benefit to the Eligible Employee's Beneficiary, and if there is no
designated, living Beneficiary, the computed lump sum value described above may
be paid to the executor or administrator of the Eligible Employee's estate. For
purposes of calculating the computed lump sum value as provided herein, the
Administration Committee may discount the present value of the future Separation
Benefit payments using a commercially reasonable discount rate.

writing, by receiving the written text of the Separation Agreement so stating,
to consult a lawyer before signing the Separation Agreement; the Employee shall

      Consistent with the requirements of ERISA and the regulations thereunder

           8.7.1 Within thirty (30) days from the date of an Employee's
      Termination of Employment, the Employing Company shall furnish such
      Employee with an agreement and release offering Separation Benefits under

                                       11
<PAGE>

      the Plan or notice of such Employee's ineligibility for or denial of
      Separation Benefits, either in whole or in part. Such notice from the
      Employing Company will be in writing and sent to the Employee or the legal
      representatives of his estate stating the reasons for such ineligibility
      or denial and, if applicable, a description of additional information that
      might cause a reconsideration by the Administration Committee or its
      delegate of the decision and an explanation for the Plan's claims review
      procedure. In the event such notice is not furnished within thirty (30)
      days, any claim for Separation Benefits shall be deemed denied and the
      Employee shall be permitted to proceed to Section 8.7.2 below.

           8.7.2 Each Employee may submit a claim for benefits to the
      Administration Committee (or to such other person as may be designated by
      the Administration Committee) in writing in such form as is permitted by
      the Administration Committee. An Employee shall have no right to seek
      review of a denial of benefits, or to bring any action in any court to
      enforce a claim for benefits prior to his filing a claim for benefits and
      exhausting his rights to review under this section.

           When claim for benefits has been filed properly, such claim for
      benefits shall be evaluated and the Employee shall be notified of the
      approval or the denial within ninety (90) days after the receipt of such
      claim unless special circumstances require an extension of time for
      processing the claim. If such an extension of time for processing is
      required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the
      Employee prior to the termination of the initial ninety (90) day period
      which shall specify the special circumstances requiring an extension and
      the date by which a final decision shall be reached (which date shall not
      be later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date on which
      the claim was filed). The Employee shall be given a written notice in
      which the Employee shall be advised as to whether the claim is granted or
      denied, in whole or in part. If a claim is denied by the Administration
      Committee, in whole or in part, the Employee shall be given written notice
      which shall contain (1) the specific reasons for the denial, (2)
      references to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based,
      (3) a description of any additional material or information necessary to
      perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information
      is necessary, and (4) the Employee's rights to seek review of the denial.

           8.7.3 If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Employee shall
      have the right to request that the Administration Committee review the
      denial, provided that the Employee files a written request for review with
      the Administration Committee within sixty (60) days after the date on
      which the Employee received written notification of the denial. The
      Employee (or his duly authorized representative) may review pertinent
      documents and submit issues and comments in writing to the Administration
      Committee. Within a reasonable period, which shall not be later than sixty
      (60) days after a request for review is received the review shall be made
      and the Employee shall be advised in writing of the decision on review,
      unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing
      the review, in which case the Employee shall be given a written
      notification within such initial sixty (60) day period specifying the
      reasons for the extension and when such review shall be completed
      (provided that such review shall be completed within one hundred and
      twenty (120) days after the date on which the request for review was
      filed). The decision on review shall be forwarded to the Employee in
      writing and shall include specific reasons for the decision and references
      to Plan provisions upon which the decision is based. A decision on review
      shall be final and binding on all persons.

           8.7.4 If an Employee fails to file a request for review in accordance
      with the procedures herein outlined, such Employee shall have no rights to
      review and shall have no right to bring action in any court and the denial
      of the claim shall become final and binding on all Persons for all
      purposes.

           8.7.5 The determinations whether any person qualifies as an Eligible
      Employee under the Plan; and whether to grant or deny any claim for
      benefits under this Plan shall be made by the Administration Committee, in

                                       12
<PAGE>

      its sole and absolute discretion, and all such determinations shall be
      conclusive and binding on all persons to the maximum extent permitted by
      law.

      Section 8.8    Modification and Termination

      The Company may at any time, without notice or consent of any person,
terminate or modify this Plan in whole or in part, and such termination or
modification shall apply to existing as well as to future employees, but such
actions shall not affect any Separation Benefit that has become payable to an
Eligible Employee, and such benefit shall continue to be paid in accordance with
the Plan provisions in effect on the date of the Termination of Employment.

      Section 8.9    Indemnification

      To the extent permitted by law, the Company shall indemnify and hold
harmless the members of the Board of Directors, the Administration Committee
members, and any employee to whom any fiduciary responsibility with respect to
this Plan is allocated or delegated to, and against any and all liabilities,
costs and expenses incurred by any such person as a result of any act, or
omission to act, in connection with the performance of his/her duties,
responsibilities and obligations under this Plan, ERISA and other applicable
law, other than such liabilities, costs and expenses as may result from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such person. The foregoing right
of indemnification shall be in addition to any other right to which any such
person may be entitled as a matter of law or otherwise. The Company may obtain,
pay for and keep current a policy or policies of insurance, insuring the members
of the Board of Directors, the Administration Committee members and any other
employees who have any fiduciary responsibility with respect to this Plan from
and against any and all liabilities, costs and expenses incurred by any such
person as a result of any act, or omission, in connection with the performance
of his/her duties, responsibilities and obligations under this Plan and under
ERISA.

      A person who has been wholly successful, on the merits or otherwise, in
the defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding or claim or demand of
the character described in Section 8.9 above shall be entitled to
indemnification as authorized in such Section 8.9.

      Section 8.11    Unsuccessful Defense

      Except as provided in Section 8.10 above, any indemnification under

           8.11.1 By the Board of Directors acting by a quorum consisting of
      directors who are not parties to such action, proceeding, claim or demand,
      upon a finding that the member of the Administration Committee has met the
      standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.9 above; or

           8.11.2 If a quorum under Section 8.11.1 above is not obtainable with
      due diligence the Board of Directors upon the opinion in writing of
      independent legal counsel (who may be counsel to any Employing Company)
      that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the standard
      of conduct set forth in Section 8.9 above has been met by such member of
      the Administration Committee.

      Section 8.12    Advance Payments

      Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding or
claim or demand may be paid by the Company or Employing Company, as applicable,
in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding, claim or
demand, if authorized in the manner specified in Section 8.11 above, except

                                       13

there need be no finding or opinion that the required standard of conduct has
been met.

      All expenses incurred, in defending a civil or criminal action or
proceeding, claim or demand, which are advanced by the Company or Employing
Company, as applicable, under Section 8.12 above shall be repaid in case the
person receiving such advance is ultimately found, under the procedures set
forth in this Article Eight, not to be entitled to the extent the expenses so
advanced by the Company exceed the indemnification to which he or she is
entitled.

      Section 8.14    Right of Indemnification

      Notwithstanding the failure of the Company or Employing Company, as
applicable, to provide indemnification in the manner set forth in Section 8.11
and 8.12 above, and despite any contrary resolution of the Board of Directors or
of the shareholders in the specific case, if the member of the Administration
Committee has met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.9 above, the
person made or threatened to be made a party to the action or proceeding or
against whom the claim or demand has been made, shall have the legal right to
indemnification from the Company or Employing Company, as applicable, as a
matter of contract by virtue of this Plan, it being the intention that each such
person shall have the right to enforce such right of indemnification against the
Company or Employing Company, as applicable, in any court of competent
jurisdiction.

                            SEPARATION AGREEMENT "A"

      [Name of Employing Company] ("Unit") and ____________________________
("Employee") hereby agree as follows:

      Employee's employment will end on _____________________, 20__.

      In consideration for Employee's agreement to the terms and conditions of
this Separation Agreement ("Agreement"), Unit will pay to Employee a Separation
Benefit of $_______________in accordance with and subject to the terms of the
Separation Benefit Plan of Unit Corporation and Participating Subsidiaries (the
"Plan").

      Employee knows that state and federal laws, including the Age
Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964,
as amended, prohibit employment discrimination based on age, sex, race, color,
national origin, religion, handicap, disability, or veteran status, and that
these laws are enforced through the United States Equal Employment Opportunity
Commission ("EEOC"), United States Department of Labor, and State Human Rights
Agencies.

      EMPLOYEE IS ADVISED TO CONSULT AN ATTORNEY PRIOR TO SIGNING THIS
AGREEMENT.

      EMPLOYEE HAS TWENTY ONE DAYS AFTER RECEIVING THIS AGREEMENT TO CONSIDER
WHETHER TO SIGN THIS AGREEMENT.

      AFTER SIGNING THIS AGREEMENT, EMPLOYEE HAS ANOTHER SEVEN (7) DAYS IN WHICH

      In exchange for receipt of the Separation Benefit described above, to
which Employee acknowledges he or she is not otherwise entitled, Employee
forever releases and discharges Unit Corporation and its subsidiaries, their
officers, directors, agents, employees, and affiliates from all claims,
liabilities, and lawsuits arising out of Employee's employment or the
termination of that employment, and agrees not to assert any such claim,
liability or lawsuit. Employee agrees that this release and discharge includes
any claim under the Age Discrimination in Employment Act and Title VII of the
Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended, and any claim under other federal, state
or local statute or regulation relating to employment discrimination or employee
benefits. Employee agrees that this release and discharge includes any claim
under any other statute, regulation or common law rule relating to Employee's
employment or termination of employment. This Agreement does not have any effect
with respect to acts or events occurring after the date upon which Employee
signs the Agreement. This Agreement does not limit any benefits to which
Employee is entitled under any retirement plans, if any.

      As further consideration for the payment of the Separation Benefit
described above, Employee agrees that Employee will not, in any capacity
directly or indirectly and on his or her own behalf or on behalf of any other
person or entity, during the period of time he or she is receiving such
Separation Benefits, either (a) solicit or attempt to induce any current
customer of the Company to cease doing business with the Company or (b) solicit
or attempt to induce any employee of the Company to sever the employment
relationship (collectively, the "Protection of Business Requirements").

      Except as provided in the next paragraph, in the event Employee violates
the Protection of Business Requirements hereof, Employee shall not be entitled
to any further payments of Separation Benefits under the Plan or this Agreement
and shall be obligated to repay Unit all Separation Benefit payments previously
received under the Plan and this Agreement.

      In the event of a Change in Control of Unit Corporation (as defined in the
Plan), Employee's obligations regarding the Protection of Business Requirements
under this Agreement shall expire and be canceled, and Employee shall be
entitled to Separation Benefits provided under the Plan in accordance with the

laws of the State of Oklahoma, notwithstanding such State's choice of law
provisions. If any part of this Agreement is held by a court of competent
jurisdiction to be void or voidable, such holding shall not apply to render void
or voidable the provisions of this Agreement not encompassed in the court's
holding. Where necessary to maintain this Agreement's validity, a court of
competent jurisdiction may modify the terms of this Agreement to the extent
necessary to effectuate its purposes as demonstrated by the terms and conditions

pursuant to this paragraph or complete discontinuance of Separation Benefits
under the Plan by any Employing Company other than the Company, shall constitute
termination of the Plan with respect to such Employing Company, but such actions
shall not affect any Separation Benefit that has become payable to an Eligible

      Consistent with the requirements of ERISA and the regulations thereunder

review procedure shall be followed with respect to the denial of Separation
Benefits to any Employee:

            8.7.1 Within thirty (30) days from the date of an Employee's
      Termination of Employment, the Employing Company shall furnish such
      Employee with an agreement and release offering Separation Benefits under
      the Plan or notice of such Employee's ineligibility for or denial of
      Separation Benefits, either in whole or in part. Such notice from the
      Employing Company will be in writing and sent to the Employee or the legal
      representatives of his estate stating the reasons for such ineligibility
      or denial and, if applicable, a description of additional information that

                                       10
<PAGE>

      might cause a reconsideration by the Administration Committee or its
      delegate of the decision and an explanation for the Plan's claims review
      procedure. In the event such notice is not furnished within thirty (30)
      days, any claim for Separation Benefits shall be deemed denied and the
      Employee shall be permitted to proceed to Section 8.7.2 below.

            8.7.2 Each Employee may submit a claim for benefits to the
      Administration Committee (or to such other person as may be designated by
      the Administration Committee) in writing in such form as is permitted by
      the Administration Committee. An Employee shall have no right to seek
      review of a denial of benefits, or to bring any action in any court to
      enforce a claim for benefits prior to his filing a claim for benefits and
      exhausting his rights to review under this section.

            When claim for benefits has been filed properly, such claim for
      benefits shall be evaluated and the Employee shall be notified of the
      approval or the denial within ninety (90) days after the receipt of such
      claim unless special circumstances require an extension of time for
      processing the claim. If such an extension of time for processing is
      required, written notice of the extension shall be furnished to the
      Employee prior to the termination of the initial ninety (90) day period
      which shall specify the special circumstances requiring an extension and
      the date by which a final decision shall be reached (which date shall not
      be later than one hundred and eighty (180) days after the date on which
      the claim was filed). The Employee shall be given a written notice in
      which the Employee shall be advised as to whether the claim is granted or
      denied, in whole or in part. If a claim is denied by the Administration
      Committee, in whole or in part, the Employee shall be given written notice
      which shall contain (1) the specific reasons for the denial, (2)
      references to pertinent Plan provisions upon which the denial is based,
      (3) a description of any additional material or information necessary to
      perfect the claim and an explanation of why such material or information
      is necessary, and (4) the Employee's rights to seek review of the denial.

            8.7.3 If a claim is denied, in whole or in part, the Employee shall
      have the right to request that the Administration Committee review the
      denial, provided that the Employee files a written request for review with
      the Administration Committee within sixty (60) days after the date on
      which the Employee received written notification of the denial. The
      Employee (or his duly authorized representative) may review pertinent
      documents and submit issues and comments in writing to the Administration
      Committee. Within a reasonable period, which shall not be later than sixty
      (60) days after a request for review is received the review shall be made
      and the Employee shall be advised in writing of the decision on review,
      unless special circumstances require an extension of time for processing
      the review, in which case the Employee shall be given a written
      notification within such initial sixty (60) day period specifying the
      reasons for the extension and when such review shall be completed
      (provided that such review shall be completed within one hundred and
      twenty (120) days after the date on which the request for review was
      filed). The decision on review shall be forwarded to the Employee in
      writing and shall include specific reasons for the decision and references
      to Plan provisions upon which the decision is based. A decision on review
      shall be final and binding on all persons.

            8.7.4 If an Employee fails to file a request for review in
      accordance with the procedures herein outlined, such Employee shall have
      no rights to review and shall have no right to bring action in any court
      and the denial of the claim shall become final and binding on all Persons
      for all purposes.

            8.7.5 The determinations whether any person qualifies as an Eligible
      Employee under the Plan; and whether to grant or deny any claim for
      benefits under this Plan shall be made by the Administration Committee, in
      its sole and absolute discretion, and all such determinations shall be
      conclusive and binding on all persons to the maximum extent permitted by
      law.

      Section 8.8    Modification and Termination

      The Company may at any time, without notice or consent of any person,
terminate or modify this Plan in whole or in part, and such termination or
modification shall apply to existing as well as to future employees, but such
actions shall not affect any Separation Benefit that has become payable to an
Eligible Employee, and such benefit shall continue to be paid in accordance with

costs and expenses incurred by any such person as a result of any act, or
omission to act, in connection with the performance of his/her duties,
responsibilities and obligations under this Plan, ERISA and other applicable
law, other than such liabilities, costs and expenses as may result from the
gross negligence or willful misconduct of any such person. The foregoing right
of indemnification shall be in addition to any other right to which any such
person may be entitled as a matter of law or otherwise. The Company may obtain,
pay for and keep current a policy or policies of insurance, insuring the members
of the Board of Directors, the Administration Committee members and any other
employees who have any fiduciary responsibility with respect to this Plan from

the defense of a civil or criminal action or proceeding or claim or demand of
the character described in Section 8.9 above shall be entitled to
indemnification as authorized in such Section 8.9.

      Section 8.11    Unsuccessful Defense

      Except as provided in Section 8.10 above, any indemnification under
Section 8.9 above, unless ordered by a court of competent jurisdiction, shall be

            8.11.1 By the Board of Directors acting by a quorum consisting of
      directors who are not parties to such action, proceeding, claim or demand,
      upon a finding that the member of the Administration Committee has met the
      standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.9 above; or

            8.11.2 If a quorum under Section 8.11.1 above is not obtainable with
      due diligence; the Board of Directors upon the opinion in writing of
      independent legal counsel (who may be counsel to any Employing Company)
      that indemnification is proper in the circumstances because the standard
      of conduct set forth in Section 8.9 above has been met by such member of
      the Administration Committee.

      Section 8.12    Advance Payments

      Expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding or
claim or demand may be paid by the Company or Employing Company, as applicable,
in advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding, claim or

proceeding, claim or demand, which are advanced by the Company or Employing
Company, as applicable, under Section 8.12 above shall be repaid in case the

                                      12
<PAGE>

person receiving such advance is ultimately found, under the procedures set
forth in this Article Eight, not to be entitled to the extent the expenses so
advanced by the Company exceed the indemnification to which he or she is
entitled.

      Section 8.14    Right of Indemnification

      Notwithstanding the failure of the Company or Employing Company, as
applicable, to provide indemnification in the manner set forth in Section 8.11
and 8.12 above, and despite any contrary resolution of the Board of Directors or
of the shareholders in the specific case, if the member of the Administration
Committee has met the standard of conduct set forth in Section 8.9 above, the
person made or threatened to be made a party to the action or proceeding or
against whom the claim or demand has been made, shall have the legal right to
indemnification from the Company or Employing Company, as applicable, as a
matter of contract by virtue of this Plan, it being the intention that each such

Company or Employing Company, as applicable, in any court of competent

                              CONSULTING AGREEMENT

     This consulting agreement is dated December 17, 2004, and is between John
G. Nikkel ("Nikkel") and Unit Corporation, a Delaware corporation (the
"Corporation").


     Nikkel has elected to retire as an employee and Chief Executive Officer of
the Corporation effective April 1, 2005 and will cease to be an officer of the
Corporation as of that date.

     The board of directors of the Corporation wishes to secure the services of
Nikkel as a consultant to the Corporation and Nikkel is willing to act in that
capacity following his retirement.


     The Corporation and Nikkel wish to enter into this agreement to describe
their obligations to each other and the scope of Nikkel's services to the
Corporation as an independent contractor and consultant to the Corporation after
his retirement.

     The parties therefore agree as follows:

1. Term of Agreement. This agreement is for a term of 1 year starting on the
date of Nikkel's retirement unless it is sooner terminated by mutual written
agreement of the parties. In the event of Nikkel's death during the term of this
agreement, the obligations of the parties under this agreement shall terminate.

     The parties, by mutual written agreement, may extend the term of this
agreement for successive 1 year periods at any time before the termination of
the then existing term of this agreement.

2. Consulting Fees. In consideration of Nikkel's obligations under this
agreement, the Corporation shall pay Nikkel an annual consulting fee of $70,000,
with payments to be made monthly in accordance with the Corporation's usual
procedures. This compensation shall be paid beginning as of Nikkel's retirement
date and ending on the termination of this agreement.

     During the term of this agreement the Corporation shall make available to
Nikkel secretarial services and office space.

3. Consulting Services.

     3.1 Duration and Scope. During the term of this agreement, Nikkel shall
serve as a consultant to the Corporation (including its subsidiaries, affiliates
and joint venture partners). Nikkel will provide the advice and counsel to the
Corporation as reasonably requested by the Chief Executive Officer of the
Corporation. Unless otherwise requested, Nikkel shall attend the weekly
exploration meetings held by the Corporation's subsidiary Unit Petroleum Company
to assist in the decisions normally made during those meetings.

     3.2 Compliance with Laws. Nikkel shall comply at his expense with all
applicable provisions of workers' compensation laws, unemployment compensation
laws, federal social security law, the Fair Labor Standards Act, federal, state
and local income tax laws, and all other applicable federal, state and local
laws, regulations and codes applicable to his status as an independent
contractor.

     3.3 Status. As a consultant to the Corporation, Nikkel shall act as an
independent contractor. Nikkel shall not have the status of an employee of the
Corporation. Nikkel shall be solely responsible for and shall pay all such
amounts of applicable federal and state income and self employment taxes. Except
as otherwise provided in this agreement, Nikkel shall not be eligible to
participate in any employee benefit, group insurance or compensation plans or

                                  Page 1 of 4
<PAGE>

programs maintained by the Corporation; provided, however, that any rights that
Nikkel may have under these plans or programs because of his prior status as an
employee and officer of the Corporation (or his status as a director of the
Corporation) shall not be affected by this agreement. The Corporation shall not
provide Social Security, unemployment compensation, disability insurance,
workers ' compensation or similar coverage, or any other statutory employment
benefit, to Nikkel.

     3.4 Reimbursement of Reasonable Expenses. On presentment to the Corporation
of appropriate documentation of his expenses, the Corporation shall reimburse
Nikkel under guidelines similar to those applicable to the Corporation's
officers for reasonable expenses incurred by Nikkel during the performance of
his consulting services.

4. Protection of the Corporation's Interests.

     4.1 Protection of Trade Secrets. For the term of this agreement, Nikkel
shall not, without the prior written consent of the Corporation, disclose or use
for any purpose (except in the course of his consulting services with the
Corporation and in furtherance of the Corporation's business) confidential
information or proprietary data of the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates
and joint venture partners, except as required by applicable law or legal
process. Nikkel agrees to deliver to the Corporation at the termination of this
agreement, or at such other time as the Corporation may request, all memoranda,
notes, plans, records, reports and other documents (and copies thereof) relating
to the business of the Corporation, its subsidiaries, affiliates and joint
venture partners, that Nikkel may then possess or have under his control.

     4.2 Limitation on Services Provided to Others. During the term of this
agreement, Nikkel shall not, directly or indirectly:

          (a) Engage in any business or activity in which the Corporation or any
subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture partner of the Corporation is engaged
(provided, however, that the purchase, sale and leasing of oil and gas mineral
interests or participating in the drilling of oil and gas wells by Nikkel shall
not be deemed to be a violation of this provision but nothing in this agreement
will relieve Nikkel of any fiduciary duties he may owe to the Corporation); nor

          (b) Be employed by, render services of any kind to, advise or receive
compensation in any form from, nor invest or participate in any manner or
capacity in, any entity or person that directly or indirectly engages in such
business or activity.

     This Subsection will not preclude investments in a corporation whose stock
is traded on a public market and of which Nikkel owns less than a significant
interest.

     4.3 Nonsolicitation. During the term of this agreement, Nikkel shall not,
directly or indirectly:


          (a) Attempt to cause any employee of the Corporation or any
subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture partner to leave his or her employment;
nor

          (b) Knowingly advise or provide information to any person in
connection with an attempt by such person to cause any employee of the
Corporation or any subsidiary, affiliate or joint venture partner to leave his
or her employment.

     4.4 Modification by Court. If any of the covenants contained in subsections
4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above is determined to be unenforceable because of the duration
of the covenant or the area covered by it, then the court or arbitrator making
the determination shall have the power to reduce the duration of the covenant or
the area covered by it, and the covenants, in their reduced form, will be
enforceable.

     4.5 Different Jurisdictions. If any of the covenants set forth in
Subsections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above is determined to be wholly unenforceable by
the courts or arbitrators of any domestic or foreign jurisdiction, then the
determination shall not bar or in any way affect the Corporation's right to

                                  Page 2 of 4
<PAGE>

relief in the courts or in arbitration proceedings of any other jurisdiction
with respect to any breach of such covenants in such other jurisdiction. Such
covenants, as they relate to each jurisdiction, shall be severable into
independent covenants and shall be governed by the laws of the jurisdiction
where a breach occurs.

     4.6 Purpose of Covenants. Nikkel and the Corporation agree that the
covenants in Subsections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above are reasonable and necessary to
protect the confidentiality of the trade secrets and other proprietary
information concerning the business of the Corporation and its subsidiaries,
affiliates and joint venture partners that was acquired by Nikkel as an employee
of the Corporation and during the course of his consulting services under this
Agreement.

     4.7 Repayment of Gains. Nikkel and the Corporation agree that the principal
purpose of entering into this agreement was to motivate Nikkel to contribute to
the Corporation's success and to increase the Corporation's value. Nikkel and
the Corporation also agree that any breach of the covenants set forth in
Subsections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above would be contrary to the purpose of this
agreement. In the event that Nikkel takes any action contrary to any of the
covenants set forth in Subsections 4.1, 4.2 and 4.3 above, Nikkel shall on
demand pay the Corporation an amount equal to the total amount of all cash
compensation paid to Nikkel under this agreement, whether that cash compensation
was paid before or after the time when Nikkel takes the contrary action.

5. Miscellaneous Provisions.

     5.1 Waiver. No provisions of this agreement can be modified, waived or
discharged unless the modification, waiver or discharge is agreed to in writing
and signed by Nikkel and the Corporation. No waiver by either party of any
breach of, or of compliance with, any condition or provision of this agreement
by the other party shall be considered a waiver of any other condition or
provision or of the same condition or provision at another time.

     5.2 Assignment and Successors; The Corporation. The Corporation shall
require any successor (whether direct or indirect and whether by purchase,
lease, merger, consolidation, liquidation or otherwise) to all or substantially
all of the Corporation's business and/or assets, by an agreement in substance
and form satisfactory to Nikkel, to assume this agreement and to perform this
agreement in the same manner and to the same extent as the Corporation would be
required to perform it in the absence of a succession. For all purposes under
this agreement, the term "Corporation" shall include any successor to the
Corporation's business and/or assets that executes and delivers the assumption
agreement described in this Subsection 5.2 or that becomes bound by this
agreement by operation of law. The rights and benefits of Nikkel under this
agreement may not be anticipated, assigned, alienated, or subject to attachment,
garnishment, levy, execution, or other legal or equitable process except as
required by law. Any attempt by Nikkel to anticipate, alienate, assign, sell,
transfer, pledge, encumber, or charge the same shall be void.

     5.3 Arbitration. Any dispute or controversy arising under or in connection
with this agreement shall be settled exclusively by arbitration in Tulsa,
Oklahoma, in accordance with the rules of the American Arbitration Association
then in effect. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's award in any court
having jurisdiction. Within 30 days following the conclusion of any arbitration
proceeding (notwithstanding any appeal), the Corporation shall pay all
reasonable attorneys' fees and related expenses incurred by Nikkel in connection
with any such arbitration; provided, however, that the Corporation's
reimbursement obligation under this sentence shall be limited to $15,000 in the
event that the Corporation is the prevailing party in the action and $30,000 if
Nikkel is the prevailing party in the action. For purposes of the preceding
sentence, if there is disagreement concerning who is the prevailing party, then
the parties shall request that the arbitrator hearing the dispute determine the
point and the parties agree to be bound by the arbitrator's determination.

     5.4 Taxes. All payments made under this agreement shall be subject to any
required withholding of applicable taxes.

     5.5 Whole Agreement. No agreements, representations or understandings
(whether oral or written and whether express or implied) which are not expressly
set forth in this agreement have been made or entered into by either party with
respect to the subject matter hereof.

     5.6 Choice of Law. The validity, interpretation, construction and
performance of this agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of
Oklahoma.

     5.7 Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision or
provisions of this agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability of
any other provision, which shall remain in full force and effect.

     5.8 Delivery of Notice. Notices and all other communications contemplated
by this agreement shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been duly
given when personally delivered or when mailed by certified mail, return receipt
requested and postage prepaid. In the case of the Nikkel, mailed notices shall
be addressed to him at the home address which he most recently communicated to
the Corporation in writing. In the case of the Corporation, mailed notices shall
be addressed to its corporate headquarters, and all notices shall be directed to
the attention of its Secretary.

     IN WITNESS WHEREOF, each of the parties has signed this agreement, in the
case of the Corporation by its duly authorized officer, as of the day and year
first above written.
