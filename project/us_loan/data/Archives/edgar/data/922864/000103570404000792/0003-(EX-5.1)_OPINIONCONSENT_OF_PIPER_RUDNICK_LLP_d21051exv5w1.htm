Company from time to time of up to $1,049,096,085 aggregate initial offering price of certain

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Registration Statement, the Prospectus, and the related final
Prospectus Supplement, dated December&nbsp;16, 2004 (the &#147;Prospectus Supplement&#148;),
relating to the Shares.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The resolutions of the Board of Directors of the Company or a committee
thereof relating to the authorization of the Underwriting Agreement and the

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(h) Such other documents as we have considered necessary to the rendering of
the opinion expressed below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our examination of the aforesaid documents, we have assumed, without independent
investigation, the genuineness of all signatures, the legal capacity of all individuals who have
executed any of the aforesaid documents, the authenticity of all documents submitted to us as
originals, the conformity with originals of all documents submitted to us as copies (and the
authenticity of the originals of such copies), the absence of other agreements or understandings
among the parties, written or oral, or actions or conduct of the parties or otherwise that would
modify, amend, supplement, or waive the terms of the Underwriting Agreement or the respective
rights or obligations of the parties thereunder, the accuracy of the representations and warranties
of the parties as set forth in the Underwriting Agreement, and the accuracy and completeness of all
public records reviewed by us. In making our examination of documents executed by parties other
than the Company, we have assumed that such parties had the power, corporate or other, to enter
into and perform all obligations thereunder, and we have also assumed the due authorization by all
requisite action, corporate or other, and the valid execution and delivery by such parties of such
documents and the validity, binding effect, and enforceability thereof with respect to such
parties. As to any facts material to this opinion, we have relied solely upon the Certificate. We
have also further assumed, without independent investigation, that the Shares will be issued in
accordance with the terms of the Underwriting Agreement, the Registration Statement, the
Prospectus, the Prospectus Supplement, and the Resolutions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon the foregoing, having regard for such legal considerations as we deem relevant, and
limited in all respects to applicable Maryland law, we are of the opinion and advise you that the
Shares have been duly authorized, and when issued and delivered
pursuant to terms of the Resolutions, the Charter (including the Articles Supplementary), the Underwriting
Agreement, and all applicable laws, and upon receipt by the Company of the consideration for

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">the
Shares as described in the Underwriting Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid, and
non-assessable.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinion set forth herein is subject to additional assumptions, qualifications and
limitations as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) This opinion concerns only the effect of the laws (exclusive of the
principles of conflict of laws) of the State of Maryland as currently in effect. We
assume no obligation to supplement this opinion if any applicable laws change after
the date hereof or if any facts or circumstances come to our attention after the
date hereof that might change this opinion.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) We have made no investigation of, and we express no opinion as to, the
laws of any jurisdiction other than the laws of the State of Maryland. To the
extent that any documents referred to herein are governed by the laws of a
jurisdiction other than Maryland, we have assumed that the laws of such jurisdiction
are the same as the laws of Maryland.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) We express no opinion as to compliance with the securities (or &#147;blue sky&#148;)
laws or the real estate syndication laws of the State of Maryland.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) We assume that the issuance of the Shares by the Company will not cause
any person to violate any of the provisions of the Charter relating to the Initial
Holder Limit, the Look-Through Ownership Limit, or the Ownership Limit (as those
terms are defined in the Charter).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) We further assume that the issuance and sale of the Shares will not cause
the Company to exceed the total limit of the authorized capital stock of the
Company, as provided in the Charter.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) This opinion is limited to the matters set forth herein, and no other
opinion should be inferred beyond the matters expressly stated.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion with the Commission as Exhibit&nbsp;5.1 to the
Current Report on Form 8-K and to the reference to our firm under the heading &#147;Legal Matters&#148; in
the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Shares. In giving our consent, we do not thereby admit
that we are in the category of persons whose consent is required under Section&nbsp;7 of the Act or the
rules and regulations of the Commission thereunder.
