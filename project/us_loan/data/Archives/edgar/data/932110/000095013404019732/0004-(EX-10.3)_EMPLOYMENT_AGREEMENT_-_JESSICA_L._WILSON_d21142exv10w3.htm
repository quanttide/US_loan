engaging in any communication with any then current or former employee,
officer, director, shareholder, customer, vendor or competitor of the Company
or any third party other than Executive&#146;s spouse or legal counsel, which could
reasonably be interpreted as derogatory or disparaging to the reputation of the
Company and its business practices, employees, officers, directors and agents.

Directors of the surviving entity resulting from such transaction, or (ii)&nbsp;a
sale of all or substantially all of the assets of the Company to another
corporation, individual or entity, as a result of which, the members of the
Board, elected by the shareholders of the Company immediately prior to such
transaction fail to constitute at least a majority of the Board of Directors of
the entity purchasing the assets of the Company; or (iii)&nbsp;any &#147;person&#148; (as such
term is defined in Section&nbsp;3(a)(9) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the

duly given pursuant hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.&nbsp;TERMINATION OF PRIOR AGREEMENTS. Except as provided for herein, this
Agreement terminates and supersedes any and all prior agreements and
understandings between the parties with respect to employment or with respect
to the compensation of the Executive by the Company from and after the
Effective Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;17.&nbsp;ASSIGNMENT; SUCCESSORS. This Agreement is personal in its nature and
neither of the parties hereto shall, without the consent of the other, assign
or transfer this Agreement or any rights or obligations hereunder; provided
that, in the event of the merger, consolidation, transfer or sale of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company with or to any other individual
or entity, this Agreement shall, subject to the express provisions hereof, be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Executive and such successor and such
successor shall discharge and perform all the promises, covenants, duties, and
obligations of the Company hereunder.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.&nbsp;GOVERNING LAW. This Agreement and the legal relations thus created
between the parties hereto shall be governed by and construed under and in
accordance with the laws of the State of Texas.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19.&nbsp;RESOLUTION OF DIFFERENCES; BREACH OF AGREEMENT. The parties shall use
good faith efforts to resolve any controversy or claim arising out of, or
relating to this Agreement or the breach thereof, first in accordance with the
Company&#146;s internal review procedures. If despite their good faith efforts, the
parties are unable to resolve such controversy or claim through the Company&#146;s
internal review procedures, then such controversy or claim shall be resolved by
binding arbitration in Dallas, Texas in accordance with the rules and
procedures of the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American
Arbitration Association then in effect. The decision of the arbitrator shall
be final and binding on both parties, and any court of competent jurisdiction
may enter judgment upon the award. The prevailing party in such action shall
be entitled to recoup their costs and attorneys fees from the opposing

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">party. This paragraph shall apply to all controversies, disputes or claims
arising out of or relating to this Agreement, with the sole exception of
controversies, disputes or claims under paragraphs 7, 12 and 13, whereby the
Company or Executive, in addition to and not in lieu of any remedies either may
have, may seek equitable and legal relief from any court of competent
jurisdiction for any breach of said paragraphs.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;20.&nbsp;ENTIRE AGREEMENT; HEADINGS. This Agreement embodies the entire
agreement of the parties respecting the matters within its scope and may be
modified only in writing. Section headings in this Agreement are included
herein for convenience of reference only and shall not constitute a part of
this Agreement for any other purpose.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.&nbsp;WAIVER; MODIFICATION. Failure to insist upon strict compliance with
any of the terms, covenants, or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver
of such term, covenant, or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment
of, or failure to insist upon strict compliance with, any right or power
hereunder at any one or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such
right or power at any other time or times. This Agreement shall not be modified
in any respect except by a writing executed by each party hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.&nbsp;SEVERABILITY. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
determines that any portion of this Agreement is in violation of any statute or
public policy, only the portions of this Agreement that violate such statute or
public policy shall be stricken. All portions of this Agreement that do not
violate any statute or public policy shall continue in full force and effect.
Further, any court order striking any portion of is Agreement shall modify the
stricken terms as narrowly as possible to give as much effect as possible to
the intentions of the parties under this Agreement.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;23.&nbsp;INDEMNIFICATION. The Company shall indemnify and hold Executive
harmless to the maximum extent permitted by law and consistent with the
Company&#146;s Articles of Incorporation and Bylaws of the Company; provided
however, that nothing herein shall prevent the Company from amending its
Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; provided, however notwithstanding any such
amendment, Executive shall have the right to indemnification which is no less
favorable than any other comparable officer of the Company. The Company&#146;s
obligations under this Section&nbsp;23 shall survive the termination of this
Agreement and Executive&#146;s employment for the maximum period permitted by law.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;24.&nbsp;COUNTERPARTS. This Agreement may be executed in several counterparts,
each of which shall be deemed to be an original but all of which together will
constitute one and the same instrument.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;25.&nbsp;MITIGATION. Executive shall not be required to mitigate amounts
payable under this Agreement by seeking other employment or otherwise, and,
except as otherwise provided in Section&nbsp;10, 11 and 14 of this Agreement, there
shall be no offset against amounts or benefits due Executive under this
Agreement on account of subsequent employment and/or eligibility for benefits.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.&nbsp;SURVIVAL. The representations, warranties, agreements, covenants,
obligations and other provisions in paragraphs 7, 12, 13, and 15 through 25
shall survive any termination of this Agreement or the employment of Executive
with Company, in each case, according to their intended terms and temporal
limitations, if any.
