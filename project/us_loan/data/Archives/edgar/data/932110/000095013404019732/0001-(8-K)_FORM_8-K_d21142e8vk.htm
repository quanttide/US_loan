<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General</I></B>. On December&nbsp;17, 2004, Steven E. Markhoff and Toby J. Skaar each
entered into separate and distinct employment agreements with Kitty Hawk, Inc.
(the &#147;Company&#148;). In addition, on December&nbsp;21, 2004, Jessica L. Wilson entered
into an employment agreement the Company. Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar and Ms.
Wilson are each individually referred to herein as an &#147;Executive&#148; and
collectively referred to herein as the &#147;Executives.&#148; The employment agreements
entered into by Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar and Ms.&nbsp;Wilson are collectively
referred to herein as the &#147;Agreements.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Agreements, the Company employs Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff as the
Company&#146;s Vice President Strategic Planning and General Counsel, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar as
the Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Kitty Hawk Cargo, Inc., and
Ms.&nbsp;Wilson as the Company&#146;s Chief Accounting Officer. The Agreements replace
and supercede any existing contractual employment arrangements between the
Company and each of the Executives. Each Agreement has a two-year term
commencing on December&nbsp;14, 2004, with automatic renewals for successive
one-year terms, subject to earlier termination by either party for any reason.
Copies of the Agreements are attached to this report as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and
10.3 and the following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the attached Agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Compensation and Benefits</I></B>. Under the Agreements, Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff is entitled
to an annual base salary of $199,999, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar is entitled to an annual base
salary of $180,000, and Ms.&nbsp;Wilson is entitled to an annual base salary of
$107,500. Thereafter, each Executive&#146;s annual base salary will be reviewed at
least annually and may be increased in the sole discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. The Company may not decrease
the salary of an Executive during the term of such Executive&#146;s employment
agreement. In addition, each Executive is eligible to receive an annual cash
performance bonus based on the achievement of annual performance goals to be
determined annually by the Compensation Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors. The Executives are also eligible to participate in any incentive
compensation plans applicable to senior executive officers that are adopted by
the Company&#146;s Board of Directors and any benefit programs adopted by the
Company for the benefit of its executive officers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Effect of Termination</I></B>. Under the Agreements, if an Executive&#146;s employment
is terminated by the Company other than for &#147;Cause&#148; (as defined in the
Agreements) or by the Company not renewing the employment agreement or by the
Executive for &#147;Good Reason&#148; (as defined in the Agreements), the terminated
Executive is generally entitled to receive:

outstanding incentive stock option agreement that would have vested during the
twelve months following the Executive&#146;s separation date if the Executive had
remained employed by the Company would immediately vest and become exercisable
and any future equity based awards granted to the Executive would become
immediately fully vested and exercisable. In addition, the Company would also
continue to provide life and disability insurance, medical, vision and dental
coverage and other health and welfare benefits (the &#147;Insurance Benefits&#148;) to
(i)&nbsp;Messrs.&nbsp;Markhoff and Skaar for up to nine months following separation and
(ii)&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;Wilson for up to six months following separation. Further, if after
nine months following Executive&#146;s termination other than for Cause or by the
Executive for Good Reason, the Executive (other than Ms.&nbsp;Wilson) demonstrates
that the Executive has used best efforts to obtain alternative employment, but
has not secured alternative employment, the Executive may be paid up to three
additional months of the Executive&#146;s annual base salary in effect on the date
of termination and may receive up to three additional months of Insurance
Benefits, so long as the Executive remains unemployed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company is terminated by reason of
death or disability, by the Executive without Good Reason, by the Executive not
renewing the term of the employment agreement or by the Company for Cause, the
Executive is generally entitled to receive the Executive&#146;s previously earned
and unpaid salary, previously earned and unpaid bonus for the year prior to
termination (except if the Executive terminates the employment agreement
without Good Reason or by not renewing the employment agreement and such
termination is prior to the finalization of the Company&#146;s prior year audited
financial statements or if the Company terminates the employment agreement for
Cause), accrued vacation, unreimbursed business expenses and other accrued
benefits. In addition, if the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company is
terminated by reason of death or disability, the Executive will receive the
Pro-Rated Bonus.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Effect of a Change of Control</I></B>. In the event of a &#147;Change of Control&#148; (as
defined in the Agreements), the term of the Agreements automatically renews for
an additional one year period (the &#147;Change of Control Period&#148;) and then
automatically renews for successive one-year periods, subject to earlier
termination. If during the Change of Control Period, the Executive terminates
the Executive&#146;s employment for Good Reason or the Company terminates the
Executive&#146;s employment without Cause, the Executive is generally entitled to
