<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>General</I></B>. On December&nbsp;17, 2004, Steven E. Markhoff and Toby J. Skaar each
entered into separate and distinct employment agreements with Kitty Hawk, Inc.
(the &#147;Company&#148;). In addition, on December&nbsp;21, 2004, Jessica L. Wilson entered
into an employment agreement the Company. Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar and Ms.
Wilson are each individually referred to herein as an &#147;Executive&#148; and
collectively referred to herein as the &#147;Executives.&#148; The employment agreements
entered into by Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar and Ms.&nbsp;Wilson are collectively
referred to herein as the &#147;Agreements.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Agreements, the Company employs Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff as the
Company&#146;s Vice President Strategic Planning and General Counsel, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar as
the Vice President and Chief Operating Officer of Kitty Hawk Cargo, Inc., and
Ms.&nbsp;Wilson as the Company&#146;s Chief Accounting Officer. The Agreements replace
and supercede any existing contractual employment arrangements between the
Company and each of the Executives. Each Agreement has a two-year term
commencing on December&nbsp;14, 2004, with automatic renewals for successive
one-year terms, subject to earlier termination by either party for any reason.
Copies of the Agreements are attached to this report as Exhibits 10.1, 10.2 and
10.3 and the following description is qualified in its entirety by reference to
the attached Agreements.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Compensation and Benefits</I></B>. Under the Agreements, Mr.&nbsp;Markhoff is entitled
to an annual base salary of $199,999, Mr.&nbsp;Skaar is entitled to an annual base
salary of $180,000, and Ms.&nbsp;Wilson is entitled to an annual base salary of
$107,500. Thereafter, each Executive&#146;s annual base salary will be reviewed at
least annually and may be increased in the sole discretion of the Compensation
Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of Directors. The Company may not decrease
the salary of an Executive during the term of such Executive&#146;s employment
agreement. In addition, each Executive is eligible to receive an annual cash
performance bonus based on the achievement of annual performance goals to be
determined annually by the Compensation Committee of the Company&#146;s Board of
Directors. The Executives are also eligible to participate in any incentive
compensation plans applicable to senior executive officers that are adopted by
the Company&#146;s Board of Directors and any benefit programs adopted by the
Company for the benefit of its executive officers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Effect of Termination</I></B>. Under the Agreements, if an Executive&#146;s employment
is terminated by the Company other than for &#147;Cause&#148; (as defined in the
Agreements) or by the Company not renewing the employment agreement or by the
Executive for &#147;Good Reason&#148; (as defined in the Agreements), the terminated
Executive is generally entitled to receive:

outstanding incentive stock option agreement that would have vested during the
twelve months following the Executive&#146;s separation date if the Executive had
remained employed by the Company would immediately vest and become exercisable
and any future equity based awards granted to the Executive would become
immediately fully vested and exercisable. In addition, the Company would also
continue to provide life and disability insurance, medical, vision and dental
coverage and other health and welfare benefits (the &#147;Insurance Benefits&#148;) to
(i)&nbsp;Messrs.&nbsp;Markhoff and Skaar for up to nine months following separation and
(ii)&nbsp;Ms.&nbsp;Wilson for up to six months following separation. Further, if after
nine months following Executive&#146;s termination other than for Cause or by the
Executive for Good Reason, the Executive (other than Ms.&nbsp;Wilson) demonstrates
that the Executive has used best efforts to obtain alternative employment, but
has not secured alternative employment, the Executive may be paid up to three
additional months of the Executive&#146;s annual base salary in effect on the date
of termination and may receive up to three additional months of Insurance
Benefits, so long as the Executive remains unemployed.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company is terminated by reason of
death or disability, by the Executive without Good Reason, by the Executive not
renewing the term of the employment agreement or by the Company for Cause, the
Executive is generally entitled to receive the Executive&#146;s previously earned

termination (except if the Executive terminates the employment agreement
without Good Reason or by not renewing the employment agreement and such
termination is prior to the finalization of the Company&#146;s prior year audited
financial statements or if the Company terminates the employment agreement for
Cause), accrued vacation, unreimbursed business expenses and other accrued
benefits. In addition, if the Executive&#146;s employment with the Company is
terminated by reason of death or disability, the Executive will receive the
Pro-Rated Bonus.

defined in the Agreements), the term of the Agreements automatically renews for
an additional one year period (the &#147;Change of Control Period&#148;) and then
automatically renews for successive one-year periods, subject to earlier
termination. If during the Change of Control Period, the Executive terminates
the Executive&#146;s employment for Good Reason or the Company terminates the
Executive&#146;s employment without Cause, the Executive is generally entitled to

conditions and subject to the rights of termination hereinafter set forth, and
the Executive is willing to accept such employment on such terms and
conditions.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual agreements hereinafter set
forth, the Executive and the Company have agreed and do hereby agree as
follows:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;EMPLOYMENT AS Vice President and Chief Operating Officer (COO)&nbsp;for

Notwithstanding the above, Executive shall be permitted, to the extent that

being expressly understood and agreed Executive may continue serving on any

the second anniversary of the Commencement Date and on each annual anniversary
thereafter, the Term and Executive&#146;s employment hereunder shall automatically
be extended for successive one (1)&nbsp;year periods unless either party gives
written notice not to extend the term of this Agreement ninety (90)&nbsp;days in
advance of the expiration of the Term or any extension thereof.

Information. Executive acknowledges that such information is a valuable and
unique asset of the Company and agrees that he shall not, during or after the

Executive&#146;s beneficiaries or estate shall also be paid on the Payment Date, a
pro-rated Bonus, if any, for the year equal to the product of (A)&nbsp;and (B)&nbsp;where
(A)&nbsp;is the amount payable to Executive as a Bonus for such year had he been
employed through the last day of the year, and (B)&nbsp;is a fraction, the numerator
of which is the number of days the Executive was employed by the Company during
such year and the denominator is 365 (&#147;Pro-Rated Bonus&#148;).

ninety (90)&nbsp;days in any twelve (12)&nbsp;month period (&#147;Disability&#148;), Executive&#146;s
employment may be terminated by the Company for Disability. During any period
prior to such termination during which Executive is absent from the full-time
performance of his duties with the Company due to Disability, the Company shall

provided, that, such payments made to the Executive shall be reduced by amounts
received from disability insurance obtained or provided by the Company.

Accrued Benefits excluding benefits described in Section&nbsp;8(a)(ii) at the times
set forth in 8(a) above.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e)&nbsp;TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE. The Company shall have the
right to terminate this Agreement prior to the expiration of the Term, at any

of the following events:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) The Company&#146;s material breach of any of the provisions of this

indemnification set forth in this Agreement and the Company&#146;s by-laws.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Executive agrees to provide the Company thirty (30)&nbsp;days&#146; prior written
notice of any termination for Good Reason, during which 30-day period the
Company shall have the right to cure, if curable, the circumstances giving rise

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(g)&nbsp;Following a termination governed by this Section&nbsp;8, except as
specifically provided in this Agreement, the Executive shall not be entitled to
any other compensation or benefits, except as may be separately negotiated by
the parties and approved by the Board of Directors of the Company in writing.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.&nbsp;TERMINATION PROCEDURE. Any termination of Executive&#146;s employment by
the Company or by Executive during the Term (other than termination pursuant to
Section&nbsp;8(a)) shall be communicated by written Notice of Termination to the
other party hereto in accordance with Section&nbsp;15. For purposes of this
Agreement, a &#147;Notice of Termination&#148; shall mean a notice which shall indicate
the specific termination provision in this Agreement relied upon.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10.&nbsp;COMPENSATION UPON TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE OR
BY THE EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON. If the Executive&#146;s employment shall be
terminated (i)&nbsp;by act of the Company other than for Cause, or (ii)&nbsp;by the
Executive for Good Reason, the Executive shall be entitled to the following
benefits:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;the Accrued Benefits which shall be paid at the times set forth in
Section 8(a) above and the Pro-Rated Bonus.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;Executive shall be paid a severance amount in 18 equal semi-monthly
installments, which in the aggregate equals seventy-five percent (75%) of
Executive&#146;s annual rate of Base Salary in effect on the date of termination
(not taking into account any reductions in Base Salary not agreed to by
Executive in writing) (the &#147;Severance Payment&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;Notwithstanding the terms and conditions of the 2003 Equity Incentive
Plan or any agreements entered into thereunder and any other plan or program
which may be in effect from time to time (and for the purpose of this Agreement
any such plans and agreements will be deemed to be amended to reflect the
foregoing), with respect to Executive&#146;s initial Incentive Stock Option
Agreement, under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan, Executive&#146;s service with the
Company will be deemed to continue for 12&nbsp;months following his separation date
for purposes of vesting such that the portion of the option that would have

his best efforts to obtain alternative employment but has not secured
alternative employment, the time period for payments and benefits set forth in
paragraphs 10(b) and (d)&nbsp;may be extended, so long as Executive remains
unemployed, for a period not to exceed three (3)&nbsp;months. Any payments made
during the period of continued unemployment, shall be paid in equal
semi-monthly installments and each installment shall equal 1/24th of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;RIGHT TO COMPANY MATERIALS. Executive agrees that all styles, designs,
lists, materials, books, files, reports, correspondence, records,
electronically stored data or software and other documents and all Confidential
Information (&#147;Company Materials&#148;) used, prepared, or made available to
Executive, shall be and shall remain the property of the Company. Upon the
termination of employment or the expiration of this Agreement, all Company
Materials and all other property of the Company shall be returned immediately
to the Company, and Executive shall not make or retain any copies of Company
Materials or its property following his termination of employment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;ANTI-SOLICITATION. Executive promises and agrees that during the Term
and for the twelve (12)&nbsp;month period commencing on the termination of his
employment (the &#147;Restricted Period&#148;), he will not influence or attempt to
influence customers or suppliers of the Company or any of its present or future
subsidiaries or affiliates, either directly or indirectly, to divert their
business to any individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other entity then
in competition with the business of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate
of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;NON-COMPETITION. Executive promises and agrees that during the
Restricted Period, he will not within the United States, without the prior
written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, become interested in
any capacity (whether as proprietor, director, partner, employee, agent,
independent contractor, consultant, trustee or in any other capacity) or be
paid by or otherwise receive compensation or consideration from any bulk air
cargo or bulk air freight business that is competitive with the specific
products or services sold or maintained by the Company. This shall not prevent
Executive from owning securities in any such competitive business (but without
otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if (i)&nbsp;such
securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have
been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
(ii)&nbsp;the Executive does not beneficially own (as defined by Rule&nbsp;13d-3
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) in excess of 5% of the
outstanding capital stock of such enterprise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;SOLICITING EMPLOYEES. During the Restricted Period commencing on the
termination of his employment, Executive promises and agrees that he will not
directly or indirectly solicit or engage any of the Company&#146;s employees or
former employees who worked for the Company at any time during the six (6)
months preceding the termination of Executive&#146;s employment, to work for any
business, individual, partnership, firm, corporation, or other entity then in
competition with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;NON-DISPARAGEMENT. The Executive agrees that subsequent to
Executive&#146;s employment hereunder, the Executive will refrain from initiating or
engaging in any communication with any then current or former employee,
officer, director, shareholder, customer, vendor or competitor of the Company
or any third party other than Executive&#146;s spouse or legal counsel, which could
reasonably be interpreted as derogatory or disparaging to the reputation of the
Company and its business practices, employees, officers, directors and agents.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;14.&nbsp;CHANGE IN CONTROL.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;For purposes of this Agreement, &#147;Change in Control&#148; shall mean: (i)

Company; or (iii)&nbsp;any &#147;person&#148; (as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;3(a)(9) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and as used in
Sections&nbsp;13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes, after the
Commencement Date a &#147;beneficial owner&#148; (as defined in Rule&nbsp;13d3 under the
Exchange Act), directly or indirectly, of securities of the Company
representing 40% or more (a &#147;40% Shareholder&#148;) of the combined voting power of
the Company&#146;s then outstanding securities eligible to vote for the election of
the Board (the &#147;Company Voting Securities&#148;); provided, however, that an event
described in this paragraph (iii)&nbsp;shall not be deemed to be a Change in Control

automatically renew for twelve additional months (the &#147;Change in Control
Period&#148;). Following the Change in Control Period, the Agreement shall renew in

notice not to extend pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.

Change in Control Period; (ii)&nbsp;if Executive&#146;s employment is terminated without
Cause during the Change in Control Period or (iii)&nbsp;if (A)&nbsp;Executive&#146;s
employment is terminated by the Company without Cause 90&nbsp;days prior to a
definitive purchase agreement that results in a Change in Control and (B)
Executive reasonably demonstrates that such termination was at the request of a
third party who had taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in
Control and (C)&nbsp;a Change in Control involving such third party (or a party
competing with such third party to effectuate a Change in Control) does occur,
then Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Accrued Benefits and the Pro-Rated Bonus at the items set
forth in 8(a) above.

Directors of the Company in writing.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a)&nbsp;RIGHT TO COMPANY MATERIALS. Executive agrees that all styles, designs,
lists, materials, books, files, reports, correspondence, records,
electronically stored data or software and other documents and all Confidential
Information (&#147;Company Materials&#148;) used, prepared, or made available to
Executive, shall be and shall remain the property of the Company. Upon the
termination of employment or the expiration of this Agreement, all Company
Materials and all other property of the Company shall be returned immediately
to the Company, and Executive shall not make or retain any copies of Company
Materials or its property following his termination of employment.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b)&nbsp;ANTI-SOLICITATION. Executive promises and agrees that during the Term
and for the twelve (12)&nbsp;month period commencing on the termination of his
employment (the &#147;Restricted Period&#148;), he will not influence or attempt to
influence customers or suppliers of the Company or any of its present or future
subsidiaries or affiliates, either directly or indirectly, to divert their
business to any individual, partnership, firm, corporation or other entity then
in competition with the business of the Company, or any subsidiary or affiliate
of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c)&nbsp;NON-COMPETITION. Executive promises and agrees that during the
Restricted Period, he will not within the United States, without the prior
written consent of the Company, directly or indirectly, become interested in
any capacity (whether as proprietor, director, partner, employee, agent,
independent contractor, consultant, trustee or in any other capacity) or be
paid by or otherwise receive compensation or consideration from any bulk air
cargo or bulk air freight business that is competitive with the specific
products or services sold or maintained by the Company. This shall not prevent
Executive from owning securities in any such competitive business (but without
otherwise participating in the activities of such enterprise) if (i)&nbsp;such
securities are listed on any national or regional securities exchange or have
been registered under Section 12(g) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and
(ii)&nbsp;the Executive does not beneficially own (as defined by Rule&nbsp;13d-3
promulgated under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934) in excess of 5% of the
outstanding capital stock of such enterprise.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d)&nbsp;SOLICITING EMPLOYEES. During the Restricted Period commencing on the
termination of his employment, Executive promises and agrees that he will not
directly or indirectly solicit or engage any of the Company&#146;s employees or
former employees who worked for the Company at any time during the six (6)
months preceding the termination of Executive&#146;s employment, to work for any
business, individual, partnership, firm, corporation, or other entity then in
competition with the Company or any subsidiary or affiliate of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.&nbsp;NON-DISPARAGEMENT. The Executive agrees that subsequent to
Executive&#146;s employment hereunder, the Executive will refrain from initiating or
engaging in any communication with any then current or former employee,
officer, director, shareholder, customer, vendor or competitor of the Company
or any third party other than Executive&#146;s spouse or legal counsel, which could
reasonably be interpreted as derogatory or disparaging to the reputation of the
Company and its business practices, employees, officers, directors and agents.

Company; or (iii)&nbsp;any &#147;person&#148; (as such term is defined in Section&nbsp;3(a)(9) of
the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;) and as used in
Sections&nbsp;13(d)(3) and 14(d)(2) of the Exchange Act) is or becomes, after the

notice not to extend pursuant to Section&nbsp;2.

Cause during the Change in Control Period or (iii)&nbsp;if (A)&nbsp;Executive&#146;s
employment is terminated by the Company without Cause 90&nbsp;days prior to a
definitive purchase agreement that results in a Change in Control and (B)
Executive reasonably demonstrates that such termination was at the request of a
third party who had taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in
Control and (C)&nbsp;a Change in Control involving such third party (or a party
competing with such third party to effectuate a Change in Control) does occur,
then Executive shall be entitled to the following benefits:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) the Accrued Benefits and the Pro-Rated Bonus at the items set
forth in 8(a) above.

thereafter, the Term and Executive&#146;s employment hereunder shall automatically

third party who had taken steps reasonably calculated to effect a Change in
Control and (C)&nbsp;a Change in Control involving such third party (or a party
competing with such third party to effectuate a Change in Control) does occur,

or entity, this Agreement shall, subject to the express provisions hereof, be
binding upon and inure to the benefit of Executive and such successor and such

binding arbitration in Dallas, Texas in accordance with the rules and
procedures of the Employment Dispute Resolution Rules of the American

any of the terms, covenants, or conditions hereof shall not be deemed a waiver
of such term, covenant, or condition, nor shall any waiver or relinquishment
of, or failure to insist upon strict compliance with, any right or power
hereunder at any one or more times be deemed a waiver or relinquishment of such
right or power at any other time or times. This Agreement shall not be modified
in any respect except by a writing executed by each party hereto.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22.&nbsp;SEVERABILITY. In the event that a court of competent jurisdiction
