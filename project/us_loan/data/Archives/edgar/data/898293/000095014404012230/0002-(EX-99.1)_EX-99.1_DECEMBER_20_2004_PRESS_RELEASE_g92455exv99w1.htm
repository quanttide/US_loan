<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Business Outlook</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&#147;We are pleased to have started our fiscal 2005 with another record quarter. We increased net
revenues 21&nbsp;percent, grew core earnings 26&nbsp;percent and improved diluted core earnings per share 28
percent over the first quarter of fiscal 2004,&#148; said Timothy L. Main, President and Chief Executive
Officer. &#147;While the end markets and the economy are just beginning to show signs of improvement,
Jabil clearly has the strong trend for electronics companies to outsource in its favor.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Jabil provided guidance for its second quarter of fiscal 2005 indicating that it currently foresees
net revenue in a range of $1.65 to $1.75&nbsp;billion and core earnings per share in a range of $0.26 to
$0.28 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per share are
currently estimated to be $0.22 to $0.24 per diluted share. <I>(Expected GAAP earnings per share
for the second quarter of fiscal year 2005 are currently estimated to include $0.04 per share for
amortization of intangibles.)</I>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Jabil management maintained its previous full fiscal 2005 guidance, indicating expectations of
net revenue to range from $7.2 to $7.4&nbsp;billion and core earnings per share to be in a range of
$1.20 to $1.24 per diluted share, depending upon actual levels of production. GAAP earnings per
share are currently estimated to be $1.05 to $1.09 per diluted share. <I>(Expected GAAP earnings
per share for the quarter are currently estimated to include $0.15 per share for amortization of
intangibles.)</I>



<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"># #


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Supplemental Information</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The financial results disclosed in this release include certain measures calculated and presented
in accordance with GAAP. In addition to the GAAP financial measures, Jabil provides supplemental,
non-GAAP financial measures to facilitate evaluation of Jabil&#146;s core operating performance. The
non-GAAP financial measures disclosed in this release exclude certain amounts that are included in
the most directly comparable GAAP measures. The non-GAAP, or core financial measures disclosed in
this release do not have standard meanings and may vary from the non-GAAP financial measures used
by other companies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Due to its acquisitions, Jabil has incurred incremental charges that are included in the GAAP
financial measures disclosed in this release. Management believes that the nature of these amounts
does not impact the performance of its core manufacturing operations. Management believes core
financial measures (which exclude the effects of the amortization of intangibles,
acquisition-related charges, restructuring and impairment charges and other income) are a useful
measure that facilitates evaluating the past and future performance of Jabil&#146;s ongoing operations
on a comparable basis. Jabil reports core earnings, core earnings per share and core operating
income to provide its investors with an alternative method for assessing its earnings and operating
income from what it believes to be its core manufacturing operations. Included in this release is
a Consolidated Statement of Earnings as well as a reconciliation of the disclosed core financial
measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Company Conference Call Information</B>

<P align="left" style="font-size: 8pt">(1)&nbsp;The computation of earnings per diluted share and core earnings per diluted share for the
three months ended November&nbsp;30, 2003 includes the elimination of $0.9&nbsp;million in interest expense,
net of tax, on the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes, which would have been
extinguished had the conversion occurred, as the effect of the conversion would have been dilutive.
The notes were redeemed for cash in the third quarter of fiscal year 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 8pt">(2)&nbsp;Diluted common shares for the three months ended November&nbsp;30, 2003 include 8,406,960 shares of
common stock issuable upon the conversion of the then outstanding convertible subordinated notes as
the effect of the conversion would have been dilutive. The notes were redeemed for cash in the
third quarter of fiscal year 2004.
