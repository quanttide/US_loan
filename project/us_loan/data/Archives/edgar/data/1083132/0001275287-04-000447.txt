ITEM 8.01  OTHER EVENTS

        On December 21, 2004, Immunicon Corporation ("Immunicon") issued a press
release announcing a second extension of its Research and Development Agreement
with Pfizer Inc. under which the Company is collaborating with Pfizer to develop
new reagents designed to detect certain undisclosed antigens on circulating
tumor cells (CTCs). The agreement, originally entered into in February 2003, and
amended in April 2004, has now been amended to extend the term to February 2006.
Immunicon believes this project may help Pfizer to determine the efficacy of
certain of their therapeutic products significantly earlier than is possible
with other methods. Under the extended agreement, Immunicon will receive
payments in support of its work with Pfizer. Pfizer has the right to terminate
with or without reason upon written notice to Immunicon, in which case Pfizer's
only obligation will be to pay for services performed up to the termination date
plus payment for any non-cancelable obligations.

        A copy of Immunicon's press release is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1
and is incorporated herein by reference.

expressly set forth by specific reference in such a filing.
