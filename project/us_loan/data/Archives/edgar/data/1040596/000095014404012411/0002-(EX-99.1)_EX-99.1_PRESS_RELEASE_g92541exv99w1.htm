<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>ALPHARETTA, Georgia, USA / CAMBRIDGE, England, UK &#150; December&nbsp;22, 2004 &#150; </B>ChoicePoint (NYSE:
CPS) today announced a definitive agreement to purchase privately held i2, a Cambridge-based global
provider of visual investigative and link analysis software for intelligence, law enforcement,
military and large commercial applications.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The transaction includes an initial payment of $90.25&nbsp;million (US), with an earn-out of up to an
additional $10&nbsp;million (US)&nbsp;if certain financial performance goals are met. The acquisition is
scheduled to close on or before January&nbsp;1, 2005, subject to customary closing conditions. For the
full year 2005, ChoicePoint expects the acquisition to be approximately $.02 accretive to earnings.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">&#147;The addition of i2 is a milestone in our company&#146;s growth that represents the latest step in two
of our strategic initiatives,&#148; noted ChoicePoint Chairman and CEO Derek V. Smith. &#147;We have been
steadily moving to enhance our analytics and distribution offerings, most recently with the
acquisition of iMap and Templar in 2004. Now, i2 will allow us to leverage the value of our data,
but, importantly, our customers will be able to gain additional insight from their own proprietary
information.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">&#147;Joining with i2 also marks our strategic expansion into international markets by offering products
unrelated to the collection of data by ChoicePoint,&#148; continued Smith. &#147;This allows us to fulfill
our company vision of helping to create a safer, more secure world through the

creating the world&#146;s leading software that helps our customers make sense of masses of data and
very complex scenarios,&#148; said Mike Hunter, co-founder and CEO of i2. &#147;We&#146;re excited about the
opportunities that being part of a growing, industry leading company like ChoicePoint will present.&#148;

More than 30&nbsp;percent of the Fortune Global 100 commercial organizations are also i2 customers.
