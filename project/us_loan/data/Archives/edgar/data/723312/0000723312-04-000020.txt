ITEM 8.01 - OTHER EVENTS

On December 22, 2004, the Registrant  posted the following  announcement  on its
website (www.sonexresearch.com):



                     SONEX HOLDS ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING


ANNAPOLIS,  MARYLAND, December 22, 2004 - SONEX RESEARCH, INC. (OTC BB: SONX), a
leader in the field of clean burn combustion technology, announced that its 2004
Annual Meeting of Shareholders was held on Monday,  December 20, in Annapolis to
re-elect directors and to report on the latest developments at the Company.

Dr. Andrew A. Pouring,  Chairman,  CEO, President,  and Chief Technical Officer,
informed  shareholders of recent successes achieved in laboratory testing of the
Sonex  combustion  technologies.  In particular,  Dr. Pouring noted that results
under a project for the Defense Advanced  Research  Projects Agency (DARPA) have
exceeded his expectations following previous single cylinder feasibility studies
in terms of engine stability,  control, and fuel consumption substantially lower
than the gasoline  baseline  engine.  Under an agreement  for  prototyping  with
DARPA,  Sonex is developing a "heavy fuel" engine (HFE)  combustion  process for
potential  Department  of Defense  (DoD)  applications  such as unmanned  aerial
vehicles (UAVs). This project is sponsored by DARPA as a technology  feasibility
demonstration  of a means for  lightweight  piston  engines to comply with a DoD
policy  directive  that  mandates  kerosene-based  heavy fuel for all engines to
address performance,  logistics and safety requirements. Part of DARPA's mission
is to sponsor  revolutionary,  high-payoff research that bridges the gap between
fundamental discoveries and their military use.

Under the DARPA agreement, Sonex has adapted a lightweight, six cylinder, 200 hp
gasoline  automotive  engine to a Sonex  Combustion  System  (SCS)  unthrottled,
direct  fuel  injection   combustion  process  based  on  the  Sonex  Controlled
Auto-Ignition  (SCAI)  technology to run on JP5, military  kerosene-based  heavy
fuel.  The SCAI  process is  enabled by a  proprietary  piston  technology  that
achieves  in-cylinder chemical kinetics at a moderate compression ratio for auto
ignition of the JP5. The laboratory HFE features the proprietary  Sonex pistons,
electronically  controlled  common  rail fuel  injection  system  and  extensive
instrumentation.

In July 2004 Sonex was awarded an additional  task to enhance the 6-cylinder HFE
to expand the performance  range of the SCAI heavy fuel  combustion  process and
achieve higher power output.  Michael I. Keller,  a consultant who serves as the
Company's  Director of  Business  Development  and  technical  program  manager,
reported that in  anticipation of a 400 hp HFE requirement for a large UAV being
developed by DARPA, Sonex has initiated discussions with high performance engine
component  suppliers.  Achievement  by Sonex in the near  future of a  technical
readiness  demonstration is expected to form the basis for in-depth  discussions
with DARPA and its UAV prime  contractor  for proposals  for follow-on  work. In
addition,  outcomes  from the DARPA program  could  validate the sparkless  SCAI
process for in-cylinder control of ignition and combustion that could be applied
later to a direct  injection  gasoline powered version for use in automobiles to
achieve better fuel economy.

Dr. Pouring also commented on other SCS technology  developments,  including the
Low Soot Diesel  Design  (LSDD)  pistons  for soot and oxides of nitrogen  (NOx)
reductions  in standard  direct  injection  diesel  engines at high  compression
ratios,  and  lightweight,  spark-ignited,  two-stroke,  HFEs  for  use  in  DoD
applications such as small UAVs.

Mr.  Keller also reported on proposed  language in a national  energy bill to be
addressed  by Congress  in 2005 which  potentially  could  provide an impetus to
Sonex efforts to interest the automotive  industry in the SCAI  application  for
improved fuel mileage in conventional gasoline and newer hybrid vehicles.

George  E.  Ponticas,   CFO  and  Secretary  of  Sonex,  reviewed  a  number  of
organizational  changes  during 2004.  Following  the  resignation  of the three
outside members of its Board of Directors at the beginning of the year, Roger D.
Posey was named president in February, and was named CEO in July, with a plan to
develop,  raise capital for, and implement an updated business plan, the primary
goal of which was to transition  Sonex from a research and  development  company
into a technology  and  manufacturing  enterprise.  Mr.  Ponticas  acknowledged,
however,  that the desired objectives were not achieved,  as the Company did not
raise the capital to complete and implement the updated  business plan, and that
Mr. Posey left the Company in October.

Mr. Ponticas,  noting that the Company's Board of Directors now consists only of
Dr. Pouring and himself,  stated management's  intention to add to the Board one
or more qualified  individuals who have no current  affiliation with the Company
towards a goal of constituting a Board with a majority of independent directors.

Dr.  Pouring also stressed that the Company needs to secure  capital to meet the
challenges still facing the Company, such as demonstrating that its LSDD pistons
can be produced in high volume using existing  piston  manufacturing  processes,
and to permit Sonex to complete  product  development and participate in teaming
arrangements with defense firms for the marketing of SCS HFEs.

As to the  business  portion of the  Annual  Meeting,  holders of the  Company's
Preferred Stock re-elected Mr. Ponticas, a current member of the Board, to serve
as a Class I Preferred Stock director for a term ending at the Annual Meeting in
2005 or until  his  successor  has been  elected  and  qualified.  The  Board of
Directors  had  nominated  Dr.  Pouring  to serve as a Class  III  Common  Stock
director for a term ending at the Annual Meeting in 2007;  however,  the Company
did not receive a sufficient number of votes to achieve a quorum for the conduct
of  business  for its Common  Stock.  Dr.  Pouring  will  continue to serve as a
director but will need to be  re-nominated by the Board for election at the next
shareholder  meeting at which  directors  are  elected.  Of the votes  received,
approximately  97% were voted in favor of the  re-election  of Dr.  Pouring as a
Class III Common Stock director.


About Sonex

Sonex  Research,  Inc.,  a leader  in the  field of  combustion  technology,  is
developing its patented Sonex Combustion  System (SCS)  piston-based  technology
for in-cylinder  control of ignition and  combustion,  designed to increase fuel
mileage and reduce  emissions  of internal  combustion  engines.  Sonex plans to
complete  development,  commercialize  and  market  its  Sonex  Controlled  Auto
Ignition (SCAI)  combustion  process to the automotive  industry to improve fuel
efficiency of gasoline powered vehicles.  Additionally,  independent third-party
testing has confirmed the potential of the SCS application  for  direct-injected
diesel  engines  to  significantly   reduce  harmful  soot  in-cylinder  without
increasing  fuel  consumption.  Other  SCS  designs  are being  used to  convert
gasoline engines of various sizes to operate on safer, diesel-type "heavy fuels"
for use in military and commercial  applications requiring light weight and safe
handling and storage of fuel, such as in UAVs (unmanned aerial vehicles).
