Item 8.01.        Other Events

In its Current Report on Form 8-K dated December 17, 2004, Generex Biotechnology
Corporation reported that it had entered into an agreement (the "Termination
Agreement") on December 17, 2004 with Elan Corporation, plc and Elan
International Services, Ltd. ("EIS" and together with Elan Corporation, plc,
"Elan"), whereby Generex and Elan agreed to terminate their joint venture
through Generex (Bermuda) Ltd. The joint venture was initially established to
pursue the application of certain of Generex's and Elan's drug delivery
technologies. As previously reported, an affiliate of Elan, EPIL III, sought to
transfer its ownership of Generex Series A Preferred Stock. Generex consented to
the transfer upon certain conditions, including the condition that the buyer
immediately convert the preferred stock at the voluntary conversion price of
$25.77 (calculated pursuant to the terms of the certificate of designation for
the preferred stock). The prospective buyer agreed with this condition.

On December 22, 2004, EPIL III's sale of the Series A Preferred Stock was
consummated, and all of Generex's outstanding Series A Preferred Stock was
automatically converted to common stock. As a result, the buyer received 534,085
shares of common stock and Generex no longer has any outstanding shares of
Series A Preferred Stock.

Beginning with the filing of Generex's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal
year ended July 31, 2002, the Series A Preferred Stock had been classified as
mezzanine equity on Generex's balance sheet, and did not qualify as
stockholders' equity for NASDAQ compliance and other purposes. As previously
reported, on November 19, 2004, Generex received notice from The Nasdaq Stock
Market informing Generex that it did not comply with Market Place Rule
4310(c)(2)(B), which requires Generex to have a minimum of $2,500,000 in
stockholders' equity or $35,000,000 market value of listed securities or
$500,000 of net income from continuing operations for the most recently
completed fiscal year or two of the three most recently completed fiscal years.
Generex subsequently provided NASDAQ staff with a plan of compliance primarily
based upon the potential for meeting the minimum stockholders' equity
requirement after conversion of the preferred stock.

The conversion has now occurred, with the result that the approximately
$14,300,000 previously classified as mezzanine equity is eliminated and an equal
amount has been added to Additional paid-in capital attributable to the common
stock, increasing stockholders' equity by that amount. At October 31, 2004, as
reported in its Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q, Generex had a deficit
stockholders equity in the amount of ($4,787,253). Included in Item 9 of this
Current Report is a pro forma balance sheet at October 31, 2004 showing that on
a pro forma basis at October 31, 2004, adjusting for the subsequent conversion
of the Series A Preferred Stock, the Company would have stockholders equity of
approximately $9,522,000, significantly in excess of he NASDAQ minimum
requirement.

Generex has submitted information regarding the conversion to NASDAQ Staff, and
Staff stated it believed Generex had submitted a definitive plan of compliance.
Generex continues to satisfy the minimum stockholder equity requirement of
Market Place Rule 4310(c)(2)(B) as of the date of this Report. Based on the
foregoing, Generex understands that it is not currently the subject of any
additional delisting proceedings based on non-compliance with this Rule, but
that NASDAQ will continue to monitor Generex's compliance with the stockholders
equity requirement and, if at the time of its next periodic report Generex does
not evidence compliance, it may be subject to delisting.

Item 9.01    Financial Statements, Pro Forma Financial Information and Exhibits.

(b)  Pro Forma Financial Information

Filed herewith is the Company's Balance Sheet (unaudited) as of and October 31,
2004, with pro forma adjustments showing the effects of the conversion of the
Series A Preferred Stock into Common Stock.
