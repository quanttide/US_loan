SECTION 2 -- FINANCIAL INFORMATION

ITEM 2.01     COMPLETION OF ACQUISITION OR DISPOSITION OF ASSETS.

         On December 29, 2004, LecTec Corporation, a Minnesota corporation
("LecTec"), completed a disposition of assets to Novartis Consumer Health, Inc.,
a Delaware corporation ("Novartis"). The assets were sold pursuant to an
agreement executed on December 7, 2004 between LecTec and Novartis (the
"Agreement"). The assets sold consisted of hydrogel coating and therapeutic
converting machinery and equipment along with any documentation, spare parts,
and software related to the equipment. Novartis paid LecTec the contract price
of $733,100 during the month of December 2004. The contract price was based on
the appraised value of the assets and on Novartis taking delivery of the
equipment at LecTec's facility which occurred on December 6, 2004, when
Novartis's representatives and employees began dismantling the equipment for
shipment. The equipment was completely removed from LecTec's facility on
December 29, 2004. LecTec is not required to install the equipment at Novartis's
facility. Novartis was LecTec's only remaining contract manufacturing customer.
In July of 2004, LecTec executed a new supply and licensing agreement with
Novartis in conjunction with the wind down of LecTec's manufacturing operations
which ceased on December 17, 2004.

         A copy of the Agreement is filed as an exhibit to this Form 8-K.
