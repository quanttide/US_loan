ITEM 4.01    CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.

The Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of Extended Systems Incorporated
(the "Registrant") selected Grant Thornton LLP as the Registrant's independent
registered public accounting firm for the fiscal year ending June 30, 2005.
Grant Thornton LLP advised the Registrant of its acceptance of this engagement
and the Registrant engaged Grant Thornton LLP effective December 27, 2004.

During the two most recent fiscal years and through December 26, 2004 neither
the Registrant nor anyone on its behalf has consulted with Grant Thornton LLP
regarding (i) either the application of accounting principles to a specified
transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type of audit opinion that
might be rendered on the Registrant's financial statements, or (ii) any matter
that was the subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in Item 304
(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of
Regulation S-K, or a reportable event, as that term is defined in Item 304
(a)(1)(v) of Regulation S-K.

On December 29, 2004, Extended Systems Incorporated issued a press release
announcing it had engaged Grant Thornton LLP to serve as the Company's
independent registered public accountant. A copy of the press release is
attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1.
