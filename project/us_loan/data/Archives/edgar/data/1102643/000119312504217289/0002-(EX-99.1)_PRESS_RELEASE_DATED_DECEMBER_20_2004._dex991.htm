 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Insurance Brokerage segment. In conjunction with the plan, the Company expects to take an efficiency initiative charge
estimated at approximately $11 million, before taxes, principally in the fourth quarter of 2004. The charge will cover, in approximately equal parts, employee severance, lease termination costs and service contract terminations. The actual amount of
the fourth quarter charge will depend on the Company&#146;s ability to execute the severance arrangements and other contract terminations by year-end. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company is lowering its 2004 full year adjusted cash earnings per share guidance from a previously communicated $1.02 - $1.07 to a revised $0.96 - $0.98, prior to the
negative effect of the previously mentioned charges. The reduced projection is due to lower new business during December 2004 and the continued softening of the property and casualty market, as well as expenses incurred related to previously
announced insurance industry investigations by various state attorney generals and other insurance regulators. The Company is also lowering its organic revenue growth guidance for the second half of 2004 to the low single digits from its previous 5%
estimate. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Board also approved a plan to sell some operations in the
Company&#146;s Insurance Brokerage and Specialized Benefits Services segments that exhibit significant earnings volatility or that are not considered core to the Company&#146;s long term business strategy. It is expected that the Company will record
a loss on disposal estimated at between $10 million and $13 million, before taxes, in the fourth quarter of 2004 to adjust the carrying value of these operations to their estimated fair value. The exact amount of the charge will depend on the
year-end carrying value of the related assets and liabilities and management&#146;s estimate of fair value. The historical and ongoing results of operations for these entities will be reclassified to discontinued operations and it is expected that
this charge will also be recorded in discontinued operations. The operations to be sold are expected to have revenues of approximately $5 million and a net loss of between $1 million and $2 million in 2004. </FONT></P> <P

Company to purchase its stock up to the limits set forth within its credit facility. The Company has the capacity under the current facility to purchase up to approximately $11 million in December 2004 and an estimated $10 million in 2005.
</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The Company is expecting growth in adjusted cash earnings per share in 2005 of
at least 15% over 2004 cash earnings per share. This estimate is based on the Company&#146;s 2005 budget, which reflects the savings from expense reductions discussed above, the expected closing of the Summit Global Partners acquisition and an
expected modest reduction in contingent commissions in 2005. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The
Company&#146;s previously announced acquisition of Summit Global Partners is expected to close early in the first quarter of 2005. The Company has requested a waiver from its lender group in connection with the transaction and a commitment for
another $80 million in borrowings on its term loan at existing terms. The $80 million will be used principally to repay the seller notes related to the Summit acquisition and to pay down borrowings on the Company&#146;s revolving credit facility.
Additionally, the Company has available approximately $55 million in net proceeds on its equity forward sales contracts, which it expects to draw down over the balance of 2004 and the first quarter of 2005. </FONT></P> <P

growth in our employee benefits and worksite marketing revenue streams, offset by lower than expected new business for December 2004 and continued erosion of property and casualty rates. We have committed to taking decisive actions to exit certain
businesses and, on a selective basis, to eliminate employment costs and other operating costs to provide greater assurance around our 15% earnings growth target for 2005.&#148; </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT

unable to provide a reconciliation of its cash earnings per share projections to net income per share, as the exact amount of the charges discussed in this release can not reasonably be determined until after December 31, 2004. The Company presents
such non-GAAP financial information because such information is of interest to the investment community owing to the fact that it provides additional meaningful methods of evaluating certain aspects of the Company&#146;s operating performance from
period to period on a basis that may not be otherwise apparent on a GAAP basis. This financial information should be viewed in addition to, not in lieu of, the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements. </FONT></P> <P

forward-looking statements within the meaning of that term as found in Section 27A of the Securities Act of 1933 and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934. These statements are not historical facts, but instead represent USI&#146;s
belief regarding future events, many of which, by their nature, are inherently uncertain and outside of USI&#146;s control. It is possible that USI&#146;s actual results and financial condition may differ, possibly materially, from the anticipated
results and financial condition indicated in these forward-looking statements. Further information concerning USI and its business, including factors that potentially could materially affect USI&#146;s financial results, are contained in USI&#146;s
filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Some factors include: USI&#146;s ability to grow revenues organically and expand its margins; successful acquisition consummation and integration; errors and omissions claims; resolution of
regulatory investigations and other legal claims, including those related to compensation arrangements with insurance companies, the actual cost of resolution of contingent liabilities and passage of new legislation subjecting our business to
regulation in jurisdictions where we operate; USI&#146;s ability to attract and retain key sales and management professionals; USI&#146;s level of indebtedness and debt service requirements; downward commercial property and casualty premium
pressures; the competitive environment; and general economic conditions around the country. USI&#146;s ability to grow has been enhanced through acquisitions, which may or may not be available on acceptable terms in the future and which, if
consummated, may or may not be advantageous to USI. All forward-looking statements included in this press release are made only as of the date of this press release, and USI does not undertake any obligation to publicly update or correct any
forward-looking statements to reflect events or circumstances that subsequently occur or of which USI hereafter becomes aware. </FONT></P>
