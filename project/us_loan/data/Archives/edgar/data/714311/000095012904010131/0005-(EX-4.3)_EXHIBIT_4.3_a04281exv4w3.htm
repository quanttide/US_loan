<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>INTERNATIONAL LEASE FINANCE CORPORATION</B>, a California corporation (herein
called the &#147;Company&#148;, which term includes any successor corporation under the
Indenture, as hereinafter defined), for value received, hereby promises to pay
to Cede &#038; Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum set forth above at
Stated Maturity shown above and to pay interest thereon from the Original Issue
Date shown above or from the most recent Interest Payment Date (as defined
below) to which interest has been paid or duly provided for at a fixed rate per
annum semi annually in arrears on April&nbsp;15 and October&nbsp;15 in each year, unless
otherwise set forth above (&#147;Interest Payment Dates&#148;), until the principal
hereof is paid or made available for payment, and on Stated Maturity. Interest
will be payable on each Interest Payment Date and at Stated Maturity or upon
redemption or optional repayment. Interest will be payable to the Holder at
the close of business on the Regular Record Date which shall be April 1 and
October 1 of each year, unless otherwise set forth above, next preceding such
Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable at Stated
Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment will be payable to the person
to whom principal is payable and (to the extent that the payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable) at the Overdue Rate, if any, per annum
set forth above on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue
installment of interest. If the Original Issue Date is between a Regular
Record Date and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, the first payment of
interest hereon will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next
succeeding Regular Record Date to the Holder on such next Regular Record Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of the principal, and premium, if any, and interest payable at
Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment of this Security will
be made in immediately available funds at the corporate trust office or agency
of the Trustee in New York, New York, provided that this Security is presented
to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payments in such funds in
accordance with its normal procedures. Interest (other than interest payable
at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment) will be paid by
check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears in the
Security Register on the applicable Regular Record Date or, at the option of
the Company, by wire transfer to an account maintained by such person with a
bank located in the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1)&nbsp;the
Depositary or its nominee, if it is the registered Holder of this Security,
will be entitled to receive payments of interest (other than at Stated Maturity
or upon redemption or optional repayment) by wire transfer to an account
maintained by such Holder with a bank located in the United States, and (2)&nbsp;a
Holder of $10,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities
having the same Interest Payment Date will, upon receipt on or prior to the
Regular Record Date preceding an applicable Interest Payment Date by the
Trustee of written instructions from such Holder, be entitled to receive
payments of interest (other than at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or
optional repayment) by wire transfer to an account maintained by such Holder
with a bank located in the United States. Such instructions shall remain in
effect with respect to payments of interest made to such Holder on subsequent
Interest Payment Dates unless revoked or changed by written instructions
received by the Trustee from such Holder, provided that any such written
revocation or change which is received by the Trustee after a Regular Record
Date and before the related Interest Payment Date shall not be effective with
respect to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Medium-Term Notes,
Series&nbsp;Q of the Company (herein called the &#147;Securities&#148;), issued and to be
issued under an Indenture dated as of November&nbsp;1, 2000 (herein called the
&#147;Indenture&#148;) between the Company and The Bank of New York, as trustee (herein
called the &#147;Trustee,&#148; which term includes any successor trustee under the
Indenture), as amended, to which the Indenture and all indentures supplemental
thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitation of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is
one of the series designated on the face hereof. The Securities of this series
may be issued from time to time at varying maturities, interest rates and other
terms as may be designated with respect to a Security.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the issuance for which this Security is a part,
the Company may, from time to time, reopen such issuance and issue additional
Securities with the same terms (including maturity and interest payment terms)
as this Security. After such additional Securities are issued, they will be
fungible with this Security.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest payments for this Security will include interest accrued to but
excluding the Interest Payment Dates. Interest payments for this Security
shall be computed and paid on the basis of a 360-day year of

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">twelve 30-day months. If any Interest Payment Date specified on the face
hereof would otherwise be a day that is not a Business Day, the Interest
Payment Date shall be postponed to the next day that is a Business Day.
&#147;Business Day&#148; means any day that is not a Saturday or Sunday and that, in The
City of New York, is not a day on which banking institutions are generally
authorized or obligated to close.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On each Optional Reset Date, if any, specified on the face hereof, the
Company has the option to reset the interest rate hereon. If no date or dates
for such reset are set forth on the face hereof, this Security will not be
subject to such reset. The Company may exercise such option by notifying the
Trustee of such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60&nbsp;days prior to an
Optional Reset Date. Not later than 40&nbsp;days prior to such Optional Reset Date,
the Trustee will mail to the Holder hereof a notice (the &#147;Reset Notice&#148;), first
class, postage prepaid. The Reset Notice will indicate whether the Company has
elected to reset the interest rate hereon and if so, (1)&nbsp;such new interest
rate; and (2)&nbsp;the provisions, if any, for redemption during the period from
such Optional Reset Date to the next Optional Reset Date or, if there is no
such next Optional Reset Date, to Stated Maturity (each such period a
&#147;Subsequent Interest Period&#148;), including the date or dates on which or the
period or periods during which and the price or prices at which such redemption
may occur during such Subsequent Interest Period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Company may, at its option, revoke the
interest rate as provided for in the Reset Notice, and establish an interest
rate that is higher than the interest rate provided for in the relevant Reset
Notice for the Subsequent Interest Period commencing on such Optional Reset
Date, by causing the Trustee to mail, not later than 20&nbsp;days prior to an
Optional Reset Date (or, if the day is not a Business Day, on the immediately
succeeding Business Day), a notice of such higher interest rate to the Holder
hereof. Such notice will be irrevocable. The Company must notify the Trustee
of its intentions to revoke such Reset Notice at least 25&nbsp;days prior to such
Optional Reset Date. If the interest rate hereof is reset on an Optional Reset
Date and the Holder hereof has not tendered this Security for repayment (or has
validly revoked any such tender) pursuant to the next succeeding paragraph,
such Holder will bear such higher interest rate for the Subsequent Interest
Period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company elects to reset the interest rate hereon as described
above, the Holder hereof will have the option to elect repayment hereof by the
Company on any Optional Reset Date at a price equal to the aggregate principal
amount hereof outstanding on, plus any interest accrued to, such Optional Reset
Date. In order to exercise such option, the Holder hereof must follow the
procedures set forth below for optional repayment, except that (1)&nbsp;the period
for delivery of this Security or notification to the Trustee will be at least
25 but not more than 35&nbsp;days prior to such Optional Reset Date and (2)&nbsp;a Holder
who has tendered for repayment pursuant to a Reset Notice may, by written
notice to the Trustee, revoke any such tender until the close of business on
the tenth day prior to such Optional Reset Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company may extend the Stated Maturity of this Security for the number
of periods of whole years from one to five, if any, specified on the face
hereof under Extension Periods up to but not beyond the Final Maturity Date
specified on the face hereof. If no period or periods for such extension are
set forth on the face hereof, this Security will not be subject to such
extension. The Company may exercise such option by notifying the Trustee of
such exercise at least 45 but not more than 60&nbsp;days prior to the old Stated
Maturity. Not later than 40&nbsp;days prior to the old Stated Maturity, the Trustee
will mail to the Holder hereof a notice (the &#147;Extension Notice&#148;), first class,
postage prepaid. The Extension Notice will set forth (1)&nbsp;the election of the
Company to extend the Stated Maturity; (2)&nbsp;the new Stated Maturity; (3)&nbsp;the
interest rate applicable to the Extension Period; and (4)&nbsp;the provisions, if
any, for redemption during the Extension Period, including the date or dates on
which or the period or periods during which and the price or prices at which
such redemption may occur during the Extension Period. Upon the mailing by
such Trustee of an Extension Notice to the Holder hereof, the Stated Maturity
shall be extended automatically, and, except as modified by the Extension
Notice and as described in the next paragraph, this Security will have the same
terms as prior to the mailing of such Extension Notice.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Notwithstanding the foregoing, not later than 20&nbsp;days prior to the old
Stated Maturity, the Company may, at its option, revoke the interest rate
provided for in the Extension Notice and establish a higher interest rate for
the Extension Period, by causing the Trustee to mail notice of such higher
interest rate, as the case may be, first class, postage prepaid, to the Holder
hereof. Such notice will be irrevocable. In such case, this Security will
bear such higher interest rate for the Extension Period, whether or not
tendered for repayment.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If the Company extends Stated Maturity, the Holder hereof will have the
option to elect repayment hereof by the Company on the old Stated Maturity at a
price equal to the principal amount hereof, plus any interest accrued and
unpaid to such date. In order to exercise such option, the Holder hereof must
follow the procedures set forth for optional repayment, except that (1)&nbsp;the
period for delivery of this Security or notification to the Trustee will be at
least 25 but not more than 35&nbsp;days prior to the old Stated Maturity and (2)&nbsp;a
Holder who has tendered for repayment pursuant to an Extension Notice may, by
written notice to the Trustee, revoke any such tender for repayment until the
close of business on the tenth day before the old Stated Maturity.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless otherwise indicated on the face of this Security, this Security may
not be redeemed prior to Stated Maturity. If so indicated on the face of this
Security, this Security may be redeemed, at the option of the Company, on any
date on or after the date set forth on the face hereof, either in whole or from
time to time in part at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal
amount redeemed, together with interest accrued and unpaid thereon to the date
of redemption. Notice of redemption shall be mailed to the Holders of the
Securities designated for redemption at their addresses as the same shall
appear in the Security Register not less than 30 and not more than 60&nbsp;days
prior to the date of redemption, subject to all the conditions and provisions
of the Indenture. In the event of any redemption, the Company will not be
required to (1)&nbsp;issue, register the transfer of, or exchange any Security
during a period beginning at the opening of business 15&nbsp;days before any
selection of Securities to be redeemed and ending at the close of business on
the date of mailing of the relevant notice of redemption or (2)&nbsp;register the
transfer or exchange of any Security, or any portion thereof, called for
redemption, except the unredeemed portion of any Security being redeemed in
part. Only a new Security or Securities for the amount of the unredeemed
portion hereof shall be issued in the name of the Holder hereof upon the
cancellation hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If so provided on the face of this Security, the Security will be subject
to repayment at the option of the Holder on the date or dates so indicated on
the face hereof. If no date or dates for such repayment are set forth on the
face hereof, this Security will not be repayable at the option of the Holder
prior to Stated Maturity. On an optional repayment date, if any, this Security
will be repayable in whole or in part in increments of $1,000 at the option of
the Holder at a price equal to 100% of the principal amount to be repaid,
together with interest thereon payable to the date of repayment, if not more
than 60 nor less than 30&nbsp;days prior to the date or dates of repayment set forth
on the face hereof, the Company receives either (a)&nbsp;the Security with the form
entitled &#147;Option to Elect Repayment&#148; on the reverse of the Security duly

successor Depositary is not appointed within the time specified in the
Indenture, or (2)&nbsp;the Company in its sole discretion determines that all Global
