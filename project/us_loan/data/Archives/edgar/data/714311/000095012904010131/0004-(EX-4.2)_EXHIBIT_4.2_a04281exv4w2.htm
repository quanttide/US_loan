(hereinafter called the &#147;Company,&#148; which term includes any successor
corporation under the Indenture, as hereinafter defined), for value received,
hereby promises to pay to Cede &#038; Co., or registered assigns, the principal sum
set forth above at Stated Maturity shown above and to pay interest thereon from
the Original Issue Date shown above or from the most recent Interest Payment
Date (as hereinafter defined) to which interest has been paid or duly provided
for, in arrears on the Interest Payment Dates set forth above (&#147;Interest
Payment Dates&#148;), until the principal hereof is paid or made available for
payment, and on Stated Maturity, commencing with the Interest Payment Date next
succeeding the Original Issue Date, at the rate per annum determined in
accordance with the provisions below, depending on the Interest Rate Basis or
Bases specified above. Interest will be payable on each Interest Payment Date
and at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment. Interest will
be payable to the Holder at the close of business on the Regular Record Date
which, unless otherwise specified above, shall be the fifteenth calendar day
(whether or not a Business Day (as defined below)) immediately preceding the
related Interest Payment Date; provided, however, that interest payable at
Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment will be payable to the
person to whom principal is payable and (to the extent that the payment of such
interest shall be legally enforceable) at the Overdue Rate, if any, per annum
set forth above on any overdue principal and premium and on any overdue
installment of interest. If the Original Issue Date is between a Regular
Record Date and the next succeeding Interest Payment Date, the first payment of
interest hereon will be made on the Interest Payment Date following the next
succeeding Regular Record Date to the Holder on such next Regular Record Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Payment of the principal, and premium, if any, and interest payable at
Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment of this Security will
be made in immediately available funds at the corporate trust office or agency
of the Trustee in New York, New York, provided that this Security is presented
to the Trustee in time for the Trustee to make such payments in such funds in
accordance with its normal procedures. Interest (other than interest payable
at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or optional repayment) will be paid by
check mailed to the address of the person entitled thereto as it appears in the
Security Register on the applicable Regular Record Date or, at the option of
the Company, by wire transfer to an account maintained by such person with a
bank located in the United States. Notwithstanding the foregoing, (1)&nbsp;the
Depositary or its nominee, if it is the registered Holder of this Security,
will be entitled to receive payments of interest (other than at Stated Maturity
or upon redemption or optional repayment) by wire transfer to an account
maintained by such Holder with a bank located in the United States, and (2)&nbsp;a
Holder of $10,000,000 or more in aggregate principal amount of Securities
having the same Interest Payment Date will, upon receipt on or prior to the
Regular Record Date preceding an applicable Interest Payment Date by the
Trustee of written instructions from such Holder, be entitled to receive
payments of interest (other than at Stated Maturity or upon redemption or
optional repayment) by wire transfer to an account maintained by such Holder
with a bank located in the United States. Such instructions shall remain in
effect with respect to payments of interest made to such Holder on subsequent
Interest Payment Dates unless revoked or changed by written instructions
received by the Trustee from such Holder, provided that any such written
revocation or change which is received by the Trustee after a Regular Record
Date and before the related Interest Payment Date shall not be effective with
respect to the interest payable on such Interest Payment Date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Security is one of a duly authorized issue of Medium-Term Notes,
Series&nbsp;Q of the Company (herein called the &#147;Securities&#148;), issued and to be

thereto reference is hereby made for a statement of the respective rights,
limitation of rights, duties and immunities thereunder of the Company, the
Trustee and the Holders of the Securities and of the terms upon which the
Securities are, and are to be, authenticated and delivered. This Security is
one of the series designated on the face hereof. The Securities of this series
may be issued from time to time at varying maturities, interest rates and other
terms as may be designated with respect to a Security.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the completion of the issuance for which this Security is a part,
the Company may, from time to time, reopen such issuance and issue additional
Securities with the same terms (including maturity and interest payment terms)
as this Security. After such additional Securities are issued, they will be
fungible with this Security.

amendment thereof and the modification of the rights and obligations of the
Company and the rights of the Holders of the Securities of each series to be
affected under the Indenture at any time by the Company and the Trustee with
the consent of the Holders of not less than a majority in principal amount of
the Securities at the time outstanding of each series to be affected. The
Indenture also contains provisions permitting the Holders of not less than a
majority in principal amount of the outstanding Securities of any series to
waive compliance by the Company with certain provisions of the Indenture and
certain past defaults under the Indenture and their consequences. Any such
consent or waiver by the Holder of this Security shall be conclusive and
binding upon such Holder and upon all future Holders of this Security and of
any Security issued upon the registration of transfer hereof or in exchange
hereof or in lieu hereof, whether or not notation of such consent or waiver is
made upon this Security.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Security or
of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the Company, which is
absolute and unconditional, to pay the principal of, premium, if any, and
interest on this Security at the times, places and rate, and in the coin or
currency, herein prescribed. However, the Indenture limits Holder&#146;s rights to

Company that it is unwilling or unable to continue as Depositary for this
Global Security or if at any time the Depositary ceases to be a clearing agency
registered under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and a
successor Depositary is not appointed within the time specified in the
Indenture, or (2)&nbsp;the Company in its sole discretion determines that all Global
Securities of the same series as this Security shall be exchangeable for
definitive Securities of differing denominations aggregating a like amount in
registered form. If this Security is exchangeable pursuant to the preceding
sentence, it shall be exchangeable for definitive Securities of differing
denominations aggregating a like amount in registered form in denominations of
$1,000 and integral multiples of $1,000 in excess thereof, bearing interest at
the same rate or pursuant to the same formula, having the same date of
issuance, redemption provisions, if any, Stated Maturity and other terms.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Depositary will not sell, assign, transfer or otherwise convey any
beneficial interest in this Security unless such beneficial interest is in an
amount equal to $1,000 or an integral multiple of $1,000 in excess thereof.
The Depositary, by accepting this Security, agrees to be bound by such
provision.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No service charge shall be made for any such registration of transfer or
