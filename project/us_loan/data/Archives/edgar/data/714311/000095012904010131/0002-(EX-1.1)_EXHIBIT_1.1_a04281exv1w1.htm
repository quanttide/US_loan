respect to the issue and sale by the Company of up to the aggregate principal
amount set forth in Schedule&nbsp;I hereto of its Medium-Term Notes, Series&nbsp;Q, Due
Nine Months or More from Date of Issue (the &#147;Notes&#148;). The Notes will be issued
under an indenture (the &#147;Indenture&#148;) dated as of November&nbsp;1, 2000, between the

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Notes will be issued in minimum denominations of $1,000 and in
denominations exceeding such amount by integral multiples of $1,000, will be
issued only in fully registered form and will bear interest at rates to be
provided in a supplement to the Prospectus referred to below.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;Representations and Warranties. The Company represents and warrants to
you as of the date hereof, as of each Closing Date and Settlement Date
hereinafter referred to, and as of the times referred to in Section 4(h)
hereof, as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Company meets the requirements for use of Form S-3 under the
Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Act&#148;) and has filed with the
Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;) a registration
statement on such Form (the file number of which is set forth in Schedule
I hereto), which has become effective, for the registration under the Act
of the aggregate principal amount set forth in Schedule&nbsp;I hereto of debt
securities including the Notes (the &#147;Securities&#148;). Such registration
statement, as amended at the date of this Agreement, meets the
requirements set forth in Rule&nbsp;415(a)(1)(x) under the Act and complies in
all other material respects with said Rule. In connection with the sale
of Notes the Company proposes to file with the Commission pursuant to
Rule&nbsp;424 under the Act a supplement to the form of prospectus included in
such registration statement relating to the Notes and the plan of
distribution thereof and has previously advised you of all further
information (financial and other) with respect to the Company to be set
forth therein. Such registration statement, including the exhibits
thereto, as amended to the date of this Agreement, is hereinafter called
the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;; such prospectus, as supplemented pursuant
to the previous sentence, is hereinafter called the &#147;Prospectus&#148;. Any
reference herein to the Registration Statement or the Prospectus shall be
deemed to refer to and include the documents incorporated by reference
therein pursuant to Item&nbsp;12 of Form S-3 which were filed under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;), on or
before the date of this Agreement or the date of the Prospectus, as the
case may be; and any reference herein to the terms &#147;amend&#148;, &#147;amendment&#148;
or &#147;supplement&#148; with respect to the Registration Statement or the
Prospectus shall be deemed to refer to and include the filing of any
document under the Exchange Act after the date of this Agreement or the
date of the Prospectus, as the case may be, deemed to be incorporated
therein by reference.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) As of the date hereof, when any amendment to the Registration
Statement becomes effective (including the filing of any document
incorporated by reference in the Registration Statement), when any
supplement to the Prospectus is filed with the Commission and at the date
of delivery by the Company of any Notes sold hereunder (a &#147;Closing
Date&#148;), (i)&nbsp;the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such time,
and the Prospectus as supplemented as of any such time, and the Indenture
will comply in all material respects with the applicable requirements of
the Act, the Trust Indenture Act of 1939, as amended (the &#147;Trust
Indenture Act&#148;), and the Exchange Act and the respective rules thereunder
and (ii)&nbsp;neither the Registration Statement, as amended as of any such
time, nor the Prospectus as supplemented as of any such time, will
contain any untrue statement of a material fact or omit to state any
material fact required to be stated therein or necessary in order to make
the statements therein not misleading; provided, however, that the
Company makes no representations or warranties

the Statement of Eligibility and Qualification (Form T-1) under the Trust
Indenture Act of the Trustee or (ii)&nbsp;the information contained in or
omitted from the Registration Statement or Prospectus in reliance upon
and in conformity with information furnished in writing to the Company by
or on behalf of the Agents specifically for use in connection with the
preparation of the Registration Statement and the Prospectus.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Subsequent to the respective dates as of which information is
given in the Registration Statement and Prospectus, and except as set
forth or contemplated in the Prospectus, neither the Company nor any of
its subsidiaries has incurred any material liabilities or obligations,
direct or contingent, nor entered into any material transactions not in
the ordinary course of business, and there has not been any material
adverse change in the condition (financial or otherwise), business,
prospects or results of operations of the Company and its subsidiaries
considered as a whole.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Securities have been duly authorized and, when issued and
delivered pursuant to this Agreement and, if applicable, the Terms
Agreement (as defined in Section 2(b) hereof) or otherwise, will have
been duly executed, authenticated, issued and delivered and will
constitute valid and legally binding obligations of the Company entitled
to the benefits provided by the Indenture, which will be substantially in
the form filed as an exhibit to the Registration Statement or a document
incorporated by reference therein; the Indenture has been duly authorized
and duly qualified under the Trust Indenture Act and constitutes a valid
and legally binding instrument, enforceable in accordance with its terms,
subject, as to enforcement, to bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization and
other laws of general applicability relating to or affecting creditors&#146;
rights and to general equity principles; and the Securities and the
Indenture will conform to the descriptions thereof in the Prospectus.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The Notes have been rated by a &#147;nationally recognized
statistical rating agency&#148; (as that term is defined by the Commission for
purposes of Rule&nbsp;436(g)(2) under the Act), including one or both of
Moody&#146;s Investor Services (&#147;Moody&#146;s&#148;) and Standard &#038; Poor&#146;s Ratings
Services, a division of the McGraw Hill Companies (&#147;S&#038;P&#148;).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(f) The Company confirms as of the date hereof, and each acceptance
by the Company of an offer to purchase Notes will be deemed to be an
affirmation, that the Company is in compliance with all provisions of
Section&nbsp;1 of Laws of Florida, Chapter&nbsp;92-198, <I>An Act Relating to
Disclosure of Doing Business with Cuba, </I>and the Company further agrees
that if it commences engaging in business with the government of Cuba or
with any person or affiliate located in Cuba after the date the
Registration Statement becomes or has become effective with the
Commission or with the Florida Department of Banking and Finance (the
&#147;Department&#148;), whichever date is later, or if the information reported in
the Prospectus, if any, concerning the Company&#146;s business with Cuba or
with any person or affiliate located in Cuba changes in any material way,
the Company will provide the Department notice of such business or
change, as appropriate, in a form acceptable to the Department.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2.&nbsp;Appointment of Agents; Purchases as Principals.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Subject to the terms and conditions set forth herein, the
Company hereby authorizes you to act as its agents to solicit offers for
the purchase of all or part of the Notes, upon the terms set forth in the
Prospectus, as supplemented, during a period beginning on the date hereof
and ending on the date the Company shall specify to you in writing. The
Company agrees to pay each Agent a commission, at the time of settlement
of each sale of Notes by the Company as a result of a solicitation made
by such Agent, in an amount to be agreed to by the Company and such Agent
at the time of solicitation, it being understood and agreed that the
commissions may not be the same for each Agent. Such commissions shall
be payable as specified in the Procedures (as defined in Section&nbsp;3).
Offers for the purchase of Notes may be solicited by the Agents as agents
for the Company at such time and in such amounts as the Agents deem
advisable. The Company may from time to time offer Notes for sale
otherwise than through the Agents. If any agent, other than an Agent, is
appointed during the term of this Agreement with respect to the Notes,
the Company shall promptly notify the Agents of such appointment.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Each sale of Notes to you as principal shall be made in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and a separate agreement
which will provide for the sale of such Notes to, and the purchase and
reoffering thereof by, you. Each such separate agreement (which may be
an oral agreement confirmed in writing or which may be substantially in
the form of Schedule&nbsp;II hereto and which may take the form of an exchange
of any standard form of written telecommunication between you and the
Company) is herein referred to as a &#147;Terms Agreement&#148;. Your commitment
to purchase Notes pursuant to any Terms Agreement shall be deemed to have
been made on the basis of the representations and warranties of the
Company herein contained and shall be subject to the terms and conditions
herein set forth. Each Terms Agreement shall specify the principal
amount of Notes to be purchased by you pursuant thereto, the price to be
paid to the Company for such Notes, the initial public offering price, if
any, at which the Notes are proposed to be reoffered, and the time and
place of delivery of and payment for such Notes (the &#147;Settlement Date&#148;).
Such Terms Agreement shall also specify any requirements for opinions of
counsel, officers&#146; certificates and letters from independent auditors
pursuant to Section&nbsp;5 hereof.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;Offering Procedure. The Agents shall communicate to the Company,
orally or in writing, each offer to purchase Notes on terms previously
communicated by the Company to the Agents, and the Company shall have the sole
right to accept such offers to purchase Notes and may refuse any proposed
purchase of Notes in whole or in part for any reason. Each of the Agents shall
have the right, in its discretion reasonably exercised, to reject any proposed
purchase of Notes on different terms, as a whole or in part, and any such
rejection shall not be deemed a breach of its agreement contained herein. The
Agents and the Company agree to perform the respective duties and obligations
specifically provided to be performed by them in the Medium-Term Notes
Administrative Procedures (attached hereto as Exhibit&nbsp;A) (the &#147;Procedures&#148;), as
amended from time to time. The Procedures may only be amended by written
agreement of the Company and the Agents after notice to, and with the approval
of, the Trustee.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;Agreements. The Company agrees with you that:

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">


<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Prior to the termination of the offering of the Notes, the
Company will not file any amendment of the Registration Statement or
supplement to the Prospectus unless the Company has furnished you with
copies for your review prior to filing and will not file any such
proposed amendment or supplement to which you reasonably object. Subject
to the foregoing sentence, the Company will cause each supplement to the
Prospectus to be filed (or transmitted for filing) with the Commission as
required pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424. The Company will promptly advise you (i)
when each supplement to the Prospectus shall have been filed (or
transmitted for filing) with the Commission pursuant to Rule&nbsp;424, (ii)
when any amendment of the Registration Statement shall have become
effective, (iii)&nbsp;of any request by the Commission for any amendment of
the Registration Statement or amendment of or supplement to the
Prospectus or for any additional information, (iv)&nbsp;of the issuance by the
Commission of any stop order suspending the effectiveness of the
Registration Statement or the institution or threatening of any
proceeding for that purpose and (v)&nbsp;of the receipt by the Company of any
notification with respect to the suspension of the qualification of the
Notes for sale in any jurisdiction or the initiation or threatening of
any proceeding for such purpose. The Company will use its best efforts
to prevent the issuance of any such stop order and, if issued, to obtain
as soon as possible the withdrawal thereof.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) If, at any time when a prospectus relating to the Notes is
required to be delivered under the Act, any event occurs as a result of
which the Registration Statement, as then amended, or the Prospectus, as
then supplemented, would include any untrue statement of a material fact
or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made,
not misleading, or if it shall be necessary to amend the Registration
Statement or to supplement the Prospectus to comply with the Act or the
Exchange Act or the respective rules thereunder, the Company promptly
will (i)&nbsp;notify the Agents to suspend solicitation of offers to purchase
Notes (and, if so notified by the Company, the Agents shall forthwith
suspend such solicitation and cease using the Prospectus as then amended
or supplemented), (ii)&nbsp;prepare and file with the Commission, subject to
the first sentence of paragraph (a)&nbsp;of this Section&nbsp;4, an amendment or
supplement which will correct such statement or omission or an amendment
or supplement which will effect such compliance and (iii)&nbsp;will supply any
such amended or supplemented Prospectus to the Agents in such quantities
as the Agents may reasonably request. If such amendment or supplement is
satisfactory in all respects to the Agents, the Agents will, upon the
filing of such amendment or supplement with the Commission and upon the
effectiveness of an amendment to the Registration Statement if such an
amendment is required, resume their obligation to solicit offers to
purchase Notes hereunder.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) As soon as practicable, the Company will make generally
available to its security holders and to you an earnings statement or
statements of the Company and its subsidiaries which will satisfy the
provisions of Section 11(a) of the Act and Rule&nbsp;158 under the Act and,
not later than 45&nbsp;days after the end of the 12-month period beginning at
the end of each fiscal quarter of the Company (other than the last fiscal
quarter of any fiscal year) during which the effective date of any
post-effective amendment to the Registration Statement occurs, not later
than 90&nbsp;days after the end of the fiscal year beginning at the end of
each last fiscal quarter of any fiscal year of the Company during

Registration Statement occurs, and not later than 90&nbsp;days after the end
of each fiscal year of the Company during which any Notes were issued,
the Company will make generally available to its security holders an
earnings statement covering such 12-month period or such fiscal year, as
the case may be, that will satisfy the provisions of such Section 11(a)
and Rule&nbsp;158.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) The Company will furnish to you and your counsel, without
charge, copies of the Registration Statement (including exhibits thereto)
and each amendment thereto which shall become effective and, so long as
delivery of a prospectus may be required by the Act, as many copies of
any preliminary Prospectus and the Prospectus and any amendments thereof
and supplements thereto as you may reasonably request.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) The Company will arrange for the qualification of the Notes for
sale under the laws of such jurisdictions as you may reasonably
designate, will maintain such qualifications in effect so long as
required for the distribution of the Notes, and, if requested by the
Agents, will arrange for the determination of the legality of the Notes

the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K for the most recent fiscal

inquiries of officials of the Company and its subsidiaries
responsible for financial and accounting matters and such other
inquiries and procedures as may be specified in such letter,
nothing came to their attention that caused them to believe that:

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) The Company agrees to indemnify and hold harmless each of you
and each person, if any, who controls each of you within the meaning of
Section&nbsp;15 of the Act as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(i) against any and all loss, liability, claim, damage and
expense whatsoever arising out of any untrue statement or alleged
untrue statement of a material fact contained in the Registration
Statement (or any amendment thereto), or the omission or alleged
omission therefrom of a material fact required to be stated therein
or necessary to make the statements therein not misleading or
arising out of any untrue statement or alleged untrue statement of
material fact contained in the Prospectus (or any amendment or
supplement thereto) or the omission or alleged omission therefrom
of a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were
made, not misleading, unless such untrue statement or such alleged
untrue statement or omission was made in reliance upon and in
conformity with written information furnished to the Company by you
expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement
thereto);

or omission (except as made in reliance upon and in conformity with
information furnished by you as aforesaid) if such settlement is
effected with the written consent of the Company; and



<P align="left" style="margin-left:6%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(iii) against any and all expense whatsoever as incurred
(including the fees and disbursements of counsel chosen by you)
reasonably incurred in investigating, preparing or defending
against any litigation, or investigation or proceeding by any
governmental agency or body, commenced or threatened, or any claim
whatsoever based upon any such untrue statement or omission, or any
such alleged untrue statement or omission (except as made in
reliance upon and in conformity with information furnished by you
as aforesaid), to the extent that any such expense is not paid
under (i)&nbsp;or (ii)&nbsp;above.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Each Agent severally agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the
Company, its directors, each of its officers who signed the Registration
Statement, and each person, if any, who controls the Company within the
meaning of Section&nbsp;15 of the Act against any and all loss, liability,
claim, damage and expense described in the indemnity contained in
subsection (a)&nbsp;of this Section, but only with respect to untrue
statements or omissions, or alleged untrue statements or omissions, made
in the Registration Statement (or any amendment thereto) or the
Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto) in reliance upon and
in conformity with written information furnished to the Company by such
Agent expressly for use in the Registration Statement (or any amendment
thereto) or the Prospectus (or any amendment or supplement thereto).



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) Each indemnified party shall give prompt notice to each
indemnifying party of any action commenced against it in respect of which
indemnity may be sought hereunder but failure to so notify an
indemnifying party shall not relieve it from any liability which it may
have otherwise than on account of this indemnity agreement. In case any
such action shall be brought against any indemnified party, the
indemnifying party may participate at its own expense in the defense of
such action. In no event shall the indemnifying parties be liable for
the fees and expenses of more than one counsel (other than local counsel)
for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate
but similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction arising out of
the same general allegations or circumstances. The indemnifying party
shall not be liable for any settlement of any proceeding effected without
its written consent, but if settled with such consent or if there be a
final judgment for the plaintiff, the indemnifying party agrees to
indemnify the indemnified party to the extent set forth in subsection (a)
or (b)&nbsp;hereof, as applicable, from and against any loss or liability by
reason of such settlement or judgment. No indemnifying party shall,
without the prior written consent of the indemnified party, effect any
settlement of any pending or threatened proceeding in respect of which
any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could
have been sought hereunder by such indemnified party, unless such
settlement includes an unconditional release of such indemnified party
from all liability on claims that are the subject matter of such
proceeding.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) If the indemnification provided for in this Section&nbsp;7 shall for
any reason be unavailable to an indemnified party under Section 7(a) or
7(b) hereof in respect of any loss, claim, damage or liability, or any
action in respect thereof, referred to therein, then each indemnifying
party shall, in lieu of indemnifying such indemnified party, contribute
to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of
such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect thereof, (i)
in such proportion as shall be appropriate to reflect the relative
benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the Agent whose
claim is subject to contribution, on the other, from the offering of the
Notes or (ii)&nbsp;if the allocation provided by clause (i)&nbsp;above is not
permitted by applicable law, in such proportion as is appropriate to
reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)&nbsp;above
but also the relative fault of the Company, on the one hand, and such
Agent, on the other, with respect to the statements or omissions which
resulted in such loss, claim, damage or liability, or action in respect
thereof, as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The
relative benefits received by the Company, on the one hand, and the
Agents, on the other, with respect to such offering shall be deemed to be
in the same proportion as the total net proceeds from the offering of the
Notes (before deducting expenses) received by the Company bear to the
total discounts and commissions received by any Agent with respect to
such offering. The relative fault shall be determined by reference to
whether the untrue or alleged untrue statement of a material fact or
omission or alleged omission to state a material fact relates to
information supplied by the Company or any Agent, the intent of the
parties and their relative knowledge, access to information and
opportunity to correct or prevent such statement or omission. The
Company and the Agents agree that it would not be just and equitable if
contributions pursuant to this Section 7(d) were to be determined by pro
rata allocation (even if the Agents were treated as one entity for such
purpose) or by any other method of allocation which does not take into
account the equitable considerations referred to herein. The amount paid
or payable by an indemnified party as a result of the loss, claim, damage
or liability, or action in respect thereof, referred to above in this
Section 7(d) shall be deemed to include, for purposes of this Section
7(d), any legal or other expenses reasonably incurred by such indemnified
party in connection with investigating or defending any such action or
claim to the extent not already paid or payable pursuant to another
provision of this Section&nbsp;7. Notwithstanding the provisions of this
Section&nbsp;7(d), no Agent shall be required to contribute any amount in
excess of the amount by which the total price at which the Notes sold
through such Agent and distributed to the public were offered to the
public exceeds the amount of any damages which such Agent has otherwise
paid or become liable to pay by reason of any untrue or alleged untrue
statement or omission or alleged omission. No person guilty of
fraudulent misrepresentation (within the meaning of Section 11(f) of the
Act) shall be entitled to contribution from any person who was not guilty
of such fraudulent misrepresentation. The Agents&#146; obligations under this
Section 7(d) to contribute are several in proportion to the respective
principal amounts of Notes purchased by each such Agent in such offering
and not joint.

time by any party hereto, with respect to such party, upon the giving of 30

<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>MEDIUM-TERM NOTE ADMINISTRATIVE<BR>
PROCEDURES FOR FIXED RATE AND FLOATING RATE NOTES<BR>
(Dated as of December&nbsp;28, 2004)</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Medium-Term Notes, Series&nbsp;Q (the &#147;Notes&#148;), in the aggregate principal
amount of up to U.S. $2,000,000,000 are to be offered on a continuing basis by
International Lease Finance Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) through ABN AMRO
Incorporated, Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays Capital Inc., BNP
Paribas Securities Corp., Citigroup Global Markets Inc., Credit Suisse First
Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities (USA)&nbsp;Inc., J.P.
Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., and Merrill Lynch, Pierce, Fenner
&#038; Smith Incorporated, who, as agents (each an &#147;Agent,&#148; and, collectively, the
&#147;Agents&#148;), have agreed to use their best efforts to solicit offers to purchase
the Notes from the Company. The Agents may also purchase Notes as principal
for resale.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notes are being sold pursuant to a Distribution Agreement, dated
December&nbsp;28, 2004 (the &#147;Distribution Agreement&#148;), by and between the Company
and the Agents. The Notes will be issued pursuant to an Indenture (the
&#147;Indenture&#148;), dated as of November&nbsp;1, 2000, between the Company and The Bank of
New York, as trustee (the &#147;Trustee&#148;), as amended. A Registration Statement
(the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;, which term shall include any additional
registration statements filed in connection with the Notes as provided in the
introductory paragraph of the Distribution Agreement) with respect to the Notes
has been filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the &#147;Commission&#148;).
The most recent basic Prospectus included in the Registration Statement, as
supplemented with respect to the Notes, is herein referred to as the
&#147;Prospectus Supplement.&#148; The most recent supplement to the Prospectus with
respect to the specific terms of the Notes is herein referred to as the
&#147;Pricing Supplement.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Notes will either be issued (a)&nbsp;in book-entry form and represented by
one or more fully registered Notes (each, a &#147;Book-Entry Note&#148;) delivered to the
Trustee, as agent for The Depository Trust Company (&#147;DTC&#148;), and recorded in the
book-entry system maintained by DTC, or (b)&nbsp;in certificated form delivered to
the purchaser thereof or a person designated by such purchaser. Owners of
beneficial interests in Notes issued in book-entry form will be entitled to
physical delivery of Notes in certificated form equal in principal amount to
their respective beneficial interests only upon certain limited circumstances
described in the Prospectus.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;General procedures relating to the issuance of all Notes are set forth in
Part&nbsp;I hereof. Additionally, Notes issued in book-entry form will be issued in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Part&nbsp;II hereof and Notes issued in
certificated form will be issued in accordance with the procedures set forth in
Part&nbsp;III hereof. Capitalized terms used herein that are not otherwise defined
shall have the meanings ascribed thereto in the Indenture or the Notes, as the
case may be.

Such credits will be made on the settlement date if possible,
and in any event not later than the Business Day following the
settlement date; provided that the Company has received notice
on the same day. If such failure shall have occurred for any
reason other than failure by such Agent to perform its
obligations hereunder or under the Distribution Agreement, the
Company will reimburse such Agent on an equitable basis for
its loss of the use of funds during the period when the funds
were credited to the account of the Company. Immediately upon
receipt of the Note in respect of which the failure occurred,
the Trustee will cancel and destroy the Note, make appropriate
entries in its records to reflect the fact that the Note was
never issued, and accordingly notify in writing the Company.</TD>
