from time to time of the Notes. The Notes constitute a series of the Debt
Securities registered on a Registration Statement on Form S-3 (File No.
333-120649) (the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;), filed by International Lease
Finance Corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;) under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended. The Notes are being issued under an Indenture, dated as of November
1, 2000 (the &#147;Indenture&#148;), between the Company and The Bank of New York, as
Trustee, as amended.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the basis of our consideration of such questions of law as we have
deemed relevant in the circumstances, we are of the opinion, subject to the
assumptions and limitations set forth herein, that the Notes have been duly
authorized by all necessary corporate action on the part of the Company and
when the final terms of a particular Note and of its issuance and sale have
been duly established in conformity with the Indenture, and when such Note has
been duly executed, authenticated and issued in accordance with the provisions
of the Indenture and upon payment for and delivery of the Notes in accordance
with the terms of the Distribution Agreement, dated December&nbsp;28, 2004, among
the Company and ABN AMRO Incorporated, Banc of America Securities LLC, Barclays
Capital Inc., BNP Paribas Securities Corp., Citigroup Global Markets Inc.,
Credit Suisse First Boston LLC, Deutsche Bank Securities Inc., HSBC Securities
(USA)&nbsp;Inc., J.P. Morgan Securities Inc., Lehman Brothers Inc., and Merrill
Lynch, Pierce, Fenner &#038; Smith Incorporated, will be legally valid and binding
obligations of the Company, enforceable against the Company in accordance with
their terms, except as may be limited by bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, moratorium or similar laws relating to or affecting creditors&#146;
rights
