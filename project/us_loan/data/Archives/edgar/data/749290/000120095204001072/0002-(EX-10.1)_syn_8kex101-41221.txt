                           LOAN MODIFICATION AGREEMENT

         This Loan Modification Agreement is entered into effective as of
December __, 2004, by and between Synthetech, Inc. (the "Borrower") and Silicon
Valley Bank ("Bank").

1.       DESCRIPTION OF EXISTING INDEBTEDNESS: Among other indebtedness which
may be owing by Borrower to Bank, Borrower is indebted to Bank pursuant to,
among other documents, a Loan and Security Agreement, dated December 31, 2003,
as may be amended from time to time, (the "Loan Agreement"). The Loan Agreement
provided for, among other things, a Committed Revolving Line in the original
principal amount of One Million Dollars ($1,000,000). Defined terms used but not
otherwise defined herein shall have the same meanings as in the Loan Agreement.

Hereinafter,  all indebtedness owing by Borrower to Bank shall be referred to as
the "Indebtedness."

2.       DESCRIPTION OF COLLATERAL AND GUARANTIES. Repayment of the Indebtedness
is secured by the Collateral as described in the Loan Agreement.

Hereinafter,  the  above-described  security documents and guaranties,  together
with  all  other  documents  securing  repayment  of the  Indebtedness  shall be
referred to as the "Security  Documents".  Hereinafter,  the Security Documents,
together with all other documents  evidencing or securing the Indebtedness shall
be referred to as the "Existing Loan Documents".

3.       DESCRIPTION OF CHANGE IN TERMS.

         A.       Modification(s) to Loan Agreement.

                  1.       Sub-section (ii) of Section 6.7 is hereby amended by
                           deleting the existing subsection and replacing it
                           with the following:

                           "(ii) TANGIBLE NET WORTH. A Tangible Net Worth of at
                           least $18,000,000 plus 50% of all equity or capital
                           contributed to Borrower and 50% of all positive net
                           income each quarterly period from and after the
                           quarter ending December 31, 2004."

                  2.       The definition of Revolving Maturity Date in Section
                           14.1 is amended by deleting the existing definition
                           and replacing it with the following:

                           ""REVOLVING MATURITY DATE" is December 23, 2005."

                  3.       Exhibit D to the Agreement is hereby deleted and
                           replaced with the form of Exhibit D attached to this
                           Loan Modification Agreement.

4.       CONSISTENT CHANGES. The Existing Loan Documents are hereby amended
wherever necessary to reflect the changes described above.

5.       PAYMENT OF LOAN FEE. Borrowers shall pay to Bank a fully earned,
non-refundable loan fee of $5,000 plus all out-of-pocket expenses.

6.       NO DEFENSES OF BORROWER. Borrower (and each guarantor and pledgor
signing below) agrees that, as of the date hereof, it has no defenses against
the obligations to pay any amounts under the Indebtedness.

7.       CONTINUING VALIDITY. Borrower (and each guarantor and pledgor signing
below) understands and agrees that in modifying the existing Indebtedness, Bank
is relying upon Borrower's representations,
<PAGE>
warranties, and agreements, as set forth in the Existing Loan Documents. Except
as expressly modified pursuant to this Loan Modification Agreement, the terms of
the Existing Loan Documents remain unchanged and in full force and effect.
Bank's agreement to modifications to the existing Indebtedness pursuant to this
Loan Modification Agreement in no way shall obligate Bank to make any future
modifications to the Indebtedness. Nothing in this Loan Modification Agreement
shall constitute a satisfaction of the Indebtedness. It is the intention of Bank
and Borrower to retain as liable parties all makers and endorsers of Existing
Loan Documents, unless the party is expressly released by Bank in writing. No
maker, endorser, or guarantor will be released by virtue of this Loan
Modification Agreement. The terms of this paragraph apply not only to this Loan
Modification Agreement, but also to all subsequent loan modification agreements.

8.       CONDITIONS. The effectiveness of this Loan Modification Agreement is
conditioned upon Borrower's payment of the Bank's out-of-pocket expenses and
loan fee.

         This Loan  Modification  Agreement  is  executed  as of the date  first
written above.
