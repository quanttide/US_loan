<p align="center">&nbsp;<b>Superior Energy
Services, Inc. Announces SPN Resources, LLC<br>
Purchases West Delta 79/86 Field
From Amerada Hess Corporation,<br>
Updates Fourth Quarter Production Estimates</b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">HARVEY,
La.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 20, 2004--Superior Energy Services, Inc. (NYSE: SPN)
today announced that its subsidiary, SPN Resources, LLC, closed on the purchase
of the West Delta 79/86 field from Amerada Hess Corporation.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">SPN
Resources acquired 100% working interest in seven leases on five shallow water
Gulf of Mexico blocks, which include eight platforms and more than 100 wells, of
which approximately 30 are producing. Net production is estimated at
approximately 1,250 barrels of oil equivalent (boe) per day, including
approximately 750 barrels of oil. Service work identified for Superior companies
that will be involved with operating, maintaining, enhancing and abandoning the
field has an estimated market value of approximately $59 million, including $36
million of decommissioning liability, and will be performed over the next eight
to 10 years. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Superior
received $3.7 million in cash as a result of netting the difference between the
cash paid at closing to Amerada Hess for acquiring the properties and the cash
Superior received in exchange for selling a portion of the behind pipe reserves
and exploration rights to Arena Energy. Superior will retain an overriding
royalty interest in any new drill well opportunities identified by Arena Energy
with the option to participate instead on a well-by-well basis for a working
interest. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">SPN
Resources now owns and operates properties on 39 blocks in the Gulf of Mexico,
which include 50 structures and more than 380 wells, of which more than 160 are
currently producing. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt"><b>
Production Update </b></p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Production
from the Company's South Pass 60 field resumed November 22, 2004, following
repairs to damage caused by Hurricane Ivan. Additional repairs and maintenance
to generators, compressors and electrical systems have limited production levels
until this week, when production exceeded pre-storm levels. The Company
estimates production from currently producing properties, excluding the West
Delta properties, should on average exceed 6,100 boe per day going forward. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">However, as
a result of the delays, Superior estimates the production deferral in the fourth
quarter will be 260,500 net boe versus earlier estimates of 184,000 net boe. The
Company expects fourth quarter production to be approximately 263,000 net boe
(inclusive of the West Delta properties) as compared to earlier guidance of
306,000 net boe. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">CEO Terry
Hall commented: &quot;The West Delta field is the type of 'sunset' property we seek
with a significant number of mature wells allowing us to increase utilization of
our production-related and decommissioning assets. The ability to put crews and
equipment to work during the seasonally slow periods during the fourth and first
quarters is important given the fixed cost nature of some of our businesses.
This transaction should be mildly accretive to 2005 earnings and offers
potential upside from the exploratory drilling our partner, Arena Energy, will
do in the field with little or none of our capital at risk. We believe we now
have an inventory of more than $240 million in service work on properties we
own, including the West Delta 79/86 acquisition. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&quot;Although
deferred production from the fourth quarter is higher than we originally
estimated due to the delay in the return of South Pass 60, we believe 2005 is
setting up as a very positive year for Superior given the improving market
outlook for our rental tools and production-related service businesses,
full-year production from South Pass 60, and incremental service work on the
properties we own.&quot; </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">SPN
Resources is focused on acquiring mature producing properties in the Gulf of
Mexico. In the last 12 months, acquisitions have been made from Unocal,
Marathon, Apache, BP, and Amerada Hess. </p>
<p style="margin-bottom:0in;margin-bottom:.0001pt">Superior
