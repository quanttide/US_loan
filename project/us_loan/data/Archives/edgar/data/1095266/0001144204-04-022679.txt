ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

      On December 20, 2004, Workstream Inc. (the "Company") agreed to purchase,
through its wholly-owned subsidiary Workstream USA, Inc. (the "Company Sub"),
substantially all of the assets of ProAct Technologies Corporation ("ProAct"), a
provider of software and hosted web-based tools for employee benefits
management, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement among the Company, the
Company Sub and ProAct (the "Purchase Agreement"). The total consideration to be
paid under the Purchase Agreement is $9,730,000, payable as follows: the Company
and Company Sub will pay $5,500,000 in cash upon closing; the Company and the
Company Sub will jointly issue at closing a promissory note in the face amount
of $1,530,000, which note will be secured by a senior security interest in the
assets being purchased under the Purchase Agreement; and the Company will issue
at closing $2,700,000 of common shares of the Company, $750,000 of which shares
will be held in escrow as the exclusive source against which the Company may
assert most potential indemnification claims under the Purchase Agreement. The
actual number of common shares to be issued at closing will be determined based
on the average of the closing price of the Company's common shares on the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market for the 20 business days prior to the closing date of the
Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company
and ProAct will enter into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the

             Workstream to Acquire the Assets of ProAct Technologies

    Acquisition Completes Workstream's Enterprise Workforce Management Suite

OTTAWA, ON AND WHITE PLAINS, NY - DECEMBER 21, 2004 - Workstream Inc. (NASDAQ:
WSTM), a provider of Enterprise Workforce Management software, today announced
it has agreed to acquire privately held ProAct Technologies Corporation, a
provider of HR software solutions for personalized benefits, employee
communications and decision support for large employers and Business Process
Outsourcers (BPO's). This transaction will be accretive and add over $10 million
in revenue in calendar 2005.

"Workstream's acquisition of ProAct will deliver the industry's most
comprehensive Enterprise Workforce Management suite, servicing over 10 million
employees and over 400 customers across North America," said Michael Mullarkey,
Chairman and CEO of Workstream. "With over $20 million of cash on hand,
Workstream is continuing to invest in organic customer acquisition, product
enhancements and expanding partnerships with HR BPO's.

WORKSTREAM EXPANDS CUSTOMER BASE

ProAct's customers include companies such as Agilent Technologies, Cigna,
Eastman Chemical Company, Johnson Controls, National Semiconductor, Proctor &
Gamble, Tenneco, The Thomson Corporation, Verizon Wireless and the Walgreen
Company. They will join the ranks of Workstream's own blue chip customer base
which includes ChevronTexaco Corporation, Citigroup Inc., Gap Inc., Home Depot,
Kaiser Permanente, Motorola, Nordstrom, VISA, Watson Wyatt, and Wells Fargo &
Co.

Greg Rorke, President and CEO of ProAct Technologies, said, "Workstream and
ProAct share in a vision of providing a complete suite of Enterprise Workforce
Management solutions to our Fortune 2000 customers with their choice of delivery
and flexible purchasing options. By combining forces, Workstream and ProAct are
creating a strategic suite of HR offerings and product leadership poised to
deliver value to organizations of all sizes."

STRATEGIC BENEFITS OF THE ACQUISITION:

      o     Combined customer base of over 400 Fortune 2000 customers.

      o     Software applications serving over 10 million employees per month.

      o     A higher percentage of recurring revenue from "software as a
            service" applications.

      o     Broader suite of Enterprise Workforce Management solutions.

      o     Expanded distribution capability through new BPO relationships.

      o     A stronger, integrated customer-facing sales and marketing
            organization.

"Organizations that are faced with the dilemma of whether to upgrade their aging
HRMS or continue investment in PeopleSoft should consider Workstream as an ERP
alternative," said Mark Smith, SVP Research and CEO of Ventana Research. "We
continue to see strong demand for software as a service (SaaS) HR solutions -
like those offered by Workstream - because it provides companies a high value,
low risk alternative to upgrading or purchasing on-premise ERP solutions".

According to Gartner, consolidation in the HR software market continues at a
rapid pace. "The landscape of HR technology is shifting as companies increase
demand for broad talent management suite solutions," stated James Holincheck,
Research Director, Human Capital Management applications at Gartner. "Talent
Management suites provide companies with a single source of strategic workforce
management capabilities designed to help them manage the entire employee
lifecycle - from recruit to retire. Enterprises are realizing the integration,
implementation and costs benefits it can deliver."

WORKSTREAM COMPLETES TALENTCENTER(TM) WITH PROACT OFFERINGS

The acquisition of ProAct will further expand Workstream's TalentCenter
application suite with new Enterprise Workforce Management capabilities. ProAct
provides a complete Benefits product line including: ProAct Benefits
Administration, ProAct Benefits Enrollment and the ProAct Health Pages(TM)
content service.

Workstream will also be acquiring an intelligent knowledge management system,
ProAct Communicator(TM), which allows administrators to author personalized
content and then deliver it to managers and employees through an intuitive
web-based solution. The ProAct Communicator products include ProAct HR
Communicator(TM), ProAct Standard Plan Description (SPD) Communicator, ProAct
Benefits Communicator(TM) and the ProAct Call Center Communicator(TM).

The Company also provides the ProAct Total Rewards Statement(TM), which
aggregates an employee's total compensation information, including real time
valuation of vested and unvested options and decision support and tax planning
tools. ProAct Total Rewards will provide a natural extension to Workstream's
complete set of compensation and rewards offerings.

ProAct's financial advisor during the acquisition process was Q Advisors, a
technology investment banking firm based in Denver, Colorado.
