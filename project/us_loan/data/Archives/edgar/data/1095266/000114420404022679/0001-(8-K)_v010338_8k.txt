ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT

      On December 20, 2004, Workstream Inc. (the "Company") agreed to purchase,
through its wholly-owned subsidiary Workstream USA, Inc. (the "Company Sub"),
substantially all of the assets of ProAct Technologies Corporation ("ProAct"), a
provider of software and hosted web-based tools for employee benefits
management, pursuant to an Asset Purchase Agreement among the Company, the
Company Sub and ProAct (the "Purchase Agreement"). The total consideration to be
paid under the Purchase Agreement is $9,730,000, payable as follows: the Company
and Company Sub will pay $5,500,000 in cash upon closing; the Company and the
Company Sub will jointly issue at closing a promissory note in the face amount
of $1,530,000, which note will be secured by a senior security interest in the
assets being purchased under the Purchase Agreement; and the Company will issue
at closing $2,700,000 of common shares of the Company, $750,000 of which shares
will be held in escrow as the exclusive source against which the Company may
assert most potential indemnification claims under the Purchase Agreement. The
actual number of common shares to be issued at closing will be determined based
on the average of the closing price of the Company's common shares on the Nasdaq
SmallCap Market for the 20 business days prior to the closing date of the
Purchase Agreement. Pursuant to the terms of the Purchase Agreement, the Company
and ProAct will enter into a registration rights agreement pursuant to which the
Company will grant ProAct "piggy-back" registration rights with respect to the
common shares issued under the Purchase Agreement.

      On December 21, 2004, the Company issued a press release announcing that
it had entered into the Purchase Agreement. The full text of such press release
is attached hereto as Exhibit 99.1 and incorporated herein by reference.
