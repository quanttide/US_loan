<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On December 22, 2004, Arcadia Resources, Inc. (the &ldquo;Company&rdquo;) agreed to
purchase the outstanding common stock of Beacon Respiratory Services, Inc., Beacon Respiratory Services of Alabama, Inc., Beacon
Respiratory Services of Colorado, Inc., and Beacon Respiratory Services of Georgia, Inc.&nbsp; These businesses furnish respiratory
services in Florida, Alabama, Colorado, and Georgia and collectively have revenues of approximately $1.8 million annually.&nbsp; We
also closed the purchase on December 22, 2004, and the transaction is effective January 1, 2005.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">The purchase price is $1.5 million, including the payment of outstanding shareholder
notes.&nbsp; The purchase price is subject to increase by up to an additional $400,000 based on changes in reimbursement rates for
calendar year 2005, with any additional amounts owed being payable to the sellers by January 1, 2006.&nbsp; By January 15, 2005,
$993,726 in cash is payable to Beacon&rsquo;s shareholders, less $150,000 to be held by the Company to offset valid indemnification
and other claims of the Company.&nbsp; The Company&rsquo;s counsel will hold 16.33% of&nbsp; the Beacon shares purchased until the
$150,000 (including accrued interest less any amounts disputed) is paid to sellers by January 1, 2006.&nbsp; During this time, the
Company may vote such shares and shall have all incidents of ownership.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">By January 15, 2004, one of Beacon&rsquo;s selling shareholders will be issued a
promissory note for $151,274, with a one-year term at 8% annual interest.&nbsp; Principal and interest will be payable
quarterly.&nbsp; If the Company defaults on the note, the selling shareholder may require the Company to transfer back the shares
of stock sold by this selling shareholder (i.e., 33% of the Beacon shares purchased by the Company) or elect other remedies.&nbsp;
These shares will be held by the Company&rsquo;s counsel until the note is paid.&nbsp; Until the note is paid, the Company may vote
such shares and shall have all incidents of ownership.</font></p>

Tool, Inc.</b></font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On December 17, 2004, our Grayrose, Inc. subsidiary purchased substantially all of the
assets of BK Tool, Inc., a light industrial staffing business located in Sterling Heights, Michigan, with approximately $2 million
in annual revenues.&nbsp; The purchase price was $175,000 plus 85% of accounts receivables no greater than 60 days
outstanding.&nbsp; At closing, we paid the seller $393,000 in cash, which we financed by drawing on our revolving credit
facility.&nbsp; An additional&nbsp; $75,000 is payable to the seller within 30 days of closing.</font></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><b><i><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">Comerica Bank Credit Agreement</font></i></b></p>

<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On May 7, 2004, our Arcadia Services, Inc. subsidiary and three of its wholly-owned
subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement with Comerica Bank which provides the borrowers with a revolving credit facility with
a credit commitment amount of up to $12 million through May 7, 2006.&nbsp; The credit agreement provides that advances to the
Company will not exceed the lesser of the revolving credit commitment amount or the aggregate principal amount of indebtedness
permitted under the advance formula amount at any one time.&nbsp; The advance formula base is 85% of the eligible accounts
receivable, plus the lesser of 85% of eligible unbilled&nbsp; accounts or $2 million, plus an overformula advance of $1
million payable within one year in 12 monthly installments.&nbsp; Except for the initial advance of $11.5 million which was used to finance a portion of the purchase price of the
acquisition of Arcadia Services, Inc. on May 7, 2004, advances on the credit facility are to be used solely for working capital
purposes.&nbsp; Thereafter, on July 29, 2004, the revolving credit commitment amount was
increased to $14.4 million.&nbsp; Subsequently, additional funds were drawn on
the overformula advance.</font></p>
<p style="text-indent: 60px"><font size="3" face="Times New Roman">On November
23, 2004,
the revolving credit commitment amount was increased to $16
million, and the credit agreement was also amended to provide an overformula
balance of $1.2 million payable at the rate of $100,000 per month for 12
consecutive months, beginning in January, 2005.&nbsp; Further, certain amendments were made to relative to accounts from business originating from state Medicaid plans eligible for
inclusion in the advance formula.&nbsp;</font></p>
