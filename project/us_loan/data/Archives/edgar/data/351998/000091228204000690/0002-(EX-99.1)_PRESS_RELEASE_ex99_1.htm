I/O REVISES FOURTH QUARTER GUIDANCE </FONT></H1>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Redmond, Wash., Dec. 22, 2004
</B>&#150; Data I/O Corporation (NASDAQ: DAIO), the leading provider of manual and
automated device programming systems, today announced it has revised guidance for the
fourth quarter, ending Dec. 31, 2004. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The company now expects fourth
quarter revenue to be between $6.0 million and $6.5 million. During the company&#146;s
third quarter earnings conference call on Oct. 22, 2004, Data I/O said that it expected
fourth quarter results to be in line with its third quarter revenue of $7.8 million. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;Some of our customers are
delaying anticipated fourth quarter shipments until the first quarter of 2005 and in some
cases, they are pushing out orders as well. We believe that these delays are not related
to the overall demand for our products, but reflect the seasonality of our customers&#146;
business,&#148; said Fred Hume, president and CEO. &#147;The vast majority of our revenue
comes from our automated programming equipment, which sells for several hundred thousand
dollars. Changes in the timing of these orders and shipments can impact the financial
results of any given quarter.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&#147;We continue to expect 2005 to
be a very good year for the company, as we benefit from our 2004 and 2005 initiatives
including new product introductions, increased customer penetration, and the establishment
of Data I/O China and Data I/O Brazil,&#148; he said. </FONT></P>
