Item 8.01.                 Other Events.
                           ------------

Description of the Mortgage Pool

                  On or about December 30, 2004, the Registrant will cause the
issuance and sale of approximately $1,515,021,000 initial principal amount of
Collateralized Asset-Backed Bonds, Series 2004-11 (collectively, the "Bonds")
pursuant to an Indenture, dated as of December 30, 2004, between Impac CMB Trust
Series 2004-11, as Issuer, and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as Indenture Trustee. The
Bonds to be designated as the Series 2004-11 Bonds will represent in the
aggregate the entire beneficial ownership interest in a trust estate (the "Trust
Estate") consisting primarily of a pool (the "Mortgage Pool") of conventional,
one- to four-family, first lien and second lien adjustable-rate and fixed-rate
mortgage loans having original terms to maturity up to 30 years (the "Mortgage
Loans").

Computational Materials

         In connection with the sale of the Series 2004-11 Bonds, (collectively,
the "Underwritten Bonds"), the Registrant has been advised by Countrywide
Securities Corporation, Bear, Stearns & Co. Inc. and Merrill Lynch, Pierce,
Fenner & Smith Incorporated (together, the "Underwriters") that the Underwriters
have furnished to prospective investors certain yield tables and other
computational materials (the "Computational Materials") with respect to the
Underwritten Bonds following the effective date of Registration Statement No.
333-117817, which Computational Materials are being filed as exhibits to this
report.

         The Computational Materials have been provided by the Underwriters. The
information in the Computational Materials is preliminary and may be superseded
by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Underwritten Bonds and by any other
information subsequently filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

         The Computational Materials were prepared by the Underwriters at the
request of certain prospective investors, based on assumptions provided by, and
satisfying the special requirements of, such prospective investors. The
Computational Materials may be based on assumptions that differ from the
assumptions set forth in the Prospectus Supplement. The Computational Materials
may not include, and do not purport to include, information based on assumptions
representing a complete set of possible scenarios. Accordingly, the
Computational Materials may not be relevant to or appropriate for investors
other than those specifically requesting them.

         In addition, the actual characteristics and performance of the mortgage
loans underlying the Underwritten Bonds (the "Mortgage Loans") may differ from
the assumptions used in the Computational Materials, which are hypothetical in
nature and which were provided to certain investors only to give a general sense
of how the yield, average life, duration, expected maturity, interest rate
sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of a particular class of Underwritten
Bonds might vary under varying prepayment and other scenarios. Any difference
between such assumptions and the actual characteristics and performance of the
Mortgage Loans will affect the actual yield, average life, duration, expected
maturity, interest rate sensitivity and cash flow characteristics of the
Underwritten Bonds.
