identify forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance and
involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions (&#147;Risk Factors&#148;) that are difficult to predict
with regard to timing, extent, likelihood and degree of occurrence. There are a number of factors,
many of which are beyond the Company&#146;s control, which could cause actual results and outcomes to
differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements. Risk Factors include,
among others: ability to purchase charged-off consumer receivables at appropriate prices, ability
to continue to acquire charged-off receivables in sufficient amounts to operate efficiently and
profitably, employee turnover, ability to compete in the marketplace, acquiring charged-off
receivables in industries that the Company has little or no experience, integration and operations
of newly acquired businesses, and additional factors discussed in the Company&#146;s reports filed with
the Securities and Exchange Commission and exhibits thereto. Other Risk Factors exist, and new Risk
Factors emerge from time to time that may cause actual results to differ materially from those
contained in any forward- looking statements. Given these risks and uncertainties, investors should
not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements as a prediction of actual results.
Furthermore, the Company expressly disclaims any obligation to update, amend or clarify
forward-looking statements.
