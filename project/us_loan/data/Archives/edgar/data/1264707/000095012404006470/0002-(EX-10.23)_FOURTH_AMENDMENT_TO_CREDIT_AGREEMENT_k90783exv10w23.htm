May&nbsp;31, 2007, so long as no Default or Event of Default shall then have occurred and
be continuing, the Borrowers may request (in consultation with the Agent) that the
Aggregate Commitment be increased, provided that, without the prior written consent
of all of the Banks, (i)&nbsp;the Aggregate Commitment shall at no time exceed
$120,000,000; (ii)&nbsp;the Borrowers shall not previously have reduced the Aggregate
Commitment; and (iii)&nbsp;the Borrowers shall not be entitled to make such request more
than once. Such request shall be made in a written notice given to the Agent and
the Banks by the Borrowers not less than twenty (20)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the
proposed effective date of such increase, which notice (a &#147;Commitment Increase
Notice&#148;) shall specify the amount of the proposed increase in the Aggregate
Commitment and the proposed effective date of such increase. In the event of such a
Commitment Increase Notice, each of the Banks shall be given the opportunity to
participate in the requested increase ratably in the proportions that their
respective Commitments bear to the Aggregate Commitment. No Bank shall have any
obligation to increase its Commitment pursuant to a Commitment Increase Notice. On
or prior to the date that is fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Days after receipt of the
Commitment Increase Notice, each Bank shall submit to the Agent a notice indicating
the maximum amount by which it is willing to increase its Commitment in connection
with such Commitment Increase Notice (any such notice to the Agent being herein a
&#147;Bank Increase Notice&#148;). Any Bank which does not submit a Bank Increase Notice to
the Agent prior to the expiration of such fifteen (15)&nbsp;Business Day period shall be
deemed to have denied any increase in its Commitment. In the event that the
aggregate increases of Commitments set forth in the Bank Increase Notices exceeds
the amount requested by the Borrowers in the Commitment Increase Notice, the Agent
shall have the right, in consultation with the Borrowers, to allocate the amount of
increases necessary to meet the Borrowers&#146; Commitment Increase Notice. In the event
that the Bank Increase Notices in the aggregate are less than the amount requested
by the Borrowers, not later than three (3)&nbsp;Business Days prior to the proposed
effective date the Borrowers may notify the Agent of any financial institution that
shall have agreed to become a &#147;Bank&#148; party hereto (a &#147;Proposed New Bank&#148;) in
connection with the Commitment Increase Notice. Any Proposed New Bank shall be
subject to the consent of the Agent (which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld). If the Borrowers shall not have arranged any Proposed New Bank(s) to
commit to the shortfall from the Bank Increase Notices, then the Borrowers shall be
deemed to have reduced the amount of their Commitment Increase Notice to the
aggregate amount set forth in the Bank Increase Notices. Based upon the Bank
Increase Notices, any allocations made in connection therewith and any notice
regarding any Proposed New Bank, if applicable, the Agent shall notify the Borrowers
and the Banks on or before the Business Day immediately prior to the proposed
effective date of the amount of each Bank&#146;s and Proposed New Bank&#146;s Commitment (the
&#147;Effective Commitment Amount&#148;) and the amount of the Aggregate Commitment, which
amount shall be effective on the following Business Day. Any increase in the
Aggregate Commitment shall be subject to the following conditions

Agreement as a Bank and shall have the rights and obligations of a Bank hereunder.
Nothing contained herein shall constitute, or otherwise be deemed to be, a

mean (A)&nbsp;each Bank the Effective Commitment Amount of which is greater than its
Commitment prior to the effective date of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment
and (B)&nbsp;each Proposed New Bank that is allocated an Effective Commitment Amount in
connection with any Commitment Increase Notice, and (ii)&nbsp;the term &#147;Selling Bank(s)&#148;
shall mean each Bank whose Commitment is not being increased from that in effect
prior to such increase in the Aggregate Commitment. Effective on the effective date
of any increase in the Aggregate Commitment pursuant to subparagraph (a)&nbsp;above, each
Selling Bank hereby sells, grants, assigns and conveys to each Buying Bank, without
recourse, warranty, or representation of any kind, except as specifically provided
herein, an undivided percentage in such Selling Bank&#146;s right, title and interest in

percentages necessary so that, from and after such sale, each such Selling Bank&#146;s
Outstanding Credit Exposure shall equal such Selling Bank&#146;s Pro Rata Share
(calculated based upon the Effective Commitment Amounts) of the Aggregate
Outstanding Credit Exposure. Effective on the effective date of the increase in the
Aggregate Commitment pursuant to clause (a)&nbsp;above, each Buying Bank hereby purchases
and accepts such grant, assignment and conveyance from the Selling Banks. Each
Buying Bank hereby agrees that its respective purchase price for the portion of the
Aggregate Outstanding Credit Exposure purchased hereby shall equal the respective
dollar amount necessary so that, from and after such payments, each Buying Bank&#146;s
Outstanding Credit Exposure shall equal such Buying Bank&#146;s Pro Rata Share
(calculated based upon the Effective Commitment Amounts) of the Aggregate
Outstanding Credit Exposure. Such amount shall be payable on the effective date of
the increase in the Aggregate Commitment by wire transfer of immediately available
funds to the Agent. The Agent, in turn, shall wire transfer any such funds received
to the Selling Banks, in same day funds, for the sole account of the Selling Banks.
Each Selling Bank hereby represents and warrants to each Buying Bank that such
Selling Bank owns the Outstanding Credit Exposure being sold and assigned hereby for
its own account and has not sold, transferred or encumbered any or all of its
interest in such Outstanding Credit Exposure, except for participations which will
be extinguished upon payment to Selling Bank of an amount equal to the portion of
the Outstanding Credit Exposure being sold by such Selling Bank. Each Buying Bank

and (ii)&nbsp;the Leverage Ratio is less than or equal to 0.50 to 1.00.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;Level III Status&#148; exists at any date if, as of the last day of the fiscal quarter of AACC
