In order to preserve the favorable tax treatment available to deferrals under the Pre-2005 EDCP due to the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004, the regulations and Internal Revenue guidance issued thereunder (collectively, the &#8220;<u>AJCA</u>&#8221;), the Board froze the Pre-2005 EDCP with respect to amounts earned and vested on and after the Effective Date.  Amounts earned and vested prior to the Effective Date are and will remain subject to the terms of the Pre-2005 EDCP.</font></p></div>
<div style="text-indent:6%"><p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">All amounts earned and vested on and after the Effective Date are subject to the terms of the Plan.  The Plan retains many of the attributes of the Pre-2005 EDCP, but is modified so as to achieve compliance with the requirements of the AJCA.  The Board reserves the right to amend the Plan, either retroactively or prospectively, in whatever respect is required to achieve compliance with the requirements of the AJCA.</font></p></div>
