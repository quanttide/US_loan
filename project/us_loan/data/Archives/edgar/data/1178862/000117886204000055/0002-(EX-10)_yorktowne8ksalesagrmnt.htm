Seller shall cause the Title Insurer to agree to issue to the Purchaser as soon as
practicable after Closing, an updated ALTA Standard Coverage Owner&#146;s Policy of Title
Insurance for the Real Property and Improvements (the &#147;Owner&#146;s Policy&#148;),

notwithstanding the foregoing, at Closing, the Owner&#146;s Policy will except from
coverage only the general exceptions (unless Purchaser obtains coverage over the general
exceptions) and the Permitted Exceptions (as defined in Section 3.3 below). </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Large Indent" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Title Review. Purchaser shall have until the expiration of the Review Period, to give
Seller a detailed notice objecting to any exception or condition contained in the Title
Commitment or shown on the Updated Survey. If Purchaser does not give notice of any
objections to Seller within the Review Period, Purchaser shall be deemed to have approved
the title as shown in the Title Commitment, the title exceptions, and all matters shown on
the Updated Survey. If Purchaser provides timely objections, Seller shall have five (5)
days after receipt of Purchaser&#146;s notice (the &#147;Title Cure Period&#148;) in which
to cure or attempt to cure Purchaser&#146;s objections. Notwithstanding the preceding
sentence, Seller shall be obligated at Closing to cause the Title Insurer to remove (by
waiver or endorsement) (a) any mortgage or deed of trust granted by Seller at the
Property, and (b) Monetary Liens (as hereinafter defined) with respect to the Property
provided that Seller has received written notice of any such Monetary Lien prior to
Closing and the cost to remove any such Monetary Liens does not exceed the sum of $500,000
in the aggregate. Seller may bond around any mechanics&#146; or materialmen&#146;s lien(s)
and abstract(s) of judgment to the Title Company&#146;s reasonable satisfaction in order
to satisfy the foregoing requirement. If Purchaser provides timely objections and all of
Purchaser&#146;s objections are not cured (or agreed to be cured by Seller prior to
Closing) within the Title Cure Period for any reason, then, within five (5) days after the
last day of the Title Cure Period, Purchaser shall, as its sole and exclusive remedy,
waiving all other remedies, either: (a) terminate this Agreement by giving a termination
notice to Seller, at which time Escrowee shall return the Earnest Money to Purchaser and
the parties shall have no further rights, liabilities, or obligations under this Agreement
(other than those that expressly survive termination); or (b) waive the uncured objections
by proceeding to Closing and thereby be deemed to have approved the Purchaser&#146;s title
as shown in the Title Commitment, the title exception documents, and the Updated Survey,
if any. If Seller does not timely receive notice of Purchaser&#146;s election to terminate
under this Section&nbsp;3.3, Purchaser will be deemed to have waived the uncured
objections and to approve the title as shown in the Commitment, the title exception
documents, and the Updated Survey. All exceptions shown on the Original Title Policy, the
Existing Survey, the Title Commitment, the title exception documents, or the Updated
Survey, and any matters which would otherwise be disclosed by an accurate survey or
inspection of the Property, that are not cured within the Title Cure Period shall be the
&#147;Permitted Exceptions&#148;. For the purposes hereof, the term &#147;Monetary
Liens&#148; shall mean mechanics&#146; liens, attachments, judgments, liens to secure the
payment of income taxes of Seller or Seller&#146;s constituents, delinquent property tax
and assessment liens against the Property and any other liens against the Property that
can be removed by the payment of a sum. </FONT></P>

or obligations under this Agreement except those which expressly survive termination, or
(ii) within forty-five (45) days following the Closing Date, Purchaser may seek specific

Seller&#146;s Remedies. If Purchaser fails to perform any of the obligations required to
be performed by Purchaser under the terms of this Agreement, Seller shall have the right
to terminate this Agreement by delivering written notice to Purchaser whereupon the
Earnest Money shall be forfeited to Seller as liquidated damages (which shall be
Seller&#146;s sole and exclusive remedy against Purchaser), it being agreed between the
parties hereto that the actual damages to Seller in such event are impractical to
ascertain and the amount of the Earnest Money is a reasonable estimate thereof and shall
be and constitute valid liquidated damages, at which time this Agreement shall be null and
void and neither party shall have any rights or obligations under this Agreement;
provided, however, if Purchaser is required to but does not deposit with the Escrowee the
Additional Earnest Money as provided for in Section 2.1.1 above, the sum of $300,000.00
shall nonetheless be recoverable by Seller from Purchaser as Earnest Money.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing in this Section 7.2 shall limit any indemnification
obligation of Purchaser under this Agreement. </FONT></P>

Pre-Closing Knowledge. If at any time after the execution of this Agreement, either
Purchaser or Seller becomes aware of any fact which makes a representation and warranty
contained in this Agreement to become untrue in any material respect, said party shall
promptly disclose such fact in writing to the other party hereto. Provided, that the party
making the representation has taken no willful act which is not permitted under this
Agreement to cause the representation to become untrue, said party shall not be in default
under this Agreement and the sole remedy of the other party shall be to either (i)
terminate this Agreement by written notice within five (5) business days of the date on
which the non-breaching party receives written notice from the breaching party
(&#147;Notice Date&#148;), in which event this Agreement, without further action of the
parties, shall become null and void such that neither party shall have any further rights
or obligations under this Agreement except for those rights and obligations which by their
terms expressly survive any such termination, or (ii) elect to proceed to Closing, in
which case such party shall be deemed to have waived its rights with respect to any such
breach of representation or warranty. In the event the non-breaching party fails to
deliver such termination notice to the breaching party on or before the Notice Date, then
the non-breaching party shall conclusively deemed to have elected to proceed under clause
(ii) of the preceding sentence. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
Agreement and without limitation to anything in Section 10.4 below, Purchaser and Seller
are prohibited from making any claims against the other party hereto after the Closing
with respect to any breaches of the other party&#146;s representations and warranties
contained in this Agreement that the claiming party has actual knowledge of prior to the
Closing. Nowithstanding clause (i) above in this Section 7.3, in the event the
representation and warranty in Section 10.1.6 below becomes untrue and Purchaser does not
have the right to terminate this Agreement under Section 5 above, then Purchaser shall not
have the right to terminate the Agreement under this Section 7.3 (however, Purchaser shall
have the rights provided under Section 5 above.). </FONT></P>

Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence and Two Million Dollars ($2,000,000) in the

insured) of not less than One Million Dollars ($1,000,000) per occurrence which shall
cover liability arising in connection with any automobile at the Property (including
owned, hired and non-owned automobiles). No inspection shall be undertaken without
reasonable prior notice to Seller. Seller shall have the right to be present at any or all
inspections. Neither Purchaser nor its agents or representatives shall contact any tenants
without the prior consent of Seller. No inspection shall involve the taking of samples or
other physically invasive procedures without the prior written consent of Seller.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in this Agreement, Purchaser shall
indemnify, defend (with counsel reasonably acceptable to Seller) and hold Seller and its
employees and agents, and each of them, harmless from and against any and all losses,
claims, damages and liabilities (including, without limitation, attorneys&#146; fees
incurred in connection therewith) arising out of Purchaser&#146;s exercise of its rights

Notwithstanding anything in this Agreement to the contrary, Seller does not covenant or
represent that tenants under Leases will not be in default under their respective Leases,
and the existence of any default by any tenant under its Lease shall not affect the
obligations of Purchaser hereunder. To Seller&#146;s knowledge, no leasing commission
shall be due for any period subsequent to the time of Closing. To Seller&#146;s knowledge,
