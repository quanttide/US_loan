                  Agreement, not encompassed by the preceding Section, after
                  prior written notice of such breach and a reasonable
                  opportunity to cure the same.

                  Executive's performance of services to the Company.

<PAGE>

                                   ARTICLE IV
               PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT OF EARLY TERMINATION OF TERM


         4.1 DEATH OR PERMANENT DISABILITY OF THE EXECUTIVE. In the event the
Term terminates as a result of the Executive's death or Permanent Disability, as
described in Sections 3.1 and 3.2, Executive will not be entitled to any Base
Compensation or Bonus Compensation or benefits following the date of the
Executive's death or the one hundredth day of the Executive's Permanent
Disability.

         4.2 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. If the Term is duly terminated by the
Company for Cause, the Company will pay the Executive the Base Compensation and
benefits only through the effective date of termination, and the Executive will:

         a. not be entitled to any other compensation or benefits, except as
expressly required by applicable law;

         b. will forfeit any and all benefits arising or accruing after the
effective date of the termination;

         c. Stock Options which were not exercisable at the time of termination
shall not thereafter be exercisable; and,

         d. Stock Options which were exercisable at the time of termination
shall be exercisable only for the period permitted by the Option Plan.

         4.3 TERMINATION WITHOUT CAUSE. If the Company terminates the Term for
no reason or a reason which is not defined as Cause in Section 4.2, the Company
shall pay the Executive the Base Compensation, Bonus Compensation and benefits
through the end of the Term. Stock Options which were not exercisable at the
time of termination shall immediately become exercisable and shall continue to
be exercisable for the period permitted by the Option Plan. A "Change in
Control" (defined in the Option Plan) which is not approved by the Board or the
Company's discontinuation of business or bankruptcy shall constitute termination
without cause within the meaning of this Section.

         4.4 RESIGNATION BY THE EXECUTIVE. If the Executive terminates the Term
by resigning, the Company shall pay the Executive the Base Compensation and
benefits until the end of the Executive Required Termination Notice Period. The
Executive will not be entitled to any other compensation or benefits following
the end of the Executive Required Termination Notice Period, except as expressly
required by applicable law. The Company reserves the right to relieve the
Executive of the obligation to perform the duties of the Position immediately
upon delivery of the Executive's notice of resignation or at any other time

given a copy of and has reviewed Chapter 325C of Minnesota Statutes, known as
the Minnesota Uniform Trade Secrets Act (the "ACT"), and acknowledges that

representations contained in this Agreement may give rise to a cause of action
in favor of the Company against the Executive for general and special damages,
exemplary damages, injunctive relief and attorney's fees.

         5.7 OTHER BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. During the Term and any renewal term,
the Executive will not, without the express prior written permission of the
Company, engage in any substantial private business activities, whether or not
the same are entered into for profit, outside or separate from the Executive's
employment with the Company that would in any way interfere with the fulfillment
of his obligations hereunder; provided, nothing herunder shall prohibit
Executive from engaging in the following activities in the same manner as

<PAGE>

World Premier; (ii) serving on the Board of Directors of EIG Group; (iii)
provision of consulting services for Nevada Restaurants; or (iv) serving as the
Chair of the Compliance Committee for Alliance Gaming.

         5.8 COVENANT NOT TO COMPETE. During the Term and any renewal term, and
for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration of the Term and any
renewal term or the earlier termination of the Term or renewal term other than
terminations that are not for Cause as defined in Section 4.2, the Executive
shall not, directly or indirectly, engage or participate in or assist, as owner,
part owner, partner, manager, director, officer, trustee, employee, agent,
consultant or in any other capacity, any person, business or other organization
designing, developing, manufacturing, licensing, providing, selling or marketing
any product, process, system or service, then in existence or under development
and which is the same or similar to, competes with, or has a usage allied to, a
product, process, system or service offered by the Company or any of its
affiliates. The foregoing restriction shall apply only where any part of such
activities takes place at, or is managed, supported, or administered from a
place of business located within a market in which the Company maintains an
office or actively promotes and markets its products, processes, systems or
services, directly or indirectly, including, without limitation, the United
States, Canada and Mexico. The Executive expressly agrees that the time period
and the described scope of this Section are the reasonable and necessary time
and scope needed to protect the legitimate business interests of the Company.

         5.9 COVENANT NOT TO RECRUIT. During the Term and any renewal term, and
for a period of twelve (12) months after the expiration of the Term and any
renewal term or the earlier termination of the Term or any renewal term other
than terminations that are not for Cause as defined in Section 4.2, the
Executive shall not, directly or indirectly, hire, attempt to hire, solicit,
recruit, employ or retain the services of any individual, in any capacity,
whether as an employee, independent contractor, consultant, agent or otherwise,
of the Company or any customers or prospective customer of the Company,
affiliates of the Company, or any individual providing services to the Company,
whether as an employee, independent contractor, consultant or agent, as of the
date hereof or at any time hereafter, without prior written approval of the
Company.

         5.10 REMEDIES. The Executive agrees that all of the provisions
contained in Article V are necessary to protect the legitimate business
interests of the Company, and to prevent the unauthorized dissemination and use
of Confidential Information and Innovations to and by competitors of the
Company. The Executive also agrees that the Company will be irreparably harmed,
and that damages alone cannot adequately compensate the Company if there is a
violation or breach by the Executive of Article V, and that injunctive relief is
essential for the protection of the Company. The Executive therefore agrees that
the Company shall have the right, in addition to any other rights and remedies
existing in its favor, to enforce its rights and the obligations under Article V
not only by an action or actions for damages, but also by an action or actions
for specific performance, injunction and/or other equitable relief without
posting any bond or security to enforce or prevent any violations, whether
anticipatory, continuing or future, of the provisions of this Article,
including, without limitation, the extension of the periods hereunder by a
period equal to (i) the length of the violation of Sections 5.7, 5.8, and/or 5.9
plus (ii) the length of any court proceedings necessary to stop such violation.

         5.11 PUBLIC POLICY. It is the desire and intent of the Company and the
Executive that the provisions contained in Article V be enforced to the fullest
extent permissible under the laws

<PAGE>



and public policy applied in each jurisdiction in which enforcement is sought.
Accordingly, if, at the time of enforcement of Article V, a court shall hold
that the duration, scope or area restrictions stated in this Agreement are
unreasonable under circumstances then existing, the parties agree that the
maximum duration, scope or area reasonable under such circumstances shall be
substituted for the stated duration, scope or area.

         5.12 INDEPENDENT COVENANTS; SURVIVAL OF COVENANTS. The covenants on the
part of the Executive contained in Article V shall be construed as an agreement
independent of any other provisions of this Agreement, and it is agreed that
relief for any claim or cause of action of the Executive against the Company,
whether predicated on this Agreement or otherwise, shall be measured in damages,
and shall not constitute a defense to enforcement by the Company of those
covenants. The provisions contained in Article V, together with the other
covenants, agreements, and obligations of the Executive set forth elsewhere in
this Agreement, shall, in all events, survive the expiration of the Term and any
renewal term or the earlier termination of the Term.

                                   ARTICLE VI
                           EXECUTIVE'S REPRESENTATIONS

         6. EXECUTIVE'S REPRESENTATIONS. As a material inducement to the Company

         state a material fact necessary in order to make the statements
         contained therein or in this Agreement not misleading.

         b. The execution, delivery and performance by the Executive of this
         Agreement will not violate any provision of any indenture, agreement or
         other instrument to which the Executive is a party or is bound, or be
         in conflict with, result in a breach of or constitute a default under
         any such indenture, agreement or other instrument.

                                   ARTICLE VII
                                  MISCELLANEOUS

modified, waived or discharged unless such modification, waiver or discharge is
agreed to in writing signed by the Executive and the Company.

         7.4 WAIVER. No waiver by either party at any time of any breach of or
noncompliance with any condition or provision of this Agreement to be performed
by the other party shall be deemed a waiver of similar or dissimilar provisions
or conditions at the same or any prior or subsequent time. No failure on the
part of the Company to exercise, and no delay in exercising, any right hereunder
shall operate as a waiver thereof, nor shall any single or partial exercise of
any right hereunder by the Company preclude any other or further exercise
thereof or the exercise of any other right.

         7.5 SEVERABILITY. If any part, term or provision of this Agreement is
held unenforceable in the jurisdiction in which either party seeks enforcement
of the Agreement, this Agreement shall be construed as if not containing the
invalid provision or provisions. Invalidity or unenforceability of any portion
or provision of this Agreement shall not affect the validity or enforceability
