<P ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><BR>
<B>3.&#9;Term</B>. The term of the Lease for the Units is for an "Interim Term" (if any) beginning on the Acceptance Date, and continuing through and including the day preceding the Base Date; and for a "Base Term" of Eighty Four (84) months, beginning on the first to occur of the 5th day of the calendar month during or following the Acceptance Date (the "Base Date").</P>

<B>5.&#9;Stipulated Loss Value.</B> After Lessor's receipt of notice of the occurrence of any Total Loss or other relevant event relating to any Unit, Lessor shall calculate the Stipulated Loss Value for such Unit and give Lessee notice thereof. Such "Stipulated Loss Value", as of any particular date, shall be the product obtained by multiplying the Lessor's Cost for the Unit in question by the percentage, as set forth in the "Schedule of Stipulated Loss Values" attached as <U>Annex I</U>, specified opposite the rent installment number (or date) becoming due immediately after the date Lessee gives or is required to give Lessor notice requiring payment of the Stipulated Loss Value. If only a portion of the Units is affected by any event causing calculation of Stipulated Loss Value, and the cost of such portion cannot be readily determined from the Lessor's Cost set forth above, then the Lessor's Cost for such portion shall be as reasonably calculated by Lessor, and notified to Lessee.</P>
