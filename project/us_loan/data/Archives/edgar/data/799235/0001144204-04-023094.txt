ITEM 1.01. ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.

      On December 21, 2004, Environmental Remediation Holding Corporation
("ERHC") finalized a restructure of ERHC's current debt (the "Restructure").
Pursuant to the Restructure, ERHC entered into a Letter Agreement, dated
November 29, 2004, with Chrome Energy, LLC, an affiliated entity ("Chrome") to
restructure all of ERHC's current debt with Chrome (the "Letter Agreement").
Prior to the Restructure, ERHC had six (6) outstanding notes in favor of Chrome:
(i) Senior Secured 10.00% Exchangeable Promissory Note Due February 15, 2005,
with a principal amount as of November 18, 2004 of $4,299,460.92; (ii) Senior
Secured 10.00% Exchangeable Promissory Note, dated as of February 15, 2001, with
a principal amount of $1,800,000; (iii) Senior Secured 8.00% Exchangeable
Promissory Note, dated February 15, 2001, with a principal amount of $2,000,000;
(iv) Amended and Restated Convertible Note, dated as of January 31, 2001, with a
principal amount of $804,312.50; (v) Amended and Restated Convertible Note,
dated as of January 31, 2001, with a principal amount of $6331.666.67; and (vi)
Note, dated as of February 15, 2001, with a principal amount of $403,643.85
(collectively, the "Old Notes").

      Pursuant to the Restructure, the Old Notes were cancelled in full in
exchange for a new 12% note, dated as of December 15, 2004, with an original
principal amount of $10,134,084, convertible at the sole discretion of ERHC at
$0.175 per share, and expiring on January 31, 2007 (the "Exchange Note"). The
entire original principal of the note is due on January 31, 2007, with annual
interest payments due on January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2007. Interest
payments are convertible at ERHC's discretion at $0.175 per share.

      In addition to the Exchange Note, ERHC entered into a new 10% working
capital loan, dated as of December 15, 2004, in favor of Chrome for up to
$2,500,000 (the "Working Capital Loan"). The Working Capital Loan is convertible
into shares of ERHC common stock, at the sole discretion of ERHC, at $0.175 per
share and expires on January 31, 2007. The entire original principal of the
Working Capital Loan is due on January 31, 2007, with annual interest payments
due on January 31, 2006 and January 31, 2007. Interest payments are convertible
at ERHC's discretion at $0.175 per share. Pursuant to the Working Capital Loan
Chrome is required to make funds available to Chrome pursuant to a schedule
attached thereto. On December 21, 2004, ERHC received the first $1,000,000
advance from the Working Capital Loan.

      Prior to the Restructure, ERHC had outstanding notes totaling
$1,626,033.86 with nonaffiliated note holders. As part of the Restructure, ERHC
has received agreements from the nonaffiliated note holders of $1,592,520.84 to
convert their respective principal and interest into shares of common stock at
$.20 per share, thereby reducing ERHC outstanding note obligation to
nonaffiliated note holders to $33,513.02.

      A copy of the Letter Agreement is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.1 and is
incorporated herein in its entirety by reference into this Item 1.01. A copy of
the Exchange Note is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.2 and is incorporated herein
in its entirety by reference into this Item 1.01. A copy of the Working Capital
Note is attached hereto as Exhibit 10.3 and is incorporated herein in its
entirety by reference into this Item 1.01.

ITEM 3.02.

      The Restructure is discussed in greater detail in Item 1.01 of this Form
8-k. Pursuant to the Restructure, on December 21, 2004, ERHC authorized the
issuance of a total of 25,397,022 shares of ERHC common stock to Chrome. ERHC
issued 12,308,560 shares to Chrome in consideration for the accrued but unpaid
interest on the Old Notes of $2,461,711.84. The accrued but unpaid interest was
converted to common stock at $0.20 per share which was equivalent to the
conversion price for all the Old Notes, except one unconvertible note with an
original principal balance of $403,643.85. ERHC issued 12,465,202 shares to
Chrome as consideration for canceling the Old Notes and entering into the
Exchange Note. Lastly, ERHC has authorized the issuance of 623,260 shares to
Chrome for its pro rata potion of the 1,558,150 shares allocated as
consideration for entering into the New Working Capital Loan, the remaining
shares will be issued pro rata as Chrome makes future advances.

      The information furnished in this Form 8-k shall not be deemed "filed" for
purposes of Section 18 of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, or
otherwise subject to the liabilities of that section, nor shall such information

1933, as amended, except as shall be expressly set forth by specific reference

      EXHIBIT 10.1 LETTER AGREEMENT WITH CHROME (WITHOUT EXHIBITS THERETO).

                                November 29, 2004

Chrome Energy LLC

      RE:   Restructure of Current Environmental Remediation Holding Corporation
            Debt and Additional Loan for Working Capital in the amount of
            $2,500,000.

Dear Sir Emeka Offor:

      This Letter Agreement is entered into between, Environmental Remediation
Holding Corporation ("ERHC") and Chrome Energy LLC ("Chrome"), whereby Chrome
agrees to cancel all existing notes between ERHC and Chrome and execute the two
enclosed notes marked EXHIBIT A and EXHIBIT B. The note marked as EXHIBIT A,
reflects your agreement to consolidate and restructure all current notes between
ERHC and Chrome (the "Restructure"). The note marked EXHIBIT B, reflects your
agreement to fund an additional $2,500,000, which is the working capital
requirement of ERHC ("New Financing"). In consideration for agreeing to the
Restructure and New Financing, ERHC has agreed to issue Chrome additional shares
of ERHC common stock (the "Additional Shares.").

      As discussed more thoroughly in the report by G.A. Herrera & Co., dated
July 15, 2004, attached hereto as EXHIBIT C (the "Herrera Report"), the Board of
Directors of ERHC has determined that it is in the best interest of ERHC for
Chrome to participate in the Restructure and New Financing. ERHC is requesting
that all current note holders restructure or convert their respective notes.
ERHC is also requesting that all note holders participate pro rata in the New
Financing. However, ERHC believes that many, if not all, of the current note
holders will not participate in the New Financing. Due to the perceived lack of
participation from the other current note holders and because Chrome is the
majority note holder, ERHC requests that Chrome initially fund the entire
$2,500,000 needed. In the event that another note holders funds their respective
pro rata share of the New Financing, such amount will be returned to Chrome
immediately.

      The following is a brief discussion of the terms of the Restructure, New
Financing and Additional Shares*:

RESTURCTURE:

      Currently, ERHC has six notes outstanding in favor of Chrome
(collectively, "Old Notes"):

      1.    Senior Secured 10.00% exchangeable Promissory Note Due February 15,
            2005, with an estimated principle amount, as of November 18, 2004,
            of $4,294,460.92.

      2.    Senior Secured 10.00% Exchangeable Promissory Note, dated as of
            February 15, 2001, with a principle amount of $1,800,000.

      3.    Senior Secured 8.00% Exchangeable Promissory Note, dated as of
            February 15, 2001, with a principle amount of $2,200,000.

      4.    Amended and Restated Convertible Note, dated as of January 31, 2001,
            with a principle amount of $804.312.50.

      5.    Amended and Restated Convertible Note, dated as of January 31, 2001,
            with a principle amount of $631,666.67.

      6.    Note, dated as of February 15, 2001, with a principle amount of
            $403,643.85.

      Upon cancellation of the Old Notes, ERHC has agreed to consolidate all the
Old Notes into one note on the following terms:

      1.    Principle amount of $10,134,084 (equals the total amount of
            principle on the Old Notes);

      2.    A maturity date of January 31, 2007;

      3.    ERHC has the right to convert the debt into shares of ERHC common
            stock at $0.175 per share (5 of the 6 old notes were convertible by
            Chrome at $0.20 per share);

      4.    ERHC has the right to pre-pay the note for the face amount plus
            accrued interest without pre-payment penalty;

      5.    Chrome is not entitled to convert the debt; and

      6.    Annual interest payments at 12% per annum (the interest rates on the
            Old Notes varied from 20% to 5.5%).

      Additionally, Chrome will receive an interest payment for the entire
amount of accrued and unpaid interest, as of December 15, 2004, on the Old Notes
($2,461,711.84) converted into shares of ERHC common stock at $0.20 per share,
or 12,966,686 shares of ERHC common stock.

NEW FINANCING:

      By December 15, 2004, Chrome will fund ERHC $2,500,000 needed for working
capital. The terms of the New Financing are as follows:

      1.    Principle amount of $2,500,000 (which will be refunded by an amount
            equal to the other note holders participation in the New Financing);

      2.    A maturity date of January 31, 2007;

      3.    ERHC has the right to convert the debt into shares of ERHC common
            stock at $0.175 per share;

      4.    A default under this Note by Chrome, will result in the conversion
            price automatically increasing to $0.20 per share;

      5.    ERHC has the right to pre-pay the note for the face amount plus
            accrued interest without pre-payment penalty;

      6.    Chrome is not entitled to convert the debt; and 7. Annual interest
            payments at 10% per annum.

ADDITIONAL SHARES:

      In consideration for agreeing to the Restructure and New Financing, ERHC
has agreed to issue Chrome a total of 14,023,352 Additional Shares of ERHC
common stock, which is equal to the current value of the Restructure converted
into shares of ERHC common stock at $0.40 per share. ERHC will issue Chrome
12,465,202 Additional Shares when the two new notes are executed, which is equal
to the current value of the Restructure converted into share of ERHC common
stock at $0.45 per share. If for any reason, Chrome defaults under the New
Financing note (as defined in the New Financing note), then the remaining
1,558,150 Additional Shares will be forfeited. ERHC will issue the remaining
1,558,150 shares upon the termination of the New Financing note (as determined
by the terms of the New Financing note), if and only if, Chrome does not default
under the New Financing (as defined in the New Financing note). Prior to
issuance, the remaining 1,558,150 Additional Shares shall be proportionately
adjusted to the then outstanding common stock of ERHC for any stock splits or
combinations, reclassification, exchanges, reorganizations, merger, or
consolidations.

Letter Agreement ERHC/CELL

      * The details of the Restructure, New Financing and Additional Shares
differ from the Herrera report in the following manners:

      1.    The Herrera Report contemplated the new loans maturing on September
            30, 2006. However, due to the postponement in finalizing the
            documentation, the maturity date will be January 31, 2007.
            Therefore, the interest due on such notes has increased.

      2.    The Herrera Report contemplated the old notes expiring on September
            30, 2004, instead of December 15, 2004. Therefore, the interest due
            on such notes has increased.

      3.    The Herrera Report does not consolidate the Old Notes into one note
            with a 12% interest rate. Therefore, the interest due on the new
            note is different. Chrome will receive 2,959,761 more shares with a
            consolidated note at 12%, than with notes with varying percentages.

      4.    The Herrera Report contemplated the Senior Secured 10.00%
            exchangeable Promissory Note Due February 15, 2005 would continue to
            be utilized for future draws up to the $5,000,000 ceiling in the
            note. This change has decreased the total amount of principle and
            interest owed to Chrome.

      After review of the enclosed notes, please execute the notes attached
hereto as EXHIBIT A and EXHIBIT B, and forward such executed notes with the
cancelled originals of the Old Notes to ERHC, by no later than December 3, 2004.
Upon receipt of the new notes and cancelled original notes, ERHC will forward
you the shares representing accrued interest through December 15, 2004 and the
Additional Shares.

      This Letter Agreement shall be construed according to the laws of the
State of Texas. This Letter Agreement shall be binding upon Chrome and ERHC and
shall inure to the benefit of Chrome and ERHC's successors and assigns.

                                         Very truly yours,

                                         ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION HOLDING CORP.

      of such  issuance  or, in the event  such a record  date  shall  have been

      appropriate  revision to the Conversion  Price shall be made and provision
      shall be made (by  adjustments  of the  Conversion  Price or otherwise) so
      that the Holder shall receive upon conversions thereof, in addition to the
      number of  shares  of  Common  Stock  receivable  thereon,  the  number of
      securities  of the Company  which they would have  received  had this Note
      been  converted  into  Common  Stock  on the  date of such  event  and had
      thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including
      the  Conversion  Date,   retained  such  securities   (together  with  any
      distributions  payable thereon during such period),  giving application to
      all  adjustments  called for during such period under this Section 4(c)(i)
      with respect to the rights of the holders of the Note.
<PAGE>

            (iv) Adjustments for Reclassification,  Exchange or Substitution. If
      the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note at any time or from
      time to time after the  Issuance  Date shall be changed into the same or a
      different  number of shares of any class or classes  of stock,  whether by

      of a stock split or combination of shares or stock dividends  provided for
      in  Sections  4(c)(i),  (ii)  and  (iii),  or  a  reorganization,  merger,

      and in each event, an appropriate  revision to the Conversion  Price shall
      by made and  provisions  shall be made (by  adjustments  of the Conversion
      Price of otherwise) so that the Holder shall have the right  thereafter to
      convert  such Note  into the kind and  amount of shares of stock and other
      securities receivable upon such reclassification,  exchange,  substitution
      or other  change,  by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into
      which  such Note  might  have  been  converted  immediately  prior to such
      reclassification,  exchange,  substitution or other change, all subject to
      further adjustment as provided herein.

            (v) Adjustments for Reorganization,  Merger,  Consolidation or Sales
      of Assets.  If at anytime  or from time to time  after the  Issuance  Date
      there shall be a capital  reorganization of the Company (other than by way
      of  a  stock  split  or  combination  of  shares  or  stock  dividends  or
      distributions  provided  for in  Section  4(c)(i),  (ii) and  (iii),  or a
      reclassification,  exchange  or  substitution  of shares  provided  for in
      Section 4(c) (iv)),  or a merger or  consolidation  of the Company with or
      into another  corporation,  or the sale of all or substantially all of the
      Company's properties or assets to any other person, then as a part of such
      reorganization,  merger,  consolidation,  or sale,  then, and in each such
      case,  proper  provision  shall be made so that, upon the exercise of this
      Note at any time after the  consummation of such  reorganization,  merger,
      consolidation,  or sale,  the Holder  shall be entitled to receive (at the
      Conversion Price in effect for Common Stock issuable upon such exercise of
      this Note immediately prior to such consummation), in lieu of Common Stock
      issuable upon such exercise of this Note prior to such  consummation,  the
      stock and other  securities,  cash and assets to which such  Holder  would
      have been entitled upon such  consummation if this Note had been exercised
      immediately prior thereto.

readjustment  of the  Conversion  Price or number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock
issuable upon  conversion of the Note pursuant to this Section 4, the Company at

accordance with the terms hereof and furnish notice to the Holder, a certificate
setting forth such adjustment and readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall,  upon written
request of the Holder,  at any time,  furnish or cause to be  furnished  to such
holder a like certificate setting forth such adjustments and readjustments,  the
applicable  Conversion  Price in effect at the time and the  number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount,  if any, of other  securities or property  which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of such Note. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  the Company shall not be obligated to deliver a  certificate  unless
such  certificate  would reflect an increase or decrease of at least one percent
(1%) of such adjusted amount.

(e) Issue  Taxes.  The  Company  shall  pay any and all  issue and other  taxes,
excluding  federal,  state or local income taxes, that may be payable in respect
of any issue or delivery of shares of Common  Stock on  conversion  of this Note
pursuant hereto;  provided,  however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
pay any transfer taxes  resulting  from any transfer  requested by any holder in
connection with any such conversion.

the applicable Conversion Date.

effected on the applicable  Conversion  Date. The Holder shall be deemed to have
become a shareholder of record of the Common Stock on the applicable  Conversion
Date.  Upon  conversion of only a portion of this Note,  the Company shall issue
and deliver to such holder,  at the expense of the Company,  against  receipt of
the original Note delivered for partial  cancellation,  a new Note  representing

the portion converted.

purposes  and not with a view to the resale or  distribution  of all or any part
thereof. The Holder acknowledges that the Note has not been registered under the

            at maturity or by acceleration or otherwise; or

      (b)   The Company  shall default if the payment of interest on the Note is

            or shall have an order for relief under the United States Bankruptcy
            Code granted  against it or them, or shall be adjudicated a bankrupt
            or  insolvent,  or shall file any  petition  or answer  seeking  for

            admitting or not contesting  the material  allegations of a petition
            filed against the Company in any such  proceeding,  or shall seek or
            consent  to  or  acquiesce  in  the   appointment  of  any  trustee,

            substantial part of the properties of the Company, or the Company or
            its directors  shall take any action  looking to the  dissolution or
            liquidation of the Company; or

      (d)   If, within sixty (60) days after the  commencement of any proceeding
            against  the  Company  seeking  any   reorganization,   arrangement,
            composition,  readjustment,   liquidation,  dissolution  or  similar
            relief under any present or future statute, law or regulation,  such
            proceeding  shall not have been dismissed,  or if, within sixty (60)
            days after the  appointment,  without the consent or acquiescence of
            the Company,  of any trustee,  receiver or liquidator of the Company
            or of all or any substantial  part of the properties of the Company,
            such appointment shall not have been vacated.

entire  unpaid  balance of  principal  and accrued  interest on this Note may be
accelerated and declared to be immediately due and payable by the holder. Unless
waived by the written consent of the holder,  such holder may proceed to protect
and enforce its rights by an action at law, suit in equity or other  appropriate
proceeding,  whether for the specific  performance  of any  agreement  contained
herein, or for an injunction  against a violation of any of the terms hereof, or
in aid of the  exercise  of  any  power  granted  hereby  or by  law.  Upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default,  the Company agrees to pay to the Holder such
further  amount  as  shall be  sufficient  to cover  the  cost  and  expense  of
collection,  including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and
expenses.  No  course  of  dealing  and no delay on the  part of the  Holder  in
exercising  any right,  power or remedy  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights,  powers and remedies.  No right, power
or remedy  conferred  hereby  upon the Holder  shall be  exclusive  of any other
right, power or remedy referred to herein nor now or hereafter available at law,
in equity, by statute or otherwise.

3.    CONVERSION.

The  Company  shall  have  the  following  conversion  rights  (the  "Conversion
Rights"):

(a)  Conversion.  At any time or from  time to time,  the  Company  may elect to

accrued but unpaid interest, into shares of common stock of the Company ("Common
Stock"), by written notice given to the Holder in accordance with the provisions
of Section 3(f) hereof (the "Conversion Notice").  The "Conversation Date" shall
be the date the Conversion  Notice is provided  pursuant to Section 3(f) hereof.
The  Holder  shall  deliver to the  Company  this Note by no later than five (5)
business days after the date on which the Conversion  Notice is delivered by the
Company as contemplated in this paragraph. New certificates will be delivered to
the  Holder,  within  five (5)  business  days after  receipt of the Note by the
Company.

(b)  Conversion  Price.  Subject to adjustment  from time to time as provided in
Section 3(c) below, the term  "Conversion  Price" shall mean $0.175 per share of
Common Stock.

(c) Adjustments of Conversion Price. The Conversion Price in effect from time to
time shall be,  subject to adjustment in accordance  with the provisions of this
Section 3(c).

            (i)  Adjustments for Holder's  default  pursuant to Section 6(b). If

            (i)  Adjustments for Stock Splits and  Combinations.  If the Company
      shall at any time or from time to time after the Issuance  Date,  effect a
      stock split of the  outstanding  Common  Stock,  the  Conversion  Price in
      effect  immediately  prior to the  stock  split  shall be  proportionately
      decreased. If the Company shall at any time or from time to time after the
      Issuance  Date,  combine  the  outstanding  shares  of Common  Stock,  the
      Conversion Price in effect  immediately  prior to the combination shall be
      proportionately  increased.  Any  adjustments  under this Section 3(c) (i)
      shall be effective at the close of business on the date the stock split or
      combination occurs.
<PAGE>

            (ii)  Adjustments for Certain  Dividends and  Distributions.  If the
      Company  shall at anytime or from time after the  Issuance  Date,  make or
      issue or set a record  date for the  determination  of  holders  of Common
      Stock  entitled  to receive a dividend  or other  distribution  payable in
      shares of Common Stock,  then, and in each event,  the Conversion Price in
      effect  immediately  prior to such event shall be decreased as of the time
      of such  issuance  or, in the event  such a record  date  shall  have been
      fixed, as of the close of business on such record date, by multiplying the
      Conversion Price then in effect by a fraction;

                  (A) the numerator of which shall be the total number of shares
            of Common Stock issued and outstanding immediately prior to the time
            of such issuance or the close of business on such record date; and

                  (B) the  denominator  of which  shall be the  total  number of
            shares of Common Stock issued and outstanding  immediately  prior to
            the time of such  issuance  or the close of  business on such record
            date plus the number of shares of Common  Stock  issuable in payment
            of such dividend or distribution.

            (iii)  Adjustments  for Other  Dividends and  Distributions.  If the
      Company  shall at any time or from time to time after the  Issuance  Date,
      make or issue or set a record  date for the  determination  of  holders of
      Common Stock entitled to receive a dividend or other distribution  payable
      in other  than  shares  of  Common  Stock,  then,  and in each  event,  an
      appropriate  revision to the Conversion  Price shall be made and provision
      shall be made (by  adjustments  of the  Conversion  Price or otherwise) so
      that the Holder shall receive upon conversions thereof, in addition to the
      number of  shares  of  Common  Stock  receivable  thereon,  the  number of
      securities  of the Company  which they would have  received  had this Note
      been  converted  into  Common  Stock  on the  date of such  event  and had
      thereafter, during the period from the date of such event to and including
      the  Conversion  Date,   retained  such  securities   (together  with  any
      distributions  payable thereon during such period),  giving application to
      all  adjustments  called for during such period under this Section 3(c)(i)
      with respect to the rights of the holders of the Note.

            (iv) Adjustments for Reclassification,  Exchange or Substitution. If
      the Common Stock issuable upon conversion of this Note at any time or from
      time to time after the  Issuance  Date shall be changed into the same or a
      different  number of shares of any class or classes  of stock,  whether by
      reclassification,  exchange,  substitution or otherwise (other than by way
      of a stock split or combination of shares or stock dividends  provided for
      in  Sections  3(c)(i),  (ii)  and  (iii),  or  a  reorganization,  merger,
      consolidation,  or sale of assets provided for in Section 3(c)(v)),  then,
      and in each event, an appropriate  revision to the Conversion  Price shall
      by made and  provisions  shall be made (by  adjustments  of the Conversion
      Price of otherwise) so that the Holder shall have the right  thereafter to
      convert  such Note  into the kind and  amount of shares of stock and other
      securities receivable upon such reclassification,  exchange,  substitution
      or other  change,  by holders of the number of shares of Common Stock into
      which  such Note  might  have  been  converted  immediately  prior to such
      reclassification,  exchange,  substitution or other change, all subject to
      further adjustment as provided herein.
<PAGE>

            (v) Adjustments for Reorganization,  Merger,  Consolidation or Sales
      of Assets.  If at anytime  or from time to time  after the  Issuance  Date
      there shall be a capital  reorganization of the Company (other than by way
      of  a  stock  split  or  combination  of  shares  or  stock  dividends  or
      distributions  provided  for in  Section  3(c)(i),  (ii) and  (iii),  or a
      reclassification,  exchange  or  substitution  of shares  provided  for in
      Section 3(c) (iv)),  or a merger or  consolidation  of the Company with or
      into another  corporation,  or the sale of all or substantially all of the
      Company's properties or assets to any other person, then as a part of such
      reorganization,  merger,  consolidation,  or sale,  then, and in each such
      case,  proper  provision  shall be made so that, upon the exercise of this
      Note at any time after the  consummation of such  reorganization,  merger,
      consolidation,  or sale,  the Holder  shall be entitled to receive (at the
      Conversion Price in effect for Common Stock issuable upon such exercise of
      this Note immediately prior to such consummation), in lieu of Common Stock
      issuable upon such exercise of this Note prior to such  consummation,  the
      stock and other  securities,  cash and assets to which such  Holder  would
      have been entitled upon such  consummation if this Note had been exercised
      immediately prior thereto.

(d)  Certificate  as to  Adjustments.  Upon  occurrence  of each  adjustment  or
readjustment  of the  Conversion  Price or number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock
issuable upon  conversion of the Note pursuant to this Section 3, the Company at
its  expense,  shall  promptly  compute:  such  adjustment  or  readjustment  in
accordance with the terms hereof and furnish notice to the Holder, a certificate
setting forth such adjustment and readjustment, showing in detail the facts upon
which such adjustment or readjustment is based. The Company shall,  upon written
request of the Holder,  at any time,  furnish or cause to be  furnished  to such
holder a like certificate setting forth such adjustments and readjustments,  the
applicable  Conversion  Price in effect at the time and the  number of shares of
Common Stock and the amount,  if any, of other  securities or property  which at
the time would be received upon the conversion of such Note. Notwithstanding the
foregoing,  the Company shall not be obligated to deliver a  certificate  unless
such  certificate  would reflect an increase or decrease of at least one percent
(1%) of such adjusted amount.

(e) Issue  Taxes.  The  Company  shall  pay any and all  issue and other  taxes,
excluding  federal,  state or local income taxes, that may be payable in respect
of any issue or delivery of shares of Common  Stock on  conversion  of this Note
pursuant hereto;  provided,  however, that the Company shall not be obligated to
pay any transfer taxes  resulting  from any transfer  requested by any holder in
connection with any such conversion.

hereunder shall be in writing and shall be deemed given (i) on the same date, if

conversion  of the Note.  In lieu of any  fractional  shares to which the holder
would otherwise be entitled,  the Company shall pay cash equal to the product of
such fraction multiplied by the Conversion Price of one share of Common Stock on
the applicable Conversion Date.

(h)  Retirement  of Note.  Conversion  of this Note shall be deemed to have been
effected on the applicable  Conversion  Date. The Holder shall be deemed to have
become a shareholder of record of the Common Stock on the applicable  Conversion
Date.  Upon  conversion of only a portion of this Note,  the Company shall issue
and deliver to such holder,  at the expense of the Company,  against  receipt of
the original Note delivered for partial  cancellation,  a new Note  representing

4.    HOLDER REPRESENTATIONS.

(a)  Investment  Purposes.  The  Holder  is  acquiring  the Note for  investment
purposes  and not with a view to the resale or  distribution  of all or any part
thereof. The Holder acknowledges that the Note has not been registered under the
Securities  Act,  or the  securities  or "blue  sky"  laws of any state or other
domestic or foreign  jurisdiction  and that none of such securities may be sold,
transferred   or  otherwise   disposed  of  except   pursuant  to  an  effective
registration statement thereunder or an applicable exemption therefrom.

(b)  Accredited  Investor.  The Holder (i) has such  knowledge and experience in
financial  and business  matters that such Holder is capable of  evaluating  the
merits  and  risks of his or her  investment  in the Note and has the  financial
ability to assume the monetary risk associated  therewith;  (ii) is able to bear
the  complete  loss of his or her  investment  in the Note;  has  received  such
documents and information  from the Company as such Holder has requested and has
had the opportunity to ask questions of and receive answers from the Company and
the terms and  conditions of the offering of the notes and to obtain  additional
information;  (iv) is an  "accredited  investor"  as defined  in Rule  501(a) of
Regulation D promulgated  under the Securities  Act; and (v) is not relying upon
any  statements  or  instruments  made or issued by any  person  other  than the
Company in making a decision to invest in the Note.

(c) Restrictive Legends. Any certificate for Common Stock issued upon conversion
of the Note  and each  certificate  for  Common  Stock  issued  to a  subsequent
transferee   shall  be  stamped  or  otherwise   imprinted   with  a  legend  in
substantially the following form:

      "The securities  represented by this  certificate have not been registered
      under the  Securities  Act of 1933, as amended  ("Securities  Act") or any
      state securities act. The securities have been acquired for investment and
      may not be sold,  transferred,  pledged  or  hypothecated  unless (i) they
      shall have been  registered  under the  Securities  Act and any applicable
      state  securities act, or (ii) the  corporation  shall have been furnished
      with an opinion of counsel,  satisfactory to counsel for the  corporation,

with  another  corporation  or  other  entity  or a sale or  transfer  of all or
substantially all of the assets of the Company to another person  (collectively,
a  "Sale"),  the  Company  will  require,  in  the  agreements  reflecting  such
transaction,  that the surviving  entity expressly assume the obligations of the
Company hereunder.  Notwithstanding the foregoing,  if the Company enters into a
Sale and the  holders  of the  Common  Stock  are  entitled  to  receive  stock,
securities or property in respect of or in exchange for Common Stock,  then as a
condition  of such  Sale,  the  Company  and any such  successor,  purchaser  or
transferee will agree that the Note may thereafter be converted on the terms and
subject  to the  conditions  set forth  above into the kind and amount of stock,
securities  or property  receivable  upon such  merger,  consolidation,  sale or
transfer  by a holder of the  number of shares of Common  Stock  into which this

(a) Company Events of Default. The Holder must provide the Company with ten (10)

Company  shall  have ten (10) days to cure such  default  ("Cure  Period").  The
continuance of any one or more of the following  events after the Cure Period is
herein referred to as an Event of Default:

            (i) The Company  shall  default if the payment of  principal  of the
      Note is not paid when and as the same shall become due and payable, either
      at maturity or by acceleration or otherwise; or

            (iii) If the  Company  shall make an  assignment  for the benefit of
      creditors,  or shall  admit in writing its  inability  to pay its debts as
      they become due, or shall file a voluntary petition in bankruptcy or shall
      have an order for relief under the United States  Bankruptcy  Code granted
      against it or them, or shall be  adjudicated  a bankrupt or insolvent,  or
      shall file any petition or answer  seeking for itself any  reorganization,
      arrangement,  composition,   readjustment,   liquidation,  dissolution  or
      similar relief under any present or future statute, law or regulation,  or

      of a petition filed against the Company in any such  proceeding,  or shall
      seek  or  consent  to or  acquiesce  in the  appointment  of any  trustee,
      custodian,  receiver  or  liquidator  of  the  Company  or of  all  or any
      substantial  part of the properties of the Company,  or the Company or its
      directors  shall take any action looking to the dissolution or liquidation
      of the Company; or

            (iv) If,  within  sixty  (60)  days  after the  commencement  of any
      proceeding  against the Company seeking any  reorganization,  arrangement,
      composition,  readjustment,  liquidation,  dissolution  or similar  relief
      under any present or future  statute,  law or regulation,  such proceeding
      shall not have been  dismissed,  or if,  within  sixty (60) days after the
      appointment,  without the consent or acquiescence  of the Company,  of any
      trustee,  receiver  or  liquidator  of  the  Company  or  of  all  or  any
      substantial part of the properties of the Company,  such appointment shall
      not have been vacated.

(b) Holder's Default. The Holder will default if:

            (i) After the Cure  Period,  the Holder is in breach of any material
      representation contained herein; or

            (ii) Company has not received,  within fifteen (15) days of the fund
      date,  the  allocated  amounts to be funded by Holder in  accordance  with
      Schedule A.

7.    REMEDIES ON DEFAULT; ACCELERATION.

Upon the  occurrence  and during the  continuance  of an Event of  Default,  the
entire  unpaid  balance of  principal  and accrued  interest on this Note may be
accelerated and declared to be immediately due and payable by the holder. Unless
waived by the written consent of the holder,  such holder may proceed to protect
and enforce its rights by an action at law, suit in equity or other  appropriate
proceeding,  whether for the specific  performance  of any  agreement  contained
herein, or for an injunction  against a violation of any of the terms hereof, or
in aid of the  exercise  of  any  power  granted  hereby  or by  law.  Upon  the
occurrence of an Event of Default,  the Company agrees to pay to the Holder such
further  amount  as  shall be  sufficient  to cover  the  cost  and  expense  of
collection,  including,  without  limitation,  reasonable  attorneys'  fees  and
expenses.  No  course  of  dealing  and no delay on the  part of the  Holder  in
exercising  any right,  power or remedy  shall  operate  as a waiver  thereof or
otherwise prejudice such holder's rights,  powers and remedies.  No right, power
or remedy  conferred  hereby  upon the Holder  shall be  exclusive  of any other
right, power or remedy referred to herein nor now or hereafter available at law,
in equity, by statute or otherwise.
