ITEM 4.02.  NON-RELIANCE ON PREVIOUSLY ISSUED FINANCIAL STATEMENT OR A RELATED
            AUDIT REPORT OR COMPLETED INTERIM REVIEW.

In December 2004 Environmental Remediation Holding Corporation (the "Company")
modified certain financial statements previously filed with the Securities and
Exchange Commission ("SEC") in connection with the Company's Form 10Q for the
quarterly periods ending December 31, 2003, March 31, 2004, and June 30, 2004.
Management determined that the beneficial conversion feature of the Company's
convertible debt to an affiliated shareholder had not been valued and accounted
for appropriately. In order to appropriately value and account for such
convertible debt, the Company has recorded a beneficial conversion feature (debt
discount) associated with such convertible debt. Amortization of the debt
discount is being accounted for using the effective interest method and is being
charged to interest expense.

      This matter has been discussed by authorized officers with the company's
independent accountant. The independent accountant has since provided new
financial statements reflecting this change. The independent accountant has been
provided with a copy of the disclosures made in response to this Item 4.02 and
will furnish, as soon as possible, a letter stating his agreement with these
statements.

The financial statements that should no longer be relied on are contained in the
following forms filed with the SEC:

Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2003 and filed on February
17, 2004.

Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended March 31, 2004 and filed on May 17,
2004.

Form 10-Q for the quarterly period ended June 30, 2004 and filed on August 16,
2004.

The new financial statements that should be relied on are contained in the
following forms filed with the SEC:

Form 10-Q/A for the quarterly period ended December 31, 2003 and filed on
December 29, 2004.
