and Noble Energy Production, Inc., a Delaware corporation and wholly owned subsidiary of Noble (&#147;Merger Sub&#148;), under which Noble has agreed to acquire all of the issued and outstanding shares of common stock, par value $0.01 per share, of
the Company (&#147;Company Common Stock&#148;). Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, which was approved by the Boards of Directors of both the Company and Noble, the Company will merge with and into Merger Sub (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with
Merger Sub surviving the Merger. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Total consideration for the
Company Common Stock is fixed at approximately $1.1 billion in cash and approximately 27 million shares of common stock of Noble, par value $3.33 1/3 per share (&#147;Noble Common Stock&#148;), not including options and warrants exchanged in the
transaction. Under the terms of the Merger Agreement, Company stockholders will have the right to elect to receive cash or Noble Common Stock, subject to a proration if either cash or stock is oversubscribed. The per share consideration is subject
to adjustment upwards or downwards so that each share of Company Common Stock shall be converted into the right to receive consideration representing equal value. This adjustment will reflect 37.5126% of the increase or decrease, as the case may be,
between $59.18 and the price of Noble Common Stock during a specified period prior to closing. The stockholders of the Company will receive, in the aggregate, consideration comprised approximately of 60 percent Noble Common Stock and 40 percent
cash. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Consummation of the transactions contemplated by the

Noble Common Stock to be issued in the Merger. It is anticipated that the transaction will be completed in April or May 2005. In the event of a termination of the Merger Agreement under certain circumstances, the Company or Noble may be required to
pay the other a termination fee as set forth in the Merger Agreement. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"

certain provisions thereof with respect to the proposed Merger. Because of the fact that 2004 year-end compensation decisions have not been made with respect to the executive officers of the Company (and therefore 2005 salary levels and 2004 bonus
amounts have not yet been determined), and because both Noble and the Company desired to have certainty regarding the amounts of any eventual change in control payments that would be made upon consummation of the Merger, Noble and the Company agreed
in the Merger Agreement to set the change in control payment calculations based on salary levels for 2004 and bonus levels paid in 2004 for fiscal year 2003 (subject to certain exceptions set forth in such amendments). The amendments to the Change
