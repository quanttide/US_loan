 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>2.5 Compensation </B>means the regular or base salary and bonuses payable by the Employer or an Affiliate to an
individual. For purposes of the Plan, Compensation will be determined before giving effect to Elective Deferrals and other salary reduction amounts which are not included in the Participant&#146;s gross income under Section 125, 401(k), 402(h) or
403(b) of the Code. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Subject to the next paragraph which applies solely to
bonuses relating to 2004 performance and paid in 2005, for purposes of the Plan, bonuses shall be deemed to have been earned during the Plan Year in which the Employer accrues such bonuses for federal income tax reporting purposes. Under the
Employer&#146;s present method of Federal income tax reporting, regular bonuses paid in March of a given year are accrued ratably during the prior year. Regular salary and special bonuses, as designated by the Board of Directors or the Compensation
Committee of the Board of Directors of Employer, are included in Compensation at the time paid to the employee. Thus, for example, Compensation for the Plan Year ending December 31, 2006 includes regular salary paid during 2006 and any regular bonus
paid during March 2007. As a result an Elective Deferral to defer, say, 10% of a Participant&#146;s 2005 Compensation will result in the deferral hereunder of 10% of the Participant&#146;s 2006 salary and 10% of any regular bonus paid to the
Participant in March 2007 (any regular bonus payable in March 2006 would not be affected by an election to defer a portion of 2006 Compensation, since such bonus would be included in 2005 Compensation). Individuals may make separate elections as to
