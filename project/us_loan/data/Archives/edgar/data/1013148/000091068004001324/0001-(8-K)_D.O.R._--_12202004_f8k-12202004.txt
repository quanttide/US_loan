Item 3.02    Unregistered Sales of Equity Securities

         On December  20,  2004,  the  registrant  entered into common stock and
warrant  purchase   agreements  with  two  investors  in  a  private   placement
transaction  pursuant to which the  registrant  sold an  aggregate  of 9,167,386
shares of its common stock at a price  representing  an approximate 20% discount
to the average closing price per share of $1.16 of the registrant's common stock
for the ten trading days ended December 7, 2004,  for cash and the  cancellation
of  indebtedness  of the registrant in an aggregate  amount of $8,500,000,  less
fees  and  expenses   incurred  by  the  registrant.   In  connection  with  the
transaction, the registrant also issued warrants to purchase (i) an aggregate of
4,583,693  shares of common  stock  exercisable  for a period of three (3) years
from the date of issuance,  at an exercise  price of $1.16;  and (ii)  4,583,693
shares of common stock  exercisable for a period of six (6) months from the date
of issuance,  at an exercise price of $1.16.  The registrant may call up to 100%
of the  warrants if the common stock price is equal to or greater than $3.00 per
share  for  five  (5)  consecutive  trading  days  prior  to the  date  that the
registrant  calls the warrants.  The warrants  have  adjustment  provisions  for
dilution   events   including   stock  splits,   stock   dividends  and  similar
transactions.

         In connection with the registrant's sale of common stock and warrants
pursuant to the common stock and warrant purchase agreements, the registrant
entered into a registration rights agreement with each investor pursuant to
which, among other things, the registrant agreed to use its best efforts to file
a registration statement to register for resale the shares of common stock,
including the shares of common stock issuable upon exercise of the warrants, no
later than thirty (30) days after the closing date and cause such registration
statement to become effective as promptly as practicable after filing but no
later than March 7, 2005.

         In connection with these transactions, the registrant reduced the
exercise price from $1.52 per share to $0.80 cents per share with respect to
previously issued warrants to purchase an aggregate of 2,196,797 shares of
common stock to the investors. The two (2) investors in the transaction are
"accredited investors", as that term is defined under Rule 501 under Regulation
D of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, pursuant to the exemption from
registration requirements under Rule 506 and Section 4(2) of the Securities Act.
