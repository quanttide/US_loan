<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">MARLBOROUGH, Mass. &#151; (December 23, 2004) &#151; </font></b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">EXACT Sciences Corporation (NASDAQ:EXAS)
today announced that the <i><font style="font-style:italic;">New England Journal
of Medicine</font></i> has published the results of the Company&#146;s multi-center
study, the first-ever study of its stool-based DNA test, PreGen-Plus, versus
the most widely used fecal occult blood test, Hemoccult&#174; II.&#160; Researchers found that the Company&#146;s
non-invasive stool-based DNA test for colorectal cancer was four-times more
sensitive than the fecal occult blood test (FOBT), the only other entirely non-invasive
colorectal cancer screening test available today.&#160; The stool-based DNA test was able to detect all
stages of colorectal cancer in an average-risk, asymptomatic population,
including the earliest-stage, most curable colorectal cancers.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">EXACT Sciences&#146; work in applied genomics led
to the development of its stool-based DNA technologies, which are the first
practical applications of the decoding of the human genome to be used broadly for
testing in the average-risk, asymptomatic population. &#160;The Company&#146;s researchers have worked with
leading research institutions throughout in the country in the continuing
development, refinement and validation of its DNA-based technologies.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Colorectal
cancer is the second leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States.
Despite the guideline recommendations endorsing regular screening for all
Americans over the age of 50, nearly 60 percent have never been screened for colorectal
cancer. &#160;Professional organizations
recommend colorectal cancer screening for adults aged 50 years and older because early diagnosis results in a
greater than 90 percent five-year survival rate.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;The results of this study indicate that the
stool-based DNA test is a more sensitive test than the FOBT for the detection
of colorectal cancer,&#148; </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">said
Thomas Imperiale, M.D., lead investigator for the study, professor of medicine
at the Indiana University School of Medicine and a research scientist at the
Regenstrief Institute, Inc.&#160; &#147;A simple, non-invasive test that
detects colorectal cancer with reasonable sensitivity and specificity might
overcome barriers to screening among persons who are not willing to have a more
invasive test, such as colonoscopy.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The primary endpoint of the study was to
determine the relative performance of stool-based DNA screening to the most
widely-used FOBT (Hemoccult II) in the detection of invasive colorectal
cancer.&#160; This primary endpoint was achieved
with high statistical significance, as the stool-based DNA test was four-times
more sensitive than the FOBT in the detection of invasive colorectal cancer (52
percent versus 13 percent, P=0.003).&#160;&#160; In
addition, the stool-based DNA test was more than four-times as sensitive in
detecting the earliest stage, most curable cancers (56.5 percent versus 13.0
percent, P=0.0006). A secondary finding was that stool-based DNA testing was twice
as sensitive as the FOBT in detecting adenomas that exhibit high-grade
dysplasia (adenomas highly likely to progress to cancer). The version of the
stool-based DNA test used in this study was designed to detect invasive cancer,
and was not expected to detect pre-cancerous adenomas.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The rationale and primary endpoint for the
study were based on screening guidelines that state that newer screening tests
do not have to provide results from a clinical trial with mortality from
colorectal cancer as an endpoint, but should demonstrate, at the minimum,
equivalence in sensitivity, specificity and safety to currently available
screening tests. Hemoccult II was chosen as the comparator as it is the only
fecal occult blood test, and only colorectal cancer screening test, proven to
reduce the incidence and risk of death from colorectal cancer. Hemoccult II is
the most widely-used fecal occult blood test on the market. The study was
designed by the authors, with advice from a panel of national experts on
colorectal cancer, cancer screening and prevention, and study design.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;It is important that people have options for
colorectal cancer screening,&#148; said Dr. Paul C. Schroy III, MD, MPH, Boston
University School of Medicine. &#147;While there are several screening tests
available, far too many people are not getting screened for what could be a
curable disease.&#160; Stool-based DNA testing
is a novel screening option that offers a convenient, non-invasive and
potentially more acceptable alternative to existing screening tests for an
average-risk patient population. Any test that increases the number of people
who get screened effectively for colorectal cancer is a test that should be
made available to patients as a standard of care.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">PreGen-Plus works by isolating the human DNA from a
single stool sample collected in the privacy of one&#146;s own home, and analyzing
that DNA for alterations associated with current, active colorectal
cancer.&#160; The test, </font><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">which must be ordered by a physician,
removes many of the common barriers associated with other available methods,
including invasiveness, discomfort and inconvenience.&#160; PreGen-Plus does not require any special
bowel preparation, stool handling or changes in diet prior to testing.&#160; It also does not carry the risks associated
with invasive tests, such as colon perforation, hemorrhage, or infection, or
sedation-related issues associated with colonoscopy.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The molecular genetics of colorectal cancer
provide the basis for the analysis of stool DNA. &#160;Eighty-five percent of colorectal cancers
result from chromosomal instability, with acquired mutations progressively
accumulating in the adenomatous polyposis coli (<i><font style="font-style:italic;">APC</font></i>) and <i><font style="font-style:italic;">p53</font></i>
tumor suppressor genes, and in the <i><font style="font-style:italic;">k-ras</font></i>
oncogene. The other 15 percent arises from malfunction to genes involved in DNA
mismatch repair, manifested by microsatellite instability. Colorectal cancer
may also be detectable by DNA markers associated with disordered apoptosis. &#160;PreGen-Plus consists of a panel of 23
individual tests each looking for the presence of DNA alterations in human DNA
isolated from stool.&#160; The test analyzes
the DNA for 21 specific point alterations in the APC, k-ras and p53 genes, a
marker for microsatellite instability known as Bat-26, and a novel marker known
as DNA Integrity Assay (DIA&#174;), all of which have been associated with the
presence of cancer.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-indent:0in;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&#147;These data, combined with other studies that
showed strong sensitivity, as well as overall patient preference for stool-based
DNA testing, demonstrate the important role that PreGen-Plus can play in
increasing colorectal cancer screening rates<i><font style="font-style:italic;">,&#148; </font></i>said Don
Hardison, EXACT Sciences&#146; President and CEO.&#160;
&#147;PreGen-Plus has been used by thousands of patients to date, and
post-market data show that more than half of those patients had never been
screened for colorectal cancer before.&#160; We
believe that PreGen-Plus can address the needs of patients who are currently
not undergoing colonoscopy as part of their normal screening once they reach
age 50, and can bring more people into the screened population.&#160; Our goal is to reduce mortality associated
with colorectal cancer &#151; and we know, by the fact that we have already detected
early stage cancers in patients, that we are beginning to achieve that goal.&#148;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><b><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-weight:bold;">About Colorectal Cancer Screening</font></b></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Today, there are several colorectal cancer
screening options, yet there is confusion among patients as to which ones may
be right for them. &#160;Colonoscopy remains
the reference standard, but many patients in rural areas do not have access to
colonoscopy, and patients in urban areas often experience long waits for an
appointment. Still other patients remain unwilling to undergo colonoscopy due
to fear of the preparation and invasiveness of the procedure. While physicians
strongly recommend colonoscopy, it is important to offer options to ensure that
every American aged 50 and older gets screened regardless of access or other
barriers.</font></p>

<h2 style="font-weight:normal;margin:0in 0in .0001pt;page-break-after:avoid;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></h2>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Other available screening options include
flexible sigmoidoscopy and barium enema. Flexible sigmoidoscopy is similar to
colonoscopy, but examines only about one-third of the colon. Barium enema is an
older technique that some doctors use, but it is also less sensitive than a
colonoscopy.&#160; The fecal occult blood test
(FOBT) measures blood in stool that is undetectable to the naked eye.&#160; Blood in the stool, however, is only an
indirect marker of colorectal neoplasia, as many tumors may not bleed, or bleed
intermittently; in addition, the detected blood could result from another problem,
such as hemorrhoids.&#160; Virtual
colonoscopy, using CAT scan technology, takes less time to perform but is not
entirely non-invasive and requires the same preparation as colonoscopy.</font></p>

the Study</font></b></h2>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">These
data were published in an article entitled &#147;Fecal DNA versus Fecal Occult Blood
for Colorectal-Cancer Screening in an Average-Risk Population&#148; in the December
23 issue of the <i><font style="font-style:italic;">New England Journal of Medicine</font></i>.&#160; This multi-center study is the largest study
to date involving the stool-based DNA test, as well as fecal occult blood
testing, in community practice. It is also the first head-to-head comparison of
a stool-based, multitarget DNA panel versus Hemoccult II in asymptomatic,
average-risk adults aged 50 years and older.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><i><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;font-style:italic;">Study design and rationale</font></i></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The rationale for the study was based on
screening guidelines which state that newer screening tests do not require
mortality reduction as an endpoint, but should have comparable or better
performance in terms of sensitivity, specificity, and safety, among other
features, when compared to other acceptable tests. &#160;Hemoccult II (SmithKline Diagnostics,
Sunnyvale, CA) was chosen as the comparator because guaiac-based FOBT is the
only test method proven to reduce the mortality associated with colorectal
cancer, and Hemoccult II is the most widely-used guaiac-based test.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">However,
the sensitivity of fecal occult blood testing for colorectal cancer and
especially for colorectal adenomas is low because neoplasms may not bleed, or
bleed intermittently, and thus cannot be detected by FOBT. A simple,
non-invasive test that detects tumor-specific markers, such as altered DNA,
with reasonable sensitivity and specificity might overcome barriers to
screening among patients who are not willing to have the more sensitive but
more invasive colonoscopy.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The study was conducted at 81 sites,
including private practice and university-based settings. Patient enrollment
occurred between August 2001 and March 2003. All participants sequentially
provided a stool sample for DNA testing, completed three Hemoccult II cards
over three days, and underwent screening colonoscopy.&#160; Study enrollment was designed to identify an
adequate number of persons with colorectal cancer.&#160; The primary endpoint for the study was to
determine the relative performance of stool-based DNA screening to the most
widely-used FOBT.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">As this study was initiated more than three
years ago, the stool-based DNA test that is now commercially available
represents a newer version of the technology and different sample handling
techniques than what was used in this study.&#160;
Sample handling techniques affect the stability of the DNA in a sample;
techniques employed in this study, which are different from those used
commercially, did not optimize DNA stability and may have impacted the point
sensitivity of the stool-based DNA test.&#160;
In addition, the currently available test also incorporates a new sample
preparation technology, Effipure&#153;, which has been shown to enhance the test&#146;s
sensitivity by increasing the amount of DNA purified from a stool sample.&#160; The Company continues to focus its applied
research efforts on the development of future generations of its stool-based
DNA technologies.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">&nbsp;</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;text-autospace:none;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">Previous
studies using stool-based DNA testing demonstrated a sensitivity of 62 percent
to 91 percent for cancer and 27 percent to 82 percent for advanced adenomas,
with a specificity of 93 percent to 96 percent in persons with a normal
colonoscopy.&#160; However, those studies
assessed persons with a great range of clinical presentations of colorectal
cancer, from asymptomatic to advanced, symptomatic lesions.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">The target population consisted of
asymptomatic persons at average risk for colorectal cancer.&#160; All participants were at least 50 years
old.&#160; Enrollment was stratified by age,
with a minimum of three-quarters of persons aged 65 years or older, to mimic
the well-known increase in the frequency of colorectal cancer with age.&#160; Exclusion criteria included gastrointestinal
bleeding within the last month; change in bowel habits or abdominal pain;
previous colorectal cancer or polyps; prior resection of any part of the colon;
iron deficiency anemia; or other coexistent visceral cancer.&#160; Individuals who had undergone colonoscopy,
sigmoidoscopy or double contrast barium enema within the preceding 10 years or
a positive fecal occult blood test within six months were excluded, as were
those with inflammatory bowel disease, familial adenomatous polyposis or
hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer, more than one first degree relative with
colorectal cancer, or any first degree relative with colorectal cancer before
age 50.&#160; Persons unwilling or unable to
undergo colonoscopy were excluded.</font></p>

<p style="margin:0in 0in .0001pt;"><font size="2" face="Times New Roman" style="font-size:10.0pt;">EXACT Sciences Corporation is a leader in
rapidly applying genomics knowledge to develop effective, patient-friendly
screening methods to detect cancer early, to assist physicians in saving
patients&#146; lives.&#160; Its commercial test,
PreGen-Plus&#153;, is used for screening colorectal cancer in the average-risk
population.&#160; Colorectal cancer, which is
the most deadly cancer among non-smokers, is curable if detected early.&#160; Despite the availability of colorectal cancer
screening and diagnostic tests for more than 20 years, the rate of early
detection of colorectal cancer remains low, and deaths from colorectal cancer
remain high.&#160; EXACT Sciences believes its
genomics-based technologies will enable early detection of colorectal cancer so
that more people can be effectively treated.&#160;
Founded in 1995, EXACT Sciences is based in Marlborough, Mass.&#160; Detailed information on EXACT Sciences and
PreGen-Plus can be found on the World Wide Web at www.exactsciences.com and
