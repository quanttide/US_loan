ITEM 4.01  CHANGES IN REGISTRANT'S CERTIFYING ACCOUNTANT.

         On December 22, 2004, the Board of Directors of China Evergreen
Environmental Corporation ("China Evergreen") approved a change in auditors. The
Board of Directors approved the dismissal of Wm. Andrew Campbell C.A.
("Campbell") as China Evergreen's independent public accountant and the
selection of PKF Hong Kong SAR ("PKF"), as their replacement.

         Campbell's report on the financial statements of China Evergreen for
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 did not contain any adverse opinion or
disclaimer of opinion, nor were they qualified or modified as to audit scope,
procedure or accounting principles except that the reports were modified as to
uncertainty and contained a disclosure stating that the financial statements
were prepared based on the assumption that China Evergreen would continue as a
going concern.

         During China Evergreen's fiscal year ended December 31, 2003 and the
subsequent interim period through December 22, 2004, there were no disagreements
between China Evergreen and Campbell on any matter of accounting principles or
practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing scope or procedure, which
disagreements, if not resolved to Campbell's satisfaction, would have caused
them to make reference to the subject matter of the disagreement in connection
with their reports on China Evergreen's financial statement for such years; and
there were no reportable events as described in Item 304(a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K. China Evergreen provided Campbell with a copy of the foregoing disclosures
and has asked Campbell to confirm the contents of such disclosures in writing.
Upon receipt of such letter, China Evergreen will file it as an exhibit by way
of an amendment to this Current Report on Form 8-K.

         In addition, during China Evergreen's two most recent fiscal years
ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and the subsequent interim periods, China
Evergreen did not consult with PKF with respect to the application of accounting
principles to a specified transaction, either completed or proposed, or the type
of audit opinion that might be rendered on China Evergreen's financial
statements, or any other matters or reportable events as set forth in Items
304(a)(2)(i) and (ii) of Regulation S-K.
