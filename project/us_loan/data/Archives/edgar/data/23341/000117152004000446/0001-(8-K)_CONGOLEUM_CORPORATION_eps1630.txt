Item 8.01  Other Events

On December 17, 2004, Congoleum Corporation (the "Company") issued a press
release announcing that the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of
New Jersey (the "Bankruptcy Court") has approved the Company's First Modified
Disclosure Statement (the "Disclosure Statement") and the voting procedures for
its Fourth Modified Joint Plan of Reorganization (the "Plan") following a
hearing held on December 9, 2004. The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled a hearing
on confirmation of the Plan on March 24, 2005. Pursuant to the approved voting
procedures, the Company expects to commence the distribution of voting materials
and solicitation of acceptances of the Plan by late December or early January,
and to have the voting results tabulated by late February, 2005.

Forward-Looking Statements

Some of the information presented in this Current Report on Form 8-K constitutes
"forward-looking statements," within the meaning of the Private Securities
Litigation Reform Act of 1995, that involve risks, uncertainties and
assumptions. These forward-looking statements are based on the Company's
expectations, as of the date of this report, of future events, and the Company
undertakes no obligation to update any of these forward-looking statements
except as required by the federal securities laws. Although the Company believes
that these expectations are based on reasonable assumptions, within the bounds
of its knowledge of its business and operations, there can be no assurance that
actual results will not differ materially from its expectations. Readers are
cautioned not to place undue reliance on any forward-looking statements. Factors
that could cause or contribute to the Company's actual results differing from
its expectations include those factors discussed in the Company's other filings
with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including in the section of its
Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 30, 2004 entitled
"Management's Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations - Risk Factors That May Affect Future Results."
