            The Company is providing this Disclosure Statement and the Exhibits
hereto, the accompanying ballots, and the related materials delivered herewith
pursuant to section 1126(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, in connection with this
solicitation ("Solicitation") of votes for the Fourth Modified Joint Plan of
Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of Congoleum Corporation,
et al., dated as of November 12, 2004 (the "Plan"), a copy of which is annexed
to this Disclosure Statement as Exhibit A.

            This Disclosure Statement is to be used solely in connection with an
evaluation of the Plan; use of this Disclosure Statement for any other purpose
is not authorized. This Disclosure Statement may not be reproduced or provided
to others (other than to those advisors of any recipient of this Disclosure
Statement who may review the information contained herein to assist such
recipient in his, her or its evaluation of the Plan) without the prior written
consent of the Company.

            THE PLAN PROVIDES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FOR THE ISSUANCE OF
INJUNCTIONS UNDER SECTIONS 105(a) AND 524(g) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE THAT RESULT
IN THE CHANNELING OF ALL ASBESTOS RELATED LIABILITIES OF THE COMPANY INTO A
TRUST AS MORE FULLY DESCRIBED HEREIN. SEE SECTION 6.7(h) - "DISCHARGE
INJUNCTION" AND SECTION 6.7 (i) - "ASBESTOS CHANNELING INJUNCTION" FOR A
DESCRIPTION OF SUCH INJUNCTIONS.

            The Company has operated and intends to continue operating its
business in the ordinary course during the Reorganization Cases. Asbestos
Personal Injury Claims, Asbestos Property Damage Claims, ABI Claims and
Congoleum Majority Interests are Impaired under the Plan; the Claims of
Congoleum's other Creditors and Interest Holders are not Impaired under the
Plan. Because acceptance of the Plan will constitute acceptance of all the
provisions thereof, holders of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims, Asbestos
Property Damage Claims, ABI Claims and Congoleum Majority Interests are urged to
consider carefully the information regarding treatment of their Claims and
Interests contained in this Disclosure Statement.

            The effectiveness of the Plan is subject to several material
conditions precedent. There can be no assurance that those conditions will be
satisfied. The Company presently intends to seek to consummate the Plan as
promptly as practicable after the Confirmation Date. There can be no assurance,
however, as to when or whether the Confirmation Date and the Effective Date
actually will occur.

            Distributions under the Plan to Creditors of the Company (other than
distributions to holders of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims) will be the
responsibility of the Reorganized Debtors. Pursuant to section 524(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code, distributions under the Plan to holders of Plan Trust Asbestos
Claims will be the responsibility of the Plan Trust and the Reorganized Debtors
will have no liability therefor.

            The terms of the Plan have been developed in the course of extensive
pre-petition and post-petition discussions and negotiations among Congoleum, the
Claimants' Representative, the Taylor Claimants (as hereinafter defined), the
Asbestos Claimants' Committee, ABI and the Futures Representative and, in the
pre-petition period, the Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee. The boards
of directors of each of Congoleum, CSI and CFI have approved the Plan and


                                        i
<PAGE>

strongly recommend that holders of Claims and Interests entitled to vote on the
Plan for purposes of sections 1126 and 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code vote to
accept it. The Claimants' Representative, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the
Taylor Claimants and the Futures Representative have approved the Plan's
treatment of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and strongly recommend that the
holders of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims entitled to vote on the Plan for
purposes of sections 1126 and 524(g) vote to accept the Plan. Letters in support
of the Plan from the Company, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee and the Futures
Representative may be included as part of this Solicitation Package. The
Claimants' Representative, Joseph F. Rice, Esquire and Perry Weitz, Esquire,
have participated in the negotiations and development of the Plan solely in
their capacity as the representatives of certain holders of Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims and not as the representative of all holders of Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims. Holders of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims should consult with
their personal counsel with respect to the Plan and the treatment of Asbestos
Personal Injury Claims thereunder.

            Without approval of the arrangements set forth in the Plan, there
can be no assurance that the Company will be able to emerge from an alternative
case under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and not be forced into liquidation
under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company believes that if it is
liquidated under Chapter 7, the distributions to Creditors would be delayed and
would be significantly lower than the distributions contemplated by and under
the Plan. See Section 7.3(a)(1) -"Best Interests Test" below.

            The Claimants' Representative, Joseph F. Rice, Esquire and Perry
Weitz, Esquire, are working for their respective individual clients in regard to
the Plan and Disclosure Statement. Upon confirmation of the Plan, the Claimants'
Representative reserves the right to seek compensation, subject to Bankruptcy
Court approval, for the benefit bestowed on all Creditors.

            THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE PLAN IS IN THE BEST INTERESTS OF THE
COMPANY'S CREDITORS (INCLUDING THE HOLDERS OF ASBESTOS PERSONAL INJURY CLAIMS
AND ASBESTOS PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS). ACCORDINGLY, CREDITORS AND INTEREST
HOLDERS ENTITLED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 1126 OF
THE BANKRUPTCY CODE OR FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 524(g) OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE ARE
URGED TO VOTE IN FAVOR OF THE PLAN. TO BE COUNTED, YOUR BALLOT MUST BE DULY
COMPLETED, EXECUTED, AND ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE VOTING AGENT NO LATER THAN
5:00 P.M., PREVAILING EASTERN TIME, ON FEBRUARY 7, 2005, UNLESS OTHERWISE
ORDERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. CREDITORS AND INTEREST HOLDERS ARE ENCOURAGED
TO READ AND CONSIDER CAREFULLY THIS ENTIRE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT, INCLUDING THE
PLAN ANNEXED HERETO AS EXHIBIT A, AND THE MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THIS DISCLOSURE
STATEMENT UNDER ARTICLE 10, "RISKS OF THE PLAN" AND ARTICLE 11, "ALTERNATIVES TO
CONFIRMATION AND CONSUMMATION OF THE PLAN," PRIOR TO CASTING THEIR VOTES.

            In making a decision, Creditors and Interest holders must rely on
their own examination of the Company and the terms of the Plan, including the
merits and risks involved. Creditors and Interest holders should not construe
the contents of this Disclosure Statement as providing any legal, business,
financial or tax advice. Each Creditor or Interest holder should consult with
his, her or its own legal, business, financial and tax advisors with respect to
any such matters concerning this Disclosure Statement, this Solicitation, the
Plan and the transactions contemplated thereby.

may vary from the amount ultimately Allowed in respect of such Claim by the

            The information contained in this Disclosure Statement, including,
but not limited to, the information regarding the history, businesses, and

matters that may arise, however, such information is not to be construed as
admissions or stipulations but rather as statements made in settlement
negotiations.

Weitz, Esquire, have participated in the negotiations and development of the
Plan Documents, solely in their capacity as the representatives of certain
holders of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and not as the representative of all


                                       iii

holders of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims. Holders of Asbestos Personal Injury
Claims should consult with their personal counsel with respect to the Plan and
the treatment of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims thereunder.

            The Asbestos Claimants' Committee did not participate in any aspects
of the pre-petition negotiations, review and approval of the Plan Documents,
but, to the extent such documents were modified post-petition, did participate
in post-petition negotiations, review and approval of such documents.

                                  INTRODUCTION

1.1.  This Solicitation - Purpose of Disclosure Statement

            The Company transmits this Disclosure Statement, pursuant to section
1126(b) of the Bankruptcy Code, for use in this Solicitation of votes to accept
the Plan. The Company is commencing this Solicitation after extended discussions
with, and the Plan is the product of negotiations with, the Claimants'
Representative, the Futures Representative and ABI. Additionally, post-petition
modifications to the Plan were the product of negotiations with the Asbestos
Claimants' Committee, the Taylor Claimants, the Claimants' Representative and
the Futures Representative.

            This Solicitation is being conducted in order to obtain sufficient
acceptances to enable the Plan to be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant
to the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code. This Disclosure Statement is being
transmitted in order to provide adequate information to enable holders of
Asbestos Personal Injury Claims, holders of Asbestos Property Damage Claims who
have timely filed Proofs of Claim and holders of ABI Claims and Congoleum
Majority Interests, who are Impaired under the Plan, to make an informed
judgment in exercising their right to vote to accept or reject the Plan under
section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code. In addition, because all Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims will be channeled into and addressed by the Plan Trust following
the Effective Date of the Plan, this Disclosure Statement is being transmitted
in order to provide adequate information to enable all holders of Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims to make an informed judgment in exercising their right to vote
to accept or reject the Plan under section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. This
Disclosure Statement is also being transmitted for informational purposes to
certain holders of Claims and Interests who are not Impaired under the Plan.

            The Company and ABI strongly recommend the Plan as being a fair and
equitable method to address the Company's ongoing asbestos liability issues and
encourage the Plan's acceptance by creditors entitled to vote. The Futures
Representative, the Claimants' Representative, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee
and the Taylor Claimants strongly recommend the Plan as being a fair and
equitable method to address the Company's ongoing asbestos personal injury
liability issues and encourage the Plan's acceptance by Creditors entitled to
vote.

1.2.  Voting Procedures

            The Company is soliciting acceptances of the Plan from (a) all known
Asbestos Claimants or their authorized representatives, (b) all holders of
Asbestos Property Damage Claims who have timely filed Proofs of Claim, and (c)
ABI as the holder of the ABI Claims and the Congoleum Majority Interests.

            In order to facilitate the solicitation of votes to accept or reject
the Plan timely following the anticipated approval of the adequacy of the
Disclosure Statement on December 9, 2004, the Company intends to cause the
Voting Agent to commence collection of certain information pertaining to
Asbestos Claimants as soon as reasonably possible. The Voting Agent has sent
both a notice of collection of information and a notice of voting procedures to


                                        1
<PAGE>

counsel for Asbestos Claimants requesting that such counsel provide the Voting
Agent with, for each client, the name, address, social security number, class
designation, amount of claim and disease level of the client, as applicable,
prior to the hearing on the Disclosure Statement, or as soon thereafter as
possible. Counsel will also be requested to advise the Voting Agent whether the
solicitation package should be sent directly to the holder or to counsel in
accordance with the voting procedures.

            In response to requests, the Voting Agent will send solicitation
packages containing notice of the time for filing objections and the hearing on
confirmation, the order approving the Disclosure Statement, the Disclosure
Statement and Plan, appropriate ballots or master ballots, and voting
instructions, among other things, to Asbestos Claimants, holders of Asbestos
Property Damage Claims who have timely filed Proofs of Claim and ABI, or their
counsel. Asbestos Claimants, holders of such Asbestos Property Damage Claims and
ABI, or their counsel, should read the solicitation package materials carefully
and follow the voting instructions listed on the ballot or master ballot.
Asbestos Claimants, holders of such Asbestos Property Damage Claims and ABI, or
their counsel, should only use the appropriate ballot(s) corresponding to the
class for which a vote is being cast.

            If at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of
the claims of each Impaired Class of Claims that have voted on the Plan vote to
accept the Plan, and at least seventy-five percent (75%) of Asbestos Claimants
and the holders of Asbestos Property Damage Claims to be channeled into and
addressed by the Plan Trust that have voted to accept the Plan and such votes
are received by the Voting Deadline (the "Requisite Acceptances"), the Company
expects to seek confirmation of the Plan promptly. If the Company does not
receive the Requisite Acceptances by the Voting Deadline, or unforeseen events
occur, it will be forced to evaluate other available options.

1.3.  Voting Deadline

            IN ORDER TO BE COUNTED FOR VOTING PURPOSES, BALLOTS MUST ACTUALLY BE
RECEIVED BY THE VOTING AGENT BY 5:00 P.M. PREVAILING EASTERN TIME ON FEBRUARY 7,
2005 UNLESS OTHERWISE ORDERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, AT THE FOLLOWING ADDRESS:

1.4.  Overview of the Reorganization

      (a) Brief Explanation of Chapter 11

            Chapter 11 is the principal business reorganization chapter of the
Bankruptcy Code. Under Chapter 11, a debtor is authorized to reorganize its
business for the benefit of its creditors and shareholders. In addition to
permitting rehabilitation of the debtor, Chapter 11 promotes equality of
treatment of creditors and equity security holders who hold substantially
similar claims against or interests in the debtor and its assets. In furtherance
of these two goals, upon the filing of a petition for relief under Chapter 11,


                                        2
<PAGE>

section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code provides for an automatic stay of
substantially all acts and proceedings against the debtor and its property,
including all attempts to collect claims or enforce liens that arose prior to
the commencement of the Chapter 11 case.

            THE CONSUMMATION OF A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION IS THE PRINCIPAL
OBJECTIVE OF A CHAPTER 11 CASE. A PLAN OF REORGANIZATION SETS FORTH THE MEANS
FOR TREATING CLAIMS AGAINST AND EQUITY INTERESTS IN A DEBTOR. CONFIRMATION OF A
PLAN OF REORGANIZATION BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT MAKES THE PLAN BINDING UPON THE
DEBTOR, ANY PERSON OR ENTITY ACQUIRING PROPERTY UNDER THE PLAN, AND ANY CREDITOR

1.5.  Overview of the Plan

            The following is a brief summary of certain information contained
elsewhere in this Disclosure Statement and in the Plan. The summary is
necessarily incomplete and is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more
detailed information appearing elsewhere in this Disclosure Statement, the
exhibits hereto and the other Plan Documents.

            The Plan is a product of extensive efforts by Congoleum, ABI, the
Claimants' Representative and the Futures Representative to negotiate a plan of
reorganization for the Company that is fair and equitable to all parties in
interest and that provides for the issuance of injunctions under sections 105(a)
and 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code that result in the channeling of asbestos
related liabilities of Congoleum and the derivative asbestos related liabilities
of ABI to the Plan Trust.

            The Plan provides for, among other things, payment in full of
Allowed Administrative Claims, Allowed Priority Tax Claims, Allowed Priority
Claims, Allowed General Unsecured Claims and the establishment of the Plan Trust
to satisfy Plan Trust Asbestos Claims. Lender Secured Claims, Other Secured
Claims and Senior Note Claims are not Impaired or affected by the Plan. The Plan
shall be binding on all parties holding Claims, whether asserted or not, against
Congoleum.

            The essential elements of the reorganization contemplated by the
Plan include, among other things:

      (a)   the creation of the Plan Trust which is intended to be a "qualified
            settlement fund" within the meaning of Section 1.468B - 1(a) of the
            Treasury Regulations promulgated under Section 468B of the IRC, that
            will assume the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to all Plan


                                        3
<PAGE>

            Trust Asbestos Claims and will use Plan Trust Assets and income to
            pay Plan Trust Asbestos Claims as provided in the Plan and the Plan
            Trust Documents;

      (b)   the funding of the Plan Trust with the Plan Trust Assets;

      (c)   the classification of Claims and Interests and the treatment of such
            Claims and Interests under the Plan;

      (d)   the payment of Claims in accordance with the requirements of the
            Bankruptcy Code;

      (e)   the establishment and implementation of the TDP as provided in the
            Plan Trust Agreement for the fair and even-handed resolution of
            those Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury Claims which have not yet
            been agreed as to amount and any Demands;

      (f)   the procedure for addressing and resolving Disputed Claims;

      (g)   the issuance of certain injunctions, including but not limited to,
            the Discharge Injunction and the Asbestos Channeling Injunction;

      (h)   amendment and restatement of the Existing Credit Agreement;

      (i)   the governance and management of the Reorganized Debtors; and

      (j)   the retention of jurisdiction by the Bankruptcy Court.

            Collateral Trust. The Collateral Trust was established in April
2003, and amended on June 6, 2003 and December 16, 2004, pursuant to the terms
of the Asbestos Settlement Documents. All Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement
Claimants are to be paid in accordance with the provisions of the Asbestos
Settlement Documents. All those Asbestos Claimants who, pursuant to the Claimant
Agreement have settled asbestos related bodily injury claims against Congoleum
and have thereby become Participating Claimants are to be paid in accordance
with the Claimant Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement. The Asbestos
Claims of Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants and Participating Claimants
(collectively, "Qualified Claimants") are secured as and to the extent provided
in the Asbestos Settlement Documents. The Collateral (as defined in the Security
Agreement) securing the Asbestos Claims of the Qualified Claimants is held by
the Collateral Trust and generally includes all of Congoleum's right to receive
payment from its insurers, net of, among other things, fees, expenses and
disbursements incurred in connection with efforts to collect such amounts, as
more fully described in the Security Agreement.

            Plan Trust. The Collateral Trust by its own terms terminates upon,
among other things, the transfer of the assets of the Collateral Trust to the
Plan Trust on the Effective Date, as provided in the Plan. The Plan Trust will
preserve the rights and payment priorities of the Collateral Trust's
beneficiaries, as stated in the Collateral Trust Agreement. All then asserted
Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, including the Claims asserted by Participating
Claimants, or to be asserted in the future by Unknown Asbestos Claimants, will
be assumed by and transferred to the Plan Trust.

            The Plan Trust will be funded with the Plan Trust Assets which will
include, without limitation, the following assets and any income, profits and
proceeds derived therefrom:

            o     Promissory Note issued by Congoleum and payable to the Plan
                  Trust, in the initial aggregate principal amount of
                  $2,738,234.75 (the "Original Principal Amount") which
                  represents 51% of the market capitalization of Congoleum as of
                  June 6, 2003, with such amount being subject to increase in
                  the amount, if any, by which 51% of Congoleum's market
                  capitalization, based on the average trading prices at the
                  close of trading for the 90 consecutive trading days beginning
                  on the one year anniversary of the Effective Date, exceeds the
                  Original Principal Amount;

            o     the Asbestos Insurance Rights;

            o     the proceeds of the Asbestos Insurance Settlement Agreements;

            o     the proceeds of the Asbestos In-Place Insurance Coverage;

            o     the proceeds of the Asbestos Insurance Actions;

            o     the proceeds of the Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries;

            o     the Asbestos Property Damage Insurance Rights;

            o     the grant of a security interest in the Pledged Stock and the
                  Other Collateral under the Pledge Agreement;

            o     the ABI Contribution;

            o     the Additional Plan Trust Contribution (if payable);

            o     the Claimant Agreement;

            o     all of the assets held by the Collateral Trust as of the
                  Effective Date;

            o     Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of Action (subject to Section
                  12.5 of the Plan); and

            o     rights granted to the Plan Trust pursuant to the Insurance
                  Assignment Agreement.

            On the occurrence and during the continuance of an Event of Default
with respect to the Promissory Note which remains uncured after the applicable
cure period, the Plan Trust, as holder of the Promissory Note, will generally be
entitled, among other things, to accelerate the amount owing under the
Promissory Note and exercise its rights under the Pledge Agreement with respect
to the Pledged Stock and the Other Collateral.

            Treatment of Secured Asbestos Claims: The full amount of the
Asbestos Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants are secured and
such Claims will be paid by the Plan Trust in accordance with the provisions of
the Asbestos Settlement Documents (including priority of payments subject to the
payment of Plan Trust Expenses) which will be incorporated in the Plan Trust
Agreement and TDP. The Asbestos Claims of Qualified Participating Claimants are
Secured Asbestos Claims to the extent of seventy-five percent (75%) of the
liquidated settlement amounts. On the Effective Date all assets in the
Collateral Trust will be transferred to the Plan Trust and the Plan Trust will
assume the obligations of the Collateral Trust as set forth in the Plan. After
the Effective Date, Secured Asbestos Claims will be paid, subject to the payment
of Plan Trust Expenses and Coverage Costs, in accordance with the terms of the
Plan Trust Agreement, by the Plan Trust in accordance with the Participating
Claimants' rights under the Asbestos Settlement Documents which will be
incorporated in the Plan Trust Agreement and TDP.

            Treatment of Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury Claims: Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims, including the unsecured portion of the liquidated Asbestos
Claims of Participating Claimants and Unknown Asbestos Personal Injury Claims,
will be paid by the Plan Trust in accordance with the trust distribution
procedures to be established as part of the Plan Trust. Under section 4.4 of the
TDP, the Plan Trust is not authorized to make payments on account of the
unsecured portion of the liquidated settlement amount of a Participating
Claimant's settled claim until the portion of the liquidated settlement amount
of such claim (including the secured portion) that has been paid, is equal to or
less than the then-current portion of Unknown Asbestos Personal Injury Claims
that have been paid by the Plan Trust.

            Treatment of Asbestos Property Damage Claims: Allowed Asbestos
Property Damage Claims will be paid from the Asbestos Property Damage Claim
Sub-Account in accordance with procedures established pursuant to the Plan Trust
Agreement.

            Indemnification Under the Plan Trust: As and to the extent provided
in the Plan Trust Agreement, the Reorganized Debtors will be entitled to
indemnification from the Plan Trust for any expenses, costs and fees (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and costs, but excluding any such expenses, costs and
fees incurred prior to the Effective Date), judgments, settlements, or other
liabilities arising from or incurred in connection with any Plan Trust Asbestos
Claim, including, but not limited to, indemnification or contribution for Plan
Trust Asbestos Claims prosecuted against the Reorganized Debtors but excluding
any amounts paid prior to or on the Effective Date by the Debtors or their past
or present Representatives, any amounts paid or incurred by the Reorganized
Debtors or their Representatives whether before or after the Effective Date, in
connection with defending, objecting to, or otherwise related to any proceedings
to determine whether an Asbestos Property Damage Claim is or should be Allowed,
any amounts paid or incurred by the Reorganized Debtors or their Representatives
after the Effective Date in connection with liquidating ABI Asbestos Personal
Injury Indemnity Claims and any amount paid or payable by the Reorganized
Debtors as described in Section 6.7(f) of this Disclosure Statement.
Notwithstanding anything in Section 3.4 of the Plan Trust Agreement to the
contrary, the Plan Trust will reimburse and pay promptly the Reorganized
Debtors, from the proceeds of the Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries, for


                                        6
<PAGE>

Coverage Costs in excess of six million dollars ($6,000,000) to the extent that
such Coverage Costs have not been reimbursed or paid to the Debtors or the
Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, from Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries
received on or after the Petition Date. Further, if the proceeds of Asbestos
Insurance Action Recoveries received on or after the Petition Date exceed $375
million ($375,000,000), net of any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage
Costs, then the Plan Trust will reimburse and pay promptly the Reorganized
Debtors, from the proceeds of Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries, for (1) any
Coverage Costs for which the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable,
have not been reimbursed and (2) the Claims Handling Fee paid under the Claimant
Agreement; provided, however, if any Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries in
excess of $375 million ($375,000,000) (but net of any payment of or
reimbursement for Coverage Costs) are not available to pay such unreimbursed or
unpaid Coverage Costs or the Claims Handling Fee due to restrictions on the use
of such Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries imposed by any Asbestos Insurance
Settlement Agreement, the Plan Trust will reimburse and pay promptly the
Reorganized Debtors from unrestricted funds held by the Plan Trust and/or grant
the Reorganized Debtors the right to offset any such unreimbursed or unpaid
Coverage Costs against any future payments due by the Reorganized Debtors under
the Promissory Note. Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries will not be reserved
for the payment of Coverage Costs not yet incurred or not yet payable under the
terms of Section 3.4(e) of the Plan Trust Agreement. Coverage Costs will be paid
out of any Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries after the date when such
Coverage Costs are or become payable under Section 3.4(e) of the Plan Trust
Agreement.

            Based upon Congoleum's knowledge of its current and future
operations, current and future financial projections and current Asbestos
Claims, and the general asbestos liabilities of similarly situated companies, it
is anticipated that the Plan Trust may not be able to pay in full all Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims as they are liquidated and may not be able to pay all Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims in full over time. However, it can be stated with certainty that
(a) Congoleum has committed substantial resources for the payment of Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims, far exceeding those resources allocated to any other creditor
group under the Plan; and (b) the mechanisms of the Plan Trust have been
designed to provide reasonable assurance that the Plan Trust will value, and
will be in a financial position to pay, similar present and future Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims against the Debtors in substantially the same manner. The Plan
Trust will be administered by the Plan Trustee pursuant to the Plan Trust
Agreement and the procedures contained therein.

            Injunctions: The Plan will permit the businesses of the Reorganized
Debtors to operate free of asbestos-related claims and litigation, through the
operation of the following injunctions pursuant to sections 105, 524(g) and 1141
of the Bankruptcy Code (the "Injunctions"):

            Discharge Injunction: The Reorganized Debtors will be protected from
Claims and litigation by Congoleum's discharge and the Discharge Injunction,
which will prohibit and enjoin the taking of any legal action against Congoleum,
Reorganized Congoleum and others based upon any Claim, Asbestos Claim or Demand.
For a complete description of the Discharge Injunction, see Section 11.5 of the
Plan.

            Asbestos Channeling Injunction: The Plan provides for an injunction
pursuant to section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code with respect to Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims against the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors and any Protected
Party.


                                        7
<PAGE>

            Management: On the Effective Date, the management, control and
operation of the Reorganized Debtors will become the responsibility of the
boards of directors of the Reorganized Debtors. The boards of directors will be
comprised of the same person(s) who serve as director(s) of the Debtors
immediately prior to the Confirmation Hearing. The current officers of the
Company will serve as the initial officers of the Reorganized Debtors.

            Plan Classes: The Plan divides all Claims and Interests into 14
different Classes. Each Claim will receive the same treatment as all other
Claims in the same Class under the Plan, so that the applicable terms of the
Plan for each Claim depend upon its classification. Section 1.6 -- "Summary
Description of Classes and Distributions" below, contains a summary description
of the treatment of each Class under the Plan, including whether the Class is
Impaired or Unimpaired by the Plan and whether the Claims in the Class are
channeled into and addressed by the Plan Trust. If a Class is Impaired by the
Plan, that Class is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan under section
1126 of the Bankruptcy Code. If the Claims in a Class are channeled to,
addressed, processed and paid by the Plan Trust in accordance with the Plan
Trust and the TDP, that Class is entitled to vote in favor of or against the
Plan under section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.

            TDP: The TDP to be adopted by the Plan Trust pursuant to the Plan
Trust Agreement will establish procedures to assign a value to all Claims under
the TDP (other than the Asbestos Personal Injury Claims of Qualified Claimants)
(the "TDP Valued Asbestos Claims") and determine the timing and amount of
payments to be made in respect of all Asbestos Personal Injury Claims. It is
anticipated that the TDP will reduce expenses significantly, which expenses
would otherwise reduce Plan Trust Assets available for distribution. All holders
of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims will benefit from such cost savings, by maximizing
the assets which are to be used for the payment of such Claims. A copy of the
current form of the TDP is attached as Exhibit "H" of the Plan. It is possible
that the TDP may be modified prior to the Effective Date and after the Effective
Date from time to time in accordance with the terms of the TDP and the Trust
Agreement.

1.6.  Summary Description of Classes and Distributions

            The distributions to each Class are summarized in the table set
forth below. The table is qualified in its entirety by reference to the more
detailed and complete descriptions set forth in the Plan and elsewhere in this
Disclosure Statement.

                        receive Cash for the unpaid portion of such Allowed

                        Reorganization Cases in the ordinary course of business
                        or under a loan or advance which are not paid on or
                        before the Effective Date will be paid by the
                        Reorganized Debtors in accordance with the terms and
                        conditions of the particular transactions relating to
                        such liabilities and any agreements relating thereto.

                        Tax Claim will either (a) be paid in Cash in full on the
                        Distribution Date or (b) at the Reorganized Debtors'

                        period not to exceed six years after the date of
                        assessment of a value equal to such Allowed Priority Tax
                        Claim as of the Effective Date.

Class 1 - Priority      Unless the Debtors and the holder of an Allowed Priority
Claims                  Claim agree to a different treatment, each Allowed

                        settlement amounts, as determined under the Collateral
                        Trust Agreement and the respective Pre-Petition

                        Claimant will, in respect of its Secured Asbestos Claim,
                        be paid by the Plan Trust, in full satisfaction,
                        settlement, release, and discharge of and in exchange
                        for such Claim, in Cash in accordance with the
                        provisions of the Asbestos Settlement Documents
                        (including priority of payment and subject to the

                        the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement) which will be
                        incorporated in the Plan Trust Agreement and TDP. Class
                        2 is Impaired and holders of Class 2 Claims are entitled

                        percent (75%) of the Qualified Participating Claimant's
                        Settlement Amount. The Qualified Participating Claimants
                        will be paid by the Plan Trust, in full satisfaction,
                        settlement, release, and discharge of and in exchange

                        payment of Plan Trust Expenses in accordance with the
                        terms of the Plan Trust Agreement) which will be
                        incorporated in the Plan Trust Agreement and TDP. Each
                        Qualified Participating Claimant holds an Unsecured

Class 4 - Lender        On the Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement, as
Secured Claims          ratified, amended and approved in accordance with the
                        Financing Order (as hereinafter defined), will be
                        amended and restated in accordance with the terms of the
                        Amended Credit Agreement and the holder of the Allowed
                        Lender Secured Claim will be entitled to all the rights
                        and benefits under the Amended Credit Agreement and
                        related documents. The Amended Credit Agreement will be
                        on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the
                        Debtors and Congress Financial Corporation ("Congress").
                        Alternatively, if, as of the Confirmation Hearing, the
                        Debtors and the holder of the Lender Secured Claim have
                        not agreed upon the terms of the Amended Credit
                        Agreement, the Lender Secured Claim will be paid in full
                        indefeasibly on the Effective Date or as soon thereafter
                        as practicable and Congress will be released from any

provided by the Collateral Trustee or its designee pursuant to the Plan (less
all amounts in respect thereof previously received by the holder thereof from
any Debtor, the Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor trust)). Such

Trust Expenses and any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in
accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement (such net proceeds are

Claims (that is, the Liquidated Value of such Class 2 Claims less all amounts in
respect thereof previously received by the holder thereof from any Debtor, the
Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor trust); provided that such
distributions will not be prior to payment of or reserve for Plan Trust Expenses
nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in accordance with
the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement. Such Class 2 Claims will be paid in the

follows, provided that such distributions will not be prior to payment of or
reserve for Plan Trust Expenses nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for
Coverage Costs in accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement:

                        (A) Fifty percent (50%) to Qualified Participating
Claimants (holders of Allowed Class 3 Claims) on a pro rata basis, determined by
multiplying the aggregate amount of the distribution to be made by a fraction,
the numerator of which is the applicable Qualified Participating Claimant's
Secured Asbestos Claim and the denominator of which is the total of all
Qualified Participating Claimants' Secured Asbestos Claims; provided the
aggregate of all distributions made under this subsection to a Qualified
Participating Claimant will not exceed such Qualified Participating Claimant's
Secured Asbestos Claim (less all amounts in respect thereof previously received
by the holder thereof from any Debtor, the Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or
any successor trust); and

                        (B) Fifty percent (50%) to Payment Percentage Claims in

proceeds of any Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries, net of any payment of or
reserve for Plan Trust Expenses and any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage
Costs in accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement, to the Payment
Percentage Claims in accordance with the TDP, provided that such distributions
shall not be prior to payment of or reserve for Plan Trust Expenses nor prior to
payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in accordance with the terms of
the Plan Trust Agreement.

                               GENERAL INFORMATION

2.1.  Business of the Company Generally

      (a)   Congoleum

            Congoleum was incorporated in Delaware in 1986, but traces its
history in the flooring business back to Nairn Linoleum Co. which began in 1886.
Congoleum is the result of a 1986 merger between Resilco, Inc., a then


                                       15
<PAGE>

subsidiary of a company previously known as Congoleum Industries, Inc., which
subsidiary owned the resilient flooring operations that were later owned by
Congoleum, and Resilient Acquisition Inc., a company formed for the purposes of
merging with Resilco, Inc. The surviving corporation to that merger changed its
name to Congoleum Corporation.

            In 1993, the business and assets of Congoleum and those of the
Amtico Tile Division of ABI, which consisted of ABI's then existing U.S.
flooring division (the "Tile Division"), were combined (the "Acquisition"). The
Acquisition was effected through the organization of a new corporation,
Congoleum Holdings Incorporated ("Congoleum Holdings"), to which Hillside
Industries Incorporated ("Hillside Industries") contributed all of the
outstanding capital stock of Resilient Holdings Incorporated ("Resilient"), the
owner of all of the outstanding capital stock of Congoleum, and to which ABI
contributed the assets and certain liabilities of the Tile Division. Upon
consummation of the Acquisition, Congoleum Holdings owned all of the outstanding
capital stock of Resilient, which, in turn, owned all of the outstanding capital
stock of Congoleum, and Congoleum owned the Tile Division. The assets and
liabilities comprising the Tile Division which were acquired by Congoleum in the
Acquisition are held directly by Congoleum.

            Pursuant to the Acquisition, subject to certain exceptions,
Congoleum is obligated to indemnify ABI for, among other things, all liabilities
relating to ABI's former Tile Division, including, among others, liabilities
related to product liability asbestos claims, to the extent that insurance
proceeds related thereto are not actually recovered by ABI or ABI is not
reimbursed or indemnified for those liabilities by any other source or entity
(the "ABI Indemnification"). As of December 31, 2003, pursuant to the ABI
Indemnification, Congoleum has paid ABI an aggregate amount of approximately
$2.3 million for indemnified costs, expenses and liabilities incurred by ABI for
asbestos-related claims pertaining to ABI's former Tile Division.

            In 1995, Congoleum completed a public offering (the "Offering") of
4,650,000 shares of its Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Class A Common Stock"). The Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote per
share. Upon completion of the Offering, Congoleum implemented a Plan of
Repurchase pursuant to which its two-tiered holding company ownership structure
was eliminated through the merger of Congoleum Holdings, Resilient and
Congoleum, pursuant to which Congoleum was the surviving corporation. Congoleum
used most of the proceeds from the Offering to repurchase most of the shares of
its Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the "Class B Common
Stock"), owned by Hillside (the "Repurchase"), which was, indirectly, the
majority stockholder of Congoleum prior to the Repurchase. Congoleum's Class B
Common Stock is generally entitled to two votes per share. As a result of the
Repurchase, ABI acquired voting control of Congoleum.

            Since the Repurchase, ABI's equity ownership interest in Congoleum
has further increased as a result of Congoleum's repurchases of its common stock
combined with open market purchases by ABI of Congoleum's common stock. As of
October 31, 2004, ABI's ownership of 151,100 shares of Class A Common Stock and
4,395,605 shares of Class B common stock represented 69.5% of the voting control
of Congoleum.

            Congoleum produces both sheet and tile floor covering products with
a wide variety of product features, designs and colors. Congoleum also produces
through-chip inlaid products for both residential and commercial markets. In


                                       16
<PAGE>

addition, Congoleum purchases sundries and accessory products for resale.
Congoleum's products serve both the residential and commercial hard-surface
flooring markets, and are used in remodeling, manufactured housing, new
construction and commercial applications.

            Congoleum owns four manufacturing facilities located in Maryland,
Pennsylvania and New Jersey and leases corporate and marketing offices in
Mercerville, New Jersey, as well as storage space in Trenton, New Jersey, which
are described as follows:

            The Marcus Hook facility is capable of manufacturing rotogravure
printed sheet flooring in widths of up to 16 feet. Major production lines at
this facility include a 12-foot wide oven, two 16-foot wide ovens, a 12-foot
wide printing press and a 16-foot wide printing press.

            The Trenton sheet facility is capable of manufacturing rotogravure
printed and through-chip inlaid sheet products in widths up to 6 feet. Major
production lines, all six-foot wide, include an oven, a rotary laminating line
and a press. The examination, packing and warehousing of all sheet products
(except products for the manufactured housing segment) occur at the Trenton
plant distribution center.

            The Trenton tile facility consists of three major production lines,
a four-foot wide commercial tile line, a two-foot wide residential tile line and
a one-foot wide residential tile line.

            Productive capacity and extent of utilization of Congoleum's
facilities are dependent on a number of factors, including the size,
construction, and quantity of product being manufactured, some of which also
dictate which production line(s) must be utilized to make a given product.
Congoleum's major production lines were operated an average of 88% of the hours
available on a five-day, three-shift basis in 2003, with the corresponding
figure for individual production lines ranging from 36% to 105%.

            Although many of Congoleum's manufacturing facilities have been
substantially depreciated, Congoleum has generally maintained and improved the
productive capacity of these facilities over time through a program of regular
capital expenditures. Congoleum considers its manufacturing facilities to be
adequate for its present and anticipated near-term production needs.

            Congoleum is one of many defendants in a large number of actions
filed by individuals alleging injuries resulting from exposure to asbestos and
asbestos-containing products, including resilient sheet vinyl and tile
manufactured by Congoleum and tile manufactured by the Tile Division or, in the
worker's compensation cases, from exposure to asbestos in the course of


                                       17

employment with Congoleum. Congoleum discontinued the manufacture of
asbestos-containing sheet products in 1983 and asbestos-containing tile products
in 1974.

            Congoleum is covered under liability insurance policies that provide
coverage for Asbestos Claims. A description of Congoleum's historical asbestos
liabilities is set forth in Section 2.2(a) -- "Asbestos Claims Against
Congoleum" below. A description of certain Congoleum insurance assets relating
to Asbestos Claims is located in Section 2.2(b) --"Congoleum's Insurance
Coverage for Asbestos-Related Personal Injury Claims" below. A more detailed
description of Congoleum's business and other material assets is located in
Article 4 -- "The Company: Corporate Structure and Management" below.

      (b)   CFI

            CFI was incorporated on January 24, 2003 under the laws of the State
of New York as a wholly owned subsidiary of Congoleum Financial Corporation,
which was a wholly owned subsidiary of Congoleum. On January 27, 2003, Congoleum
Financial Corporation was merged with and into CFI, with CFI surviving the
merger, and the separate legal existence of Congoleum Financial Corporation
ceased. CFI is a wholly owned subsidiary of Congoleum and a limited guarantor of
Congoleum's obligations under the Existing Credit Agreement.

            Congoleum Financial Corporation was incorporated on November 12,
1998 under the laws of the State of Delaware. Congoleum Financial Corporation's
business included providing debt financing to Congoleum. As of the date of this
Disclosure Statement, Congoleum did not have any debt outstanding with CFI.

      (c)   CSI

            CSI was incorporated on January 24, 2003 under the laws of the State
of New York as a wholly owned subsidiary of Congoleum. CSI's business includes
providing sales and promotion services for the purpose of promoting Congoleum's
business. CSI is a limited guarantor of Congoleum's obligations under the
Existing Credit Agreement.

2.2.  Factors Leading to the Need for Bankruptcy Relief

      (a)   Asbestos Claims Against Congoleum

            Congoleum, along with many of its competitor sheet vinyl and tile
manufacturers, has become the subject of numerous claims by individuals
asserting bodily injury as a result of alleged exposure to asbestos-containing
products. As a result of the explosion of asbestos claims and litigation in
recent years, and the increasing costs of settlement and defense, certain sheet
vinyl and tile manufacturers and many others in related industries, including
distributors and contractors similar to Congoleum, have filed Chapter 11
proceedings.

            As of December 31, 2000, there were approximately 12,000 known
claimants with Asbestos Personal Injury Claims pending against Congoleum. As of
December 31, 2001, there were approximately 25,000 known claimants with Asbestos
Personal Injury Claims pending against Congoleum. As of December 31, 2002, there
were approximately 56,000 known claimants with Asbestos Personal Injury Claims
pending against Congoleum. As of June 30, 2003, there were approximately 91,000


                                       18
<PAGE>

known claimants with Asbestos Personal Injury Claims pending against Congoleum.
Thus, the number of known claimants with Asbestos Personal Injury Claims pending
against Congoleum doubled from 2001 to 2002, and nearly doubled in the first six
months of 2003.

            In the spring of 2001, two damages verdicts in the amount of
approximately $18.2 million and $15.8 million, respectively, were rendered
against Congoleum in asbestos personal injury claims brought by Kenneth Cook and
Richard Arsenault in New York State Supreme Court, New York County. Although
under the reverse bifurcation procedure then in effect in New York, liability
would still have to be established, the liability trial was to be held
immediately. Congoleum retained a leading jury consulting firm to conduct a mock
trial to assess its likelihood of prevailing at trial and was advised that it
was likely to lose. During the period following August 2002, Congoleum faced a
situation in which its primary insurers claimed that their policies were
exhausted (as supported by applicable New Jersey law at the time) while at the
same time its excess carriers claimed that the primary layers were not exhausted
and that therefore excess coverage was not available. This left Congoleum with
no carriers ready and willing to pay claims. Thus, Congoleum was placed in an
untenable position as a result of the foregoing confluence of events. The
insurers' refusal to defend and indemnify Congoleum caused it to begin the
process of seeking a global resolution in the form of a prepackaged bankruptcy.

            During the fourth quarter of 2002, Congoleum engaged an outside
actuary to conduct an updated analysis of Congoleum's asbestos-related
liabilities. Developments during the latter part of 2002 included a significant
increase in claims filed against Congoleum and higher settlement requirements,
and the exhaustion of primary insurance coverage combined with a dispute of
coverage by certain of its excess insurance carriers. These developments in turn
led to Congoleum's plan to file a plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code. The study concluded that the minimum gross liability for the
56,567 known claimants at December 31, 2002, using historical settlement
payments, was $310 million. This amount did not include defense costs, liability
for the 30,000 additional claimants purportedly existing at December 31, 2002,
or for future claims, which the study concluded could not be reasonably
determined in light of the available data and uncertainty arising from an
announced bankruptcy filing. Congoleum's estimated minimum gross liability is
substantially in excess of both the total assets of Congoleum (without giving
effect to rights under insurance policies) as well as Congoleum's previous
estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for both known and
unasserted claims. Congoleum believes that (without giving effect to rights
under insurance policies) it does not have the necessary financial resources to
litigate and/or fund judgments and/or settlements of the asbestos claims in the
ordinary course of business. Congoleum believes that its going concern or
liquidation value is substantially less than the minimum gross liability for the
known asbestos claims against it.

            Between January 1, 2002 and December 31, 2003, Congoleum settled
with in excess of 79,000 Asbestos Claimants.

      (b)   Congoleum's Insurance Coverage for Asbestos-Related Personal Injury
            Claims

            To date, Congoleum has discovered excess insurance policies (in
whole or in part), or evidence of excess policies, that were issued to Congoleum
beginning in December 1953, and which Congoleum believes cover claims by third
parties injured by its activities, including but not limited to claims alleging
injury from asbestos. Such policies obligate the insurers to pay amounts that
Congoleum becomes liable to pay in connection with, among other things, claims
alleging bodily injury. Generally, such policies also obligate the insurers to
pay defense costs in connection with claims against Congoleum, either in
addition to the applicable limits of liability of the policies, as in the case
of primary and some excess policies, or subject to such limits of liability. The
discussion in this Section 2.2(b) applies only to policy periods through 1985.

            The liability policies purchased by Congoleum generally provide two
types of limits of liability. The first type, the "per occurrence" limit,
generally limits the amount the insurer will pay in connection with a single
"occurrence" to which the limit applies, as the term "occurrence" is defined in
the policy. The second type, the "aggregate" limit, generally limits the total
amount the insurer will pay in connection with all occurrences covered by the
policy for bodily injury to which the aggregate limit applies.

            In the context of asbestos personal injury, the policies purchased
by Congoleum generally provide coverage for two fundamental types of claims. The
first type consists of claims in which the alleged exposure to asbestos is
within the "products hazard" or the "completed operation's hazard" as those
terms are defined in the policies. Such claims, referred to herein as "products"
claims, include claims alleging exposure to asbestos-containing products
manufactured or sold by Congoleum. In many states, including New Jersey,
asbestos claims within the "products hazard" are considered a single occurrence
subject to annual limits in each insurance policy. In addition, coverage for
products claims may be subject to a specified annual aggregate limit of
liability under some of the policies purchased by Congoleum.

            The second type of claim involves exposure not within the scope of
the policies' products hazard or completed operations hazard. Such claims,
referred to herein as "non-products" claims, include claims involving alleged
exposure to asbestos-containing materials, whether or not manufactured by
Congoleum while such materials were present at premises or facilities owned or
operated by Congoleum or at locations where asbestos material may have been
disposed of by Congoleum. Although non-products claims have been asserted
against Congoleum, the vast majority of asbestos-related claims that have been
brought to date are products claims.

            During the period in which Congoleum produced asbestos-containing
products, Congoleum purchased primary and excess insurance policies providing in
excess of $1 billion of limits of liability for general and product liability
claims. Through August 2002, substantially all asbestos-related claims and
defense costs were paid through primary insurance coverage. In February 2002 and
then in August 2002, Congoleum received notice from its two lead primary
insurance carriers that its primary insurance coverage was exhausted.


                                       20
<PAGE>

            The exhaustion of limits by one of the primary insurance companies
was based on its contention that limits in successive policies were not
cumulative for asbestos claims with the "products hazard" and that Congoleum was
limited to only one per occurrence limit for multiple years of coverage for such
claims. Certain excess insurance carriers claimed that the non-cumulation
provisions of the primary policies were not binding on them and that there
remained an additional $13 million in indemnity coverage plus related defense
costs before their policies were implicated. On April 10, 2003, the New Jersey
Supreme Court ruled in another case involving the same non-cumulation provisions
as in the Congoleum primary policies (the "Spaulding Case") that the
non-cumulation provisions are invalid under New Jersey law and that the primary
policies provide coverage for the full amount of their annual limits for all
successive policies. Although Congoleum was not a party to this case, the
decision in the Spaulding Case was likely binding on Congoleum and its primary
insurance company. Thus, based on the Spaulding Case decision, the primary
insurance company became obligated to provide the additional $13 million of
coverage previously disputed by the excess carriers. After the Spaulding
decision was decided, Congoleum entered into settlement negotiations and reached
a settlement with the primary insurance company that had previously contended
that limits in successive policies were not cumulative for asbestos claims
within the "products hazard."

            Prior to the decision in Spaulding, Congoleum had entered into
settlement agreements with asbestos claimants exceeding the $13 million amount
of previously disputed coverage. The excess carriers objected to the
reasonableness of these settlements notwithstanding the decision in the
Spaulding case and the settlement with the primary insurance company, Congoleum
also believes that the excess carriers will continue to dispute the
reasonableness of the settlements, contend that their policies still are not
implicated and dispute their coverage for that and other various reasons in
ongoing coverage litigation. The excess carriers have also raised various
objections to Congoleum's reorganization strategy and negotiations.

      (c)   Coverage Litigation

            There is insurance coverage litigation currently pending between
Congoleum and its excess insurance carriers, and the guaranty funds and
associations for the State of New Jersey. The litigation was initiated on
September 15, 2001, by one of Congoleum's excess insurers. Congoleum has reached
settlements with its insurance brokers in this litigation. Congoleum has also
reached a settlement with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company, the primary
insurance company who had, prior to the Spaulding case decision, contended that
limits in successive policies were not cumulative for asbestos, which was
approved by the Bankruptcy Court on July 29, 2004.

            On February 26, 2003, one of Congoleum's excess insurers filed an
action for preliminary and permanent injunctive relief seeking, among other
things, an order enjoining Congoleum from entering into the Pre-Petition
Settlement Agreement and compelling Congoleum to allow insurers to participate
in the settlement discussions. The insurers also sought permission to file
amended counterclaims against Congoleum objecting to the terms of the
Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement. On March 26, 2003, the court denied the
insurers' request for injunctive relief.


                                       21
<PAGE>

            Since April 2003, the parties have conducted extensive discovery.
Congoleum has produced numerous employees and other representatives for multiple
days of depositions and has produced hundreds of thousands of pages of documents
relating to the Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement and the proposed prepackaged
bankruptcy proceeding. Discovery into the facts and circumstances leading to the
promulgation of the Plan currently is ongoing. Congoleum has also served and
received discovery requests and has conducted depositions of numerous insurance
company employees and representatives.

            On or about July 11, 2003, certain upper layer excess insurers
(i.e., those in the second excess layer and above) filed a motion for summary
judgment seeking to dismiss Congoleum's breach of contract claims as to such
upper layer excess carriers. On August 26, 2003, the Court granted the
defendants' motion. This ruling did not impact the declaratory judgment count of
the coverage litigation. The court also held that the ruling is not a
determination as to whether Congoleum had a right to enter into the Pre-Petition
Settlement Agreement and may not be used by the insurers to determine
Congoleum's ability to enforce insurance coverage for the Claims addressed in
the Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement. The court also held that the question of
whether there was a sound and reasonable basis for entering into the
Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement was not and could not be decided by this
motion.

            On September 10, 2003, one of Congoleum's excess insurers filed a
motion for summary judgment seeking a ruling that the Pre-Petition Settlement
Agreement is unreasonable and was entered into in bad faith as a matter of law.
Most of the excess insurers joined in the application. On November 7, 2003, the
court denied the insurers' motion for summary judgment in its entirety.

            In December 2003, several of Congoleum's excess insurers filed
motions for summary judgment seeking a ruling that Congoleum had violated the
duty to cooperate, consent to settle and anti-assignment provisions of their
insurance policies and, as a result, the Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement was
not enforceable against it. Most of the excess insurers joined in the
application. On April 19, 2004, the court denied the insurers' motions for
summary judgment in their entirety.

            On February 25, 2004, Congoleum filed an application for leave to
file a Third Amended Complaint against the excess insurers to allege claims for
breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing and for bad faith.
On March 5, 2004, the court granted Congoleum's application for leave to file a
Third Amended Complaint in its entirety. On or about March 12, 2004, Congoleum
filed the Third Amended Complaint and served each excess insurer with a copy.

            On March 22, 2004, Congoleum filed an application for a jury trial
during the Phase I trial. On April 19, 2004, the court denied Congoleum's
application. Congoleum filed an application for leave to appeal, but the
Appellate Division refused to consider the appeal of the jury trial ruling on an
interlocutory basis.

            On August 12, 2004, the court entered a new case management order
with respect to the pending insurance coverage litigation, Case Management Order
No. IV ("CMO IV"). CMO IV sets forth the deadlines for completing fact and
expert discovery. CMO IV also established deadlines for dispositive and
pre-trial motion practice. As of November 1, 2004, there is pending before the


                                       22
<PAGE>

court a proposed Case Management Order No. V which revises some, but not all, of
the discovery dates in CMO IV. The trial date for Phase 1 of the trial is
February 28, 2005 under both CMO IV and CMO V.

            The Phase 1 trial in the insurance coverage litigation is scheduled
to begin on February 28, 2005. The court has defined the scope of the Phase 1
trial as follows:

            All issues and claims relating to whether the insurers are obligated
            to provide coverage under the policies at issue in the litigation
            for the global claimant's agreement entered into by Congoleum,
            including but not limited to all issues and claims relating to both
            Congoleum's decision and conduct in entering into the Claimant
            Agreement and filing a pre-packaged bankruptcy and the insurance
            company defendants' decisions and conduct in opposing the Claimant
            Agreement and Congoleum's pre-packaged bankruptcy, the
            reasonableness and good faith of the Claimant Agreement, whether the
            Claimant Agreement breached any insurance policies and, if so,
            whether the insurance companies suffered any prejudice, and whether
            the insurance companies' opposition to the Claimant Agreement and
            bankruptcy and various other conduct by the insurers has breached
            their duties of good faith and fair dealing such that they are
            precluded from asserting that Congoleum's decision to enter into the
            Claimant Agreement constitutes any breach(es) on the part of
            Congoleum.

            The Phase 2 trial will address all remaining coverage issues,
including but not limited to trigger and allocation. The Phase 3 trial will
address claims and damages for bad faith and punitive damages, if appropriate.
Discovery is permitted on all issues, except for punitive damages. Pre-trial
motions and trial dates for the Phase 2 and Phase 3 trials and discovery for the
Phase 3 trial will be addressed by the court after the Phase 1 trial decision.

      (d)   Congoleum's Insurance Coverage for Asbestos Property Damage Claims

            The insurance policies purchased by Congoleum also provide coverage
for claims asserting property damage. In the context of asbestos property
damage, some, but not all, of Congoleum's primary policies provided separate
property damage limits, and some policies included property damage limits within
a combined single, overall policy aggregate or within the policy's products
aggregate limit. Thus, the property damage limits have been exhausted for some
years and not other years under Congoleum's primary policies. Congoleum has
identified certain primary insurance policies, set forth on Exhibit "A" to the
Plan, that provide separate property damage coverage limits. As a result of the
Liberty Settlement, discussed in Section 5.7 below, approximately $1.25 million
is earmarked for the payment of Asbestos Property Damage Claims.

                                   ARTICLE 3
             THE PRE-PETITION PROCESS AND PAYMENT OF ASBESTOS CLAIMS

3.1.  The Company's Reasons for Negotiating a Prepackaged Plan

            As both the volume of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and the
associated costs of defense and settlements increased, and as its principal
insurers refused to make further payments or became insolvent, Congoleum became
concerned about its ability to continue in business and to pay fair compensation
to claimants allegedly injured by its historical operations. Beginning in
October 2002, Congoleum consulted with its counsel regarding ways to compensate
legitimate Asbestos Claimants while preserving Congoleum's business, including
utilization of the special provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, including section
524(g), to accomplish this purpose.

            In an effort to further reduce the cost and disruption of a
bankruptcy filing, and to optimize the potential for preserving value, Congoleum
simultaneously negotiated the Claimant Agreement, the Security Agreement and the
Collateral Trust Agreement as described in Section 3.2 below. Congoleum also
structured the plan of reorganization as a prepackaged plan, in which
acceptances were solicited prior to filing the Reorganization Cases, in an
effort to reduce the duration and expense of the contemplated bankruptcy
proceedings and the risk that the contemplated bankruptcy proceedings would have
a material adverse impact upon Congoleum's business.

            Votes were solicited for the prepackaged plan and the votes received
were overwhelmingly in favor of the prepackaged plan. While the Debtors could
have proceeded to seek confirmation of the prepackaged plan, after filing these
Chapter 11 cases, the Debtors engaged in negotiations with various constituents
in an effort to develop consensual modifications. The Debtors were successful in
negotiating such consensual modifications and they are incorporated into the
Plan attached hereto as Exhibit A.

3.2.  The Initial Negotiation Process

      (a)   General Background

            Congoleum and the Claimants' Representative commenced preliminary
negotiations in December 2002. The negotiations focused first on the
desirability of a possible plan of reorganization and the settlements required
to position Congoleum for filing such a plan, and then on the terms of such a
plan.

            In connection with its attempts to negotiate a global resolution of
its asbestos liabilities in the form of a prepackaged plan of reorganization,
Congoleum of necessity dealt with the counsel who represent the largest number
of identified Asbestos Personal Injury Claims, the Claimants' Representative.
Due to the length of time necessary to negotiate a global resolution in the form
of a prepackaged plan of reorganization, Congoleum needed to persuade the
Claimants' Representative that they and their clients - many of whom had claims
at advanced stages in the litigation process and some of whom had already
received damages verdicts in their favor - should stand down rather than simply
engage in the normal race of diligence among creditors in a nonbankruptcy
setting. Otherwise, Congoleum was at risk of having its assets and businesses
destroyed by a race to reduce claims to judgment and execute on assets. The
affected claimants were thus being asked to extend what in substance was a form


                                       24
<PAGE>

of credit to Congoleum at a time when it was financially distressed. Not
surprisingly the Claimants' Representative wished that the positions of the
appropriate claimants be secured in order to induce them to stand down in the
tort system, in the same way that a previously unsecured creditor of a
distressed obligor might insist on getting "liened up" as an inducement to
rolling over a maturing debt. Consequently, the Claimant Agreement that was
eventually negotiated included a mechanism - the Collateral Trust - to make sure
that claimants with ripe claims were reasonably compensated and secured and
thereby induced to forbear during the prepetition period.

            The Claimants' Representative and Congoleum each evaluated the
Asbestos Personal Injury Claims presently asserted against Congoleum. The
parties examined historical data for Congoleum as well as other asbestos
defendants. The Kenesis Group, LLP was retained by Congoleum to assist it in its
assessment of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims values. An appropriate dollar
figure for the settlement amounts was reached by the parties during the course
of negotiations.

            As a result of these negotiations, Congoleum entered into the
following agreements:

            (i) the Claimant Agreement with the Claimants' Representative
pursuant to which Congoleum offered to settle existing Asbestos Claims and
provide collateral for payment of a substantial portion of such claims (see
Section 3.2(c) -- "Claimant Agreement," below, for a description of the Claimant
Agreement);

            (ii) the Collateral Trust Agreement with the Collateral Trustee
which provides, among other things and subject to certain conditions precedent,
for the receipt of certain payments from insurers and payment thereof to certain
Asbestos Claimants (see Section 3.2(e) -- "The Collateral Trust Agreement,"
below, for a description of the Collateral Trust Agreement); and

            (iii) the Security Agreement with the Collateral Trustee pursuant to
which Congoleum granted a security interest in Congoleum's rights under and
proceeds of insurance coverage for asbestos-related liabilities to the
Collateral Trustee for the benefit of the holders of Secured Asbestos Claims
(see Section 3.2(f) -- "The Security Agreement," below, for a description of the
Security Agreement).

            Copies of any of the Asbestos Settlement Documents may be obtained
by contacting the Voting Agent at: The Altman Group, Inc., 60 East 42nd Street,
Suite 405, New York, NY 10165, Attn: Ken Altman.

            The settlement amounts established under the Asbestos Settlement
Documents represent heavily negotiated figures that take into account factors,
including the cost of inflation, the increases in settlement costs and jury
awards and the costs of litigating unsubstantiated claims.

      (b)   Negotiations with Asbestos Insurance Companies

            Before ultimately deciding to pursue a prepackaged plan of
reorganization, beginning in July 2001 and continuing through December 2002,
Congoleum attempted to resolve its disputes with its numerous asbestos insurance


                                       25
<PAGE>

companies (collectively, the "Insurance Companies"). Those efforts were
unsuccessful and Congoleum found itself facing potential serious cash flow
problems due to the drain on resources from asbestos-related defense costs and
concerns this uncertainty created on the part of suppliers and lenders.
Considering its options, Congoleum decided to utilize the trust mechanisms
provided by section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code to efficiently, promptly, and
fairly resolve its asbestos liability claims.

            In a January 13, 2003 press release, Congoleum publicly stated its
desire to resolve its asbestos liabilities by possibly filing a Chapter 11
prepackaged plan. Congoleum's insurance counsel, Dughi, Hewit & Palatucci
("DH&P"), circulated the press release to all the Insurance Companies.

            The Insurance Companies expressed opposition to Congoleum's proposed
plan to resolve its liability by filing a Chapter 11 prepackaged plan and
requested meetings and on-going communications with Congoleum concerning, among
other things, the negotiation and drafting of the Asbestos Settlement Documents.
Congoleum met with representatives from several Insurance Companies four times
during February and March of 2003 and also forwarded to them drafts of the
Claimant Agreement (a copy of which is attached hereto as Exhibit "E").

            The Insurance Companies requested some changes to the Asbestos
Settlement Documents, and also continued to object to Congoleum entering into or
finalizing the Claimant Agreement and other Asbestos Settlement Documents. Some
of the changes to the Asbestos Settlement Documents requested by the Insurance
Companies were implemented, but no settlement was reached between Congoleum and
the Insurance Companies, and the Insurance Companies continued to object to
terms contained in the Asbestos Settlement Documents.

            On April 18, 2003, Congoleum forwarded executed copies of the
Claimant Agreement to, among other parties, the Insurance Companies.

      (c)   Claimant Agreement

            Under the terms of the Claimant Agreement, the amounts due to
Qualified Participating Claimants are fixed by the compensable disease matrix
attached to the Claimant Agreement. Each Qualified Participating Claimant
provided evidence of his or her bodily injury, sickness or disease and a
verification that such Qualified Participating Claimant was exposed to asbestos
or an asbestos-containing product for which Congoleum may have liability. In
addition, each Qualified Participating Claimant submitted a release in a form
acceptable to Congoleum. The Claims Reviewer reviewed such documentation
submitted by each potential Qualified Participating Claimant in order to ensure
its completeness and adequacy. If the documentation was incomplete or
inadequate, the Claims Reviewer informed Claimants' Counsel and such potential
Qualified Participating Claimant had the opportunity to remedy the deficiency
within the timeframe provided in the Claimant Agreement. If the documentation
was complete and adequate, the Claims Reviewer approved the Claim and forwarded
such Claim for payment in accordance with the Claimant Agreement.

            The payment of the settlement amounts to the Qualified Participating
Claimants is partially secured by a security interest granted to the Collateral
Trustee in the Asbestos Insurance Collateral. See Section 3.2(f) -- "The
Security Agreement" for a general description of the lien granted in the


                                       26
<PAGE>

Asbestos Insurance Rights. The security interest will secure an amount equal to
seventy-five percent of the aggregate of all of the amounts for which Qualified
Participating Claims are settled under the Claimant Agreement.

            Pursuant to the Claimant Agreement, Congoleum advanced $1,000,000 to
each Claimants' Representative to pay out-of-pocket expenses, reasonable
professionals' fees and expenses, and other costs such counsel may have incurred
or may incur in connection with (i) the negotiation and implementation of the
Asbestos Settlement Documents, (ii) the negotiation of a prepackaged chapter 11
plan of reorganization for Congoleum, (iii) due diligence investigations related
to a possible chapter 11 plan of reorganization; and (iv) defending the Claimant
Agreement.

      (d)   Pre-Petition Settlement Agreements

            The Pre-Petition Settlement Agreements address the Claims of
Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants with whom Congoleum entered into various
settlement agreements. Pursuant to the Claimant Agreement, a UCC-1 financing
statement was filed by the Collateral Trustee to perfect the lien securing the
liabilities set forth in the Security Agreement. The Secured Asbestos Claims of
Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants are secured to the full extent of
their liquidated settlement amounts, as determined under the Collateral Trust
Agreement and the respective Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement. On the Effective
Date, the Plan Trust will automatically assume all liability for Secured
Asbestos Claims and the Reorganized Debtors will have no liability for Secured
Asbestos Claims. On the Effective Date, all of the Collateral Trust's right,
title and interest in and to any assets or properties then held by the
Collateral Trust will automatically be transferred and assigned to, and vest in,
the Plan Trust free and clear of all Liens, Claims and encumbrances except for
Liens filed for the benefit of Richard Arsenault, Kenneth Cook and Dennis
Matthews and all rights with respect to such assets and properties will be
enforceable by the Plan Trust.

      (e)   The Collateral Trust Agreement

            Congoleum established the Collateral Trust to hold the security
interest in the Asbestos Insurance Collateral (as defined therein) and to act as
a vehicle to transfer the proceeds thereof to Secured Asbestos Claimants with
respect to their Secured Asbestos Claims. Under the terms of the Collateral
Trust Agreement, the Collateral Trust is the direct recipient of the proceeds of
the Asbestos Insurance Collateral. The Collateral Trust will transfer all of its
assets and liabilities to the Plan Trust upon or as soon as practicable after
the Plan Trust's establishment and the Plan Trust will preserve the rights of
the beneficiaries of the Collateral Trust and provides for the transfer of such
assets and liabilities.

            The Collateral Trustee is Arthur J. Pergament, who will serve until
the earlier of his resignation or removal or the termination of the Collateral
Trust. The Collateral Trustee at all times acts as a fiduciary of the Collateral
Trust and in accordance with the Collateral Trust Agreement. The Collateral
Trustee earns $195 per hour for his time devoted to business of the Collateral
Trust. The hourly rate may be adjusted over time as appropriate with the consent
of the Claimants' Representative. In addition, the Collateral Trustee is
reimbursed for any reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses from the assets
of the Collateral Trust.

            Wilmington Trust Company serves as the Delaware trustee for the
Collateral Trust. The Delaware trustee is a trustee for the sole and limited
purpose of fulfilling the requirements of Section 3807 of chapter 38 of Title 12
of the Delaware Code, 12 Del. C. ss.ss. 3801 et seq. The Delaware trustee
receives compensation from the Collateral Trust for its service as Delaware
trustee at the rates detailed in a mutually acceptable fee agreement. The
Collateral Trust will reimburse the Delaware trustee for all reasonable
out-of-pocket costs and expenses incurred by the Delaware trustee in connection
with the performance of its duties, at the rates detailed in the fee agreement.

      (f)   The Security Agreement

            Congoleum granted to the Collateral Trustee a security interest in
the Asbestos Insurance Collateral (as defined in the Collateral Trust
Agreement), which consists generally of (i) all of Congoleum's claims, causes of
action and rights to receive payment from its insurers for its benefit to
satisfy claims against it, net of certain fees and expenses, and (ii) the
proceeds of any of the above, net of certain fees and expenses. The Asbestos
Insurance Collateral secures all of the Secured Asbestos Claims.

3.3.  Selection of the Futures Representative

            Congoleum considered candidates to serve as the Futures
Representative to represent the interests of Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants
who are presently unknown. After reviewing the qualifications and potential
conflicts of certain candidates, and following careful deliberation, Congoleum
asked R. Scott Williams to serve as the Futures Representative.

            Mr. Williams is a member of the Litigation Practice Group of Haskell
Slaughter Young & Rediker, L.L.C. Mr. Williams holds degrees from the University
of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (B.A. 1985) and the University of Alabama School
of Law (J.D. 1988). Prior to joining Haskell Slaughter Young & Rediker, L.L.C.,
Mr. Williams served United States Senator Howell Heflin as counsel to the United
States Senate Judiciary Committee and as judicial clerk to the Honorable Sharon
Lovelace Blackburn of the United States District Court for the Northern District
of Alabama. Mr. Williams was admitted to the Alabama Bar in 1988 and his
practice specializes in bankruptcy and commercial litigation. Mr. Williams is a
frequent lecturer and author on bankruptcy and commercial litigation related
topics and he currently serves as a contributing editor to Collier on Bankruptcy
(15th Ed. Revised). Mr. Williams is a past president of the Birmingham Bar
Bankruptcy and Commercial Law Section and is a former member of the Birmingham
Bar Executive Committee. In addition, Mr. Williams is an active member of the
American Bankruptcy Institute and has served in a variety of leadership roles
for that organization.

            Mr. Williams served as the futures representative in the prepackaged
Chapter 11 case of In re Shook & Fletcher Insulation Co., U.S.B.C. N.D. Al.,
Case No.: 02-02771-BGC-11. Mr. Williams has never represented a current
plaintiff, defendant, or insurer in connection with asbestos litigation against
Congoleum, and, other than being selected as the Futures Representative, has
never had a relationship with, or connection to, Congoleum or any of its
Affiliates.

                                       28

            Mr. Williams' appointment has been approved by the Bankruptcy Court.
See Section 5.4 - "Bankruptcy Court Appointment of Futures Representative".

3.4.  Formation of the Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee

            During the course of the negotiations of the prepackaged plan
documents, various representatives of the holders of Asbestos Personal Injury
Claims engaged in discussions with the Claimants' Representative concerning the
possible pre-packaged bankruptcy filing by the Company. Such discussions
culminated in the formation of the Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee
which consisted of the following members: Perry Weitz, Esquire, Joe Rice,
Esquire, Steve Kazan, Esquire, Russell Budd, Esquire, Bryan Blevins, Esquire,
John Cooney, Esquire and Matt Bergmann, Esquire. The members of the Pre-Petition
Asbestos Claimants' Committee represented a majority of the holders of Asbestos
Personal Injury Claims and a diverse mix of the types of such Asbestos
Claimants.

3.5.  Due Diligence Review

            The Claimants' Representative engaged L. Tersigni Consulting, P.C.
("LTC") to conduct a due diligence investigation of (a) the business affairs of
Congoleum, (b) the equity value of Congoleum, and (c) the feasibility of a plan
of reorganization. The Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee was also
apprised of the results of the due diligence investigation undertaken by LTC and
considered such results in connection with its review and approval of the
prepackaged plan of reorganization. LTC's due diligence review consisted of a
thorough investigation of the past and present business activities of Congoleum
and the relationship between Congoleum and its Affiliates. Congoleum cooperated
with LTC in its investigation and produced numerous documents in response to the
requests of LTC. The Futures Representative and his professionals (including
CIBC World Markets Corp.) conducted their own due diligence review, including
consulting with advisors to the Company and the Claimants' Representative.

3.6.  Pre-Petition Plan Negotiations

            In December 2002, Congoleum, the Claimants' Representative and ABI
began preliminary negotiations regarding the terms of a prepackaged plan of
reorganization. Congoleum, through its counsel, prepared a proposed draft plan
of reorganization reflecting the tentative agreements reached among the parties.
Counsel to Congoleum, the Claimants' Representative, the Futures Representative
(subsequent to his appointment by the Debtors in June 2003), ABI and counsel to
ABI reviewed the draft plan and related documents and engaged in extensive
negotiations regarding many of the operative provisions of those documents. The
goal of all parties to these negotiations, in addition to achieving the maximum
benefit for their respective interests or clients, was to insure that the
resulting plan documents were fair and equitable and satisfied the requirements
of the Bankruptcy Code in general and section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code in
particular. Prior to the final conclusion of such negotiations, the Pre-Petition
Asbestos Claimants' Committee participated in the final negotiation, review and
approval of the plan documents.

3.7.  Pre-Petition Solicitation

            On October 27, 2003, the Debtors commenced a pre-petition
solicitation with respect to a plan of reorganization (the "Pre-Petition
Solicitation"). The solicitation materials consisted of a disclosure statement
with a plan of reorganization attached as an exhibit thereto, a copy of the
Pre-petition Solicitation and Voting Procedures, an appropriate ballot or
ballots with instructions (depending upon which Class or Classes in which
holders of Claims were entitled to vote), a self-addressed return envelope,
letters in support of such plan from the Company and the Futures Representative,
and in certain instances, letters from counsel to holders of Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims to their respective clients (collectively, the "Pre-Petition
Solicitation Package").

            Votes were solicited from holders of Claims in Classes 2, 3, 4, 9
and 10 and holders of Interests in Class 12. Class 4, which is now an Unimpaired
Class, was designated as being an Impaired Class at the time of the Pre-Petition
Solicitation. There were no known holders of Claims in Class 11 at the time of
the Pre-Petition Solicitation and thus, votes could not be solicited from
holders of Claims in that Class. Holders of Priority Tax Claims and holders of
Claims in Classes 1, 5, 6 and 7 and holders of Interests in Classes 13 and 14
were sent Pre-Petition Solicitation Packages that included notices of non-voting
status in lieu of ballots. Holders of Claims in Class 8 - Workers' Compensation
Claims and holders of Claims in Class 7 who were employees of the Debtors were
not sent Pre-Petition Solicitation Packages. Instead, such claimants were
notified of such plan and their treatment under such plan separately by the
Debtors.

            The initial deadline for voting for the Pre-Petition Solicitation,
December 19, 2003, was extended by the Debtors to December 24, 2003. Based on
the votes received for the Pre-Petition Solicitation, as well as other
indications of support, such plan was overwhelmingly supported by a majority of
the Debtors' creditors, including the holders of Asbestos Personal Injury
Claims.

            While the Debtors could have proceeded to seek confirmation of the
prepackaged plan, after filing these Chapter 11 cases, the Debtors engaged in
negotiations with various constituents in an effort to develop consensual
modifications. The Debtors were successful in negotiating such consensual
modifications and they are incorporated into the Plan attached hereto as Exhibit
A.

4.5.  Debt and Equity Structure

      (a)   Summary of Pre-Petition Date Indebtedness

            (1) The Credit Facility

            On December 10, 2001, Congoleum entered into a three-year revolving
credit agreement (the "Credit Facility") with Congress which provides for
revolving loans and a letter of credit facility in an aggregate principal amount
of up to $30,000,000. Interest payable on revolving loans is equal to .25% above
a designated prime rate or 2.75% over an adjusted Eurodollar rate, as
applicable, depending on meeting the required covenants under the Credit
Facility. The Credit Facility contains certain covenants which include a
covenant requiring the maintenance of adjusted minimum tangible net worth and
EBITDA (i.e., earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) if
borrowing availability falls below a certain level. It also includes
restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and limitations on capital
expenditures. The covenants and conditions under the Credit Facility must be met
in order for Congoleum to borrow under the Credit Facility. The repayment
obligations of Congoleum are secured under the Credit Facility by a grant of a
perfected security interest in certain of Congoleum's inventory and accounts


                                       34
<PAGE>

receivable. In addition, Congoleum Financial Corporation and Congoleum
Intellectual Properties, Inc., wholly owned subsidiaries of Congoleum as of the
date of the Credit Facility, each granted a limited guarantee in favor of
Congress with regard to the obligations of Congoleum under the Credit Facility.

            Pursuant to the terms of the Credit Facility, amounts received by
Congoleum with regard to its accounts receivable and inventory which are subject
to the security interest granted by Congoleum to Congress are to be deposited by
Congoleum, and Congoleum is obligated to direct its customers to remit payments,
into a lockbox or blocked account, which funds are controlled and used by
Congress to offset outstanding amounts borrowed by Congoleum under the Credit
Facility.

            In September 2002, Congoleum and Congress amended the Credit
Facility to revise certain financial and other covenants. In February 2003,
Congoleum and Congress further amended the Credit Facility to revise certain
financial and other covenants on terms negotiated to reflect the transactions
contemplated by Congoleum's intended global settlement of its asbestos claims
liability. Pursuant to this amendment, CSI and CFI granted a limited guarantee
in favor of Congress with regard to the obligations of Congoleum under the
Credit Facility, which limited guarantee is substantially similar to the limited
guarantee that was previously granted by Congoleum Financial Corporation and
Congoleum Intellectual Properties, Inc., which entities are no longer in
existence. As of the Petition Date, the principal amount of all pre-petition
obligations owed by the Debtors to Congress, both absolute and contingent,
pursuant to the Credit Facility existing as of December 31, 2003 consisted of
the principal amount of not less than $14,325,937, plus all interest accrued and
accruing thereon and fees, costs, expenses and other charges accrued, accruing
or chargeable with respect thereto.

            Congress has provided debtor-in-possession financing during the
pendency of the Reorganization Cases. See Section 5.2(b) - - "DIP Financing".

            (2) The Senior Notes

            On August 3, 1998, Congoleum issued $100 million in aggregate
principal amount of 8?% Senior Notes Due 2008 (the "Senior Notes") priced at
99.505 to yield 8.70%. Interest is payable on the Senior Notes semiannually on
February 1 and August 1. The Senior Notes mature on August 1, 2008. The Senior
Notes are redeemable at the option of Congoleum, in whole or in part, at any
time on or after August 1, 2003 at predetermined redemption prices (ranging from
104% to 100%), plus accrued and unpaid interest to the date of redemption. The
Indenture under which the notes were issued includes certain restrictions on
additional indebtedness and uses of cash, including dividend payments.

            In March 2003, Congoleum and the trustee under the Indenture
governing the Senior Notes (the "Indenture Trustee") amended the Indenture to
expressly provide Congoleum, under the terms of that Indenture, with greater
flexibility to pursue possible resolutions of its current and future asbestos
claims liability, including negotiating a global settlement with current
asbestos plaintiffs and the Futures Representative, and soliciting acceptances
of and filing a prepackaged plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
Bankruptcy Code. Prior to the amendment, holders of a majority in aggregate
principal amount of the Senior Notes outstanding as of the record date for


                                       35
<PAGE>

determining the holders entitled to vote on the proposed amendment had consented
to the amendment.

            In August 2003, Congoleum and the Indenture Trustee amended the
Indenture to expressly provide Congoleum, under the terms of the Indenture, with
greater flexibility to pursue approval of its pre-packaged plan of
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, including expressly
permitting Congoleum to issue the Promissory Note to the Plan Trust, to reflect
certain possible contributions expected to be made by ABI to the Plan Trust and
expressly permitting Congoleum to issue promissory notes to ABI as repayment for
certain amounts which may be paid by ABI to the Plan Trust. Prior to the
amendment, holders of a majority in aggregate principal amount of the Senior
Notes as of the record date for determining the holders entitled to vote on the
proposed amendment had consented to the amendment.

      (b)   Description of Capital Stock

            (1) Congoleum

            Congoleum has 31,000,000 shares of capital stock authorized, of
which 20,000,000 shares are designated as Class A Common Stock, 10,000,000
shares are designated as Class B Common Stock and 1,000,000 shares are
designated as preferred stock (the "Preferred Stock").

            As of October 31, 2004, 3,651,190 shares of Class A Common Stock,
4,608,945 shares of Class B Common Stock and no shares of Preferred Stock were
issued and outstanding. As of that date, ABI held 151,100 shares of Class A
Common Stock and 4,395,605 shares of Class B Common Stock.

            Upon the filing of amended certificates of incorporation in
connection with the Effective Date, the Debtors will be prohibited from issuing
non-voting capital stock in accordance with section 1123(a)(5) of the Bankruptcy
Code.

                  (A) Class A Common Stock

            The Class A Common Stock is entitled to one vote per share and,
generally, votes together with the Class B Common Stock as a single class. The
Class A Common Stock and Class B Common Stock are on parity on a per share basis
with respect to dividend and liquidation rights.

                  (B) Class B Common Stock

            Generally, the Class B Common Stock is entitled to two votes per
share and votes together with the Class A Common Stock as a single class. The
Class B Common Stock is only entitled to one vote per share with regard to
certain extraordinary transactions. The Class B Common Stock and Class A Common
Stock are on parity on a per share basis with respect to dividend and
liquidation rights.

            A holder of Class B Common Stock may convert any shares of such
stock into an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock at any time at the
holder's option. The Class B Common Stock is subject to automatic conversion
into Class A Common Stock on a one-for-one basis upon the adoption of a


                                       36
<PAGE>

resolution authorizing such conversion approved by the holders of a majority of
the outstanding shares of Class B Common Stock voting as a separate class. In
addition, any shares of Class B Common Stock sold or otherwise transferred to a
person or entity other than an affiliate of the transferor will be automatically
converted into an equal number of shares of Class A Common Stock upon such sale
or transfer. A pledge of shares of Class B Common Stock is not considered a
transfer for this purpose unless and until the pledge is enforced. Also, with
respect to shares of Class B Common Stock held by ABI, those shares will
automatically be converted into an equal number of shares of Class A Common
Stock upon the occurrence of a "change of control" of ABI (as defined under
Congoleum's Certificate of Incorporation).

            (2) CFI

            CFI has 1,000 shares of common stock, each share having a par value
of $0.01, authorized, of which 100 shares are issued and outstanding and owned
by Congoleum.

            (3) CSI

            CSI has 1,000 shares of common stock, each share having a par value
of $0.01, authorized, of which 100 shares are issued and outstanding and owned
by Congoleum.

4.6.  Other Matters

      (a)   Environmental Proceedings

            Congoleum is named, together with a large number (in most cases,
hundreds) of other companies, as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") in
pending proceedings under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, as amended ("CERCLA"), and similar state laws.
In addition, in four other instances, although not named as a PRP, Congoleum has
received a request for information. The pending proceedings relate to eight
disposal sites in New Jersey, Pennsylvania and Maryland in which recovery from
generators of hazardous substances is sought for the cost of cleaning up the
contaminated waste sites. Congoleum's ultimate liability in connection with
those sites depends on many factors, including the volume of material
contributed to the site, the number of other PRPs and their financial viability,
the remediation methods and technology to be used and the extent to which costs
may be recoverable from insurance. However, under CERCLA, and certain other
laws, Congoleum, as a PRP, can be held jointly and severally liable for all
environmental costs associated with a site.

            The most significant exposure to which Congoleum has been named a
PRP relates to a recycling facility site in Elkton, Maryland. The PRP group at
this site is made up of 81 companies, substantially all of which are large
financially solvent entities. Two removal actions were substantially complete as
of December 31, 1998; however, the groundwater remediation phase has not begun
and the remedial investigation/feasibility study related to the groundwater
remediation has not been approved. The PRP group estimated that future costs of
groundwater remediation, based on engineering and consultant studies conducted,
would be approximately $26 million. Congoleum's proportionate share, based on
waste disposed at the site, is estimated to be approximately 5.8%.


                                       37
<PAGE>

            Congoleum also accrues remediation costs for certain of Congoleum's
owned facilities on an undiscounted basis. Congoleum has entered into an
administrative consent order with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and has self-guaranteed certain remediation funding sources and
financial responsibilities. Estimated total cleanup costs, including capital
outlays and future maintenance costs for soil and groundwater remediation, are
primarily based on engineering studies.

            The outcome of these matters could result in significant expenses or
judgments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of the
operations, cash flows and financial position of Congoleum.

      (b)   Other Matters Material to the Success of Reorganized Congoleum

            The success of Reorganized Congoleum is dependent upon several
factors. One factor is the continuing contributions of key employees, both
management and in the field. In addition, the relationships with its existing
customer base and suppliers are important to Reorganized Congoleum's success.
Finally, the performance of Reorganized Congoleum depends on Reorganized
Congoleum's ability to retain its relationship with Congress during the
Reorganization Cases and thereafter.

                                   ARTICLE 5
                     EVENTS DURING THE REORGANIZATION CASES

5.1.  Commencement of the Reorganization Cases

            On December 31, 2003 (the "Petition Date"), Congoleum, CSI and CFI
each filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy
Code. Each Debtor was authorized to operate its business and manage its
properties as a debtor-in-possession pursuant to sections 1107(a) and 1108 of
the Bankruptcy Code. On or about January 7, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered
an order providing for the joint administration of the Reorganization Cases.

5.2.  Administration of the Reorganization Cases

      (a)   Payment of Pre-Petition Debt Incurred in the Ordinary Course of
            Business

            On January 7, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered orders that
authorized the Company to pay, in its discretion, all undisputed, unsecured
pre-petition indebtedness and obligations (other than the Asbestos Claims,
Senior Note Claims and any other indebtedness or liabilities that are impaired
and to be restructured under the Plan) which were incurred in the ordinary
course of business as such indebtedness and obligations mature in accordance
with their terms, and to pay salaries, wages, benefits and other amounts owed to
employees and consultants as such obligations become due, including obligations
that were, or may have been, incurred prior to the Petition Date.

      (b)   DIP Financing

            In order to fund ongoing business operations and to preserve the
value of the Debtors' estates, the Debtors entered into a Ratification and
Amendment Agreement (the "Ratification Agreement") with Congress to ratify and


                                       38
<PAGE>

amend the Credit Facility in order to provide the Debtors with
debtor-in-possession financing. The Debtors filed a Motion for Interim and Final
Orders Pursuant to Sections 363(c) And 364(c) of the Bankruptcy Code and
Bankruptcy Rule 4001 (1) Authorizing the Use of Cash Collateral, (2) Authorizing
Debtors to Obtain Interim Post-Petition Financing, (3) Granting Senior Liens and
Priority Administrative Expense Status, (4) Modifying the Automatic Stay, (5)
Authorizing Debtors to Enter into Agreements with Congress Financial
Corporation, and (6) Prescribing Form and Manner of Notice and Time for Final
Hearing under Bankruptcy Rule 4001(C) (the "DIP Motion"). On March 8, 2004, the
Bankruptcy Court entered a final order authorizing the Debtors to obtain
debtor-in-possession financing on a final basis, effective as of February 2,
2004 (the "DIP Order").

            In summary, Congress agreed, subject to the terms of the
Ratification Agreement, to make post-petition loans to Congoleum in an aggregate
principal amount not to exceed $30 million, including a sublimit of $5 million
for letters of credit, subject to certain borrowing base and minimum excess
availability restrictions. To secure this indebtedness, Congress was granted
security interests in all of the collateral subject to security interests in the
Credit Facility, all present and future accounts, all present and future
acquired Inventory and all documents of title. In addition, the DIP Order
provides, inter alia, that the obligations of the Debtors under the Ratification
Agreement will constitute, in accordance with section 364(c)(1) of the
Bankruptcy Code, allowed administrative expense claims against the Debtors in
the Reorganization Cases, with such claims having priority over all other
administrative expense claims and all unsecured claims of the Debtors then
existing or thereafter arising, of any kind or nature whatsoever including,
without limitation, all administrative expenses of the kinds specified in
sections 503(b) and 507(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. Reference should be made to
the DIP Motion (including all exhibits thereto) and the Ratification Agreement,
copies of which are on file with the Bankruptcy Court, for more details
regarding the terms of the financing.

            On November 22, 2004, with the consent of Congress, the Debtors
filed a Motion Pursuant to Section 364 of the Bankruptcy Code for an Order
Approving Amendment to Post-Petition Financing Agreement. This amendment will
(i) amend the current budget; (ii) extend the term of the existing Credit
Facility from December 31, 2004 to June 30, 2005; (iii) place new limitations on
capital expenditures; and (iv) provide a new minimum EBITDA covenant. A fee of
$150,000 is payable to Congress upon approval of this amendment by the
Bankruptcy Court.

      (c)   Asbestos Property Damage Claim Bar Date

            At the time the Debtors commenced the Reorganization Cases, no
Asbestos Property Damage Claims were being asserted against the Debtors. In
order to bind holders of Asbestos Property Damage Claims to the Plan, the
Debtors needed to ascertain whether any such claims existed, and if so, give
such claimants notice and an opportunity to protect their interests. On January
13, 2004, the Debtors filed the Motion re: for Order (i) Establishing Asbestos
Property Damage Claim Bar Date; (ii) Approving Property Damage Proof of Claim
Form; and (iii) Approving Scope and Form of Notice (the "Asbestos Property
Damage Claim Bar Date Motion"). The Bankruptcy Court, on February 2, 2004,
entered an Order establishing May 3, 2004 as the deadline by which holders of
Asbestos Property Damage Claims were required to assert such claims against the
Debtors by the filing of an Asbestos Property Damage Proof of Claim Form or be
forever barred from asserting any such claim against the Debtors, the


                                       39
<PAGE>

Reorganized Debtors, the Plan Trust and other parties protected by the
Bankruptcy Court's Orders or the Plan (the "Asbestos Property Damage Claim Bar
Date Order").

            Because the Debtors were unaware of any holders of Asbestos Property
Damage Claims, notice of the Asbestos Property Damage Claim Bar Date was
provided by publication in certain national newspapers and newspaper inserts,
such as The New York Times and Parade Magazine, as well as trade publications
for certain industries. In response, thirty-six (36) Asbestos Property Damage
Proofs of Claim were filed which asserted Asbestos Property Damage Claims of
approximately $900,000 in the aggregate. The Debtors are in the process of
reviewing the Asbestos Property Damage Claims to ensure that such claims are
based upon the existence of Congoleum manufactured asbestos-containing products
in the buildings for which claims are asserted as well as to ensure that such
claims complied in all other respects with the Asbestos Property Damage Claim
Bar Date Order.

5.3.  Asbestos Claimants' Committee

            Section 1102 of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the appointment of a
committee of holders of unsecured claims and such other committees as the U.S.
Trustee or the Bankruptcy Court may determine to appoint. On March 23, 2004, a
motion was filed requesting that the United States Trustee appoint an official
committee of asbestos-related personal injury claimants. On April 19, 2004, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order requiring the appointment of the Asbestos
Claimants' Committee. On April 21, 2004, the United States Trustee appointed the
Asbestos Claimants' Committee, which currently consists of the following
members: (i) Frank Cettina, c/o Weitz & Luxenberg, P.C.; (ii) Michael Edwards,
c/o Baron & Budd, P.C.; (iii) Gerald and Mae Ferro, c/o Kazan, McClain, Abrams,
Fernandez, Lyons & Farrise, a Professional Law Corporation; and (iv) Harvey
Overman, c/o Motley Rice, LLC. The Asbestos Claimants' Committee requested and
obtained authority to employ the following professionals: (i) Caplin & Drysdale,
Chartered as counsel to the Asbestos Claimants' Committee; and (ii) Goldstein
Lem & Isaacson, P.C. as co-counsel to the Asbestos Claimants' Committee.

            In light of the authority granted by the Bankruptcy Court to pay
undisputed pre-petition indebtedness and obligations which were incurred in the
ordinary course of business as such indebtedness and obligations mature in
accordance with their terms, described in Section 5.2(a) above, and the
unimpairment of Claims other than Asbestos Claims, no statutory committee of
unsecured non-asbestos-related creditors has been formed.

5.4.  Bankruptcy Court Appointment of Futures Representative

            On February 18, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered an order
approving the appointment of R. Scott Williams as the Futures Representative
(the "Futures Representative Appointment Order"). Mr. Williams' qualifications
to serve as Futures Representative, and the process by which he was selected,
are set forth in Section 3.3 -- "Selection of the Futures Representative." Mr.
Williams requested and obtained the authority to employ the following
professionals: (i) Swidler Berlin Shereff Friedman, LLP as co-counsel to Mr.
Williams; (ii) Ravin Greenberg PC as co-counsel to Mr. Williams; and (iii) CIBC
World Markets Corp. as financial advisor to Mr. Williams.


                                       40
<PAGE>

            On February 27, 2004, certain insurers of the Debtors appealed the
Futures Representative Appointment Order. On August 9, 2004, the District Court
entered an order affirming the Futures Representative Appointment Order. On
September 8, 2004, the appellants appealed the District Court's order to the
United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit (the "Court of Appeals").
Such appeal is pending.

5.5.  Retention of Professionals

            The Debtors requested and obtained the authority to employ the
following professionals: (i) Saul Ewing LLP ("Saul Ewing") as counsel to the
Debtors; (ii) Gilbert Heintz & Randolph LLP ("GHR") as special insurance counsel
to the Debtors; (iii) Dughi Hewit & Palatucci PC as special insurance counsel to
the Debtors; (iv) SSG Capital Advisors, L.P. as financial advisors to the
Debtors; (v) Ernst & Young LLP as audit and tax advisors to the Debtors; (vi)
Ernst & Young Corporate Finance LLC as restructuring advisor to the Debtors;
(vii) Peterson Risk Consulting as insurance allocation consultant to the
Debtors; and (viii) Daley-Hodkin, LLC as appraiser.

            Certain of the Debtors' insurers appealed the Bankruptcy Court's
Orders authorizing the retention of Saul Ewing and GHR. On August 9, 2004, the
District Court affirmed the Bankruptcy Court's Order authorizing the retention
of GHR. On September 8, 2004, the appellants appealed the District Court's order
to the Court of Appeals. On August 26, 2004 the District Court vacated the
Bankruptcy Court's order authorizing the retention of Saul Ewing and remanded
the matter to the Bankruptcy Court for further fact finding. A stay of this
Order was subsequently entered by the District Court pending an appeal by the
Debtors. On September 24, 2004, the Debtors appealed the District Court's order
to the Court of Appeals.

            While the Debtors and Saul Ewing disputed all allegations raised by
the insurers challenging Saul Ewing's retention, the Debtors and Saul Ewing
decided that further contesting those allegations could entail enduring a costly
and potentially distracting appellate process. The Debtors and Saul Ewing did
not want to add the prospect of delay, additional cost and unnecessary
disruption to the Debtors' bankruptcy cases. Saul Ewing, in consultation with
and consent of the Debtors, concluded that Saul Ewing should withdraw as the
Debtors' counsel in order to avoid any potential distraction to the Debtors'
reorganization efforts and potential additional cost to the Debtors' estates. On
October 18, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court approved Saul Ewing's withdrawal as
counsel to the Debtors and established a transition period during which Saul
Ewing is to complete certain work for the Debtors. The Debtors requested and
obtained the authority to employ Pillsbury Winthrop LLP and Okin, Hollander &
DeLuca, LLP as substitute co-counsel to the Debtors.

5.6.  Motion for Relief from Stay

            On January 6, 2004, certain of the Congoleum's insurers filed the
Motion of Certain Insurers for Declaration that Section 362 (a) of the
Bankruptcy Code is not Applicable, or, in the Alternative, for Relief from the
Automatic Stay (the "Stay Motion"). The Stay Motion sought a declaration from
the Bankruptcy Court that Coverage Litigation between Congoleum and certain of
its insurers, described in Section 2.2(c) above, was not subject to the


                                       41
<PAGE>

automatic stay provisions of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code or, in the
alternative, requesting that the Bankruptcy Court grant relief from the
automatic stay so that the Coverage Litigation could proceed during the pendency
of the Reorganization Cases. On March 22, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court entered an
order that permitted the claims asserted in the Coverage Litigation (except for
certain claims for rescission of insurance policies issued to Congoleum) to
proceed without making a finding as to whether or not the automatic stay
provisions of section 362 of the Bankruptcy Code applied to the Coverage
Litigation.

5.7.  Settlements with Insurers and Brokers

      (a)   Liberty Mutual Settlement Agreement

            On June 24, 2004, the Debtors filed a motion for approval of a
settlement agreement with Liberty Mutual Insurance Company ("Liberty"), which
provided primary liability insurance coverage to Congoleum including coverage
for asbestos-related claims (the "Liberty Settlement"). On July 29, 2004, the
Bankruptcy Court entered an order approving the Liberty Settlement. In summary,
the Liberty Settlement provides that Liberty will contribute $14,450,000 for the
benefit of the Debtors' Estates. Upon the Confirmation Order becoming a Final
Order, Liberty agreed to contribute an additional $950,000 for the benefit of
the Plan Trust. In exchange, the Debtors agreed, among other things, to
designate Liberty as a Settling Asbestos Insurance Company, thereby entitling
Liberty to the benefit of certain injunctions under the Plan pursuant to
sections 105(a) and 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. Reference should be made to
the Liberty Settlement, which is attached as an exhibit to the motion seeking
approval of the Liberty Settlement and which is on file with the Bankruptcy
Court for more details regarding the terms of the Liberty Settlement.

      (b)   Marsh and Aon Settlements

            On September 28, 2004, the Debtors filed motions for the approval of
settlement agreements with Marsh USA, Inc. et al. ("Marsh") and Aon Corporation
et al. ("Aon"), both of which provided insurance brokerage services to Congoleum
with respect to certain of the policies issued to Congoleum that provide
coverage for Asbestos Personal Injury Claims (respectively, the "Marsh
Settlement" and the "Aon Settlement"). On October 18, 2004, the Bankruptcy Court
approved the Marsh and Aon Settlements. In summary, the Marsh and Aon
Settlements provides that Marsh and Aon will contribute $40,000 and $75,000,
respectively, for the benefit of the Debtors' Estates. Reference should be made
to the Marsh Settlement and the Aon Settlement, which are attached as exhibits
to the motions seeking approval of the Marsh and Aon Settlements and which are
on file with the Bankruptcy Court for more details regarding the terms of those
settlements.

5.8.  First, Second, Third and Fourth Modifications to the Plan

      (a)   First Modification to the Plan

            On January 22, 2004, the Debtors filed the First Modification to the
Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code
of Congoleum Corporation et al. (the "First Modification"). The modifications
made to the Plan in the First Modification were consensual modifications
concerning the treatment of Congress under the Plan. The First Modification
changed Congress' treatment under the Plan from Impaired to Unimpaired.


                                       42
<PAGE>

Congress' treatment under the Plan is more fully described in Section 6.4(d)(2)
below. As a result of the change in treatment of Congress under the Plan,
technical amendments to conform the Plan were made.

      (b)   Second Modification to the Plan

            On May 18, 2004, the Debtors filed the Second Modified Joint
Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of
Congoleum Corporation et al. (the "Second Modification"). In addition to
technical, non-substantive modifications, the Second Modification modified the
Plan as follows:

            (1)   Former Section 10.1(a)(xv) of the Plan. Former Section
                  10.1(a)(xv) of the Plan, which required a finding by the
                  Bankruptcy Court that certain of the Debtors' insurers had
                  notice and an opportunity to be heard on the Asbestos
                  Insurance Assignment and that the insurers were to be bound by
                  the Plan and the Confirmation Order, was deleted in its
                  entirety.

            (2)   Section 7.2 of the Plan. Section 7.2 of the Plan was modified
                  to clarify that although only the Plan Trustee has the
                  authority to contest Asbestos Personal Injury Claims, Unknown
                  Asbestos Claims and ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity
                  Claims and to litigate to judgment, settle or withdraw such
                  objections, such authority is without prejudice to the right
                  of any Asbestos Insurance Company to contest coverage under
                  any Asbestos Insurance Policy.

            (3)   Section 11.6 of the Plan. Section 11.6 of the Plan, concerning
                  the Asbestos Channeling Injunction, was supplemented to
                  provide that any claim that an Asbestos Insurance Company may
                  have been entitled to assert against a Settling Asbestos
                  Insurance Company based on an Asbestos Claim will be
                  "channeled to and become a right, claim or cause of action as
                  an offset claim against the Plan Trust."

            (4)   Section 11.10 of the Plan. Section 11.10 was added to the Plan
                  to clarify the Debtors' intention that the Plan remain
                  "insurance neutral." Section 11.10 of the Plan expressly
                  preserves the rights of insurers to litigate relevant coverage
                  disputes in the appropriate forum separate and apart from the
                  Plan confirmation proceedings. Section 11.10 of the Plan
                  reinforces what already was inherent in the structure of the
                  Plan by explicitly acknowledging that confirmation of the Plan
                  will neither expand nor diminish any party's rights under
                  their insurance policies.

      (c)   Third Modification to the Plan

            On November 8, 2004, the Debtors filed the Third Modified Joint Plan
of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of Congoleum
Corporation, et al., dated as of November 8, 2004 (the "Third Modification"). In
addition to technical, non-substantive modifications, the Third Modification
modified the Plan as follows:


                                       43
<PAGE>

            (1)   Sections 2.3 and 4.1 of the Plan. Former Class 2, which
                  included the Secured Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition
                  Settlement Claimants, was split into Classes 2A and 2B. Class
                  2A consisted of (i) all Secured Asbestos Claims of Qualified
                  Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants of $200,000 or less and (ii)
                  Secured Asbestos Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement
                  Claimants of more than $200,000 that have been voluntarily
                  reduced by the holders of such Claims to $200,000, in each
                  case to the extent secured under the terms of the Collateral
                  Trust Agreement. Class 2B consisted of all Secured Asbestos
                  Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants of more
                  than $200,000 (unless such Secured Asbestos Claims of
                  Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants have been
                  voluntarily reduced by the holders of such Claims to $200,000)
                  to the extent secured under the terms of the Collateral Trust
                  Agreement.

            (2)   Section 3.3 of the Plan. Section 3.3 was added to the Plan to
                  reflect that any requests for compensation or expense
                  reimbursement for making a substantial contribution in the
                  Reorganization Cases must be filed within sixty days of the
                  Confirmation Date.

            (3)   Section 5.1(e) of the Plan. Section 5.1(e) of the Plan was
                  modified to reflect a revision to the Plan Trust Agreement,
                  which permits the Plan Trustee to transfer monies from the
                  Asbestos Property Damage Claim Sub-Account to the Asbestos
                  Personal Injury Claim Sub-Account to the extent that the funds
                  in the Asbestos Property Damage Claim Sub-Account exceed the
                  aggregate amount of all unpaid Asbestos Property Damage Claims
                  that have been filed prior to the Asbestos Property Damage
                  Claim Bar Date and a reasonable reserve for Plan Trust
                  Expenses and indemnification costs or expenses, in either
                  case, related to Asbestos Property Damage Claims.

            (4)   Section 5.1(r) of the Plan. Section 5.1(r) of the Plan was
                  modified to reflect a revision to the Plan Trust Agreement,
                  which provides for the indemnification of the Claimants'
                  Representative and the Collateral Trustee by the Reorganized
                  Debtors and the Plan Trust with respect to the negotiation and
                  implementation of the Third Modification made on or after
                  October 1, 2004. The Reorganized Debtors will be responsible
                  for the first $1 million of any costs incurred by the Plan
                  Trust under the indemnity contained in Section 3.4(c) of the
                  Plan Trust. Thereafter, the Plan Trust and the Reorganized
                  Debtors will each be responsible for one half of all
                  indemnifiable liabilities, expenses, claims, damages and
                  losses incurred under such indemnity, provided that the
                  Reorganized Debtors' maximum obligation will in no event
                  exceed $3 million in the aggregate.

            (5)   Section 11.3 of the Plan. Section 11.3 of the Plan was
                  modified to reflect the addition of the Asbestos Claimants'
                  Committee as a party exculpated under Section 11.3 of the
                  Plan.


                                       44
<PAGE>

            (6)   Section 12.5 of the Plan. Section 12.5 of the Plan was
                  modified to reflect that the Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of
                  Action assigned to the Plan Trust on the Effective Date will
                  not include any Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of Action arising
                  from any transfer of assets or property to the Collateral
                  Trust prior to the Petition Date or from any subsequent
                  distribution by the Collateral Trust of such assets or
                  property and that any such Plan Trust Bankruptcy Cause of
                  Action will be unconditionally released by the Debtors in
                  accordance with Sections 11.3 and 11.4 of the Plan.

            (7)   Section 13.12 of the Plan. Section 13.12 was added to the Plan
                  to provide that to the extent that the actual costs incurred
                  by the Claimants' Representative exceed $2 million dollars in
                  the aggregate, the Debtors or, after the Effective Date, the
                  Reorganized Debtors will provide funding to cover such actual
                  costs, subject to disclosure of the costs incurred and
                  approval by the Bankruptcy Court.

            (8)   Exhibit C to the Plan - "Asbestos Insurance Rights Assignment
                  Agreement". Exhibit C to the Plan, "Asbestos Insurance Rights
                  Assignment Agreement", was revised to reflect the Reorganized
                  Debtors' agreement that the Plan Trust may effectuate a
                  complete policy buy-back of any policy subscribed by any
                  London Market insurer, following which the Reorganized Debtors
                  will retain no coverage with respect to such insurer(s). In
                  addition, the Reorganized Debtors, upon the request of the
                  Plan Trustee, will evaluate additional requests for complete
                  policy commutations. To the extent that such policy
                  commutations do not materially impair the Reorganized Debtors'
                  ongoing need for insurance coverage for potential non-asbestos
                  liabilities and such additional releases are reasonably
                  necessary to permit the realization of asbestos-related
                  insurance settlements, the Reorganized Debtors will cooperate
                  with the Plan Trustee to provide additional complete policy
                  commutations. Such additional policy commutations may be
                  conditioned upon a reasonable allocation of policy proceeds or
                  other provisions to protect Congoleum from potential
                  non-asbestos liabilities as may be agreed between the
                  Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trustee.

            (9)   Exhibit D to the Plan - "Congoleum Plan Trust Agreement".
                  Section 3.4(c) was added to the Plan Trust as discussed above
                  in the description of Section 5.1(r) of the Plan. Section
                  3.4(e) of the Plan Trust was modified to reflect certain
                  limitations on the payment or reimbursement of Coverage Costs
                  and the Claims Handling Fee under the Claimants Agreement. In
                  sum, revised Section 3.4(e) provides that the Reorganized
                  Debtors are entitled to be reimbursed for Coverage Costs in
                  excess of $6 million dollars from the proceeds of the Asbestos
                  Insurance Action Recoveries. Further, if the proceeds of the
                  Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries exceed $375 million, net
                  of any payment or reimbursement for Coverage Costs, the Plan
                  Trust will reimburse or pay the Reorganized Debtors for any
                  Coverage Costs that have not been reimbursed and the Claims
                  Handling Fee paid under the Claimant Agreement, provided,


                                       45
<PAGE>

                  however, to the extent that any Asbestos Insurance Action
                  Recoveries in excess of $375 million are not available to pay
                  Coverage Costs or the Claims Handling Fee due to restrictions
                  on the use of such Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries
                  imposed by any Asbestos Insurance Settlement Agreement, the
                  Plan Trust will reimburse and pay the Reorganized Debtors from
                  unrestricted funds held by the Plan Trust and/or grant the
                  Reorganized Debtors the right to offset any unreimbursed and
                  unpaid Coverage Costs against any future payments due by the
                  Reorganized Debtors under the Promissory Note.

            (10)  Exhibit H to the Plan - "Trust Distribution Procedures" and
                  Exhibit B to the Plan -"Collateral Trust Agreement". Section
                  III of the TDP was revised to reflect the modifications to the
                  security and payment of Asbestos Claims as agreed by the
                  Claimants' Representative, the Futures Representative and the
                  Asbestos Claimants' Committee and as reflected in certain
                  amendments to the Collateral Trust Agreement agreed upon by
                  the Claimants' Representative. The revised payment structure
                  under Section III of the TDP is described, in detail, in
                  Section 1.7 above.

      (d)   Fourth Modification to the Plan

            On November 12, 2004, the Debtors filed the Fourth Modified Joint
Plan of Reorganization Under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of Congoleum
Corporation, et al., dated as of November 12, 2004 (the "Fourth Modification").
In addition to technical, non-substantive modifications, the Fourth Modification
modified the Plan by combining Classes 2A and 2B (described in Section 5.8(c)(1)
above) into a single Class 2 and added certain new provisions relating to
principles of "insurance neutrality."

5.9.  Standing of Insurers to be Heard

            The Debtors filed motions challenging the standing of certain of
Congoleum's insurers to raise objections and be heard in the Reorganization
Cases, specifically with regard to the Disclosure Statement and the Second
Modified Plan. The Bankruptcy Court ruled that the insurers do not have standing
to raise objections and be heard with respect to the Disclosure Statement. As to
the Second Modified Plan, however, the Bankruptcy Court ruled that the insurers
do have standing to raise objections and be heard. Many of the insurers have
filed preliminary objections to the Second Modified Plan (the "Plan Objections")
and, as a result of the Bankruptcy Court's ruling on standing to object to the
Second Modified Plan, the insurers are actively prosecuting the Plan Objections.
It is anticipated that the insurers may file amended or supplemental objections
in connection with the filing of the Plan.

5.10. Discovery Conducted by the Parties

      (a)   Fact Discovery

            In connection with the Plan Objections, the insurers and the Debtors
have engaged in extensive discovery in preparation for the Confirmation Hearing.
The parties have exchanged voluminous amounts of documents, as well as obtaining
documents from representatives of the parties and certain other
parties-in-interest in the Reorganization Cases, including many of the counsel


                                       46
<PAGE>

to the holders of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims. Most of the Debtors' senior
management, as well as certain professionals retained by the Debtors, have been
deposed by the insurers. Likewise, the Debtors have taken the depositions of
representatives of certain of the insurers.

      (b)   Expert Witness Discovery

            Both the Debtors and the insurers have identified certain expert
witnesses that they expect to call to testify at the Confirmation Hearing.
Expert witness reports were exchanged on June 19, 2004. As of the date of this
Disclosure Statement, further expert witness discovery, including depositions of
expert witnesses and the identification and exchange of rebuttal expert witness
reports, has not occurred.

5.11. Confirmation Hearing

            The Confirmation Hearing is currently scheduled to commence on March
24, 2005. Notice of the Confirmation Hearing will be published in one or more
newspapers of general circulation in locations where the Company has substantial
business operations, and will be mailed to all known holders of Claims, at least
25 days before the date of the Confirmation Hearing, unless the Bankruptcy Court
specifies otherwise. See Section 7.2 -- "Confirmation Hearing" below. Section
524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that any confirmation order containing a
supplemental injunction must be issued or affirmed by the District Court. If the
Confirmation Order is not issued by the District Court exercising its bankruptcy
jurisdiction, the Debtors will seek to have the Confirmation Order affirmed
promptly by the District Court. See Section 7.3(e) -- "Injunction Under Section
524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code".

                                   ARTICLE 6

6.4.  Treatment of Classified Claims and Interests

            Allowed Claims and Allowed Interests, as classified in Article II of
the Plan, will be treated in the manner set forth in Article IV of the Plan. The
following constitutes a summary of such treatment:

      (a)   Class 1 - Priority Claims

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 1 is Unimpaired by the Plan. Each holder of an Allowed
Priority Claim in Class 1 is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan and
is not entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan under section 1126 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

            (2) Treatment

            On the Distribution Date, each holder of an Allowed Priority Claim
will receive either (i) the Allowed Amount of its Priority Claim in Cash, or
(ii) such different treatment as may be agreed to by such holder and the
Reorganized Debtors. The Reorganized Debtors will be responsible for payment of
Allowed Priority Claims.

      (b)   Class 2 - Secured Asbestos Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition
            Settlement Claimants

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 2 is Impaired by the Plan. Class 2 consists of all Secured
Asbestos Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants to the extent
secured under the terms of the Collateral Trust Agreement, and are asserted by
any parties to the Pre-Petition Settlement Agreements who are designated as
Qualified Claimants pursuant to the Claimant Agreement and the Collateral Trust
Agreement. Each holder of a Secured Asbestos Claim of a Qualified Pre-Petition
Settlement Claimant in Class 2 is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan
under sections 524(g) and 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code.

            (2) Treatment

            On the Effective Date, the Plan Trust will automatically assume all
liability for Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and the Reorganized Debtors will have
no liability for Plan Trust Asbestos Claims. The Secured Asbestos Claims of the
Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants are secured to the full extent of
their liquidated settlement amounts, as determined under the Collateral Trust


                                       49
<PAGE>

Agreement and the respective Pre-Petition Settlement Agreements. Each Qualified
Pre-Petition Settlement Claimant will be paid in Cash by the Plan Trust in
accordance with the provisions of the Asbestos Settlement Documents, the Plan,
the Plan Trust Agreement and TDP.

      (c)   Class 3 - Secured Asbestos Claims of Qualified Participating
            Claimants

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 3 is Impaired by the Plan. Secured Asbestos Claims of
Qualified Participating Claimants constitute Plan Trust Asbestos Claims that are
secured according to the provisions of the Collateral Trust Agreement, and that
are asserted by Asbestos Claimants designated as Participating Claimants
pursuant to the Claimant Agreement and the Collateral Trust Agreement. Each
holder of a Secured Asbestos Claim of Qualified Participating Claimants in Class
3 is entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan under sections 524(g) and
1126 of the Bankruptcy Code.

            (2) Treatment

            On the Effective Date, the Plan Trust will automatically assume all
liability for Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, and the Reorganized Debtors will have
no liability for such Claims. The Asbestos Personal Injury Claims of the
Qualified Participating Claimants are Secured Asbestos Claims to the extent of
seventy-five percent (75%) of the Qualified Participating Claimant's Settlement
Amount. The Qualified Participating Claimants will be paid by the Plan Trust, in
full satisfaction, settlement, release and discharge of and in exchange for such
Claim, in Cash in accordance with the provisions of the Asbestos Settlement
Documents (including priority of payment subject to the payment of Plan Trust
Expenses) which will be incorporated in the Plan Trust Agreement and TDP. Each
Qualified Participating Claimant holds an Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury
Claim in Class 10 with respect to twenty-five percent (25%) of his or her
Qualified Participating Claimant's Settlement Amount.

      (d)   Class 4 - Lender Secured Claims

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 4 is Unimpaired by the Plan. Lender Secured Claims constitute
any Claim arising under or relating to the Existing Credit Agreement, Existing
Subsidiary Guaranty or any related documents. Each holder of a Lender Secured
Claim in Class 4 is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan and is not
entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan under section 1126 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

            (2) Treatment

            On the Effective Date, the Existing Credit Agreement, as ratified,
amended and approved in accordance with the Financing Order will be amended and
restated in accordance with the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement and the
holder of the Allowed Lender Secured Claim will be entitled to all the rights
and benefits of a Lender under the Amended Credit Agreement and related
documents, which will be on terms and conditions mutually acceptable to the
Debtors and Congress. Alternatively, if, as of the Confirmation Hearing, the


                                       50
<PAGE>

Debtors and the holder of the Lender Secured Claim have not agreed upon the
terms of the Amended Credit Agreement, the Lender Secured Claim will be paid in
full indefeasibly on the Effective Date or as soon thereafter as practicable and
Congress will be released from any and all liabilities and causes of action in
accordance with the Financing Order.

      (e)   Class 5 - Other Secured Claims

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 5 is Unimpaired by the Plan. Each sub-Class of Class 5 Other
Secured Claims contains a single Other Secured Claim and is a separate Class for
all purposes under the Bankruptcy Code and the Plan. If the Claim of a holder of
an Other Secured Claim exceeds the value of the Collateral that secures it, such
holder will have an Other Secured Claim equal to the Collateral's value and a
General Unsecured Claim for the deficiency. Other Secured Claims include any
pre-petition Secured Claim asserted against the Debtors, other than Lender
Secured Claims and Secured Asbestos Claims. Each holder of an Other Secured
Claim in Class 5 is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan and is not
entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan under section 1126 of the
Bankruptcy Code.

            (2) Treatment

            The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the holders of
Allowed Other Secured Claims are Unimpaired by the Plan and all such Claims will
be Reinstated on the Effective Date.

      (f)   Class 6 - Senior Note Claims

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 6 is Unimpaired by the Plan. Senior Note Claims constitute
Claims based upon the Senior Notes. Each holder of a Senior Note Claim in Class
6 is conclusively presumed to have accepted the Plan and is not entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan under section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code.

            (2) Treatment

            The legal, equitable and contractual rights of the holders of
Allowed Senior Note Claims are Unimpaired by the Plan and all such Claims will
be Reinstated on the Effective Date.

      (g)   Class 7 - General Unsecured Claims

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 7 is Unimpaired by the Plan. General Unsecured Claims
constitute Unsecured Claims against the Debtors other than Asbestos Claims,
Senior Note Claims, ABI Claims and Workers Compensation Claims, including
without limitation Claims in respect of rent, trade payables and similar such

            (1) Impairment and Voting

            Class 10 is Impaired by the Plan. Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury

6.5.  Means for Execution of the Plan

      (a)   Establishment of the Plan Trust

            On the Effective Date, the Plan Trust will be established in
accordance with the Plan Documents. See Article 8 -- "Plan Trust and Asbestos
Claims Resolution Matters" for a description of the Plan Trust. In addition, on

Plan Trust.


                                       54
<PAGE>

      (b)   Plan Trust Funding

            (1) The Collateral Trust

            On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Trust
Agreement and the Plan, all of the Collateral Trust's right, title and interest
in and to any assets or properties then held by the Collateral Trust will
automatically be transferred and assigned to, and vest in, the Plan Trust, free
and clear of all Claims, Liens and encumbrances of the Debtors or any creditor,
shareholder, or other Entity, except for Liens expressly preserved in the Plan
and the order(s) confirming the Plan, and subject to the payment priorities set
forth in the Plan Trust Agreement, the Plan and the TDP, without any further
action of any Entity.

            (2) The Promissory Note

            On the Effective Date, Congoleum will issue a promissory note to the
Plan Trust in the initial aggregate principal amount of $2,738,234.75 (the
"Original Principal Amount") which represents 51% of the market capitalization
of Congoleum as of June 6, 2003, with such amount being subject to increase in
the amount, if any, by which 51% of Congoleum's market capitalization based on
the average trading prices at the close of trading for the 90 consecutive
trading days beginning on the one year anniversary of the Effective Date,
exceeds the Original Principal Amount. This adjustment amount could result in
the principal amount of the note increasing materially. For example, if the
adjustment amount were calculated based on the excess of 51% of the equity value
of Congoleum over $2.7 million during the 90 consecutive day trading period
ended September 30, 2004, the resulting adjustment amount would be $11 million.
The form of the Promissory Note is attached to the Plan as Exhibit "F."

            (3) The ABI Contribution

            On the Effective Date, ABI will make the ABI Contribution to the
Plan Trust.

            (4) The Liberty Payment

            Upon the Confirmation Order becoming a Final Order, Liberty will
contribute $950,000 to the Plan Trust.

            (5) Additional Plan Trust Contribution

            If ABI prepays the Promissory Note in accordance with the terms of
the Promissory Note at any time after the Principal Adjustment Date (as defined
in the Promissory Note), but prior to the third anniversary of the Principal
Adjustment Date, and subsequent to that payment, but prior to such third
anniversary there is a Disposition Event, then if the Second Re-Measurement
Value exceeds the greater of the Re-Measurement Value (as defined in the
Promissory Note) and $2,738,234.75, ABI will, following the effective date of
such Disposition Event promptly pay to the Plan Trust an amount equal to 50% of
such excess amount. ABI may not prepay the Promissory Note prior to the
Principal Adjustment Date. Congoleum will be obligated to repay ABI for the
Additional Plan Trust Contribution, which repayment obligation will be evidenced
by a promissory note substantially similar in form and content to the Promissory
Note with any amount paid by ABI with regard to the Additional Plan Trust


                                       55
<PAGE>

Contribution constituting principal that will be treated in substantially the
same manner as the Original Principal Amount is treated under the Promissory
Note.

      (c)   Plan Distributions

            The Disbursing Agent will make all distributions required under the
Plan (other than distributions to holders of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims).
Distributions will be made on the Distribution Date (unless otherwise provided
by the Plan or ordered by the Bankruptcy Court) with respect to all Claims
except for Plan Trust Asbestos Claims. Distributions to be made on the
Distribution Date will be deemed actually made on the Distribution Date if made
either (a) on the Distribution Date or (b) as soon as practicable thereafter.
With respect to Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, distributions to holders of Plan
Trust Asbestos Claims will be made in accordance with the Plan Trust Agreement
and/or the TDP, as applicable, as discussed above, in Section 1.7 hereto.

      (d)   Procedures for the Treatment of Disputed Claims

            (1) Disallowance of Improperly Filed Claims

            Subject to section 502(j) of the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy
Rules 3008 and 9006, any Administrative Claim, Asbestos Property Damage Claim or
Claim (other than Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and ABI Claims) for which the
filing of a Proof of Claim, application or motion with the Bankruptcy Court is
required under the terms of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, any order
of the Bankruptcy Court (including one providing a Bar Date) or the Plan will be
disallowed if and to the extent that such Proof of Claim (or other filing) is
not timely and properly made.

            (2) Prosecution of Objections to Claims

            Unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court after notice and a
hearing, after the Effective Date the Reorganized Debtors will have the
exclusive right to make and file objections to Proofs of Claims, other than
Proofs of Claims in respect of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims, Unknown Asbestos
Claims, Professional Fee Claims and ABI Asbestos Claims, at any time on or
before ninety days after the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the date on
which such Claim was filed with the Bankruptcy Court unless no Proof of Claim is
required to be filed pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3002, the Plan or any order of
the Bankruptcy Court; provided, however, that (x) this deadline may be extended
by the Bankruptcy Court on motion by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as
applicable, and (y) neither the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors nor any other
Person may file an objection to any (1) Claim that was Allowed by a Final Order
entered during the Reorganization Cases, or (2) Claim Allowed by the Plan. In
addition, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court after notice and a
hearing, after the Effective Date the Reorganized Debtors, subject to Sections
13.5 and 13.11 of the Plan, will have the exclusive right to make and file
objections to Administrative Claims and to amend the Schedules or to object to
any Claim specified on the Schedules, at any time on or before sixty (60) days
after the later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the date on which such Claim
was filed with the Bankruptcy Court unless no Proof of Claim is required to be
filed pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3002, the Plan or any order of the Bankruptcy
Court; provided, however, that (x) this deadline may be extended by the
Bankruptcy Court on motion by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as


                                       56
<PAGE>

applicable, and (y) neither the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors nor any other
Person may file an objection to any (1) Claim that was Allowed by a Final Order
entered during the Reorganization Cases, or (2) Claim Allowed by the Plan.
Without prejudice to the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company to assert any
Asbestos Insurer Coverage Defenses, after the Effective Date, only the Plan
Trustee will have the authority to contest Asbestos Personal Injury Claims,
Unknown Asbestos Claims and ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims and
litigate to judgment, settle or withdraw such objections and each Asbestos
Personal Injury Claim, Unknown Asbestos Claim and ABI Asbestos Personal Injury
Indemnity Claim, whether or not a Proof of Claim was filed with the Bankruptcy
Court, will be satisfied exclusively in accordance with the Plan Trust
Documents.

            (3) No Distributions Pending Allowance

            Notwithstanding any other provision hereof, if a Claim or any
portion of a Claim is Disputed, no payment or distribution will be made on
account of the Disputed portion of such Claims (or the entire Claim, if the
entire Claim is Disputed), unless and until such Disputed Claim becomes an
Allowed Claim.

6.6.  Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

      (a)   Assumption or Rejection of Executory Contracts and Unexpired Leases

            Except for any unexpired lease or executory contract that the
Debtors reject or designate as being subject to rejection on or before the
Effective Date, and except for the Joint Venture Agreement, as of the Effective
Date, all executory contracts and unexpired leases not previously assumed by the
Debtors pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code will be deemed to have
been assumed by the Debtors, subject to Section 5.2 of the Plan, and the Plan
will constitute a motion to assume such executory contracts and unexpired
leases. Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, entry of the
Confirmation Order by the Bankruptcy Court will constitute approval of such
assumptions pursuant to section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and a finding by
the Bankruptcy Court that each such assumption is in the best interests of the
Debtors, the Estates and all parties in interest in the Reorganization Cases.

            On the Effective Date, the Joint Venture Agreement and the
Intercompany Agreements will be assumed by Congoleum and the obligations of
Reorganized Congoleum to ABI thereunder will be subject to the provisions set
forth in the Plan.

      (b)   Damages Upon Rejection

            The Bankruptcy Court will determine the dollar amount, if any, of
the Claim of any Entity seeking damages by reason of the rejection of any
executory contract or unexpired lease; provided, however, that such Entity must
file a Proof of Claim with the Bankruptcy Court on or before thirty (30)
calendar days following the later of the Confirmation Date or the date of
rejection of the executory contract or unexpired lease. To the extent that any
such Claim is Allowed by the Bankruptcy Court by Final Order, such Claim will
become, and will be treated for all purposes under the Plan as, a Class 7
General Unsecured Claim, or if the Claim is an Unsecured Asbestos Personal
Injury Claim, a Class 10 Claim, and the holder thereof will receive
distributions as a holder of an Allowed Claim in such Class pursuant to the
Plan. The Debtors will notify those Entities that may assert a Claim for damages


                                       57
<PAGE>

from the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease of this bar date
for filing a Proof of Claim in connection therewith.

      (c)   Cure of Defaults

            Any defaults of the Debtors with respect to assumed executory
contracts or leases existing as of the Effective Date will be cured in the
ordinary course of the Reorganized Debtors' business promptly after any such
default becomes known to the Debtors, unless otherwise determined by the
Bankruptcy Court pursuant to a Final Order, or agreed to by the parties to such
contract or lease on or before the Effective Date. The Bankruptcy Court will
resolve any disputes over cure amounts according to applicable law, and the
assumed executory contracts or leases will be binding upon and enforceable upon
the parties thereto, subject to any rights and defenses existing thereunder.
Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, upon payment of such cure
amounts, all of the Debtors' defaults existing as of the Confirmation Date with
respect to any executory contract or unexpired lease to be assumed will be
deemed cured.

6.7.  Injunctions, Releases and Discharge

      (a)   Term of Certain Injunctions and Automatic Stay

            (A) All of the injunctions and/or automatic stays provided for in or
in connection with the Reorganization Cases, whether pursuant to section 105,
section 362, section 524(g), or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code or
other applicable law, in existence immediately prior to Confirmation will remain
in full force and effect until the Injunctions become effective, and thereafter
if so provided by the Plan, the Confirmation Order, or by their own terms. In
addition, on and after Confirmation, the Debtors may seek such further orders as
they may deem necessary to preserve the status quo during the time between
Confirmation and the Effective Date.

            (B) Each of the Injunctions will become effective on the Effective
Date and will continue in effect at all times thereafter. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, all actions in the nature of
those to be enjoined by the Injunctions will be enjoined during the period
between the Confirmation Date and the Effective Date.

      (b)   Setoffs

            Subject to the limitations provided in section 553 of the Bankruptcy
Code, the Debtors or the Plan Trust, as applicable, may, but will not be
required to, setoff against any Claim and the payments or other distributions to
be made pursuant to the Plan in respect of such Claim, claims of any nature
whatsoever the Debtors may have against the holder of such Claim, but neither
the failure to do so nor the allowance of any Claim under the Plan will
constitute a waiver or release by the Debtors of any such claim that the Debtors
may have against such holder; provided that Reorganized Congoleum may not offset
any obligations under the Promissory Note against any claim that Reorganized
Congoleum may have against the Plan Trust.


                                       58
<PAGE>

      (c)   Discharge

            Except as specifically provided in the Plan, the Plan Documents or
in the Confirmation Order, as of the Effective Date, Confirmation will discharge
the Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors pursuant to section 1141(d)(1)(A) of the
Bankruptcy Code from any and all Claims of any nature whatsoever and Demands
including, without limitation, any Claims, demands and liabilities that arose
before the Confirmation, and all debts of the kind specified in section 502(g),
502(h) or 502(i) of the Bankruptcy Code, whether or not (i) a Proof of Claim
based on such Claim was filed or deemed filed under section 501 of the
Bankruptcy Code, or such Claim was listed on the Schedules of the Debtors, (ii)
such Claim is or was Allowed under section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, or (iii)
the holder of such Claim has voted on or accepted the Plan. Except as
specifically provided in the Plan or Plan Documents, the rights that are
provided in the Plan as of the Effective Date will be in exchange for and in
complete satisfaction, settlement and discharge of all Claims (including without
limitation Asbestos Claims) or Demands against, Liens on, and interests in the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors or any of their assets or properties.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, nothing in this Section
will affect the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company to assert any Asbestos
Insurer Coverage Defenses.

      (d)   Release of Representatives of the Debtors

            To the extent permitted by law applicable to cases under the
Bankruptcy Code in the judicial district in which the Bankruptcy Court is
located, except as otherwise specifically provided in the Plan and the Plan
Documents, for good and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of
which is acknowledged in the Plan, all current and former Representatives of the
Debtors, on and after the Effective Date, are released from any and all Claims,
obligations, rights, suits, damages, causes of action, remedies and liabilities
whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, existing or
hereafter arising, in law, equity or otherwise, that any Entity would have been
legally entitled to assert in its own right (whether individually or
collectively) or on behalf of the holder of any Claim or Interest or other
Entity, based in whole or in part, upon any act or omission, transaction,
agreement, event, or other occurrence taking place on or before the Effective
Date, for claims or liabilities resulting from their services as officers or
directors of the Debtors or, to the extent such claims or liabilities relate to
the business, operations or management of the Debtors prior to the Effective
Date or to their conduct as professionals or advisors to any of the Debtors.
Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, nothing in this Section
will affect the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company to assert any Asbestos
Insurer Coverage Defenses.

      (e)   Exculpation

            To the extent permitted by law applicable to cases under the
Bankruptcy Code in the judicial district in which the Bankruptcy Court is
located, as of the Effective Date, each of the Reorganized Debtors, the Debtors,
the Futures Representative, the Plan Trustee, the Claimants' Representative, the
Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee,
the Collateral Trustee, ABI or any of their respective Representatives (i) will
not have or incur any liability to any Entity for any act or omission in
connection with or arising out of the negotiation of the Plan or any Plan
Document, negotiation of the settlement provided in the Collateral Trust,
negotiation of the settlement provided in the Claimant Agreement, the pursuit of


                                       59
<PAGE>

confirmation of the Plan, the consummation of the Plan, the Collateral Trust
Agreement, the Claimant Agreement, the Security Agreement or the administration
of the Plan or the property to be distributed under the Plan, provided, however,
that this exculpation provision will not apply to Asbestos Insurer Coverage
Defenses; and (ii) in all respects will be entitled to rely upon the advice of
counsel with respect to their duties and responsibilities under the Plan and the
other Plan Documents.

      (f)   Indemnification of the Claimants' Representative and Collateral
            Trustee

            The Plan Trust and the Reorganized Debtors will indemnify and hold
harmless each of the Claimants' Representative and the Collateral Trustee, to
the extent that such Entity was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a
party, to any threatened or pending judicial, administrative or arbitrative
action, suit or proceeding by reason of any act or omission of such Entity with
respect to the negotiation and implementation of modifications to the Plan, the
other Plan Documents and the Collateral Trust Agreement contemplated by the
Third Modification and made on or after October 1, 2004 to the fullest extent
that a trust or a corporation organized under the laws of the State of Delaware
is from time to time entitled to indemnify and defend its officers, directors,
trustees and employees, against any and all liabilities, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), claims, damages or losses incurred by
each such Entity in connection with or resulting from such action, suit or
proceeding. To the extent that the Claimants' Representative or the Collateral
Trustee seek indemnification under Section 3.4(c) of the Plan Trust Agreement,
the Reorganized Debtors will be responsible to pay the first one million dollars
($1,000,000) of indemnifiable liabilities, expenses, claims, damages and losses
sought under such Section 3.4(c). Thereafter, the Reorganized Debtors and the
Plan Trust will each be responsible, severally and not jointly, to pay on a pari
passu basis one half of the liabilities, expenses, claims, damages and losses
indemnifiable under such Section 3.4(c), provided that the Reorganized Debtors'
maximum obligation under such Section 3.4(c) will in no event exceed the
aggregate sum of three million dollars ($3,000,000). If the Claimants'
Representative or Collateral Trustee seeks indemnification under such Section
3.4(c) (each, an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party will give the
Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust prompt written notice of the basis upon
which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under such Section 3.4(c) (an
"Indemnification Claim Notice"). In no event will the Plan Trust or the
Reorganized Debtors be liable for any liabilities, expenses, claims, damages or
losses that result from a delay in providing the Indemnification Claim Notice.
Each Indemnification Claim Notice will contain a description of the action, suit
or proceeding related to the claim for indemnification and each Indemnified
Party will furnish promptly to the Plan Trust and the Reorganized Debtors copies
of all papers and official documents received by it in respect thereof. At their
option, the Reorganized Debtors may assume the defense of any action, suit or
proceeding upon which the Indemnified Parties intend to base a request for
indemnification by giving written notice to such Indemnified Party within
fourteen (14) days after the Reorganized Debtors' receipt of an Indemnification
Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of such action, suit or proceeding
will not be construed as an acknowledgement that the Reorganized Debtors or the
Plan Trust are liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in respect thereof, nor
will it constitute a waiver by the Reorganized Debtors or the Plan Trust of any
defense any of them may assert against any Indemnified Party's claim for
indemnification. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the
Reorganized Debtors and/or the Plan Trust are not obligated to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless any Indemnified Party in respect of any action, suit or
proceeding for which indemnification is sought under such Section 3.4(c), such


                                       60
<PAGE>

Indemnified Party will reimburse the Reorganized Debtors for any and all costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) incurred by the Reorganized
Debtors in defense of such action, suit or proceeding. Regardless of whether the
Reorganized Debtors choose to defend or prosecute any such action, suit or
proceeding, no Indemnified Party will admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any such action, suit or proceeding without the
prior written consent of the Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust, which
consent will not be unreasonably withheld. The Reorganized Debtors and the Plan
Trust will not be liable for any settlement or disposition of a claim by any
Indemnified Party that is reached without the prior written consent of the
Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust. If the Reorganized Debtors choose to
defend or prosecute any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification
will be requested, (i) the Indemnified Parties will reasonably cooperate in the
defense or prosecution thereof and (ii) the Reorganized Debtors will keep the
Plan Trust reasonably informed of the status of, and issues in, the action, suit
or proceeding and will consult with the Plan Trust in connection with the
defense or prosecution thereof (subject to any applicable privileges). In
addition, if the Reorganized Debtors choose to defend or prosecute any action,
suit or proceeding for which indemnification will be requested, the Reorganized
Debtors will not settle such action, suit or proceeding without the prior
written consent of the Plan Trust, which consent will not be unreasonably
withheld.

      (g)   Releases by Holders of Claims

            To the extent permitted by law applicable to cases under the
Bankruptcy Code in the judicial district in which the Bankruptcy Court is
located, other than rights to the treatment provided in Article IV of the Plan
or as otherwise provided in the Plan or the Plan Documents, on and after the
Effective Date, each holder of a Claim who has accepted the Plan will be deemed
to have unconditionally released the Released Non-Debtor Parties, the Claimants'
Representative, the Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the Asbestos
Claimants' Committee and their current and former Representatives from any and
all Claims, obligations, rights, suits, damages, causes of action, remedies, and
liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen,
existing or hereafter arising, in law, equity, or otherwise, that such Entity
would have been legally entitled to assert (whether individually or
collectively), based in whole or in part upon any act or omission, transaction,
agreement, event, or other occurrence taking place on or before the Effective
Date by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, the Reorganization Cases, or the
negotiation, formulation, and preparation of the Plan, the Plan Documents or any
related agreements, instruments or other documents.

      (h)   Discharge Injunction

            Except as specifically provided in the Plan Documents to the
contrary, the satisfaction, release, and discharge set forth in Section 11.1 of
the Plan will also operate as an injunction, pursuant to sections 105, 524(g)
and 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code, prohibiting and enjoining the commencement or
continuation of any action, the employment of process or any act to collect,
recover from, or offset (i) any Claim or Demand against or Interest in the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Collateral Trust, or the Plan Trust by any
Entity and (ii) any cause of action, whether known or unknown, against the
Released Parties based on such Claim or Interest described in subpart (i) of
this Section (h).


                                       61

      (i)   Asbestos Channeling Injunction

            The sole recourse of the holder of a Plan Trust Asbestos Claim or
Demand on account of such Claim or Demand or of a Person that had or could have
asserted an Asbestos Claim or Demand will be to the Plan Trust pursuant to the
provisions of the Asbestos Channeling Injunction, the Plan, the Plan Trust
Agreement and the TDP, and such holder will have no right whatsoever at any time
to assert its Plan Trust Asbestos Claim or Demand against the Debtors,
Reorganized Debtors, any other Protected Party, or any property or interest in
property of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or any other Protected Party.
Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the Effective Date, the Asbestos
Channeling Injunction will apply to all present and future holders of Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims and Demands, and all such holders will be permanently and
forever stayed, restrained, and enjoined from taking any of the following
actions for the purpose of, directly or indirectly, collecting, recovering, or
receiving payment of, on, or with respect to any Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and
Demands, other than from the Plan Trust in accordance with the Asbestos
Channeling Injunction and pursuant to the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the
TDP:

                  (i) commencing, conducting, or continuing in any manner,
directly or indirectly, any suit, action, or other proceeding (including a
judicial, arbitration, administrative, or other proceeding) in any forum against
or affecting any Protected Party or any property or interests in property of any
Protected Party;

                  (ii) enforcing, levying, attaching (including any prejudgment
attachment), collecting, or otherwise recovering by any means or in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, any judgment, award, decree, or other order
against any Protected Party or any property or interests in property of any
Protected Party;

                  (iii) creating, perfecting, or otherwise enforcing in any
manner, directly or indirectly, any encumbrance against any Protected Party, or
any property or interests in property of any Protected Party;

                  (iv) setting off, seeking reimbursement of, contribution from,
or subrogation against, or otherwise recouping in any manner, directly or
indirectly, any amount against any liability owed to any Protected Party or any
property or interests in property of any Protected Party; and

                  (v) proceeding in any manner in any place with regard to any
matter that is subject to resolution pursuant to the Plan Trust, except in
conformity and compliance with the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP.

            Any right, claim or cause of action that an Asbestos Insurance
Company may have been entitled to assert against a Settling Asbestos Insurance
Company based on or relating to Asbestos Claims shall be channeled to and become
a right, claim or cause of action as an offset claim against the Plan Trust and
not against the Settling Asbestos Insurance Company in question and all persons,
including any Asbestos Insurance Company, shall be enjoined from asserting any
such right, claim or cause of action against a Settling Asbestos Insurance
Company.


                                       62
<PAGE>

            Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, nothing
contained in the Plan will constitute or be deemed a waiver of any claim, right
or cause of action that the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or the Plan Trust
may have against any Entity in connection with or arising out of or related to
an Asbestos Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the
contrary, nothing in the Plan shall be understood to channel, prevent, impair or
limit in any way enforcement against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or
any other Protected Party of any rights provided in connection with any Workers'
Compensation Claim.

      (j)   Reservation of Rights

            Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the
satisfaction, release and discharge, and the Injunctions set forth in Article XI
of the Plan, will not serve to satisfy, discharge, release, or enjoin (i) claims
by the Plan Trust, the Reorganized Debtors, ABI, and their Affiliates, or any
other Entity, as the case may be, against (A) the Plan Trust for payment of Plan
Trust Asbestos Claims in accordance with the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and
the TDP, as applicable, (B) the Plan Trust for the payment of Plan Trust
Expenses, or (C) the Reorganized Debtors, the Plan Trust, or any other Entity,
to enforce the provisions of the Plan or another Plan Document, or (ii) the
rights of any Asbestos Insurance Company to assert any claim, debt, obligation,
cause of action or liability for payment against any other Asbestos Insurance
Company that is not a Settling Asbestos Insurance Company.

      (k)   Rights Against Non-Debtors under Securities Laws

            Notwithstanding any language to the contrary contained in the
Disclosure Statement, the Plan, and/or the Confirmation Order, no provision will
release any non-Debtor, including any current and/or former officer and/or
director of the Debtors and/or any non-Debtor included in the Released
Non-Debtor Parties, from liability to the United States Securities and Exchange
Commission, in connection with any legal action or claim brought by such
governmental unit against such Person(s).

      (l)   Rights Against Debtors under Environmental Laws

            Environmental rights and Claims of Governmental Units under
applicable Environmental Laws will survive the Reorganization Cases, will not be
discharged, impaired or adversely affected by the Plan and the Reorganization
Cases and will be determined in the manner and by the administrative or judicial
tribunals in which such rights or Claims would have been resolved or adjudicated
if the Reorganization Cases had not been commenced. Governmental Units need not
file any Proofs of Claim under Environmental Laws in the Reorganization Cases in
order to preserve Claims under Environmental Laws. Nothing in the Confirmation
Order or Plan will be construed as releasing or relieving any Entity of any
liability under any Environmental Law.

      (m)   Disallowed Claims and Disallowed Interests

            On and after the Effective Date, the Debtors will be fully and
finally discharged from any liability or obligation on a Disallowed Claim or a
Disallowed Interest, and any order creating a Disallowed Claim or a Disallowed
Interest that is not a Final Order as of the Effective Date solely because of an
Entity's right to move for reconsideration of such order pursuant to section 502


                                       63
<PAGE>

of the Bankruptcy Code or Bankruptcy Rule 3008 will nevertheless become and be
deemed to be a Final Order on the Effective Date. The Confirmation Order, except
as otherwise provided in the Plan or ordered by the Bankruptcy Court, will
constitute an order: (i) disallowing all Claims (other than Plan Trust Asbestos
Claims) and Interests to the extent such Claims and Interests are not allowable
under any provision of section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not
limited to, time-barred Claims, and Claims for unmatured interest, and (ii)
disallowing or subordinating, as the case may be, any Claims, or portions of
Claims, for penalties or Non-Compensatory Damages.

      (n)   Reservation of Asbestos Insurance Company Rights

            While the obligations, if any, of the Plan Trust to pay holders of
Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and Demands will be determined pursuant to the Plan
and the Plan Documents, neither the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the Plan and
the Plan Documents nor the Confirmation Order will constitute a trial or hearing
on the merits, or an adjudication or judgment, or be used as evidence to prove:

            (i) that any of the Debtors, the Plan Trust or any Asbestos
Insurance Company is liable for, or otherwise obligated to pay with respect to,
any individual Plan Trust Asbestos Claim or Demand;

            (ii) that the procedures established by the Plan, including the TDP,
for evaluating and paying Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and Demands are reasonable
and/or consistent with the procedures that were used to evaluate or settle
Asbestos Personal Injury Claims against the Debtors before the Petition Date;

            (iii) that the settlement of, or the value assigned to, any
individual Asbestos Personal Injury Claim pursuant to the TDP was reasonable
and/or otherwise appropriate; or

            (iv) that any of the Asbestos Insurance Companies participated in
and/or consented to the negotiation of the Plan or any of the Plan Documents.

            Nothing in the Plan, the Plan Documents, the Confirmation Order, any
finding of fact and/or conclusion of law with respect to Confirmation of the
Plan, or any order or opinion entered on appeal from the Confirmation Order will
limit the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company, in any Asbestos Insurance
Action, to assert any Asbestos Insurer Coverage Defense, including by presenting
evidence and/or argument with respect to any of the matters specified in clauses
(i) though (iv) of this Section; nor will any of the matters specified in
clauses (i) through (iv) of this Section have any res judicata or collateral
estoppel effect against any Asbestos Insurance Company.

            Notwithstanding anything in this Section to the contrary, nothing in
this Section will affect or limit, or be construed as affecting or limiting, (i)
the binding effect of the Plan and the Confirmation Order on the Debtors, the
Reorganized Debtors, the Plan Trust or the beneficiaries of the Plan Trust; or
(ii) the protection afforded to any Settling Asbestos Insurance Company by the
Asbestos Channeling Injunction. Further, nothing in this Section is intended or
will be construed to preclude otherwise applicable principles of res judicata or
collateral estoppel from being applied against any Asbestos Insurance Company
with respect to any issue that is actually litigated by such Asbestos Insurance


                                       64
<PAGE>

Company as part of its objections to confirmation of the Plan.

      (o)   No Liability for Solicitation or Participation

            Pursuant to section 1125(e) of the Bankruptcy Code, the Confirmation
Order will provide that all of the Persons who have solicited acceptances or
rejections of the Plan (including the Debtors and all of their respective
officers, directors, shareholders, attorneys, agents, advisers and employees,
all of the other Released Parties and the Voting Agent) have acted in good faith
and in compliance with the applicable provisions of the Bankruptcy Code, and are
not liable on account of such solicitation or participation, for violation of
any applicable law, rule, or regulation governing the solicitation of
acceptances or rejections of the Plan or the offer, issuance, sale or purchase
of securities.

6.8.  Matters Incident to Plan Confirmation

      (a)   No Successor Liability

            Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, the Debtors, the
Reorganized Debtors, ABI, their Affiliates, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee,
the Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee and the Futures Representative do
not, pursuant to the Plan or otherwise, assume, agree to perform, pay, or
indemnify creditors or otherwise have any responsibilities for any liabilities
or obligations of the Debtors relating to or arising out of the operations of or
assets of the Debtors, whether arising prior to, on, or after the Confirmation
Date. Neither the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, ABI, their Affiliates, nor
the Plan Trust is, or will be, a successor to the Debtors by reason of any
theory of law or equity, and none will have any successor or transferee
liability of any kind or character, except that the Reorganized Debtors and the
Plan Trust will assume the obligations specified in the Plan and the
Confirmation Order.

      (b)   Revesting of Assets

            Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, on the Effective
Date, each Reorganized Debtor will be vested with all of the assets and property
of its former Estate, free and clear of all Claims, Liens, charges and other
interests of holders of Claims or Interests, and may operate its business free
of any restrictions imposed by the Bankruptcy Code or by the Bankruptcy Court.

      (c)   Vesting and Enforcement of Causes of Action

            Pursuant to section 1123(b)(3)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, except as
otherwise provided in the Plan, the Reorganized Debtors will be vested with and
have the right to enforce against any Entity any and all of the Debtors' Causes
of Action other than Causes of Action related to Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and
Plan Trust Assets (including the right to pursue such claims, if any, in the
name of any Debtor if necessary), with the proceeds of the recovery of any such
actions to be property of the Reorganized Debtors; provided, however, that
nothing herein will alter, amend, or modify the injunctions (including the
Injunctions), releases, or discharges provided in the Plan. Pursuant to section
1123(b)(3)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, except as otherwise provided in the Plan,
the Plan Trust will be vested with and have the right to enforce against any
Entity any and all of the Debtors' Causes of Action relating to any Plan Trust


                                       65
<PAGE>

Asbestos Claims or any Plan Trust Assets (including the right to pursue such
claims, if any, in the name of any Debtor if necessary) and for this purpose the
Plan Trust will be designated as a representative of the Estates, with the
proceeds of the recovery of any such actions to be property of the Plan Trust;
provided, however, that nothing herein will alter, amend, or modify the
injunctions (including the Injunctions), releases, or discharges provided in the
Plan.

      (d)   Bankruptcy Causes of Action

            On the Effective Date, the Debtors will assign to the Plan Trust all
Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of Action; provided, however, that any Plan Trust
Bankruptcy Cause of Action arising from any transfer of assets or property to
the Collateral Trust prior to the Petition Date or from any subsequent
distribution by the Collateral Trust of such assets or property will not be
assigned to the Plan Trust and will be unconditionally released by the Debtors
and their Estates in accordance with Sections 11.3 and 11.4 of the Plan. All
such Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of Action will constitute part of the Plan
Trust Assets, and will be transferred to and vested in the Plan Trust as of the
Effective Date, free and clear of all Claims, Liens and encumbrances of every
nature. The Plan Trust will be deemed the appointed representative of the
Debtors' estates to, and may, enforce, pursue, litigate, abandon, compromise and
settle any such Plan Trust Bankruptcy Cause of Action, as it deems appropriate.
All Bankruptcy Causes of Action will be preserved for enforcement solely by the
Reorganized Debtors.

      (e)   Preservation of Insurance Claims

            The discharge and release of the Debtors and the Released Non-Debtor
Parties from all Claims as provided in the Plan and the injunctive protection
provided to the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors, Released Non-Debtor Parties and
Released Parties with respect to Demands, as provided in the Plan, will not
affect the liability of any Asbestos Insurance Company except (i) to the extent
that any such Asbestos Insurance Company is also a Settling Asbestos Insurance
Company or (ii) that all Asbestos Insurer Coverage Defenses are preserved.

6.9.  Retention of Jurisdiction

      (a)   Jurisdiction

            Until the Reorganization Cases are closed, the Bankruptcy Court will
retain the fullest and most extensive jurisdiction permissible, including that
necessary to ensure that the purposes and intent of the Plan are carried out.
Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Bankruptcy Court will retain
jurisdiction to hear and determine all Claims against and Interests in the
Debtors, and to adjudicate and enforce all other causes of action which may
exist on behalf of the Debtors. Nothing contained in the Plan will prevent the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Collateral Trust or the Plan Trust from
taking such action as may be necessary in the enforcement of any cause of action
which any Debtor has or may have and which may not have been enforced or
prosecuted by such Debtor, which cause of action will survive Confirmation of
the Plan and will not be affected thereby except as specifically provided in the
Plan. Nothing contained in the Plan concerning the retention of jurisdiction by
the Bankruptcy Court will be deemed to be a retention of exclusive jurisdiction
with respect to any Asbestos Insurance Action; rather any court other than the
Bankruptcy Court which has jurisdiction over an Asbestos Insurance Action will
have the continuing right to exercise such jurisdiction.


                                       66
<PAGE>

      (b)   General Retention

            Following the Confirmation of the Plan, the administration of the
Reorganization Cases will continue at least until the completion of the
transfers contemplated to be accomplished on the Effective Date. Moreover, the
Plan Trust will be subject to the continuing jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court in accordance with the requirements of section 468B of the IRC and the
regulations issued pursuant thereto. The Bankruptcy Court will also retain
jurisdiction for the purpose of classification of any Claim and the
re-examination of Claims that have been Allowed for purposes of voting, and the
determination of such objections as may be filed with the Bankruptcy Court with
respect to any Claim. The failure by the Debtors to object to, or examine, any
Claim for the purposes of voting, will not be deemed a waiver of the right of
the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or the Plan Trust, as the case may be, to
object to or re-examine such Claim in whole or in part.

      (c)   Specific Purposes

            In addition to the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Court will retain
exclusive jurisdiction for the following specific purposes after the
Confirmation Date:

o     to modify the Plan after Confirmation, pursuant to the provisions of the
      Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules;

o     to correct any defect, cure any omission, reconcile any inconsistency, or
      make any other necessary changes or modifications in or to the Plan, the
      Plan Documents or the Confirmation Order as may be necessary to carry out
      the purposes and intent of the Plan, including the adjustment of the
      date(s) of performance under the Plan Documents in the event that the
      Effective Date does not occur as provided in the Plan so that the intended
      effect of the Plan may be substantially realized thereby;

o     to assure the performance by the Disbursing Agent and the Plan Trustee of
      their respective obligations to make distributions under the Plan;

o     to enforce and interpret the terms and conditions of the Plan Documents;

o     to enter such orders or judgments, including, but not limited to,
      injunctions (i) as are necessary to enforce the title, rights, and powers
      of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Plan Trust, ABI, the Futures
      Representative and the Trust Advisory Committee, or (ii) as are necessary
      to enable holders of Claims to pursue their rights against any Entity that
      may be liable therefor pursuant to applicable law or otherwise, including,
      but not limited to, Bankruptcy Court orders;

o     to hear and determine any motions or contested matters involving taxes,
      tax refunds, tax attributes, tax benefits, tax proceedings and similar or
      related matters with respect to the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or
      the Plan Trust relating to tax periods or portions thereof ending on or
      before the Effective Date, arising on account of transactions contemplated
      by the Plan Documents, or relating to the period of administration of the
      Reorganization Cases;


                                       67
<PAGE>

o     to hear and determine all applications for compensation of professionals
      and reimbursement of expenses under sections 330, 331, or 503(b) of the
      Bankruptcy Code;

o     to hear and determine any causes of action arising during the period from
      the Petition Date through the Effective Date;

o     to hear and determine any claim, cause of action, dispute or other matter
      in any way related to the Plan Documents or the transactions contemplated
      thereby, against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, ABI, the ABI
      Parties, the Trust Advisory Committee, the Plan Trust, the Collateral
      Trust, the Plan Trustee, the Collateral Trustee or the Futures
      Representative and each of their respective Representatives;

o     to hear and determine any and all motions pending as of Confirmation for
      the rejection, assumption, or assignment of executory contracts or
      unexpired leases and the allowance of any Claim resulting therefrom;

o     to hear and determine such other matters and for such other purposes as
      may be provided in the Confirmation Order;

o     to consider and act on the compromise and settlement of any Claim against
      or Interest in the Debtors or their Estates;

o     to hear and determine all questions and disputes regarding title to the
      assets of the Debtors, their Estates, the Reorganized Debtors or the Plan
      Trust;

o     to hear and determine any other matters related to the Plan, including the
      implementation and enforcement of all orders entered by the Bankruptcy
      Court in the Reorganization Cases;

o     to retain continuing jurisdiction with regard to the Plan Trust sufficient
      to satisfy the requirements of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under
      section 468B of the IRC (including Treas. Reg. Section 1.468B-1(c)(1));

o     to hear and determine any and all applications brought by the Plan Trustee
      to amend, modify, alter, waive, or repeal any provision of the Plan Trust
      Agreement or the TDP; and

o     to enter such orders as are necessary to implement and enforce the
      Injunctions and the other injunctions described in the Plan, including,
      without limitation, orders extending the protections afforded by section
      524(g)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code to the Protected Parties, including
      without limitation, ABI, the ABI Parties and the Settling Asbestos
      Insurance Companies.

6.10. Miscellaneous Provisions

      (a)   Substantial Contribution Claims

            Any Entity who requests compensation or expense reimbursement for
making a substantial contribution in the Reorganization Cases pursuant to
sections 503(b)(3), (4) and (5) of the Bankruptcy Code ("Substantial
Contribution Claim") must file an application with the clerk of the Bankruptcy
Court on or before a date that is sixty (60) days subsequent to the Confirmation


                                       68
<PAGE>

Date and serve such application on counsel for the Debtors, counsel for the
Futures Representative and counsel for the Asbestos Claimants' Committee and on
all other parties as otherwise required by the Bankruptcy Court and the
Bankruptcy Code, or be forever barred from seeking such compensation or expense
reimbursement. All Allowed Substantial Contribution Claims will be paid by the
Reorganized Debtors within sixty (60) days of allowance by the Bankruptcy Court.

            The Debtors will not object to a Substantial Contribution Claim made
on behalf of certain holders of Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury Claims
represented by Robert G. Taylor II, Esquire (the "Taylor Claimants") , provided,
however, that (i) any such Substantial Contribution Claim does not exceed
$350,000 and is determined to be reasonable by the Bankruptcy Court; and (ii)
the Taylor Claimants and their counsel make all reasonable efforts to achieve
Confirmation of the Plan by June 1, 2005 and such Confirmation is supported by
at least 75% of the Taylor Claimants.

      (b)   Exemption From Transfer Taxes

            The issuance, transfer, or exchange of any of the securities issued
under, or the transfer of any other assets or property pursuant to or in
connection with the Plan or the making or delivery of an instrument of transfer
under or in connection with the Plan will not, pursuant to section 1146 of the
Bankruptcy Code, be taxed under any law imposing a stamp tax, transfer tax or
other similar tax.

      (c)   Effectuating Documents and Further Transactions

            The Chief Executive Officer, President, Chief Financial Officer or
any Vice President of any Debtor will be authorized to execute, deliver, file or
record such contracts, instruments, releases, indentures, and other agreements
or documents and take or direct such actions as may be necessary or appropriate
to effectuate and further evidence the terms and conditions of the Plan. The
Secretary or any Assistant Secretary of any Debtor will be authorized to certify
or attest to any of the foregoing actions.

      (d)   The Asbestos Claimants' Committee and the Futures Representative

            The Asbestos Claimants' Committee will continue in existence until
the Effective Date, with the Debtors to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of
the Asbestos Claimants' Committee and the Futures Representative through that
date as well, in accordance with any fee and expense procedures promulgated
during the Reorganization Cases. After the Effective Date, the Futures
Representative will (i) continue in existence and the rights, duties and
responsibilities of the Futures Representative will be as set forth in the Plan
Trust Documents and (ii) have the right to prosecute and/or object to
applications for Professional Fee Claims. The Representatives retained by the
Futures Representative during the Reorganization Cases will, as of the Effective
Date, be released and discharged of and from all further authority, duties,
responsibilities, and obligations related to or arising from, the Reorganization
Cases. On the Effective Date, any other committee that may have been appointed
in the Reorganization Cases (other than the TAC) will be dissolved except for
the purposes of: (i) prosecuting any appeal or request for reconsideration or
stay pending appeal of the Confirmation Order; (ii) pending adversary
proceedings; and (iii) prosecuting applications for compensation for the
professionals retained by such committee, and the members, attorneys,


                                       69
<PAGE>

accountants, and other professionals thereof will be released and discharged of
and from all further authority, duties, responsibilities, liabilities, and
obligations related to, or arising from, the Reorganization Cases. On the
Effective Date, the Trust Advisory Committee will assume those powers, duties,
and responsibilities as provided in the Plan Trust Agreement.

      (e)   Modification of the Plan

            The Debtors, with the written consent of ABI and the Futures
Representative, may propose amendments to or modifications of any of the Plan
Documents under section 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code at any time prior to the
Confirmation Date. After Confirmation, the Debtors, with the written consent of
the Futures Representative, the Plan Trustee and ABI, may remedy any defects or
omissions or reconcile any inconsistencies in the Plan or the Confirmation Order
or any other order entered for the purpose of implementing the Plan in such
manner as may be necessary to carry out the purposes and intent of the Plan.
Anything in the Plan or in any Plan Document to the contrary notwithstanding,
following Confirmation, but prior to the Effective Date, the Plan will not be
modified, supplemented, changed or amended in any material respect except with
the consent of ABI (to the extent that any such modification, supplementation,
change, or amendment impairs or affects the rights of ABI or the Affiliates
under the Plan), the Futures Representative, and the Debtors. Unless otherwise
provided in the Confirmation Order or other order of a court of competent
jurisdiction in the event of a conflict between the terms or provisions of the
Plan and the Plan Trust Documents, the terms of the Plan will control.

      (f)   Revocation and Withdrawal of the Plan

            The Debtors reserve the right to revoke and withdraw the Plan before
the entry of the Confirmation Order. If the Debtors revoke or withdraw the Plan,
or if Confirmation does not occur, then, with respect to all parties in
interest, the Plan will be deemed null and void and nothing contained therein
will be deemed to constitute a waiver or release of any Claims by or against the
Debtors or any other Entity or to prejudice in any manner the rights of the
Debtors or such Entity in any further proceedings involving the Debtors.

      (g)   No Admission

            Nothing contained in the Plan or in this Disclosure Statement will
be deemed as an admission by the Debtors, with respect to any matter set forth
therein or herein, including, without limitation, liability on any Claim or the
propriety of any Claims classification.

      (h)   Governing Law

            Except to the extent that federal law (including, but not limited
to, the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules) is applicable or where the
Plan provides otherwise, the rights and obligations arising under the Plan will
be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the laws of the
State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of conflicts of law
thereof which would require the application of any other law.


                                       70

      (i)   Modification of Payment Terms

            The Reorganized Debtors reserve the right to modify the treatment of
any Allowed Claim (other than a Plan Trust Asbestos Claim), as provided in
section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, at any time after the Effective Date
upon the consent of the holder of such Allowed Claim, and solely with respect to
any Allowed ABI Claim, with the additional consent of the Futures Representative
and the Plan Trustee.

      (j)   Duty to Cooperate

            Notwithstanding anything in the Plan to the contrary, nothing in the
Plan will relieve (by way of injunction or otherwise) any of the Debtors or
Reorganized Debtors or any other Entity which is or claims to be an insured
under an Asbestos Insurance Policy from any duty to cooperate that may be
required by any such insurance policy under applicable law with respect to the
defense of any Asbestos Personal Injury Claims asserted against any of the
Debtors or Reorganized Debtors.

      (k)   Claimants' Representative Fee Claims

            To the extent that the actual costs incurred in connection with
Confirmation of the Plan by the Claimants' Representative exceed two million
dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate, the Debtors or, after the Effective Date,
the Reorganized Debtors will provide funding to cover such actual costs, subject
to disclosure of the costs incurred and approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Any
request for payment of such actual costs incurred by Claimants' Representative
must be filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors and their counsel no later
than 60 days after the Effective Date, unless otherwise ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court. Objections to any application of the Claimants' Representative
for compensation or reimbursement of expenses must be filed and served on the
Claimants' Representative and its counsel, if any, no later than the first
Business Day following 30 days (or such other period as may be allowed by order
of the Bankruptcy Court) after the date on which the applicable application for
compensation or reimbursement was received.

                                   ARTICLE 7
                            CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAN

7.1.  Acceptance or Rejection of the Plan

      (a)   Persons Entitled to Vote on the Plan

            Pursuant to section 1126 of the Bankruptcy Code, only Classes of
Claims and Interests that are impaired under the terms and provisions of the
Plan are entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan. Generally speaking,
under section 1124 of the Bankruptcy Code, a class of claims or interests is
"impaired" under a plan of reorganization unless, with respect to each claim or
interest in such class, the plan in question (1) leaves unaltered the legal,
equitable and contractual rights to which such claim or interest entitles the
holder of such claim or interest; or (2) notwithstanding any contractual
provision or applicable law that entitles the holder of such claim or interest
to demand or receive accelerated payment of such claim or interest after the
occurrence of a default (A) cures any such default that occurred before or after
the commencement of the case under the Bankruptcy Code, other than a default of
the kind specified in section 365(b)(2) thereof; (B) reinstates the maturity of


                                       71
<PAGE>

such claim or interest as such maturity existed before such default; (C)
compensates the holder of such claim or interest for any damages incurred as a
result of any reasonable reliance by such holder on such contractual provision
or such applicable law; and (D) does not otherwise alter the legal, equitable,
or contractual rights to which such claim or interest entitles the holder of
such claim or interest.

            Under the Plan, Classes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13 and 14 are Unimpaired;
therefore, the holders of Claims and Interests in such Classes are conclusively
presumed to have accepted the Plan pursuant to section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy
Code. The Company will not solicit acceptances of the Plan from holders of
Claims and Interests in these Classes.

            Classes 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 are Impaired; therefore, the holders
of Claims and Interests in Classes 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 are entitled to vote
to accept or reject the Plan. Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code permits
supplementary injunctions to be issued which channel all Asbestos Claims to a
trust if, among other things, 75% of those claimants voting in the Class or
Classes of claimants whose Claims are to be addressed by the trust vote for the
plan. Because the Claims in Classes 2, 3, 10 and 11 are to be channeled into the
Plan Trust, the Company is soliciting acceptances of the Plan for purposes of
section 524(g) from these Classes.

      (b)   Voting Instructions

            (1) Ballots

            Holders of Claims in Classes 9, 11 and 12 will be sent individual
ballots only. With respect to the Asbestos Claimants in Classes 2, 3 and 10, the
Company will provide either individual ballots or master ballots; provided,
however, master ballots will only be sent to counsel who (i) represent one or
more Asbestos Claimants, (ii) have the requisite authority to vote on behalf of
such Asbestos Claimants, (iii) have filed a 2019 statement with the Bankruptcy
Court, and (iv) have notified the Voting Agent of counsel's intent to use master
ballots.

            If your counsel is not voting on your behalf, you must follow the
procedures outlined below and on your individual ballot in order to properly
complete your ballot.

                  (i) Class 2, 3 and 10 Ballots

            A separate form of ballot will be provided to Holders in Class 2
(Secured Asbestos Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants), Class
3 (Secured Asbestos Claims of Qualified Participating Claimants) and Class 10
(Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury Claims), or their counsel, respectively.

                        (A) Indicate on the ballot, by checking the appropriate
box, whether you are voting to accept or reject the Plan. If your ballot does
not indicate either an acceptance or a rejection of the Plan or if it indicates
both an acceptance and a rejection, it will not be counted.

                        (B) For the holders of claims in Classes 2 and 3, as
well as holders of Claims in Class 10 whose claim amount has been determined
previously, indicate on the ballot, by filling in the appropriate blank, the
dollar amount of your claim. This dollar amount should be the amount you have
agreed to in the Claimant Agreement.

<PAGE>

                        (C) For the holders of Claims in Class 10 whose claims
have not been determined previously, you must indicate your disease level by
marking an "X" in the box that corresponds to your choice. The amount of your
claim will be based on your disease level, and this amount will be for voting
purposes only and will not be binding for any other purpose.

                        (D) Sign and date your ballot, and return it to the
Voting Agent so that it is actually received by the Voting Agent by 5:00 p.m.,
Prevailing Eastern Time, on February 7, 2005, unless otherwise extended by the
Bankruptcy Court.

                        (E) By signing and dating your ballot, you will be
certifying under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ss.1746 that:

                              (2)   All of the information you have provided on
                                    your ballot or master ballot is true and
                                    correct; and

                              (3)   You have the full power and authority under
                                    applicable non-bankruptcy or bankruptcy law
                                    to vote to accept or reject the Plan as an
                                    Asbestos Claimant or counsel.

If you are a holder of a Class 10 claim that has not been determined previously,
you must additionally certify under penalty of perjury that:

                              (4)   You have been exposed to an
                                    asbestos-containing product manufactured or
                                    distributed by Congoleum Corporation or with
                                    respect to which Congoleum has legal
                                    liability and that you have the disease
                                    level indicated on the ballot.

                        (F) If you vote to accept the Plan, you consent to the
release and exculpation provisions set forth in sections 11.3 and 11.4 of the
Plan.

                  (ii)  Class 9, 11 and 12 Ballots

            Holders of Class 9, 11 and 12 Claims, if any, shall receive a ballot
for their respective class.

                        (A) Indicate on the ballot, by checking the appropriate
box, whether you are voting to accept or reject the Plan. If your ballot does
not indicate either an acceptance or a rejection of the Plan or if it indicates
both an acceptance and a rejection, it will not be counted.

                        (B) Indicate on the ballot, by filling in the
appropriate blank, the amount of Claim or the number of shares you hold, as

                                       73
<PAGE>

that you indicated on your Proof of Claim. With respect to Class 9 and 12
Claims, this amount should be the amount of your claim or the number of shares
that you hold, as applicable. The information you enter relating to the amount
and basis of your Claim or Interest will be used solely for the purposes of
identifying your Claim or Interest and may be used for calculating votes to
accept or reject the Plan. Such information does not establish the amount of
your Claim or Interest.

                        (C) Sign and date your ballot, and return it to the
Voting Agent so that it is actually received by the Voting Agent prior to 5:00
p.m., Prevailing Eastern Time, on February 7, 2005, unless otherwise extended by
the Bankruptcy Court.

                        (D) By signing and dating your ballot, you will be
certifying under penalty of perjury pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ss.1746 that:

                              (1)   You have been provided with a copy of the
                                    Disclosure Statement, Plan and the
                                    accompanying exhibits;

                              (2)   All of the information you have provided on
                                    your ballot is true and correct; and

                                    applicable non-bankruptcy or bankruptcy law
                                    to vote to accept or reject the Plan on
                                    behalf of the Claimant listed on your
                                    ballot.

                        (E) If you vote to accept the Plan, you consent to the

2005, UNLESS OTHERWISE EXTENDED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. ALL BALLOTS WILL BE
TABULATED BY THE VOTING AGENT.

            IN ORDER TO BE COUNTED, BALLOTS MUST BE ACTUALLY RECEIVED BY THE
VOTING AGENT ON OR BEFORE 5:00 P.M., PREVAILING EASTERN TIME, ON FEBRUARY 7,
2005, UNLESS OTHERWISE ORDERED BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, AT THE APPROPRIATE

                                       74
<PAGE>

            (3) Incomplete or Irregular Ballots

            Ballots or master ballots that are not signed in accordance with the
voting instructions will not be counted.

            Ballots or master ballots that are signed, but not expressly voted
either for acceptance or rejection of the Plan, will not be counted.

            Ballots or master ballots that do not supply the information
requested on the ballot or master ballot, as applicable, will not be counted.

            Ballots or master ballots that are not actually received by the
Voting Agent by the Voting Deadline on February 7, 2005 at 5:00 p.m., Prevailing
Eastern Time, will not be counted.

            Ballots or master ballots that are illegible or contain insufficient
information (such as incomplete or missing social security numbers for Asbestos
Claimants) to permit the identification of the Claimant will not be counted.

            Ballots or master ballots transmitted to the Voting Agent by
facsimile or other electronic means will not be counted.

            Ballots or master ballots that are incomplete, including without
limitation with respect to an Asbestos Claimant for whom counsel fails to make
the required certifications, will not be counted.

            (4) Extension of the Solicitation Period

            The solicitation period for ballots with respect to the Plan will
expire at 5:00 p.m., Prevailing Eastern Time, on February 7, 2005 unless
otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. Except to the extent allowed by the
Bankruptcy Court, ballots that are received after the Voting Deadline may not be
accepted or used by the Company in connection with its request for Confirmation
of the Plan or any modification thereof.

            (5) Ballot Retention

            The original ballots or master ballots will be maintained by the
Voting Agent for a period of one year following the Effective Date, unless
otherwise instructed by the Reorganized Debtors, in writing, or otherwise
ordered by the Bankruptcy Court.

      (c)   Class Acceptance Requirement

            Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code does not require that each holder
of a Claim vote in favor of the Plan for it to be confirmed by the Bankruptcy
Court. Instead, the Bankruptcy Code defines acceptance of the Plan by a Class of
Claims as acceptance by holders of at least two-thirds in amount and more than
one-half in number of the claims of that Class that have voted on the Plan,
excluding any holders of Claims designated pursuant to section 1126(e) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Acceptance by a Class of Interests is defined as acceptance by
holders of at least two-thirds in amount of the Allowed Interests of that Class
held by holders of such Interests that have voted on the Plan, excluding any
holders of Interests designated pursuant to section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy


                                       75
<PAGE>

Code. Section 1126(e) provides that a vote may be disregarded if the Bankruptcy
Court determines, after notice and a hearing, that an Entity's acceptance or
rejection of the plan was not in good faith, or was not solicited or procured in
good faith, or in accordance with the provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

      (d)   Acceptance Pursuant to Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code

            In accordance with section 524(g)(2)(B)(ii)(IV)(bb) of the
Bankruptcy Code, a supplementary injunction may be issued if, among other
things, 75% of those voting in the Class or Classes of claimants addressed by
the trust vote in favor of the Plan.

7.2.  Confirmation Hearing

            Section 1128(a) of the Bankruptcy Code requires the court, after
notice, to hold a hearing on confirmation of a plan. Notice of the Confirmation
Hearing will be provided to all creditors and equity holders or their
representatives. The Confirmation Hearing may be adjourned from time to time by
the Bankruptcy Court without further notice except for an announcement of the
adjourned date made at the Confirmation Hearing or any subsequent adjourned
Confirmation Hearing.

            Section 1128(b) of the Bankruptcy Code provides that any party in
interest may object to confirmation of a plan. Any objection to confirmation of
the Plan must be in writing, must conform to the Bankruptcy Rules, must set
forth the name of the objecting party, the nature and amount of Claims or
Interests held or asserted by the objectant against the Debtor or property, the
basis for the objection and the specific grounds therefor, and must be filed
with the Bankruptcy Court by the date and time set forth in the notice of the
Confirmation Hearing, and served upon the parties and their counsel, so as to be
received no later than the date and time for service of the objections, all as
designated in the notice of the Confirmation Hearing.

7.3.  Requirements for Confirmation

      (a)   Consensual Confirmation Under Section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code

            At the Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court will determine
whether the requirements of section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code have been
satisfied, in which event the Bankruptcy Court will enter the Confirmation
Order. Such requirements include, among others:

                  (i) That the Plan complies with applicable provisions of the
Bankruptcy Code.

                  (ii) That the Debtors have complied with the applicable
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code.

                  (iii) That the Plan has been proposed in good faith and not by
any means forbidden by law.

                  (iv) That any payment made or promised by the Debtors to any
Entity for services, costs or expenses in or in connection with the
Reorganization Cases or the Plan has been approved by or is subject to approval
by the Bankruptcy Court as reasonable.


                                       76
<PAGE>

                  (v) That the Debtors have disclosed the identity and
affiliations of any individual proposed to serve as a director or an officer of
the Reorganized Debtors after confirmation of the Plan and that the appointment
to, or continuance in, such office by such individual is consistent with the
interests of holders of Claims and Interests and with public policy.

                  (vi) That the Plan is in the best interests of the holders of
Claims and Interests; that is, each holder of an Allowed Claim or Allowed
Interest either has accepted the Plan or will receive or retain on account of
its Claim or Equity Interest property with a value, as of the Effective Date,
that is not less than the amount that the holder would receive or retain if the
Debtors were liquidated under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code on the Effective
Date.

                  (vii) Each Class of Claims or Interests has either accepted
the Plan or is not impaired under the Plan, provided, however, that if such
requirement is not met, the Plan may be confirmed pursuant to section 1129(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code.

                  (viii) Except to the extent that the holder of a particular
Claim has agreed to a different treatment of such Claim, the Plan provides that
Allowed Administrative Expense Claims and Allowed Priority Claims will be paid
in full on the Effective Date and that Allowed Priority Tax Claims will be
either paid in full on the Effective Date or will receive on account of such
Claims deferred cash payments, over a period not exceeding six years after the
date of assessment of such Claims, of a value, as of the Effective Date, equal
to the Allowed Amount of such Claims.

                  (ix) At least one impaired Class of Claims has accepted the
Plan, without regard to the votes of any insiders.

                  (x) That the Plan is feasible; that is, confirmation is not
likely to be followed by the need for liquidation or further reorganization of
the Reorganized Debtors.

                  (xi) All fees comparable to the fees payable under section
1930 of title 28 of the U.S. Code, if and to the extent due, have been paid on
or prior to the Effective Date.

                  (xii) The Plan provides for the continuation after the
Effective Date of payment of all retiree benefits, as that term is defined in
section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code, without modification by the Plan, thereby
complying with section 1114 of the Bankruptcy Code.

            The Plan is the product of extensive arms-length negotiations and
has been proposed in good faith. The Company believes that the Plan satisfies
all applicable requirements of section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code. A
discussion of the reasons the Company believes the Plan satisfies certain of
such requirements is set forth below and the satisfaction of the remaining
requirements of section 1129(a) of the Bankruptcy Code is, in the Company's
belief, self-explanatory:

            (1) Best Interests Test

            Under the best interests test, the Plan may be confirmed if, with
respect to each Impaired Class of Claims or Interests, each holder of an Allowed
Claim or Allowed Interest in such Class either (A) has accepted the Plan or (B)
will receive or retain under the Plan, on account of its Claim or Interest,


                                       77
<PAGE>

property of a value, as of the Effective Date, that is not less than the amount
such holder would receive or retain if the Company were to be liquidated under
Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code.

            To determine what the holders in each Class of Claims or Interests
would receive if the Company were to be liquidated, the Bankruptcy Court must
estimate the dollar amount that would be generated from the liquidation of the
Company's assets and properties in the context of a Chapter 7 liquidation case.
The cash amount that would be available for satisfaction of the Allowed Claims
and Allowed Interests of the Company would consist of the proceeds resulting
from the disposition of the assets of the Company, augmented by the cash held by
the Company at the time of the commencement of a Chapter 7 case. Such cash
amount would be reduced by the costs and expenses of the liquidation and by any
additional Administrative Claims and Priority Claims that would result from the
termination of the Company's business and the use of a Chapter 7 proceeding for
the purposes of liquidation. See Exhibit B (Liquidation Analysis).(2)

            The Company believes that the timing of distributions under a
Chapter 7 case would be delayed and the amount of distributions that would be
made in a Chapter 7 case would be materially less than the distributions
contemplated by the Plan. In addition, the ability of the trustee in a Chapter 7
case to negotiate settlements with insurance companies without the benefit of
the section 524(g) injunctions is likely to be impaired, with the result that
fewer settlements are likely to be achieved, and the terms of any such
settlements are likely to be less favorable to Claimants than settlements
achievable in the Reorganization Cases. Furthermore, unlike the Plan Trust in
the Reorganization Cases, a Chapter 7 trustee would not receive the benefits of
the Promissory Note and the ABI Contribution.

            The Company therefore believes that the Plan is in the best
interests of all holders of Claims and Interests.

            (2) Feasibility of the Plan

            In order for the Plan to be confirmed, the Bankruptcy Court also
must determine that the Plan is feasible -- that is, that the need for further
reorganization or a subsequent liquidation of the Company is not likely to
result following confirmation of the Plan. In determining whether a plan of
reorganization is feasible, a court will consider (A) the adequacy of the
proposed capital structure of the reorganized entity, (B) its earning power, (C)
the overall economic conditions in which it will operate, (D) the capability of
its management, (E) the continuity of its management and (F) any other factors
the court deems relevant to the successful operation of the reorganized entity
to perform the provisions of the plan of reorganization.

            The Reorganized Debtors will be discharged from Asbestos Claims and
otherwise in general will be free of prepetition debt, other than indebtedness
in respect of or under (1) the Lender Secured Claims, (2) Other Secured Claims
and (3) Senior Note Claims, as well as ongoing business expenses and
reorganization costs. Congoleum anticipates that the cash flow generated by its
business and assets will be sufficient to pay its ongoing obligations under the
Promissory Note, its other long-term debt and its business expenses.

                                       78
<PAGE>

            The Company, therefore, believes that the Plan is feasible.

            (3) Acceptance by an Impaired Class

            Because the Plan impairs several Classes of Claims (Classes 2, 3, 9,
10, 11 and 12), section 1129(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that for the
Plan to be confirmed, at least one Impaired Class of Claims must accept the Plan
by the requisite vote. As more fully described in Section 7.1(c) - "Class
Acceptance Requirement," an Impaired Class of Claims will have accepted the Plan
if and only if at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of
the Allowed Claims in such Class that vote have voted to accept the Plan.

      (b)   Conditions to Confirmation

            Confirmation of the Plan will not occur unless each of the following
conditions has been satisfied or waived in accordance with Section 10.3 of the
Plan. These conditions to Confirmation, which are designed, among other things,
to ensure that the Injunctions, releases, and discharges set forth in Article XI
of the Plan will be effective, binding and enforceable, are as follows:

            (i) The Bankruptcy Court will have made specific findings and
determinations, among others, in substantially the following form:

                  (A) The Discharge Injunction and the Asbestos Channeling
Injunction are to be implemented in connection with the Plan and the Plan Trust;

                  (B) As of the Petition Date, Congoleum has been named as a
defendant in personal injury, wrongful death or property damage actions seeking
recovery for damages allegedly caused by the presence of, or exposure to,
asbestos or asbestos-containing products;

                  (C) The Plan Trust, upon the Effective Date, will assume the
liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and
Demands;

                  (D) The Plan Trust is to be funded in part by securities of
Reorganized Congoleum in the form of the Promissory Note that is secured by,
among other things, the Other Collateral, and the Pledged Stock (being
securities of Reorganized Congoleum) pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and
constitutes an obligation of Reorganized Congoleum to make future payments to
the Plan Trust;

                  (E) The Plan Trust, on the Effective Date, will hold as
collateral for the Promissory Note, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge
Agreement, a majority of the voting shares of Congoleum, and if certain
contingencies occur the Plan Trust will be entitled to foreclose its security
interests in the Pledged Stock, and own such Pledged Stock if there are any
defaults under the terms of the Promissory Note pursuant to the terms of the
Pledge Agreement;

                  (F) The Plan Trust is to use its assets and income to pay Plan
Trust Asbestos Claims and Plan Trust Expenses;


                                       79
<PAGE>

                  (G) Congoleum is likely to be subject to substantial future
Demands for payment arising out of the same or similar conduct or events that
gave rise to the Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, which are addressed by the Asbestos
Channeling Injunction;

                  (H) The actual amounts, numbers and timing of future Demands
cannot be determined;

                  (I) Pursuit of Demands outside the procedures prescribed by
the Plan and the TDP is likely to threaten the Plan's purpose to deal equitably
with Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and future Demands;

                  (J) The Plan establishes separate Classes of Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims that are to be addressed by the Plan Trust and at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the Asbestos Claimants voting in such Classes have
accepted the Plan;

                  (K) Pursuant to court orders or otherwise, the Plan Trust will
operate through mechanisms such as structured, periodic or supplemental
payments, Pro Rata distributions, matrices or periodic review of estimates of
the numbers and values of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims or other comparable
mechanisms, that provide reasonable assurance that the Plan Trust will value,
and be in a financial position to pay, Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and
Demands therefor in substantially the same manner;

                  (L) The Futures Representative was appointed by the Bankruptcy
Court as part of the proceedings leading to the issuance of the Discharge
Injunction and the Asbestos Channeling Injunction for the purpose of, among
other things, protecting the rights of persons that might subsequently assert
Demands of the kind that are addressed in the Discharge Injunction and the
Asbestos Channeling Injunction and transferred to the Plan Trust;

                  (M) In light of the benefits provided, or to be provided, to
the Plan Trust on behalf of each Protected Party, the Asbestos Channeling
Injunction is fair and equitable with respect to the persons that might
subsequently assert Demands against any Protected Party;

                  (N) The Plan otherwise complies with section 524(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code;

                  (O) Congoleum's contribution to the Plan Trust and ABI's
contribution of the ABI Contribution to the Plan Trust provided for in the Plan,
together with the Asbestos Insurance Assignment, constitute substantial assets
of the Plan Trust and the reorganization;

                  (P) The duties, obligations and any Asbestos Insurer Coverage
Defenses of the insurers that issued policies and their successors and assigns,
or, with respect to any insolvent insurers, their liquidators and/or the state
insurance guaranty funds that bear responsibility with respect to such rights
under such policies which constitute the Asbestos Insurance Rights and Asbestos
Property Damage Insurance Rights are not eliminated or diminished by the
transfer pursuant to the Plan of the Debtors' rights in the Asbestos Insurance
Rights and Asbestos Property Damage Insurance Rights pursuant to the Insurance
Assignment Agreement; and


                                       80
<PAGE>

                  (Q) Amendments to the Collateral Trust Agreement to conform it
to the TDP will have been executed and delivered by Congoleum and the Collateral
Trustee and consented to by the Claimants' Representative.

            (ii) The Bankruptcy Court will have made such findings and
determinations regarding the Plan as will enable the entry of the Confirmation
Order and any other order entered in conjunction therewith, each of which will
be in form and substance acceptable to the Debtors, ABI and the Futures
Representative and, insofar as such findings and determinations affect the
Financing Order or the rights of Congress thereunder, Congress.

      (c)   Conditions for Effective Date

            Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan or the Confirmation
Order, the Effective Date of the Plan will not occur unless and until each of
the following conditions has been satisfied or, if applicable, waived:

            (1) Confirmation Order

            The Confirmation Order will have been entered by the Bankruptcy
Court and affirmed by the District Court or entered by the District Court, and
the Confirmation Order and any order of the District Court will be in form and
substance acceptable to the Debtors, ABI, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, and
the Futures Representative, and the Confirmation Order (and the affirming order
of the District Court) will have become a Final Order; provided, however, that
the Effective Date may occur at a point in time when the Confirmation Order is
not a Final Order at the option of the Debtors, with the written consent of ABI,
the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, and the Futures Representative, unless the
effectiveness of the Confirmation Order has been stayed, reversed or vacated.
The Effective Date may occur, again at the option of the Debtors, with the
written consent of the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the Futures Representative
and ABI, on the first Business Day immediately following the expiration or other
termination of any stay of effectiveness of the Confirmation Order.

            (2) Injunctions

            The Discharge Injunction and the Asbestos Channeling Injunction will
be in full force and effect.

            (3) Amended Credit Agreement

            The Amended Credit Agreement and all documents to be executed in
connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the Debtors, will not restrict Reorganized Congoleum's
obligations to make scheduled interest payments under the Promissory Note except
as provided in the Promissory Note and will have been executed and delivered and
all conditions precedent to effectiveness thereof will have been satisfied or
waived by the parties thereto.

            (4) Plan Documents

            The Plan Documents necessary or appropriate to implement the Plan
(which will include without limitation, the Promissory Note, the Plan Trust
Documents, the Pledge Agreement and the Insurance Assignment Agreement) will


                                       81
<PAGE>

have been executed, delivered and, where applicable, filed with the appropriate
governmental authorities; all conditions precedent to the effectiveness of each
of the Plan Documents will have been satisfied or waived by the respective
parties thereto; and the Plan Documents will be in full force and effect.

            (5) Other Assurances

            The Debtors will have obtained either (i) a private letter ruling
from the Internal Revenue Service establishing that the Plan Trust is a
"qualified settlement fund" pursuant to Section 468(B) of the IRC and the
regulations issued pursuant thereto, or (ii) other decisions, opinions or
assurances regarding certain tax consequences of the Plan, satisfactory to the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors and the Futures Representative.

            (6) Other Approvals, Documents and Actions

            All authorizations, consents and regulatory approvals required, if
any, in connection with the consummation of the Plan will have been obtained,
and all actions, documents, and agreements necessary to implement the Plan will
have been effected or executed.

            (7) Judicial Fees

            All fees payable pursuant to 28 U.S.C. ss. 1930 if and to the extent
assessed against the Bankruptcy Estates of the Debtors will have been paid in
full.

      (d)   Nonconsensual Confirmation Under Section 1129(b) of the Bankruptcy
            Code

            Although section 1129(a)(8) of the Bankruptcy Code requires that a
plan be accepted by each class that is impaired by such plan, section 1129(b) of
the Bankruptcy Code provides that the Bankruptcy Court may still confirm the
Plan at the request of the Debtors if all requirements of section 1129(a) other
than section 1129(a)(8) are met and if, with respect to each Class of Claims or
Interests that is impaired under the Plan and has not voted to accept the Plan,
the Plan "does not discriminate unfairly" and is "fair and equitable." A plan
confirmed on the basis of this provision is commonly referred to as a "cramdown"
plan. A cramdown plan is only available pursuant to section 1129(a)(10) of the
Bankruptcy Code if at least one impaired class of claims accepts the plan. In
the event there is no impaired accepting Class, the Debtors could not seek
cramdown confirmation of the Plan because the Plan would not comply with the
requirements of section 1129(a)(10) of the Bankruptcy Code. In any event, the
Debtors do not intend to seek confirmation of the Plan if the voting
requirements of section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code are not met with respect
to the relevant Claims.

      (e)   Injunction Under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code

            Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code authorizes the Bankruptcy
Court to enjoin Entities from taking action to collect, recover or receive
payment or recovery with respect to any Claim or Demand that is to be paid in
whole or in part by a trust created by a plan of reorganization that satisfies
the requirements of the Bankruptcy Code. The injunction may also bar any action
based on such Claims or Demands against Congoleum that are directed at third
parties.


                                       82
<PAGE>

            To obtain the injunction, a trust must be established that (1)
assumes Congoleum's Plan Trust Asbestos Claims; (2) is funded in whole or in
part by securities of Congoleum and with an obligation by Congoleum to make
future payments; (3) owns or is entitled to own if specified contingencies
occur, a majority of the voting shares of Congoleum; and (4) uses its assets or
income to satisfy claims and demands.

            As a requirement before issuing an injunction under section 524(g)
of the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Court must determine that (1) Congoleum
is likely to be subject to substantial Demands for payment arising out of the
same or similar conduct or events that give rise to the Claims that are
addressed by the injunction; (2) the actual amounts, numbers and timing of such
Demands cannot be determined; (3) pursuit of such Demands outside the procedures
prescribed by the Plan is likely to threaten the Plan's purpose to deal
equitably with Claims and Demands; and (4) the Plan Trust will operate through
mechanisms such as structured, periodic, or supplemental payments, pro rata
distributions, matrices, or periodic review of estimates of the numbers and
values of Claims and Demands, or other comparable mechanisms that provide
reasonable assurance that the Plan Trust will value, and be in a financial
position to pay, Claims and Demands that involve similar Claims in substantially
the same manner.

            The Bankruptcy Court must also ensure that the terms of any proposed
section 524(g) injunction are set forth in the plan and disclosure statement and
that a separate Class or Classes of claimants whose Claims are to be addressed
by the trust be established and vote, by at least seventy-five percent (75%) of
those voting in such Class or Classes, in favor of the Plan. Moreover, the
injunction will be valid and enforceable as to future claimants only if a legal
representative is appointed to protect their rights in the proceedings and if
the court determines that applying the injunction to future claimants in favor
of the beneficiaries of the injunction is fair and equitable with respect to the
Persons that might subsequently assert such Demands, in light of the benefits
provided, or to be provided, to the Plan Trust on behalf of Congoleum or a
beneficiary of the third party injunction.

            The order confirming the Plan must be issued or affirmed by the
District Court that has jurisdiction over the Reorganization Cases.

            The Company believes that it will be able to satisfy the
requirements of section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, to the extent that the
requisite number of Asbestos Claimants in Classes 2, 3, 10 and 11 vote in favor
of the Plan.

            Under the jurisdictional scheme applicable to bankruptcy courts,
jurisdiction over bankruptcy cases and proceedings arising under the Bankruptcy
Code or arising in or related to bankruptcy cases is vested in the district
courts. However, the district courts may refer them to the bankruptcy judges of
the district. In most districts, the district court has entered a standing order
referring all such matters to the bankruptcy judges.

            The Company filed the Reorganization Cases with the Bankruptcy Court
of the District of New Jersey. Because section 524(g) requires, however, that
any confirmation order containing a supplemental injunction must be issued or
affirmed by the District Court, the reference may be withdrawn and the
Reorganization Cases might proceed before a district judge. In this instance,
the Debtors' Chapter 11 cases have been assigned to the Hon. Katherine Ferguson,


                                       83
<PAGE>

a United States Bankruptcy Judge and it is anticipated that the Bankruptcy Judge
will conduct the Confirmation Hearing and enter the Confirmation Order. In that
instance, the section 524(g) injunctions will not be enforceable until the
Confirmation Order is affirmed by a district judge.

7.4.  Effect of Confirmation

            Upon the Bankruptcy Court's entry of the Confirmation Order (and, if
the District Court is not the issuing court of the Confirmation Order, the
Confirmation Order being affirmed thereof by the District Court as required by
section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code), and subject to the occurrence of the
Effective Date, the Plan will be binding upon the Company, all holders of Claims
and Interests and all other parties in interest, regardless of whether they have
accepted the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE 8
                PLAN TRUST AND ASBESTOS CLAIMS RESOLUTION MATTERS

            THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT FEATURES OF THE
PLAN TRUST. THIS SUMMARY IS QUALIFIED IN ITS ENTIRETY BY REFERENCE TO THE
COMPLETE TEXT OF THE PLAN TRUST DOCUMENTS AND THE PLAN.

8.1.  Establishment and Purpose of the Plan Trust

            On the Effective Date, the Plan Trust will be established in
accordance with the Plan Documents. The Plan Trust is intended to be a
"qualified settlement fund" within the meaning of section 468B of the IRC and
Treasury Regulations promulgated thereunder. All Plan Trust Asbestos Claims will
be paid in accordance with the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP. The purpose of
the Plan Trust will be to, among other things, (a) pay all Plan Trust Asbestos
Claims in accordance with the Plan, the TDP, the Plan Trust Agreement and the
Confirmation Order; (b) preserve, hold, manage, and maximize the Plan Trust
Assets for use in paying and satisfying Plan Trust Asbestos Claims; (c)
prosecute, settle, and manage the disposition of the Asbestos In-Place Insurance
Coverage; and (d) prosecute, settle, and manage Asbestos Insurance Actions and
Direct Actions. All Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, including the future Asbestos
Claims and Demands of Plan Trust Asbestos Claimants that are presently unknown,
will be determined and liquidated, if Allowed, pursuant to the Plan, the Plan
Trust Agreement and the TDP.

            On the Effective Date, all liabilities, obligations and
responsibilities relating to all Plan Trust Asbestos Claims will be transferred
to the Plan Trust and the Plan Trustee, on behalf of the Plan Trust, will
expressly assume all liability for all Plan Trust Asbestos Claims. Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims of Qualified Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants are secured in
the full amount of their Qualified Claims and will be paid by the Plan Trust in
accordance with the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP. The Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims of the Qualified Participating Claimants are Secured Asbestos
Claims to the extent of seventy-five percent (75%) of the liquidated settlement
amounts with the remaining twenty-five percent (25%) remaining unsecured.
Holders of Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury Claims will be paid the unpaid
Liquidated Value of such Claims in accordance with, and subject to the
limitations in, the TDP.


                                       84
<PAGE>

8.2.  Funding and Receipt of Plan Trust Assets

            On the Effective Date, Reorganized Congoleum will issue the
Promissory Note to, and all Plan Trust Assets will be transferred to, vested in,
and assumed by the Plan Trust free and clear of all Claims, Liens and
encumbrances, except for Liens filed for the benefit of Richard Arsenault,
Kenneth Cook and Dennis Matthews and subject to payment priorities set forth in
the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP; provided, however, that to the
extent that certain Plan Trust Assets, because of their nature or because they
will accrue subsequent to the Effective Date, cannot be transferred to, vested
in, and assumed by the Plan Trust on the Effective Date, such Plan Trust Assets
will be transferred to, vested in, and assumed by the Plan Trust as soon as
practicable after the Effective Date. On the Effective Date, pursuant to the
Pledge Agreement, ABI will pledge the Pledged Stock and the Other Collateral to
the Plan Trust to secure performance of the obligations of Congoleum under the
Promissory Note. On the Effective Date, ABI will also deliver the ABI
Contribution to the Plan Trust by wire transfer of immediately available funds.
If ABI prepays the Promissory Note in accordance with the terms of the
Promissory Note at any time after the Principal Adjustment Date (as defined in
the Promissory Note), but prior to the third anniversary of the Principal
Adjustment Date, and subsequent to that payment, but prior to such third
anniversary there is a Disposition Event, then if the Second Re-Measurement
Value exceeds the greater of the Re-Measurement Value (as defined in the
Promissory Note) and $2,738,234.75, ABI will, following the effective date of
such Disposition Event, promptly pay to the Plan Trust an amount equal to 50% of
such excess amount. ABI may not prepay the Promissory Note prior to the
Principal Adjustment Date. On the Effective Date, the Debtors will also deliver
the Insurance Assignment Agreement attached to the Plan as Exhibit "C" thereto,
and such agreement will be valid, binding and enforceable. The Insurance
Assignment Agreement will transfer claims and rights set forth therein as
Debtors may have, subject to any Asbestos Insurer Coverage Defenses.

            On the Effective Date, pursuant to the terms of the Collateral Trust
Agreement, all of the Collateral Trust's right, title and interest in and to any
assets or properties then held by the Collateral Trust will automatically be
transferred and assigned to, and vest in, the Plan Trust free and clear of all
Claims, Liens and encumbrances, except for Liens filed for the benefit of
Richard Arsenault, Kenneth Cook and Dennis Matthews, and all rights with respect
to such assets and properties will be enforceable by the Plan Trust.

            Congoleum is in discussions with a number of its insurers about the
possibility of receiving lump sum payments as a commutation of part or all of
such insurers' policies. If such negotiations are successful that could result
in substantial funds being immediately contributed or committed to the Plan
Trust. It is not possible at this time to say whether or not such negotiations
will succeed.

            It is possible that the Coverage Litigation will be resolved
adversely to Congoleum; this would have a substantial adverse impact on the
amount of funds available in the Plan Trust. It is also possible that the
Coverage Litigation will result in a judgment establishing coverage in favor of
Congoleum but requiring that in order to trigger a payment obligation by an
insurer a claim would have to be adjusted through normal litigation or
settlement with the participation of the relevant insurance carrier(s). If this
occurred, it could be necessary either for the Plan Trust to be amended
significantly or for significant numbers of Asbestos Personal Injury Claimants


                                       85
<PAGE>

and their counsel to pursue claims through the courts in order to generate
payments by insurance carriers into the Plan Trust.

8.3.  Discharge of Liabilities to Holders of Asbestos Claims

            Except as provided in the Plan and the Confirmation Order, the
transfer to, vesting in and assumption by the Plan Trust of the Plan Trust
Assets as contemplated by the Plan, among other things, will discharge the
Debtors and the Reorganized Debtors from and in respect of all Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims.

8.4.  Excess Plan Trust Assets

            To the extent there are any Plan Trust Assets remaining after the
payment in full of all Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and all Plan Trust Expenses
(or provision has been made therefor) in accordance with the Plan Trust
Agreement and the TDP, such excess Plan Trust Assets will be transferred to a
tax-exempt organization qualified under section 501(c)(3) of the IRC, which is
to be determined by the Plan Trustee; provided, however, that such charitable
purpose, if practicable, will be related to the treatment of or research
regarding asbestos-related disorders.

8.5.  Plan Trust Expenses

            The Plan Trust will pay all Plan Trust Expenses from the Plan Trust
Assets. Neither the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, ABI nor their Affiliates
will have any obligation to pay any Plan Trust Expenses. Notwithstanding any
provision herein to the contrary, on the Effective Date, (i) the Collateral
Trustee will provide the Plan Trust with a certification setting forth the
amount of Asbestos Expenses incurred by or on behalf of, or imposed on, the
Collateral Trust, or otherwise payable by the Collateral Trust, in each case
prior to the Effective Date and all appropriate invoices and other backup
regarding such Asbestos Expenses, including without limitation, amounts which
may be due to the Claims Reviewer (or to Congoleum to reimburse it for amounts
it paid to the Claims Reviewer) for services performed prior to the Effective
Date and (ii) the Plan Trust will only assume Asbestos Expenses from periods
prior to the Effective Date if and to the extent set forth on such
certification. The Plan Trustees, each member of the TAC, the Futures
Representative and the Representatives of each of the foregoing will have a lien
upon the Plan Trust Assets which will be prior to any lien thereon, and the Plan
Trust will grant a security interest in the Plan Trust Assets, all proceeds
thereof and all accounts into which such proceeds or the Plan Trust Assets are
deposited or maintained to secure payment of amounts payable to them as
compensation or indemnification.

8.6.  Appointment of the Initial Plan Trustee

            Prior to the Confirmation Hearing, the Debtors, with the approval of
the Futures Representative and the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, will nominate
the initial Plan Trustee. Effective as of the Effective Date, the Bankruptcy
Court will appoint the initial Plan Trustee to serve as Plan Trustee in
accordance with the Plan Trust Agreement. For purposes of performing his or her
duties and fulfilling his or her obligations under the Plan Trust Agreement, the
TDP and the Plan, the Plan Trustee will be deemed to be a party in interest
within the meaning of section 1109(b) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Plan Trustee
will be the "administrator" of the Plan Trust as that term is used in Treasury
Regulation Section 1.468B-2(k)(3).


                                       86
<PAGE>

8.7.  The Futures Representative

            On and after the Effective Date, the Futures Representative will
continue to serve as the Futures Representative pursuant to the terms of the
Plan Trust Agreement and will have the functions and rights provided in the Plan
Trust Documents.

8.8.  Appointment of Members of the Trust Advisory Committee

            After the Confirmation Date, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee will
designate the initial members of the TAC. Effective as of the Effective Date,
the Bankruptcy Court will appoint the initial members of the TAC (and thereupon
the TAC will be formed) to serve as members of the TAC in accordance with the
Plan Trust Agreement.

8.9.  Assumption of Liabilities

            On the Effective Date, all liabilities, obligations and
responsibilities relating to all Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and Asbestos
Expenses will be transferred to the Plan Trust and the Plan Trustee, on behalf
of the Plan Trust, will expressly assume all liability for all Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims, Demands and Asbestos Expenses, subject to the provisions of the
Plan Trust Agreement.

8.10. Indemnification of the Company and Reorganized Congoleum by the Plan Trust

            As and to the extent provided in the Plan Trust Agreement, the Plan
Trust (and to the extent specified in Section 6.7(f), the Reorganized Debtors)
will indemnify and hold harmless each of the Plan Trustees, the Plan Trust
officers and employees, the Futures Representative, the Claimants'
Representative, the Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the Asbestos
Claimants' Committee, the Collateral Trustee, each member of the TAC, the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors and their respective past, present and future
Representatives.

8.11. Establishment of the TDP

            Following the Effective Date, the Plan Trustee will promptly
implement the TDP. The TDP sets forth the procedures for resolving TDP Valued
Asbestos Claims. The TDP also provides mechanisms such as structured, periodic
or supplemental payments, pro rata distributions, or periodic review of
estimates of the numbers and values of present Unsecured Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims and future Demands, or other comparable mechanisms, that provide
reasonable assurance that the Plan Trust will value and be in a financial
position to pay similar Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury Claims in
substantially the same manner. The TDP may be modified prior to the Effective
Date and after the Effective Date from time to time in accordance with the terms
of the TDP and the Trust Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE 9
                            ESTIMATED CLAIMS BY CLASS

            The Company and its professionals have attempted to determine the
number and amount of Asbestos Claims likely to be asserted in the case. There
are such inherent difficulties in doing so that no representation can be made as
to the precise accuracy of such information. As of December 31, 2003, Claims
against the Company are as follows:


                                       87
<PAGE>

9.1.  Claims other than Asbestos Claims

      (a)   Administrative Expense Claims

            The Company estimates that the costs and expenses of the
Reorganization Cases will likely total approximately $25 million (before any
reimbursement of Coverage Costs), including the costs of professionals retained
during the Reorganization Cases.

      (b)   Priority Tax Claims

            The Company believes it is likely that there will be few, if any,
Priority Tax Claims.

      (c)   Priority Claims (Class 1)

            The Company obtained approval of the Bankruptcy Court to pay
Priority Claims in the ordinary course of business, including wages due to
employees and contributions on its employees' behalf to employee benefit plans.
The Company believes that there will be few, if any, Priority Claims remaining
unpaid at the Effective Date.

      (d)   Lender Secured Claims (Class 4)

            The Company estimates that the Lender Secured Claims (Class 4) total
approximately $10.2 million.

      (e)   Senior Note Claims (Class 6)

            The Company expects that the Senior Note Claims (Class 6) total
approximately $100 million, plus accrued interest through the Effective Date.

      (f)   General Unsecured Claims (Class 7)

            The Company obtained authority from the Bankruptcy Court at the
beginning of the Reorganization Cases to pay such claims in the ordinary course
of business, when such Claims become due. The Company believes that there will
be few, if any, General Unsecured Claims remaining unpaid at the Effective Date.

      (g)   Workers' Compensation Claims (Class 8)

            As of December 31, 2003, the current incurred liability was
estimated to be approximately $3.2 million.

      (h)   ABI Claims (Class 9)

            The Company estimates such Claims total approximately $1.8 million.

9.2.  Asbestos Claims

      (a)   Secured Asbestos Claims (Classes 2 and 3)

            The Company estimates that the maximum amount of the aggregate
Settlement Amounts of Secured Asbestos Claimants total approximately $375
million.

      (b)   Unsecured Asbestos Personal Injury Claims (Class 10)

            In light of the information presently available to the Company, and
the uncertainties and difficulties inherent in determining the number and amount
of Asbestos Claims, the Company believes that the classification and treatment
provided by the Plan complies with applicable law and is fair and equitable.

      (c)   Asbestos Property Damage Claims (Class 11)

            The aggregate filed amount of Asbestos Property Damage Claims is
approximately $900,000 and does not exceed the amount of proceeds from insurance
coverage available for such Claims.

                                RISKS OF THE PLAN

10.1. General

            The following is intended as a summary of certain risks associated
with the Plan, but is not exhaustive and must be supplemented by the analysis
and evaluation of the Plan and this Disclosure Statement as a whole by each
holder of a Claim with such holder's own counsel and other advisors.

10.2. Confirmation Risks

            For the Plan to be confirmed, each Impaired Class is given the
opportunity to vote to accept or reject the Plan. With regard to the Impaired
Classes which vote on the Plan, the Plan will be deemed accepted by a Class of
Impaired Claims if the Plan is accepted by holders of Claims of such Class who
hold at least two-thirds in amount and more than one-half in number of the total
Allowed Claims of such Class actually voting on the Plan. Only those members of
a Class who vote to accept or reject the Plan will be counted for voting
purposes. The Plan must also comply with the requirements of section 524(g) of
the Bankruptcy Code. Thus, if votes of holders of Claims in Classes 2, 3, 10 and
11 are received in number and amount sufficient to enable the Bankruptcy Court
to confirm the Plan and issue a supplemental injunction under section 524(g) of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Company intends to seek, as promptly as practicable,
confirmation of the Plan.

            Any objection to the Plan by a party in interest could either
prevent, or delay for a significant period of time, confirmation of the Plan.


                                       89
<PAGE>

            Moreover, although the Company believes that the Plan will satisfy
all requirements necessary for confirmation by the Bankruptcy Court, there can
be no assurance that the Bankruptcy Court will reach the same conclusion.

10.3. Insurance Coverage for Plan Trust Asbestos Claims

            As described in Section 2.2 above, Congoleum has been in discussions
with its insurers about insurance coverage for Asbestos Claims for some time.
Furthermore, as specifically discussed in Section 2.2(c) above, there is
insurance coverage litigation currently pending between Congoleum and its excess
insurers, and the guaranty funds and associations for the State of New Jersey.

            In the Coverage Litigation, Congoleum's insurers have asserted that
both the Claimant Agreement and the TDP are unreasonable and the result of
improper "collusion" among counsel representing Asbestos Claimants and
Congoleum. According to Congoleum's insurers, Congoleum has violated numerous
provisions in its insurance policies by agreeing to the Claimant Agreement and
the TDP. In particular, Congoleum's insurers assert that Congoleum has violated
consent-to-settlement clauses, cooperation clauses, consent-to-assignment
clauses, and other clauses.

            Most of Congoleum's insurers assert that they have no coverage
obligations for claims resolved pursuant to the Claimant Agreement and the TDP.
Most of Congoleum's insurers also have asserted coverage defenses unrelated to
the terms of particular settlement agreements entered into by Congoleum. Some of
Congoleum's insurers also assert that, as a result of Congoleum's alleged
breaches of its insurance policies, the policies are now void, relieving the
insurers of all coverage obligations for all time under the policies.

            While the recoveries of Asbestos Claimants under the Plan could be
affected by an adverse ruling in the Coverage Litigation, Congoleum strongly
disagrees with the insurers' coverage positions and believes that the most
valuable assets being assigned to the Plan Trust under the Plan are proceeds
from Congoleum's insurance policies. Congoleum believes, based on discovery
taken in the coverage litigation to date, that one of three outcomes is possible
if the Court were to rule that Congoleum is not entitled to coverage for claims
asserted under the Claimant Agreement: (i) all coverage, both present and
future, could be voided; (ii) Claims settled under the Claimant Agreements could
be deemed ineligible for insurance coverage, but all future and unliquidated
claims or demands would remain eligible for coverage; or (iii) future coverage
would remain in place, and the insurers would be required to compensate
Congoleum for any settled claims that satisfied the disease and exposure
criteria in accordance with the various policies of insurance. Based upon
developments in the Coverage Litigation to date, Congoleum believes it is highly
unlikely that it will be left with no liability insurance coverage for
liquidated and/or future claims even if the Court in the Coverage Litigation
were to rule that the Claimant Agreements did not settle conclusively the rights
of the Plan Trust to insurance coverage.

            Because of the risks involved with respect to the effects of various
potential rulings by the Bankruptcy Court or an appeal thereof, as well as the
uncertainty in the resolution of any present or future Asbestos Insurance
Action, including the Coverage Litigation, the ultimate value of the insurance
proceeds that will be available to the Plan Trust is uncertain. The Company has


                                       90
<PAGE>

addressed the potential impact of this uncertainty on the Plan Trust by
authorizing the Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and the Futures
Representative, to amend the TDP and/or the Plan Trust Agreement under certain
circumstances. Specifically, Section 8.2 of the TDP provides that should any
provision contained in the TDP be determined to be inconsistent with or contrary
to Congoleum's obligations to any insurance company providing insurance coverage
to any Debtor in respect of claims for personal injury based on exposure to
asbestos-containing products, the Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and
the Futures Representative, may amend the TDP and/or the Plan Trust Agreement to
make the provisions of either or both documents consistent with the duties and
obligations of such Debtor to said insurance company. Moreover, the possibility
that one or more of the Insurance Companies may become insolvent in the future
may impact the value of Congoleum's insurance coverage, and thus the value of
the Plan Trust Assets.

10.4. Distributions under the TDP

            Payments that will be made on Plan Trust Asbestos Claims will be
determined under the TDP, the Plan and the Plan Trust Agreement and will be
based on one hand, upon estimates of the number, types and amount of present and
expected future Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and, on the other hand, on the value
of the Plan Trust Assets, the liquidity of the Plan Trust Assets, the Plan
Trust's expected future expenses and income, as well as other material matters
that are reasonable and likely to affect the sufficiency of funds to pay all
holders of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims. There can be no certainty as to the
precise amounts that will be distributed by the Plan Trust in any particular
time period or when Plan Trust Asbestos Claims will be paid by the Plan Trust.

10.5. Risk of Post-Confirmation Default

            Although no guarantees can be given, the Company believes that the
cash flow generated by its business and assets will be sufficient to meet
Reorganized Congoleum's ongoing business obligations and operating requirements
and that such cash flow will be sufficient to make the payments required under
the Plan. The Company further believes that Congoleum's net cash flow will be
sufficient to make payments on the Promissory Note to the Plan Trust. At the
Confirmation Hearing, the Bankruptcy Court will be required to make a judicial
determination that the Plan is feasible in order to confirm the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE 11
            ALTERNATIVES TO CONFIRMATION AND CONSUMMATION OF THE PLAN

            If the Plan is not confirmed and consummated, the alternatives to
the Plan include (a) liquidation of the Company under Chapter 7 of the
Bankruptcy Code; and (b) an alternative plan of reorganization.

11.1. Liquidation under Chapter 7

            If no plan can be confirmed, the Reorganization Cases may be
converted to proceedings under Chapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code, pursuant to
which a trustee would be appointed to liquidate the assets of the Company for
distribution in accordance with the priorities established by the Bankruptcy
Code. A discussion of the effects that a Chapter 7 liquidation would have on the
recovery of holders of Claims and Equity Interests and the Company's liquidation


                                       91
<PAGE>

analysis are set forth in Section 7.3(a)(1) -- "Best Interests Test" above. The
Company believes that the timing of the distributions under a Chapter 7 case
would be delayed and the amount of distributions that would be made in a Chapter
7 case would be materially less than the distributions contemplated by the Plan,
because, among other things, (a) the ability of the trustee in a Chapter 7 case
to negotiate settlements with Asbestos Insurance Companies without the benefit
of the section 524(g) injunctions is likely to be impaired, and (b) a Chapter 7
trustee would not receive the benefits of the Promissory Note or the ABI
Contribution.

            Attached hereto as Exhibit B is a Liquidation Analysis for the
Company, which assumes that a bankruptcy case under Chapter 7 is commenced
immediately and that the Company's assets are liquidated by a Chapter 7 trustee
in an orderly liquidation. The Liquidation Analysis is based upon a number of
estimates and assumptions which, while considered reasonable, are inherently
beyond the control of the Company or any Chapter 7 trustee. Accordingly, there
can be no assurances that the values reflected in the Liquidation Analysis would
be realized if the Company were to undergo such a Chapter 7 liquidation; actual
results could vary materially from those shown in that exhibit. In addition, any
liquidation would necessarily take place in the future under circumstances which
presently cannot be predicted. Accordingly, if the Estates were liquidated, the
actual liquidation proceeds could be materially lower or higher than the amounts
set forth in Exhibit B, and no representation or warranty can be made with
respect to the actual proceeds that could be received in a Chapter 7
liquidation.

11.2. Alternative Plan of Reorganization

            If the Plan is not confirmed, the Company, or if the Company's
exclusive period in which to file a plan of reorganization has expired, any
other party in interest could attempt to formulate a different plan of
reorganization. However, the Plan is the product of extensive negotiations among
Congoleum, the Futures Representative, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the
Taylor Claimants, the Claimants' Representative and ABI, and is a delicate
balance of the competing and conflicting interests held by those parties. Any
attempt to propose an alternative plan containing different terms for any of
these parties would threaten to disrupt the balance established by the Plan.
This, in turn, could lead to years of costly litigation for all parties.

            THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE CONFIRMATION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF THE
PLAN IS PREFERABLE TO ANY OF THE ALTERNATIVES BECAUSE IT SHOULD PROVIDE GREATER
RECOVERIES THAN THOSE AVAILABLE IN LIQUIDATION OR UNDER ANY ALTERNATIVE PLAN.

                                   ARTICLE 12
               CERTAIN FEDERAL INCOME TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE PLAN

            A summary description of certain United States federal income tax
consequences of the Plan is provided below. This summary is for informational
purposes only and should not be relied upon for purposes of determining the
specific tax consequences of the Plan to a particular holder of a Claim. Only
the principal United States federal income tax consequences of the Plan to
Congoleum, the Plan Trust and certain impaired holders of Claims are described
below. No opinion of counsel has been sought or obtained with respect to any tax
consequences of the Plan. No rulings or determinations of the Internal Revenue


                                       92
<PAGE>

Service or any other taxing authority have been sought or obtained with respect
to any tax consequences of the Plan, and the discussion below is not binding
upon the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority. No assurance
can be given that the Internal Revenue Service or any other taxing authority
would not assert, or that a court would not sustain, a different position from
any discussed herein.

            This summary is based upon existing United States federal income tax
law, which is subject to change, possibly with retroactive effect. This summary
does not address all aspects of United States federal income taxation that may
be important to a particular holder of a Claim in light of such holder's
individual investment circumstances or to certain types of holders of Claims
subject to special tax rules (e.g., financial institutions, insurance companies,
broker-dealers, tax-exempt organizations, and foreign persons), all of whom may
be subject to tax rules that differ significantly from those summarized below.
This summary does not discuss any foreign, state, or local tax considerations.
In addition, this summary does not address the possible application of recently
adopted IRC amendments and United States Treasury regulations concerning
reportable transactions, which include transactions with respect to which, under
certain circumstances, taxpayers claim losses. Each holder of a Claim is urged
to consult its tax advisor regarding the United States federal, state, local,
and foreign income and other tax consequences of the Plan.

12.1. Tax Consequences to Congoleum

      (a)   Discharge of Indebtedness

            In general, a taxpayer must include in gross income the amount of
any indebtedness that is cancelled ("COD Income") during the taxable year.
However, Section 108(a)(1)(A) of the IRC provides an exception to this rule
where a taxpayer is subject to the jurisdiction of a bankruptcy court and the
cancellation of indebtedness is granted by, or effected pursuant to, a plan
approved by such court, as would be the case upon the confirmation of the Plan.
In this event, rather than being included in gross income, the COD Income is
applied to reduce the following tax attributes of the taxpayer in the following
order: net operating losses, business and minimum tax credit carry forwards,
capital loss carry forwards, the basis of the taxpayer's assets, and foreign tax
credit carry forwards (collectively, the "Tax Attributes"). Under Section
108(b)(5) of the IRC, a taxpayer may elect to first apply the reduction to the
basis of the taxpayer's depreciable assets, with any remaining balance applied
to the other Tax Attributes in the order stated above. Additionally, Section
108(e)(2) of the IRC provides that no COD Income is realized to the extent that
the taxpayer's satisfaction of the cancelled debt would have given rise to a tax
deduction for United States federal income tax purposes. The effect of Section
108(e)(2) of the IRC, where applicable, is to allow the taxpayer's debt to be
cancelled without the recognition of income by the taxpayer and without
reduction of its Tax Attributes.

            Pursuant to the Plan, although an amount of Asbestos Claims will be
paid, holders of Asbestos Claims may receive less than 100% of the face value of
their Claims and thus an amount of Asbestos Claims also may be cancelled.
However, such cancellation of Asbestos Claims generally will not result in COD
Income to Reorganized Congoleum because payment of the Asbestos Claims would
have given rise to tax deductions for Reorganized Congoleum. In addition,
although the terms of the Amended Credit Agreement have not yet been determined,
Congoleum believes it unlikely that an amendment of the Existing Credit
Agreement will result in COD Income to Reorganized Congoleum. Although adoption


                                       93
<PAGE>

of the Amended Credit Agreement likely will be viewed, for United States federal
income tax purposes, as an exchange of one debt instrument for another, such
deemed exchange will result in COD Income only if, among other things, the
principal amount of the debt under the Amended Credit Agreement is less than the
principal amount of the debt under the Existing Credit Agreement or if the
interest rate on the debt under the Amended Credit Agreement is less than a
certain threshold, neither of which is expected to occur.

            Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the discharge of
indebtedness pursuant to the Plan were to cause Reorganized Congoleum to
recognize COD Income, Congoleum has not yet determined whether it would make the
election under Section 108(b)(5) of the IRC to apply any required Tax Attribute
reduction first to depreciable property, with any excess next applied to reduce
other Tax Attributes. In this regard, as of December 31, 2003, Congoleum had net
operating losses of approximately $10.4 million.

      (b)   Transfers to the Plan Trust

            The Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 468B of the IRC
provide that a fund, account, or trust will constitute a qualified settlement
fund ("QSF") if it satisfies three conditions. First, the fund, account, or
trust must be established pursuant to an order of or be approved by a government
authority, including a court, and must be subject to the continuing jurisdiction
of that government authority. Second, the fund, account, or trust must be
established to resolve or satisfy one or more contested or uncontested claims
that have resulted or may result from an event or related series of events that
has occurred and that has given rise to at least one claim asserting liability
arising from, among other things, a tort. Third, the fund, account, or trust
must be a trust under applicable state law or have its assets physically
segregated from the other assets of the transferor and persons related to the
transferor.

            The transfer of property to a QSF generally is treated as a sale or
exchange of that property. However, the issuance of a transferor's debt
generally is not a transfer of property for this purpose and generally does not
result in gain or loss to the transferor. A payment to a QSF generally is
deductible when made, assuming that such payment otherwise constitutes an
ordinary and necessary business expense. However, to the extent that debt issued
by the transferor is transferred to a QSF, the transferor is entitled to a
deduction only as the transferor makes principal payments. Additionally, no
deduction is allowed with respect to the transfer of insurance proceeds to a QSF
to the extent the transferred amounts are excludable from gross income of the
transferor. If the settlement of an insurance claim occurs after the transfer of
such claim to the QSF and a deduction has been taken with respect to such
transfer, then the transferor must include in income the amounts received from
the settlement of the insurance claim to the extent of the deduction.

            Assuming confirmation of the Plan, the Plan Trust will be
established to satisfy Plan Trust Asbestos Claims alleged to arise out of a tort
or torts, will be a trust under state law, and will be approved by the
Bankruptcy Court or District Court and subject to its continuing jurisdiction.
Accordingly, based on those assumptions and on the completion of certain
filings, the Plan Trust will constitute a QSF after confirmation of the Plan.
Certain insurance proceeds and certain rights under and security interests in
insurance coverage will be transferred to the Plan Trust; Reorganized Congoleum
also will transfer the Promissory Note to the Plan Trust. Although amounts


                                       94
<PAGE>

transferred to a QSF generally are deductible, no deduction will be allowed to
Reorganized Congoleum with respect to the transfer of insurance proceeds to the
extent the transferred amounts are excludable from gross income of Reorganized
Congoleum. Further, if the settlement of an insurance claim occurs after the
transfer of such claim to the QSF and Reorganized Congoleum has taken a
deduction with respect to such transfer, then Reorganized Congoleum will be
required to include in income the amounts received from the settlement of the
insurance claim to the extent of the deduction. With regard to the Promissory
Note, Reorganized Congoleum will be entitled to tax deductions as it makes
principal payments on the Promissory Note.

12.2. Tax Consequences to the Plan Trust

            Assuming that, as expected, the Plan Trust qualifies as a QSF, the
Plan Trust will be required to pay federal income tax on its modified gross
income, as defined in the Treasury regulations promulgated under Section 468B of
the IRC, at the highest rate applicable to estates and trusts. The Plan Trust
generally will not be required to include in income amounts transferred to it
pursuant to the Plan, except that interest and original issue discount, if any,
on the Promissory Note will be includible in gross income by the Plan Trust. The
Plan Trust will not be entitled to deduct amounts that it pays with respect to
Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, but will be entitled to deduct amounts paid for
administrative costs and other incidental costs of the Plan Trust.

12.3. Tax Consequences to Certain Impaired Holders of Claims

            The United States federal income tax consequences to a holder of a
Claim that is impaired and the character and amount of income, gain or loss
recognized as a consequence of the Plan and the distributions provided for
thereby will be determined by reference to the Claim in respect of which the
distribution is made and as if the distribution were made directly by
Reorganized Congoleum and accordingly will depend upon, among other things: (1)
the nature of the Claim, (2) the manner in which a holder acquired the Claim,
(3) the length of time the Claim has been held, (4) whether the Claim was
acquired at a discount, (5) whether the holder has taken a bad debt deduction
with respect to the Claim (or any portion thereof) in the current or prior
years, (6) whether the holder has previously included in income accrued but
unpaid interest with respect to the Claim, (7) the method of tax accounting of
the holder, and (8) whether the Claim constitutes a security for United States
federal income tax purposes. Accordingly, each holder of a Claim is urged to
consult its tax advisor regarding the tax consequences of the Plan to it.

      (a)   Holders of Asbestos Claims

            Under Section 104 of the IRC, to the extent that a payment from the
Plan Trust to a holder of an Asbestos Personal Injury Claim constitutes damages
on account of personal physical injuries or physical sickness of such holder,
such payment will not constitute gross income to such holder, except to the
extent that the payment is attributable to medical expense deductions taken
under Section 213 of the IRC for a prior taxable year. A payment from the Plan
Trust to a holder of an Asbestos Personal Injury Claim other than on account of
personal physical injuries or physical sickness generally will be includible in
gross income of such holder.


                                       95
<PAGE>

            A payment to a holder of an Allowed Asbestos Property Damage Claim
generally will generate income or loss to the recipient in an amount equal to
the difference between the payment received and such holder's tax basis in the
damaged property.

      (b)   Holder of Lender Secured Claim

            As discussed above, an amendment of the Existing Credit Agreement
likely will result in a deemed exchange, for United States federal income tax
purposes, of the Existing Credit Agreement for the Amended Credit Agreement.
Notwithstanding this, it is not expected that the holder of the Lender Secured
Claim will realize income, gain or loss for United States federal income tax
purposes as a result of this deemed exchange, assuming that the principal amount
of the debt under the Amended Credit Agreement is the same as the principal
amount of the debt under the Existing Credit Agreement and the interest rate on
the Amended Credit Agreement exceeds a minimum threshold.

      (c)   Information Reporting and Backup Withholding

            Certain payments of Allowed Claims may be subject to information
reporting by the Plan Trust to the Internal Revenue Service. Moreover, such
reportable payments may be subject to backup withholding (at a rate of 28% for
2004) under certain circumstances. Backup withholding is not an additional tax.
Amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules may be credited against a
holder's United States federal income tax liability, and a holder may obtain a
refund of any excess amounts withheld under the backup withholding rules by
filing an appropriate claim for refund with the Internal Revenue Service
(generally, a United States federal income tax return).

                              FINANCIAL INFORMATION

13.1. General

            An analysis of the Company's financial condition appears in the
Financial Statements attached hereto as Exhibit "C" and Exhibit "D". This
information is provided to permit Claimants to better understand the Company's
financial condition.

            The Company is required to file monthly operating reports with the
Bankruptcy Court. Such financial information is on file with the Bankruptcy
Court and publicly available for review. In addition, Congoleum continues to
make the filings required by the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended.

<PAGE>

14.2. Accounting Method

            The Company maintains its books and records on an accrual basis, in
accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. The financial
statements of the Company have been audited by the accounting firm of Ernst &
Young through December 31, 2003.

                          RECOMMENDATION AND CONCLUSION

            The Company recommends that all holders of Claims in Classes 2, 3,
9, 10 and 11 and holders of Interests in Class 12 vote to accept the Plan, and
urges each of them to evidence such acceptance and approval, by instructing the
holder of any proxy for them to vote to accept the Plan on their behalf, or by
returning their ballots so that they will be received on or before the Voting
Deadline.

            In the view of the Company, the Plan provides the best available
alternative for maximizing the distributions that holders of Asbestos Claims
will receive from the Estates.

pay all Plan Trust Asbestos Claims in accordance with the Plan, the Plan Trust
Agreement, the TDP and the Confirmation Order; (ii) preserve, hold, manage, and
maximize the Plan Trust Assets for use in paying and satisfying Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims in accordance with the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP; (iii)

Coverage; and (iv) prosecute, settle, and manage Asbestos Insurance Actions and

and clear of all Claims, Liens and encumbrances except for Liens filed for the
benefit of Richard Arseneault, Kenneth Cook and Dennis Matthews and subject to
the payment priorities set forth in the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the
TDP; provided, however, that to the extent that certain Plan Trust Assets,
because of their nature or because they will accrue subsequent to the Effective
Date, cannot be transferred to, vested in, and assumed by the Plan Trust on the
Effective Date, such Plan Trust Assets shall be transferred to, vested in, and

and enter into the Pledge Agreement.

            (c) Additional Plan Trust Contribution. ABI shall not prepay the
Promissory Note in full for any reason prior to the Principal Adjustment Date.
If ABI prepays the Promissory Note in full in accordance with the Promissory
Note (other than Section 13 of the Promissory Note) at any time after the
Principal Adjustment Date (as defined in the Promissory Note), but prior to the
third anniversary of the Principal Adjustment Date, and subsequent to that
payment but prior to such third anniversary there is a Disposition Event, then
if the Second Re-Measurement Value exceeds the greater of the Re-Measurement
Value (as defined in the Promissory Note) and $2,738,234.75, ABI shall,
following the effective date of such Disposition Event promptly pay (in full in
Cash) to the Plan Trust an amount equal to 50% of such excess amount. Congoleum
shall be obligated to repay ABI for the Additional Plan Trust Contribution,
which repayment obligation shall be evidenced by a promissory note substantially
similar in form and content to the Promissory Note with any amount paid by ABI
with regard to the Additional Plan Trust Contribution constituting principal
that shall be treated in substantially the same manner as the Original Principal
Amount is treated under the Promissory Note.

properties then held by the Collateral Trust shall automatically be transferred

the Distribution Date shall be deemed actually made on the Distribution Date if
made either (a) on the Distribution Date or (b) as soon as practicable
thereafter. With respect to Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, distributions to holders
of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims shall be made in accordance with the Plan Trust
Agreement and/or the TDP, as applicable.

      6.2 Delivery of Distributions. Distributions to holders of Allowed Claims
other than Asbestos Claims shall be made by the Disbursing Agent (a) at the
holder's last known address, or (b) at the address in any written notice of
address change delivered to the Disbursing Agent or the Plan Trustee, as
applicable. If any holder's distribution is returned as undeliverable, no
further distributions to such holder shall be made, unless and until the
Disbursing Agent is notified of such holder's then current address, at which
time all missed distributions shall be made to such holder without interest.
Amounts in respect of undeliverable distributions made through the Disbursing
Agent shall be returned to the appropriate Reorganized Debtor until such
distributions are claimed or become unclaimed property pursuant to Section 6.4
of the Plan. With respect to Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, distributions to the
holders of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims shall be made in accordance with the Plan
Trust Agreement and/or the TDP, as applicable. Distributions on account of the
ABI Personal Injury Indemnity Claims and all ABI Claims (other than ABI Asbestos
Property Damage Indemnity Claims and Other ABI Asbestos Claims) shall be subject
to the terms of the Pledge Agreement.

      6.3 Withholding of Taxes. The Disbursing Agent shall withhold from any
assets or property distributed under the Plan any assets or property that must
be withheld pursuant to applicable law.

      6.4 Unclaimed Property. Any Cash, assets and other property to be
distributed on account of any Claim other than a Plan Trust Asbestos Claim under
the Plan that remain unclaimed (including by an Entity's failure to negotiate a
check issued to such Entity) or otherwise not deliverable to the Entity entitled
thereto before the later of (a) one year after the date of distribution or (b)
120 calendar days after an order allowing such Entity's Claim becomes a Final
Order, shall become vested in, and shall be transferred and delivered to, the
Reorganized Debtors. In such event, such Entity's Claim shall no longer be
deemed to be Allowed and such Entity shall be deemed to have waived its rights
to such payments or distributions under the Plan pursuant to section 1143 of the
Bankruptcy Code and shall have no further Claim in respect of such distribution
and shall not participate in any further distributions under the Plan with
respect to such Claim.

                                  ARTICLE VII

                          RESOLUTION OF DISPUTED CLAIMS

      7.1 Disallowance of Improperly Filed Claims. Subject to section 502(j) of
the Bankruptcy Code and Bankruptcy Rules 3008 and 9006, any Administrative
Claim, Asbestos Property Damage Claim or Claim (other than Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims and ABI Claims) for which the filing of a Proof of Claim,
application or motion with the Bankruptcy Court is required under the terms of
the Bankruptcy Code, the Bankruptcy Rules, any order of the Bankruptcy Court
(including one providing a Bar Date) or the Plan shall be Disallowed if and, to
the extent that such Proof of Claim (or other filing) is not timely and properly
made.

      7.2 Prosecution of Objections to Claims. Unless otherwise ordered by the
Bankruptcy Court after notice and a hearing, after the Effective Date the
Reorganized Debtors shall have the exclusive right to make and file objections
to Proofs of Claims, other than Proofs of Claims in respect of Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims, Unknown Asbestos Claims, Professional Fee Claims and ABI Asbestos
Claims, at any time on or before ninety (90) days after the later of (i) the
Effective Date or (ii) the date on which such Claim was filed with the
Bankruptcy Court unless no Proof of Claim is required to be filed pursuant to
Bankruptcy Rule 3002, the Plan or any order of the Bankruptcy Court; provided,
however, that (x) this deadline may be extended by the Bankruptcy Court on
motion by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, and (y) neither
the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors nor any other Person may file an objection
to any (1) Claim that was Allowed by a Final Order entered during the
Reorganization Cases, or (2) Claim Allowed by the Plan. In addition, unless
otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court after notice and a hearing, after the
Effective Date the Reorganized Debtors, subject to Sections 13.5 and 13.11 of
the Plan, shall have the exclusive right to make and file objections to
Administrative Claims and to amend the Schedules or to object to any Claim
specified on the Schedules, at any time on or before sixty (60) days after the
later of (i) the Effective Date or (ii) the date on which such Claim was filed
with the Bankruptcy Court unless no Proof of Claim is required to be filed
pursuant to Bankruptcy Rule 3002, the Plan or any order of the Bankruptcy Court;
provided, however, that (x) this deadline may be extended by the Bankruptcy
Court on motion by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, and

(y) neither the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors nor any other Person may file
an objection to any (1) Claim that was Allowed by a Final Order entered during
the Reorganization Cases, or (2) Claim Allowed by the Plan. Without prejudice to
the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company to assert any Asbestos Insurer
Coverage Defenses, after the Effective Date, only the Plan Trustee shall have
the authority to contest Asbestos Personal Injury Claims, Unknown Asbestos
Claims and ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims and litigate to
judgment, settle or withdraw such objections and each Asbestos Personal Injury
Claim, Unknown Asbestos Claim and ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim,
whether or not a Proof of Claim was filed with the Bankruptcy Court, shall be
satisfied exclusively in accordance with the Plan Trust Documents.

      7.3 No Distributions Pending Allowance. Notwithstanding any other
provision hereof, if a Claim or any portion of a Claim is a Disputed Claim, no
payment or distribution shall be made on account of such Disputed Claim, unless
and until such Disputed Claim becomes an Allowed Claim.

      7.4 Distributions After Allowance. Payments and distributions to each
holder of a Claim that is Disputed, or that is not Allowed, to the extent that
such Claim ultimately becomes Allowed, shall be made in accordance with the
provisions hereof governing the Class of Claims in which such Claim is
classified. As soon as practicable after the date that the order or judgment of
the Bankruptcy Court allowing any Disputed Claim (other than a disputed Asbestos
Claim) becomes a Final Order, the Reorganized Debtors shall distribute to the
holder of such Claim any payment or property that would have been distributed to
such holder if the Claim had been Allowed as of the Effective Date (or such
other date on which such distribution would have been made).

      7.5 Liquidation of ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims.

            (a) Liability for ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims
shall be determined under the provisions of the Joint Venture Agreement
applicable thereto and this Section 7.5.

            (b) ABI shall give prompt written notice to the Plan Trust and
Reorganized Congoleum of an ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim, except
that any delay or failure to so notify the Plan Trust and Reorganized Congoleum
shall relieve the Plan Trust of its obligations in respect of such ABI Asbestos
Personal Injury Indemnity Claim only to the extent, if at all, that the Plan
Trust is materially prejudiced by reason of such delay or failure. Such notice
shall include detailed information concerning the basis for the ABI Asbestos
Personal Injury Indemnity Claim. Reorganized Congoleum shall assist and
cooperate with the Plan Trust in understanding and evaluating the basis of the
ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim, and each of Reorganized Congoleum
and ABI shall provide such further information to the Plan Trust as it may
reasonably request during the 30 day period following the Plan Trust's receipt
of ABI's notice, provided, however, that Reorganized Congoleum and ABI shall not
be required to disclose privileged information. If, by the expiration of such 30
day period, the Plan Trust has not notified ABI that it has determined that the
asserted ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim is due and payable by the
Plan Trust, or if the Plan Trust concludes (and notifies ABI) during such period
that it is unable to determine based on the information provided whether the
Plan Trust has liability for such ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim,
ABI, Reorganized Congoleum and the Plan Trustee shall endeavor to resolve
consensually whether the Plan Trust has liability in respect of such ABI
Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim and if so, the amount of such
liability, for a period of 15 days (the "Negotiation Period").

            (c) If upon the conclusion of the Negotiation Period, ABI,
Reorganized Congoleum and the Plan Trustee have not resolved all outstanding
issues related to the ABI Personal Injury Indemnity Claim and the Reorganization
Case of Congoleum remains open, ABI may file in the Bankruptcy Court an
application for allowance of such ABI Personal Injury Indemnity Claim, which
application shall be treated as a proof of claim filed under section 501 of the
Bankruptcy Code, and deemed allowed pursuant to section 502 of the Bankruptcy
Code unless the Plan Trust files an objection to the application within 30 days
following receipt of notice of the filing thereof. The Bankruptcy Court shall
adjudicate an ABI application for allowance of an ABI Personal Injury Indemnity
Claim that is subject to objection by the Plan Trust as a contested matter, with
each party bearing its own costs and expenses, including attorneys' fees.

            (d) If upon the conclusion of the Negotiation Period, ABI,
Reorganized Congoleum and the Plan Trustee have not resolved all outstanding
issues related to the ABI Personal Injury Indemnity Claim and the Reorganization
Case of Congoleum is closed, such issues shall be submitted to binding
arbitration and shall be finally settled under the Commercial Arbitration Rules
of the American Arbitration Association (the "AAA") by an arbitrator appointed
by agreement of ABI and the Plan Trust in accordance with such rules of the AAA.
In the event ABI and the Plan Trust fail to agree upon an arbitrator, the AAA
shall select an arbitrator in accordance with such rules of the AAA. Any such
arbitration will be conducted in New York, New York. Any party to an arbitration
may be represented by its attorney or other representative selected by such
party. Each party shall be responsible for its own costs and expenses, including
attorneys' fees, and the arbitrator shall issue a final ruling within one
hundred and twenty (120) days of the commencement of the arbitration proceeding.

            (e) If at any time following ABI's assertion of an ABI Asbestos
Personal Injury Indemnity Claim in accordance with this Section 7.5, the Plan
Trust notifies ABI that it accepts liability for such ABI Asbestos Personal
Injury Indemnity Claim and ABI and the Plan Trust agree on the amount of such
liability, or if the Bankruptcy Court or an arbitrator determines the amount of
such ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim, such ABI Asbestos Personal
Injury Indemnity Claim shall be Allowed in the amount so agreed or determined,
and, notwithstanding any provision of the Joint Venture Agreement to the
contrary, the Plan Trust shall only be obligated to pay the portion of the
Allowed Amount of such ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claim as is
determined in accordance with the TDP.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                        TREATMENT OF EXECUTORY CONTRACTS,
                        UNEXPIRED LEASES AND SETTLEMENTS

      8.1 Assumption of Unexpired Leases and Executory Contracts.

            (a) Assumption. Except for any unexpired lease or executory contract
that the Debtors reject or designate as being subject to rejection on or before
the Effective Date, and except for the Joint Venture Agreement, as of the
Effective Date, all executory contracts and unexpired leases not previously


                                       35
<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT A TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


assumed by the Debtors pursuant to section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code shall be
deemed to have been assumed by the Debtors, subject to Section 5.2, and the Plan
shall constitute a motion to assume such executory contracts and unexpired
leases. Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date, entry of the
Confirmation Order by the Bankruptcy Court shall constitute approval of such
assumptions pursuant to section 365(a) of the Bankruptcy Code and a finding by
the Bankruptcy Court that each such assumption is in the best interests of the
Debtors, the Estates and all parties in interest in the Reorganization Cases.
With respect to each such executory contract or unexpired lease assumed by the
Debtors, unless otherwise determined by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to a Final
Order or agreed to by the parties thereto on or before the Effective Date, any
defaults of the Debtors with respect to such assumed executory contracts or
leases existing as of the Effective Date shall be cured in the ordinary course
of the Reorganized Debtors' business promptly after any such default becomes
known to the Debtors and, if disputed, established pursuant to applicable law by
the Bankruptcy Court, and the assumed executory contracts or leases shall be
binding upon and enforceable upon the parties thereto, subject to any rights and
defenses existing thereunder. Subject to the occurrence of the Effective Date,
upon payment of such cure amount all defaults of the Debtors existing as of the
Confirmation Date with respect to such executory contract or unexpired lease
shall be deemed cured.

            (b) Rejection. Notwithstanding subpart (a) of this Section 8.1, the
Debtors may reject those executory contracts and unexpired leases listed on an
exhibit to be provided to the Bankruptcy Court in advance of the Confirmation
Hearing (as such list may be amended or supplemented up to and including the
Confirmation Date).

            (c) Assumption of Joint Venture Agreement. On the Effective Date,
the Joint Venture Agreement shall be deemed to have been assumed by Congoleum,
and the obligations of Reorganized Congoleum to ABI thereunder shall be subject
to the provisions set forth in the Plan.

            (d) Assumption of Intercompany Agreements. On the Effective Date,
the Intercompany Agreements shall be deemed to have been assumed by Congoleum.

      8.2 Damages Upon Rejection. The Bankruptcy Court shall determine the
dollar amount, if any, of the Claim of any Entity seeking damages by reason of
the rejection of any executory contract or unexpired lease; provided, however,
that such Entity must file a Proof of Claim with the Bankruptcy Court on or
before thirty (30) calendar days following the later of the Confirmation Date or
the date of rejection of the executory contract or unexpired lease. To the
extent that any such Claim is Allowed by the Bankruptcy Court by Final Order,
such Claim shall become, and shall be treated for all purposes under the Plan
as, a Class 7 General Unsecured Claim, or if the Claim is an Unsecured Asbestos
Personal Injury Claim, a Class 10 Claim, and the holder thereof shall receive
distributions as a holder of an Allowed Claim in such Class pursuant to the
Plan. The Debtors shall notify those Entities that may assert a Claim for
damages from the rejection of an executory contract or unexpired lease of this
bar date for filing a Proof of Claim in connection therewith.

      8.3 Executory and Other Settlements. Prior to the Effective Date, with the
consent of the Claimants' Representative and the Futures Representative, the
Debtors may seek Bankruptcy Court approval of additional settlements with
holders of Asbestos Claims. The Plan Trust, or the Reorganized Debtors, as may


                                       36

                                           EXHIBIT A TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


be appropriate, shall make payments in accordance with the terms of any
settlement under the terms of this Section 8.3 and a Final Order approving such
settlement and the Plan Trust Agreement and/or the TDP, as applicable, with
respect to the Plan Trust Asbestos Claims.

      8.4 Insurance Agreements. Except to the extent expressly set forth in any
Asbestos Insurance Settlement Agreement, nothing contained in the Plan or any
negotiations leading up to the Plan, including this Section 8.4, shall
constitute a waiver of: (i) any claim, right, or cause of action that any of the
Debtors or the Plan Trust, as applicable, may have against any insurer,
including under any insurance agreement; or (ii) any Asbestos Insurer Coverage
Defenses that any Asbestos Insurance Company may have against the Debtors or the
Plan Trust. The discharge and release provisions contained in the Plan shall
neither diminish nor impair the duties, obligations or, with respect to any
Asbestos Insurance Company, the Asbestos Insurer Coverage Defenses, of any
Asbestos Insurance Company, the Debtors or any other Entity under any Asbestos
Insurance Policy or agreement relating thereto.

      8.5 Compensation and Benefits Programs. Unless otherwise agreed to by the
affected parties or modified by order of the Bankruptcy Court, all of the
Debtors' obligations under employment and severance policies, and all
compensation and benefit plan, policies, and programs shall be treated as though
they are executory contracts that are deemed assumed under the Plan.

      8.6 Retiree Benefits. Notwithstanding any other provisions of the Plan
(other than the last sentence of this Section 8.6), any payments that are due to
any individual for the purpose of providing or reimbursing payments for retired
employees and their spouses and dependents for medical, surgical, or hospital
care benefits, or benefits in the event of sickness, accident, disability, or
death under any plan, fund, or program (through the purchase of insurance or
otherwise) maintained or established in whole or in part by the Debtors prior to
the Petition Date shall be continued for the duration of the period, if any,
that the Debtors have obligated themselves to provide such benefits.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, no employee or retired employee (nor their
spouses or dependents and beneficiaries) of the Debtors or the Reorganized
Debtors shall be entitled to assert any Asbestos Claim against the Debtors or
the Reorganized Debtors.

      8.7 Indemnification of Directors, Officer and Employees. The obligations
of the Debtors to indemnify any Person serving at any time on or prior to the
Effective Date as one of their directors, officer or employees by reason of such
Person's service in such capacity, or as a director, officer or employee of any
other corporation or legal entity, to the extent provided in the Debtors'
constituent documents, or by a written agreement with the Debtors, or pursuant
to applicable general corporation law, each as applicable, shall be deemed and
treated as executory contracts that are assumed by the Reorganized Debtors
pursuant to the Plan and section 365 of the Bankruptcy Code as of the Effective
Date. Accordingly, such indemnification obligations shall be treated as General
Unsecured Claims and shall survive Unimpaired and unaffected by entry of the
Confirmation Order, irrespective of whether such indemnification is owed for an
act or event occurring before or after the Petition Date.

                       ACCEPTANCE OR REJECTION OF THE PLAN

      9.1 Classes Entitled to Vote. The holders of Claims or Interests in each
Impaired Class of Claims or Interests, i.e., Classes 2, 3, 9, 10, 11 and 12 are
entitled to vote to accept or reject the Plan.

      9.2 Acceptance by Impaired Classes of Claims. Pursuant to section 1126(c)
of the Bankruptcy Code, an Impaired Class of Claims shall have accepted the Plan
if (a) the holders of at least two-thirds in dollar amount of the claims
actually voting in such Class (other than Claims held by any holder designated
pursuant to section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code) have voted to accept the
Plan and (b) more than one-half in number of such claims actually voting in such
Class (other than Claims held by any holder designated pursuant to section
1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code) have voted to accept the Plan.

      9.3 Acceptance by Impaired Class of Interests. Pursuant to section 1126(d)
of the Bankruptcy Code, an Impaired Class of Interests shall have accepted the
Plan if the holders of at least two-thirds in amount of the Allowed Interests
actually voting in such Class (other than Interests held by any holder
designated pursuant to section 1126(e) of the Bankruptcy Code) have voted to
accept the Plan.

      9.4 Acceptance Pursuant to Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Plan
shall have been voted upon favorably as required by section
524(g)(2)(B)(ii)(IV)(bb) of the Bankruptcy Code.

      9.5 Presumed Acceptance of Plan. Classes 1, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 13 and 14 are
Unimpaired. Under section 1126(f) of the Bankruptcy Code, the holders of Claims
and Interests in such Classes are conclusively presumed to have voted to accept
the Plan.

                                   ARTICLE X

                  CONDITIONS TO CONFIRMATION AND EFFECTIVENESS

      10.1 Conditions to Confirmation. Confirmation of the Plan shall not occur
unless each of the following conditions has been satisfied or waived in
accordance with Section 10.3 below. These conditions to Confirmation, which are
designed, among other things, to ensure that the Injunctions, releases, and
discharges set forth in Article XI shall be effective, binding and enforceable,
are as follows:

            (a) The Bankruptcy Court shall have made specific findings and
determinations, among others, in substantially the following form:

                  (i) The Discharge Injunction and the Asbestos Channeling
Injunction are to be implemented in connection with the Plan and the Plan Trust;


                                       38

                  (ii) As of the Petition Date, Congoleum has been named as a
defendant in personal injury, wrongful death or property damage actions seeking
recovery for damages allegedly caused by the presence of, or exposure to,
asbestos or asbestos-containing products;

                  (iii) The Plan Trust, upon the Effective Date, shall assume
the liabilities of the Debtors with respect to Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and
Demands;

                  (iv) The Plan Trust is to be funded in part by securities of
Reorganized Congoleum in the form of the Promissory Note that is secured by,
among other things, the Other Collateral, and the Pledged Stock (being
securities of Reorganized Congoleum) pursuant to the Pledge Agreement and
constitutes an obligation of Reorganized Congoleum to make future payments to
the Plan Trust;

                  (v) The Plan Trust, on the Effective Date, will hold as
collateral for the Promissory Note, pursuant to the terms of the Pledge
Agreement, a majority of the voting shares of Congoleum, and if certain
contingencies occur the Plan Trust will be entitled to foreclose its security
interests in the Pledged Stock, and own such Pledged Stock if there are any
defaults under the terms of the Promissory Note pursuant to the terms of the
Pledge Agreement;

                  (vi) The Plan Trust is to use its assets and income to pay
Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and Plan Trust Expenses;

                  (vii) Congoleum is likely to be subject to substantial future
Demands for payment arising out of the same or similar conduct or events that
gave rise to the Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, which are addressed by the Asbestos
Channeling Injunction;

                  (viii) The actual amounts, numbers and timing of future
Demands cannot be determined;

                  (ix) Pursuit of Demands outside the procedures prescribed by
the Plan and the TDP is likely to threaten the Plan's purpose to deal equitably
with Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and future Demands;

                  (x) The Plan establishes separate Classes of Asbestos Personal
Injury Claims that are to be addressed by the Plan Trust and at least
seventy-five percent (75%) of the Asbestos Claimants voting in such Classes have
accepted the Plan;

                  (xi) Pursuant to court orders or otherwise, the Plan Trust
shall operate through mechanisms such as structured, periodic or supplemental
payments, Pro Rata distributions, matrices or periodic review of estimates of
the numbers and values of Asbestos Personal Injury Claims or other comparable
mechanisms, that provide reasonable assurance that the Plan Trust shall value,
and be in a financial position to pay, Asbestos Personal Injury Claims and
Demands therefor in substantially the same manner;

                  (xii) The Futures Representative was appointed by the
Bankruptcy Court as part of the proceedings leading to the issuance of the
Discharge Injunction and the Asbestos Channeling Injunction for the purpose of,
among other things, protecting the rights of persons that might subsequently
assert Demands of the kind that are addressed in the Discharge Injunction and
the Asbestos Channeling Injunction and transferred to the Plan Trust;

                  (xiii) In light of the benefits provided, or to be provided,
to the Plan Trust on behalf of each Protected Party, the Asbestos Channeling
Injunction is fair and equitable with respect to the persons that might
subsequently assert Demands against any Protected Party;

                  (xiv) The Plan otherwise complies with section 524(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code;

                  (xv) Congoleum's contribution to the Plan Trust and ABI's
contribution of the ABI Contribution to the Plan Trust provided for herein,
together with the Asbestos Insurance Assignment, constitute substantial assets
of the Plan Trust and the reorganization;

                  (xvi) The duties, obligations and any Asbestos Insurer
Coverage Defenses of the insurers that issued policies and their successors and
assigns, or, with respect to any insolvent insurers, their liquidators and/or
the state insurance guaranty funds that bear responsibility with respect to such
rights under such policies which constitute the Asbestos Insurance Rights and
Asbestos Property Damage Insurance Rights are not eliminated or diminished by
the transfer pursuant to the Plan of the Debtors' rights in the Asbestos
Insurance Rights and Asbestos Property Damage Insurance Rights pursuant to the
Insurance Assignment Agreement; and

                  (xvii) Amendments to the Collateral Trust Agreement to conform
it to the TDP shall have been executed and delivered by Congoleum and the
Collateral Trustee and consented to by the Claimants' Representative.

            (b) Confirmation Order. The Bankruptcy Court shall have made such
findings and determinations regarding the Plan as shall enable the entry of the
Confirmation Order and any other order entered in conjunction therewith, each of
which shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Debtors, ABI and the
Futures Representative and, insofar as such findings and determinations affect
the Financing Order or the rights of Congress thereunder, Congress.

      10.2 Conditions to Effectiveness. Notwithstanding any other provision of
the Plan or the Confirmation Order, the Effective Date of the Plan shall not
occur unless and until each of the following conditions has been satisfied or
waived in accordance with Section 10.3 below:

            (a) Confirmation Order. The Confirmation Order shall have been
entered by the Bankruptcy Court and affirmed by the District Court or entered by
the District Court and the Confirmation Order and any order of the District
Court shall be in form and substance acceptable to the Debtors, ABI, the
Asbestos Claimants' Committee, and the Futures Representative and the
Confirmation Order (and affirming order of the District Court) shall have become
a Final Order; provided, however, that the Effective Date may occur at a point
in time when the Confirmation Order is not a Final Order at the option of the
Debtors, with the written consent of the Futures Representative, the Asbestos
Claimants' Committee, and ABI, unless the effectiveness of the Confirmation
Order has been stayed, reversed or vacated. The Effective Date may occur, again
at the option of the Debtors, with the written consent of ABI, the Asbestos
Claimants' Committee, and the Futures Representative, on the first Business Day
immediately following the expiration or other termination of any stay of
effectiveness of the Confirmation Order.

            (b) Injunctions. The Discharge Injunction and the Asbestos
Channeling Injunction shall be in full force and effect.

            (c) Amended Credit Agreement. The Amended Credit Agreement and all
documents to be executed in connection with the Amended Credit Agreement, in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Debtors, shall not restrict
Reorganized Congoleum's obligations to make scheduled interest payments under
the Promissory Note except as provided in the Promissory Note and shall have
been executed and delivered and all conditions precedent to effectiveness
thereof shall have been satisfied or waived by the parties thereto.

            (d) Plan Documents. The Plan Documents necessary or appropriate to
implement the Plan (which shall include without limitation, the Promissory Note,
the Plan Trust Documents, the Pledge Agreement and the Insurance Assignment
Agreement) shall have been executed, delivered and, where applicable, filed with
the appropriate governmental authorities; all conditions precedent to the
effectiveness of each of such Plan Documents shall have been satisfied or waived
by the respective parties thereto; and the Plan Documents shall be in full force
and effect.

            (e) Other Assurances. The Debtors shall have obtained either (i) a
private letter ruling from the Internal Revenue Service establishing that the
Plan Trust is a "qualified settlement fund" pursuant to Section 468(B) of the
IRC and the regulations issued pursuant thereto, or (ii) other decisions,
opinions or assurances regarding certain tax consequences of the Plan,
satisfactory to the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors and the Futures
Representative.

            (f) Other Approvals, Documents and Actions. All authorizations,
consents and regulatory approvals required, if any, in connection with the
consummation of the Plan shall have been obtained, and all actions, documents,
and agreements necessary to implement the Plan shall have been effected or
executed.

      10.3 Waiver of Conditions. Each of the conditions set forth in Sections
10.1 and 10.2 above may be waived in whole or in part by the Debtors, with the
written consent of ABI, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee and the Futures
Representative, without any notice to other parties in interest or the
Bankruptcy Court and without a hearing. The failure of the Debtors to exercise
any of the foregoing rights shall not be deemed a waiver of any other rights,
and each such right shall be deemed an ongoing right that may be asserted at any
time.

                                   ARTICLE XI

                       INJUNCTIONS, RELEASES AND DISCHARGE

      11.1 Discharge. Except as specifically provided in the Plan, the Plan

whatsoever and Demands including, without limitation, any Claims, demands and
liabilities that arose before the Confirmation, and all debts of the kind

not (a) a Proof of Claim based on such Claim was filed or deemed filed under
section 501 of the Bankruptcy Code, or such Claim was listed on the Schedules of
the Debtors, (b) such Claim is or was Allowed under section 502 of the
Bankruptcy Code, or (c) the holder of such Claim has voted on or accepted the
Plan. Except as specifically provided in the Plan or Plan Documents, the rights
that are provided in the Plan as of the Effective Date shall be in exchange for
and in complete satisfaction, settlement and discharge of all Claims (including
without limitation Asbestos Claims) or Demands against, Liens on, and interests
in the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors or any of their assets or properties.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in this Section 11.1
shall affect the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company to assert any Asbestos
Insurer Coverage Defenses.

      11.2 Release of Representatives of the Debtors. To the extent permitted by
law applicable to cases under the Bankruptcy Code in the judicial district in
which the Bankruptcy Court is located, except as otherwise specifically provided
in the Plan and the Plan Documents, for good and valuable consideration, the
receipt and sufficiency of which is acknowledged in the Plan, all current and
former Representatives of the Debtors, on and after the Effective Date, are
released from any and all Claims, obligations, rights, suits, damages, causes of
action, remedies and liabilities whatsoever, whether known or unknown, foreseen
or unforeseen, existing or hereafter arising, in law, equity or otherwise, that
any Entity would have been legally entitled to assert in its own right (whether
individually or collectively) or on behalf of the holder of any Claim or
Interest or other Entity, based in whole or in part, upon any act or omission,
transaction, agreement, event, or other occurrence taking place on or before the
Effective Date, for claims or liabilities resulting from their services as
officers or directors of the Debtors or, to the extent such claims or
liabilities relate to the business, operations or management of the Debtors
prior to the Effective Date or to their conduct as professionals or advisors to
any of the Debtors. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 11.2 shall affect the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company to
assert any Asbestos Insurer Coverage Defenses.

      11.3 Exculpation. To the extent permitted by law applicable to cases under

located, as of the Effective Date, each of the Reorganized Debtors, the Debtors,
the Futures Representative, the Claimants' Representative, the Pre-Petition
Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the Collateral
Trustee, the Plan Trustee, ABI and any of their respective Representatives (a)

Document, negotiation of the settlement provided in the Collateral Trust,
negotiation of the settlement provided in the Claimant Agreement, the pursuit of
confirmation of the Plan, the consummation of the Plan, the Collateral Trust
Agreement, the Claimant Agreement, the Security Agreement or the administration
of the Plan or the property to be distributed under the Plan, provided, however,
that this exculpation provision shall not apply to Asbestos Insurer Coverage
Defenses; and (b) in all respects shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of
counsel with respect to their duties and responsibilities under the Plan and the
other Plan Documents.

      11.4 Releases by Holders of Claims. To the extent permitted by law
applicable to cases under the Bankruptcy Code in the judicial district in which
the Bankruptcy Court is located, other than rights to the treatment provided in
Article IV of the Plan or as otherwise provided in the Plan or the Plan

                                           EXHIBIT A TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


Documents herein, on and after the Effective Date, each holder of a Claim who
has accepted the Plan shall be deemed to have unconditionally released the
Released Non-Debtor Parties, Claimants' Representative, the Pre-Petition
Asbestos Claimants' Committee, the Asbestos Claimants' Committee and their
current and former Representatives from any and all Claims, obligations, rights,
suits, damages, causes of action, remedies, and liabilities whatsoever, whether
known or unknown, foreseen or unforeseen, existing or hereafter arising, in law,
equity, or otherwise, that such Entity would have been legally entitled to
assert (whether individually or collectively), based in whole or in part upon
any act or omission, transaction, agreement, event, or other occurrence taking
place on or before the Effective Date by the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors,
the Reorganization Cases, or the negotiation, formulation, and preparation of
the Plan, the Plan Documents or any related agreements, instruments or other
documents.

      11.5 Discharge Injunction. Except as specifically provided in the Plan
Documents to the contrary, the satisfaction, release, and discharge set forth in
Section 11.1 shall also operate as an injunction, pursuant to sections 105,
524(g) and 1141 of the Bankruptcy Code, prohibiting and enjoining the
commencement or continuation of any action, the employment of process or any act
to collect, recover from, or offset (a) any Claim or Demand against or Interest
in the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Collateral Trust, or the Plan Trust
by any Entity and (b) any cause of action, whether known or unknown, against the
Released Parties based on such Claim or Interest described in subpart (a) of
this Section 11.5.

      11.6 Asbestos Channeling Injunction. The sole recourse of the holder of a
Plan Trust Asbestos Claim or Demand on account of such Claim or Demand or of a
Person that had or could have asserted an Asbestos Claim or Demand shall be to
the Plan Trust pursuant to the provisions of the Asbestos Channeling Injunction,
the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP, and such holder shall have no
right whatsoever at any time to assert its Plan Trust Asbestos Claim or Demand
against the Debtors, Reorganized Debtors, any other Protected Party, or any
property or interest in property of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or any
other Protected Party. Without limiting the foregoing, from and after the
Effective Date, the Asbestos Channeling Injunction shall apply to all present
and future holders of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and Demands, and all such
holders shall be permanently and forever stayed, restrained, and enjoined from
taking any of the following actions for the purpose of, directly or indirectly,
collecting, recovering, or receiving payment of, on, or with respect to any Plan
Trust Asbestos Claims and Demands, other than from the Plan Trust in accordance
with the Asbestos Channeling Injunction and pursuant to the Plan, the Plan Trust
Agreement and the TDP:

            (a) commencing, conducting, or continuing in any manner, directly or
indirectly, any suit, action, or other proceeding (including a judicial,
arbitration, administrative, or other proceeding) in any forum against or
affecting any Protected Party or any property or interests in property of any
Protected Party;

            (b) enforcing, levying, attaching (including any prejudgment
attachment), collecting, or otherwise recovering by any means or in any manner,
whether directly or indirectly, any judgment, award, decree, or other order
against any Protected Party or any property or interests in property of any
Protected Party;

<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT A TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


            (c) creating, perfecting, or otherwise enforcing in any manner,
directly or indirectly, any encumbrance against any Protected Party, or any
property or interests in property of any Protected Party;

            (d) setting off, seeking reimbursement of, contribution from, or
subrogation against, or otherwise recouping in any manner, directly or
indirectly, any amount against any liability owed to any Protected Party or any
property or interests in property of any Protected Party; and

            (e) proceeding in any manner in any place with regard to any matter
that is subject to resolution pursuant to the Plan Trust, except in conformity
and compliance with the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP.

      Any right, claim or cause of action that an Asbestos Insurance Company may
have been entitled to assert against a Settling Asbestos Insurance Company based
on or relating to Asbestos Claims shall be channeled to and become a right,
claim or cause of action as an offset claim against the Plan Trust and not
against the Settling Asbestos Insurance Company in question and all persons,
including any Asbestos Insurance Company, shall be enjoined from asserting any
such right, claim or cause of action against a Settling Asbestos Insurance
Company.

      Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, nothing contained in
the Plan shall constitute or be deemed a waiver of any claim, right or cause of
action that the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or the Plan Trust may have
against any Entity in connection with or arising out of or related to an
Asbestos Claim. Notwithstanding any other provision in the Plan to the contrary,
nothing in the Plan shall be understood to channel, prevent, impair or limit in
any way enforcement against the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or any other
Protected Party of any rights provided in connection with any Workers'
Compensation Claim.

      11.7 Reservation of Rights. Notwithstanding any other provision of the
Plan to the contrary, the satisfaction, release and discharge, and the
Injunctions set forth in Article XI, shall not serve to satisfy, discharge,
release, or enjoin (a) claims by the Plan Trust, the Reorganized Debtors, ABI,
and their Affiliates, or any other Entity, as the case may be, against (i) the
Plan Trust for payment of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims in accordance with the
Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP, as applicable, (ii) the Plan Trust
for the payment of Plan Trust Expenses, or (iii) the Reorganized Debtors, the
Plan Trust, or any other Entity, to enforce the provisions of Section 5.2 or any
provision of the Plan or another Plan Document, or (b) the rights of any
Asbestos Insurance Company to assert any claim, debt, obligation, cause of
action or liability for payment against any other Asbestos Insurance Company
that is not a Settling Asbestos Insurance Company.

      11.8 Rights Against Non-Debtors under Securities Laws. Notwithstanding any
language to the contrary contained in the Disclosure Statement, Plan, and/or
Confirmation Order, no provision shall release any non-Debtor, including any
current and/or former officer and/or director of the Debtors and/or any
non-Debtor included in the Released Non-Debtor Parties, from liability to the
United States Securities and Exchange Commission, in connection with any legal
action or claim brought by such governmental unit against such Person(s).

      11.9 Rights Against Debtors Under Environmental Laws. Environmental rights
and Claims of Governmental Units under applicable Environmental Laws shall
survive the Reorganization Cases, shall not be discharged, impaired or adversely
affected by the Plan and the Reorganization Cases and shall be determined in the
manner and by the administrative or judicial tribunals in which such rights or
Claims would have been resolved or adjudicated if the Reorganization Cases had
not been commenced. Governmental Units need not file any Proofs of Claim under
Environmental Laws in the Reorganization Cases in order to preserve Claims under
Environmental Laws. Nothing in the Confirmation Order or Plan shall be construed
as releasing or relieving any Entity of any liability under any Environmental
Law.

      11.10 Disallowed Claims and Disallowed Interests. On and after the
Effective Date, the Debtors shall be fully and finally discharged from any
liability or obligation on a Disallowed Claim or a Disallowed Interest and any
order creating a Disallowed Claim or a Disallowed Interest that is not a Final
Order as of the Effective Date solely because of an Entity's right to move for
reconsideration of such order pursuant to section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code or
Bankruptcy Rule 3008 will nevertheless become and be deemed to be a Final Order
on the Effective Date. The Confirmation Order, except as otherwise provided
herein, or unless the Bankruptcy Court orders otherwise, shall constitute an
order: (a) disallowing all Claims (other than Plan Trust Asbestos Claims) and
Interests to the extent such Claims and Interests are not allowable under any
provision of section 502 of the Bankruptcy Code, including, but not limited to,
time-barred Claims, and Claims for unmatured interest, and (b) disallowing or
subordinating, as the case may be, any Claims, or portions of Claims, for
penalties or Non-Compensatory Damages.

      11.11 Reservation of Asbestos Insurance Company Rights. While the
obligations, if any, of the Plan Trust to pay holders of Plan Trust Asbestos
Claims and Demands shall be determined pursuant to the Plan and the Plan
Documents, neither the Bankruptcy Court's approval of the Plan and the Plan
Documents nor the Confirmation Order shall constitute a trial or hearing on the
merits, or an adjudication or judgment, or be used as evidence to prove:

            (a) that any of the Debtors, the Plan Trust or any Asbestos
Insurance Company is liable for, or otherwise obligated to pay with respect to,
any individual Plan Trust Asbestos Claim or Demand;

            (b) that the procedures established by the Plan, including the TDP,
for evaluating and paying Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and Demands are reasonable
and/or consistent with the procedures that were used to evaluate or settle
Asbestos Personal Injury Claims against the Debtors before the Petition Date;

            (c) that the settlement of, or the value assigned to, any individual
Asbestos Personal Injury Claim pursuant to the TDP was reasonable and/or
otherwise appropriate; or

            (d) that any of the Asbestos Insurance Companies participated in
and/or consented to the negotiation of the Plan or any of the Plan Documents.

      Nothing in the Plan, the Plan Documents, the Confirmation Order, any
finding of fact and/or conclusion of law with respect to Confirmation of the
Plan or any order or opinion entered on appeal from the Confirmation Order shall


                                       45

limit the right of any Asbestos Insurance Company, in any Asbestos Insurance
Action, to assert any Asbestos Insurer Coverage Defense, including by presenting
evidence and/or argument with respect to any of the matters specified in clauses
(a) though (d) of this Section; nor shall any of the matters specified in
clauses (a) through (d) of this Section have any res judicata or collateral
estoppel effect against any Asbestos Insurance Company.

      Notwithstanding anything in this Section 11.11 to the contrary, nothing in
this Section 11.11 shall affect or limit, or be construed as affecting or
limiting, (i) the binding effect of the Plan and the Confirmation Order on the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Plan Trust or the beneficiaries of the
Plan Trust; or (ii) the protection afforded to any Settling Asbestos Insurance
Company by the Asbestos Channeling Injunction. Further, nothing in this Section
11.11 is intended or shall be construed to preclude otherwise applicable
principles of res judicata or collateral estoppel from being applied against any
Asbestos Insurance Company with respect to any issue that is actually litigated
by such Asbestos Insurance Company as part of its objections to confirmation of
the Plan.

                                  ARTICLE XII

                      MATTERS INCIDENT TO PLAN CONFIRMATION

      12.1 Term of Certain Injunctions and Automatic Stay.

            (a) All of the injunctions and/or automatic stays provided for in or
in connection with the Reorganization Cases, whether pursuant to section 105,
362, 524(g), or any other provision of the Bankruptcy Code or other applicable
law, in existence immediately prior to Confirmation shall remain in full force
and effect until the Injunctions become effective, and thereafter if so provided
by the Plan, the Confirmation Order, or by their own terms. In addition, on and
after Confirmation, the Debtors may seek such further orders as they may deem
necessary to preserve the status quo during the time between Confirmation and
the Effective Date.

            (b) Each of the Injunctions shall become effective on the Effective
Date and shall continue in effect at all times thereafter. Notwithstanding
anything to the contrary contained in the Plan, all actions in the nature of
those to be enjoined by the Injunctions shall be enjoined during the period
between the Confirmation Date and the Effective Date.

      12.2 No Successor Liability. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the
Plan, the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, ABI, their Affiliates, Asbestos
Claimants' Committee, the Pre-Petition Asbestos Claimants' Committee and the
Futures Representative do not, pursuant to the Plan or otherwise, assume, agree
to perform, pay, or indemnify creditors or otherwise have any responsibilities
for any liabilities or obligations of the Debtors relating to or arising out of
the operations of or assets of the Debtors, whether arising prior to, on, or
after the Confirmation Date. Neither the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, ABI,
their Affiliates, nor the Plan Trust is, or shall be, a successor to the Debtors
by reason of any theory of law or equity, and none shall have any successor or
transferee liability of any kind or character, except that the Reorganized
Debtors and the Plan Trust shall assume the obligations specified in the Plan
Documents and the Confirmation Order.

      12.3 Revesting. Except as otherwise expressly provided in the Plan, on the
Effective Date, each Reorganized Debtor shall be vested with all of the assets
and property of its former Estate, free and clear of all Claims, Liens, charges
and other interests of holders of Claims or Interests, and may operate its
business free of any restrictions imposed by the Bankruptcy Code or by the
Bankruptcy Court.

      12.4 Vesting and Enforcement of Causes of Action. Pursuant to section
1123(b)(3)(B) of the Bankruptcy Code, except as otherwise provided in the Plan,
the Reorganized Debtors shall be vested with and have the right to enforce
against any Entity any and all of the Debtors' Causes of Action other than
Causes of Action related to Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and Plan Trust Assets
(including the right to pursue such claims, if any, in the name of any Debtor if
necessary), with the proceeds of the recovery of any such actions to be property
of the Reorganized Debtors; provided, however, that nothing herein shall alter,
amend, or modify the injunctions (including the Injunctions), releases, or
discharges provided herein. Pursuant to section 1123(b)(3)(B) of the Bankruptcy
Code, except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the Plan Trust shall be vested
with and have the right to enforce against any Entity any and all of the
Debtors' Causes of Action relating to any Plan Trust Asbestos Claims or any Plan
Trust Assets (including the right to pursue such claims, if any, in the name of
any Debtor if necessary) and for this purpose the Plan Trust shall be designated
as a representative of the Estates, with the proceeds of the recovery of any
such actions to be property of the Plan Trust; provided, however, that nothing
herein shall alter, amend, or modify the injunctions (including the
Injunctions), releases, or discharges provided herein.

      12.5 Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of Action. On the Effective Date, the
Debtors shall assign to the Plan Trust all Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of
Action; provided, however, that any Plan Trust Bankruptcy Cause of Action
arising from any transfer of assets or property to the Collateral Trust prior to
the Petition Date or from any subsequent distribution by the Collateral Trust of
such assets or property shall not be assigned to the Plan Trust and shall be
unconditionally released by the Debtors and their Estates in accordance with
Sections 11.3 and 11.4 of the Plan. All such Plan Trust Bankruptcy Causes of
Action shall constitute part of the Plan Trust Assets, and shall be transferred
to and vested in the Plan Trust as of the Effective Date, free and clear of all
Claims, Liens and encumbrances of every nature. The Plan Trust shall be deemed
the appointed representative of the Debtors' estates to, and may, enforce,
pursue, litigate, abandon, compromise and settle any such Plan Trust Bankruptcy
Cause of Action, as it deems appropriate.

      12.6 Bankruptcy Causes of Action. On the Effective Date, all Bankruptcy
Causes of Action shall be preserved for enforcement solely by the Debtors.

                                  ARTICLE XIII

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      13.1 Jurisdiction. Until the Reorganization Cases are closed, the
Bankruptcy Court shall retain the fullest and most extensive jurisdiction
permissible, including that necessary to ensure that the purposes and intent of
the Plan are carried out. Except as otherwise provided in the Plan, the
Bankruptcy Court shall retain jurisdiction to hear and determine all Claims
against and Interests in the Debtors, and to adjudicate and enforce all other


                                       47
<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT A TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


causes of action which may exist on behalf of the Debtors. Nothing contained
herein shall prevent the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or the Plan Trust
from taking such action as may be necessary in the enforcement of any cause of
action which the Debtors have or may have and which may not have been enforced
or prosecuted by the Debtors, which cause of action shall survive Confirmation
of the Plan and shall not be affected thereby except as specifically provided
herein. Nothing contained herein concerning the retention of jurisdiction by the
Bankruptcy Court shall be deemed to be a retention of exclusive jurisdiction
with respect to any Asbestos Insurance Action; rather any court other than the
Bankruptcy Court which has jurisdiction over an Asbestos Insurance Action shall
have the continuing right to exercise such jurisdiction.

      13.2 General Retention. Following the Confirmation of the Plan, the
administration of the Reorganization Cases will continue at least until the
completion of the transfers contemplated to be accomplished on the Effective
Date. Moreover, the Plan Trust shall be subject to the continuing jurisdiction
of the Bankruptcy Court to the extent required by the requirements of section
468B of the IRC and the regulations issued pursuant thereto. The Bankruptcy
Court shall also retain jurisdiction for the purpose of classification of any
Claim and the re-examination of Claims that have been Allowed for purposes of
voting, and the determination of such objections as may be filed with the
Bankruptcy Court with respect to any Claim. The failure by the Debtors to object
to, or examine, any Claim for the purposes of voting, shall not be deemed a
waiver of the right of the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, or the Plan Trust,
as the case may be, to object to or re-examine such Claim in whole or in part.

      13.3 Specific Purposes. In addition to the foregoing, the Bankruptcy Court
shall retain jurisdiction for the following specific purposes after
Confirmation:

            (a) to modify the Plan after Confirmation, pursuant to the
provisions of the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules;

            (b) to correct any defect, cure any omission, reconcile any
inconsistency, or make any other necessary changes or modifications in or to the
Plan, the Plan Documents or the Confirmation Order as may be necessary to carry
out the purposes and intent of the Plan, including the adjustment of the date(s)
of performance under the Plan Documents in the event that the Effective Date
does not occur as provided herein so that the intended effect of the Plan may be
substantially realized thereby;

            (c) to assure the performance by the Disbursing Agent and the Plan
Trustee of their respective obligations to make distributions under the Plan;

            (d) to enforce and interpret the terms and conditions of the Plan
Documents;

            (e) to enter such orders or judgments, including, but not limited
to, injunctions as are necessary to (i) enforce the title, rights, and powers of
the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Plan Trust, ABI, the Futures
Representative and the Trust Advisory Committee or (ii) enable holders of Claims
to pursue their rights against any Entity that may be liable therefor pursuant
to applicable law or otherwise, including, but not limited to, Bankruptcy Court
orders;

Plan Trust relating to tax periods or portions thereof ending on or before the
Effective Date, arising on account of transactions contemplated by the Plan
Documents, or relating to the period of administration of the Reorganization
Cases;

            (g) to hear and determine all applications for compensation of
professionals and reimbursement of expenses under sections 330, 331, or 503(b)

Plan Trustee, the Collateral Trustee or the Futures Representative and each of
their respective Representatives;

Confirmation for the rejection, assumption, or assignment of executory contracts

Claim against or Interest in the Debtors or their Estates;

            (m) to hear and determine all questions and disputes regarding title
to the assets of the Debtors, their Estates, the Reorganized Debtors or the Plan
Trust;

            (n) to hear and determine any other matters related hereto,
including the implementation and enforcement of all orders entered by the
Bankruptcy Court in these Reorganization Cases;

      13.4 Payment of Statutory Fees. All fees payable pursuant to section 1930
of title 28 of the United States Code, as determined by the Bankruptcy Court at
the Confirmation Hearing, shall be paid by the Debtors on or before the
Effective Date and thereafter by the Reorganized Debtors as due until the
Reorganization Cases are closed, converted or dismissed.

      13.5 The Asbestos Claimants' Committee and the Futures Representative. The
Asbestos Claimants' Committee shall continue in existence until the Effective
Date, with the Debtors to pay the reasonable fees and expenses of the Asbestos
Claimants' Committee and the Futures Representative through that date as well,
in accordance with any fee and expense procedures promulgated during the
Reorganization Cases. After the Effective Date, the Futures Representative shall
(a) continue in existence and the rights, duties and responsibilities of the
Futures Representative shall be as set forth in the Plan Trust Documents and (b)
have the right to prosecute and/or object to applications for Professional Fee
Claims. The Representatives retained by the Futures Representative during the
Reorganization Cases shall, as of the Effective Date, be released and discharged
of and from all further authority, duties, responsibilities and obligations
related to, or arising from, the Reorganization Cases. On the Effective Date,
any committee that may have been appointed in the Reorganization Cases other
than the TAC shall be dissolved except for the purposes of: (a) prosecuting any
appeal or request for reconsideration or stay pending appeal of the Confirmation
Order; (b) pending adversary proceedings; and (c) prosecuting applications for
compensation for the professionals retained by such committee, and the members,
attorneys, accountants, and other professionals thereof shall be released and
discharged of and from all further authority, duties, responsibilities,
liabilities, and obligations related to, or arising from, the Reorganization
Cases. On the Effective Date, the Trust Advisory Committee will assume those
powers, duties, and responsibilities as provided in the Plan Trust Agreement.

      13.6 Revocation of Plan. The Debtors reserve the right to revoke and
withdraw the Plan before the entry of the Confirmation Order. If the Debtors
revoke or withdraw the Plan, or if Confirmation does not occur, then, with
respect to all parties in interest, the Plan shall be deemed null and void and
nothing contained herein shall be deemed to constitute a waiver or release of
any Claims by or against the Debtors or any other Entity or to prejudice in any
manner the rights of the Debtors or such Entity in any further proceedings
involving the Debtors.

      13.7 Modification of Plan. The Debtors, with the written consent of ABI
and the Futures Representative, may propose amendments to or modifications of
any of the Plan Documents under section 1127 of the Bankruptcy Code at any time
prior to the Confirmation Date. After Confirmation, the Debtors, with the
written consent of the Futures Representative, the Plan Trustee and ABI, may
remedy any defects or omissions or reconcile any inconsistencies in the Plan or
the Confirmation Order or any other order entered for the purpose of
implementing the Plan in such manner as may be necessary to carry out the
purposes and intent of the Plan. Anything in the Plan or in any Plan Document to
the contrary notwithstanding, following Confirmation but prior to the Effective
Date, the Plan Documents shall not be modified, supplemented, changed or amended
in any material respect except with the written consent of ABI (to the extent
that any such modification, supplementation, change, or amendment impairs or
affects the rights of ABI, or the Affiliates under the Plan), the Futures
Representative and the Debtors. Unless otherwise provided in the Confirmation
Order or other order of a court of competent jurisdiction in the event of a
conflict between the terms or provisions of the Plan and the Plan Trust
Documents, the terms of the Plan shall control.

      13.8 Modification of Payment Terms. The Reorganized Debtors reserve the
right to modify the treatment of any Allowed Claim (other than a Plan Trust
Asbestos Claim), as provided in section 1123(a)(4) of the Bankruptcy Code, at
any time after the Effective Date upon the consent of the holder of such Allowed
Claim, and solely with respect to any Allowed ABI Claim, with the additional
consent of the Futures Representative and the Plan Trustee.

      13.9 Entire Agreement. The Plan Documents and the Plan Trust Documents set
forth the entire agreement and undertakings relating to the subject matter
thereof and supersede all prior discussions and documents. No Entity shall be
bound by any terms, conditions, definitions, warranties, understandings, or
representations with respect to the subject matter hereof, other than as
expressly provided for herein or as may hereafter be agreed to by the parties in
writing.

      13.10 Headings. Headings are utilized in the Plan for convenience and
reference only and shall not constitute a part of the Plan for any other
purpose.

      13.11 Professional Fee Claims. All final requests for payment of
Professional Fee Claims must be filed and served on the Reorganized Debtors and
their counsel no later than 60 days after the Effective Date, unless otherwise
ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. Objections to any application of such
Bankruptcy Professionals or other Entities for compensation or reimbursement of
expenses must be filed and served on the respective applicant and its counsel no
later than the first Business Day following 30 days (or such other period as may
be allowed by order of the Bankruptcy Court) after the date on which the
applicable application for compensation or reimbursement was received. The
Reorganized Debtors may pay charges that they incur on and after the Effective
Date for Bankruptcy Professionals' fees, disbursements, expenses or related
support services without application to the Bankruptcy Court.

      13.12 Claimants' Representative Fee Claims. To the extent that the actual
costs incurred in connection with Confirmation of the Plan by the Claimants'
Representative exceed two million dollars ($2,000,000) in the aggregate, the
Debtors or, after the Effective Date, the Reorganized Debtors shall provide
funding to cover such actual costs, subject to disclosure of the costs incurred
and approval by the Bankruptcy Court. Any request for payment of such actual
costs incurred by Claimants' Representative must be filed and served on the
Reorganized Debtors and their counsel no later than 60 days after the Effective
Date, unless otherwise ordered by the Bankruptcy Court. Objections to any
application of the Claimants' Representative for compensation or reimbursement
of expenses must be filed and served on the Claimants' Representative and its
counsel, if any, no later than the first Business Day following 30 days (or such
other period as may be allowed by order of the Bankruptcy Court) after the date
on which the applicable application for compensation or reimbursement was
received.

      13.13 Recordable Order. Upon Confirmation of the Plan, the Confirmation
Order shall be deemed to be in recordable form, and shall be accepted by any
recording officer for filing and recording purposes without further or
additional orders, certifications, or other supporting documents.

      13.14 Governing Law. Except to the extent that federal law (including, but
not limited to, the Bankruptcy Code and the Bankruptcy Rules) is applicable or
where the Plan provides otherwise, the rights and obligations arising under the
Plan shall be governed by, and construed and enforced in accordance with, the
laws of the State of Delaware, without giving effect to the principles of
conflicts of law thereof that would require application of any other law.

      13.15 No Admission. Nothing contained in the Plan or in the Disclosure
Statement shall be deemed as an admission by the Debtors, with respect to any
matter set forth herein or therein, including, without limitation, liability on
any Claim or the propriety of any Claims classification.

      13.16 Consent to Jurisdiction. Upon default under the Plan or any Plan
Documents, the Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the Affiliates, ABI, the Plan
Trust, the Trust Advisory Committee, the Futures Representative, and the Plan
Trustee consent to the jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy Court, or any successor
thereto, and agree that it shall be the preferred forum for all proceedings
relating to such default.

      13.17 Setoffs. Subject to the limitations provided in section 553 of the
Bankruptcy Code, the Debtors or the Plan Trust, as applicable, may, but shall
not be required to, setoff against any Claim and the-payments or other
distributions to be made pursuant to the Plan in respect of such Claim, claims
of any nature whatsoever the Debtors may have against the holder of such Claim,
but neither the failure to do so nor the allowance of any Claim hereunder shall
constitute a waiver or release by the Debtors of any such claim that the Debtors
may have against such holder; provided that Reorganized Congoleum may not offset
any obligations under the Promissory Note against any claim that Reorganized
Congoleum may have against the Plan Trust.

      13.18 Successors and Assigns. The rights, duties, and obligations of any
Entity named or referred to in the Plan shall be binding upon, and shall inure
to the benefit of, the successors and assigns of such Entity.

      13.19 Non-Debtor Waiver of Rights. Non-Debtor parties shall have the right
to voluntarily waive any rights, benefits or protections that are afforded to
them under the provisions of the Plan or any order issued in furtherance of the
Plan, and such waiver shall supersede such rights, benefits or protections. Any
such waiver shall only be effective if such party expressly and specifically
waives in writing one or more of such rights, benefits or protections.

      13.20 Further Authorizations. The Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors, the
Plan Trust, ABI and the Futures Representative, if and to the extent necessary,
may seek with notice to the others such orders, judgments, injunctions, and
rulings that any of them deem necessary to further carry out the intentions and
purposes of, and give full effect to the provisions of, the Plan.

      13.21 No Change of Control. The pledge of the Pledged Stock shall not be
deemed to result in a "change in control" of any Debtor for purposes of any
contracts and agreements as to which any Debtor is a party.

      13.22 Duty to Cooperate. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary,
nothing in the Plan shall relieve (by way of injunction or otherwise) any of the
Debtors or Reorganized Debtors or any other Entity which is or claims to be an
insured under an Asbestos Insurance Policy from any duty to cooperate that may
be required by any such insurance policy under applicable law with respect to
the defense of any Asbestos Personal Injury Claims asserted against any of the
Debtors or Reorganized Debtors.

                           COLLATERAL TRUST AGREEMENT

      This irrevocable trust agreement (the "Collateral Trust Agreement") is
entered into by and between Congoleum Corporation, a Delaware Corporation
("Congoleum"), Arthur J. Pergament, solely in his capacity as the Collateral
Trustee hereunder (the "Collateral Trustee"), and Wilmington Trust Company, a
Delaware banking corporation, solely in its capacity as Delaware Trustee
hereunder ("Delaware Trustee") (the Collateral Trustee and Delaware Trustee are
sometimes referred to herein as "Trustee" or collectively as the "Trustees")
(Congoleum and the Trustees collectively, the "Parties").

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, numerous individuals have asserted asbestos-related bodily injury
claims against Congoleum (each an "Asbestos Claimant" and collectively, the
"Asbestos Claimants"), each alleging exposure to an asbestos-containing product
manufactured, sold, or distributed by Congoleum or for which Congoleum otherwise
may have legal liability (the "Asbestos Claims"), and it is anticipated that
additional asbestos-related bodily injury claims will continue to be asserted
against Congoleum (collectively, the "Asbestos Actions"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum and certain Asbestos Claimants, contemporaneously
herewith, are executing a settlement agreement, titled Settlement Agreement
Between Congoleum Corporation and Various Asbestos Claimants (the "Claimant
Agreement"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum entered into settlement agreements prior to the
Claimant Agreement to resolve certain Asbestos Claims, under which some or all
of the consideration has yet to be paid (the "Pre-Existing Settlement
Agreements"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum may enter into additional settlement agreements to
resolve certain Asbestos Claims that are scheduled for trial prior to the
commencement of an anticipated chapter 11 reorganization case for Congoleum in
an aggregate amount not to exceed $15,000,000.00 (the "Trial-Listed Settlement
Agreements"); and

                                                           EXHIBIT B TO THE PLAN


      WHEREAS, Congoleum, contemporaneously herewith, is executing an agreement
titled Security Agreement ("Security Agreement"), granting to the Collateral
Trust (as defined below) a present and continuing security interest in certain
insurance proceeds; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum, to the extent permissible under applicable law,
intends that the Collateral Trust be characterized as a Qualified Settlement
Fund pursuant to Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder ("QSF"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum has asked the Trustees to act as the Collateral Trustee
and the Delaware Trustee, as applicable, and the Trustees have agreed to accept
this appointment under the terms hereof; and

      WHEREAS, the Parties desire to enter into this Collateral Trust Agreement
to confirm their agreements with respect to (i) the establishment, maintenance,
investment and disbursement of the Trust Assets (as defined below); and (ii)
certain other matters relating to the foregoing, as hereafter provided.

      NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties hereby agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

I.    ESTABLISHMENT OF THE COLLATERAL TRUST

      A. Creation and Name. The Parties hereby create a trust known as the
"Congoleum Collateral Trust," which is the "Collateral Trust" provided for and
referred to in the Claimant Agreement. The Collateral Trustee may transact the
business and affairs of the Collateral Trust in the name "Congoleum Collateral
Trust."

                                                           EXHIBIT B TO THE PLAN


      B. Purpose. The purpose of the Collateral Trust is: (i) to hold security
interests in the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement); (ii) to
receive Insurance Proceeds (as defined in the Security Agreement); and (3) to
pay amounts owed by Congoleum to various parties to Pre-Existing Settlement
Agreements, Trial-Listed Settlement Agreements, and Claimant Agreement, and
otherwise to meet the purposes and requirements stated in those agreements.

II.   PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND COLLATERAL TRUST ADMINISTRATION

      A. Qualified Claims. Subject to the terms and conditions herein and in the
Claimant Agreement, the following persons and entities shall be entitled to
receive payment from the Collateral Trust in the following amounts:

            1. An Asbestos Claimant as to which Congoleum notifies the
      Collateral Trustee in writing that such Asbestos Claimant who entered into
      a Pre-Existing Settlement Agreement or a Trial-Listed Settlement Agreement
      with Congoleum has satisfied the requirements to qualify for payment under
      the terms of the applicable Pre-Existing Settlement Agreement or
      Trial-Listed Settlement Agreement (an Asbestos Claimant who has qualified
      under either a Pre-Existing Settlement Agreement or a Trial-Listed
      Settlement Agreement shall be referred to herein as a "Qualified First
      Priority Claimant"). Such Qualified First Priority Claimant shall be paid
      the applicable amount specified in the notice of satisfaction of the
      requirements for payment provided by Congoleum to the Trustee (the "First
      Priority Settlement Amount"). First Priority Settlement Amounts shall be
      paid in the order in which such Asbestos Claimants become Qualified First
      Priority Claimants. Each Qualified First Priority Claimant's First
      Priority Settlement Amount shall be fully secured, and shall be reduced by
      the amount of all payments received by the Qualified First Priority
      Claimant from Congoleum, the Collateral Trust, or any successor trust.

                                                           EXHIBIT B TO THE PLAN


            2. An Asbestos Claimant as to which the Claims Reviewer (as defined
      below) notifies the Trustee in writing that an Asbestos Claimant has
      satisfied the requirements to qualify as a Participating Asbestos Claimant
      (as defined in the Claimant Agreement). Such Participating Asbestos
      Claimant shall have a secured claim (the "Asbestos Claimant's Secured
      Claim") equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the Participating Asbestos
      Claimant's Settlement Amount (as defined in the Claimant Agreement). Each
      Asbestos Claimant's Secured Claim shall be reduced by the amount of all
      payments received by the Participating Asbestos Claimant from the
      Collateral Trust or any successor trust.

            3. A claims-handling entity ("Claims Reviewer") as designated by
      Congoleum with the consent of Claimants' Counsel (as defined in the
      Claimant Agreement) shall be paid its fees and costs as agreed (the
      "Claims Handling Fee"). Congoleum shall be reimbursed by the Collateral
      Trust for all or part of the Claims Handling Fee paid by Congoleum.

      B. Payment of Qualified Claims. The Collateral Trustee shall make payments
from the Trust Assets (as defined below) from time to time to the extent that
the Collateral Trustee believes it is prudent in light of the funds available

            3. Following the payment in full of the Claims Handling Fee, the
      Collateral Trustee shall pay subsequent distributions up to $200 million
      in total distributions to Participating Asbestos Claimants on a pro-rata

      subsequent distributions as follows:

                  a.    Fifty percent (50%) to Participating Asbestos Claimants
                        on a pro-rata basis in accordance with Section II.C in
                        an amount not to exceed each Participating Asbestos
                        Claimants' Secured Claim; and

                  b.    The remainder to a reserve account, which the Collateral
                        Trustee shall maintain and hold until it is distributed
                        pursuant to Section II.B.5 (the "Reserve").

            5. Upon or as soon as practicable after the establishment by
      Congoleum of a trust qualified as a QSF pursuant to a confirmed plan of

      hereunder and provides for the transfer of the Trust Assets, including the
      Reserve to a plan trust (the "Plan Trust"), the Collateral Trustee shall
      release the security interests granted by the Security Agreement and pay
      any remaining Trust Assets to the Plan Trust in accordance with the plan
      of reorganization. If no Plan Trust is established on or before the later

      successor in connection with the pursuit by Congoleum or any Congoleum
      successor of Congoleum's insurance coverage.

      C. Pro-Rata Distributions to Participating Asbestos Claimants. All
distributions from the Collateral Trust to Participating Asbestos Claimants
shall be allocated to individual Participating Asbestos Claimants by multiplying
the aggregate amount of the distribution to be made by a fraction, the numerator
of which is the unpaid amount of the Participating Asbestos Claimant's Secured
Claim and the denominator of which is the total of all remaining unpaid
Participating Asbestos Claimants' Secured Claims.

      D. Trust Assets.

            1. In furtherance of the purposes of the Collateral Trust, the
      Collateral Trustee, on behalf of the Collateral Trust, shall receive and
      accept from Congoleum, or directly from Congoleum's liability insurers,
      Insurance Proceeds and other assets, if any, as designated in the Claimant
      Agreement (the "Trust Assets"). To the extent that the Collateral Trustee
      receives payments or other assets that are not properly Trust Assets, the
      Collateral Trustee shall promptly thereafter notify Congoleum and shall
      remit such payments or forward such assets to or as directed by Congoleum
      no later than five (5) business days after the receipt of such payments or
      assets. Interest and other investment income accrued on the Trust Assets
      shall become part of the Trust Assets.

      shall, from time to time, invest and reinvest the Trust Assets in
      accordance with the investment guidelines attached hereto as Appendix A
      (the "Investment Guidelines"). The Collateral Trustee shall have the right
      to liquidate any investment held, in order to provide funds necessary to
      make distributions of the Trust Assets pursuant to this Collateral Trust
      Agreement. Absent gross negligence or willful misappropriation, the
      Collateral Trustee shall not have any liability for any loss sustained as
      a result of any investment made pursuant to this Collateral Trust
      Agreement or as a result of any liquidation of any investment prior to its
      maturity. The Collateral Trustee shall have the power to exercise all
      rights with respect to the Collateral Trust's investments consistent with
      the Collateral Trustee's fiduciary duties to the Collateral Trust and in
      accordance with the Investment Guidelines.

      E. Grant of Security Interest.

      Collateral Trust shall have security interests in the Collateral (as

      Agreement, and applicable law.

            2. Within ten (10) days following Congoleum's grant of the security
      interest, the Collateral Trustee shall take any and all actions that are
      necessary to establish and protect the security interest in the
      Collateral, including the filing of one or more UCC-1 financing
      statements. Congoleum agrees to execute and deliver promptly such
      financing statements and other documents, and do such other things, as the
      Collateral Trustee shall reasonably request, to effectuate the Collateral
      Trustee's actions hereunder, within three (3) business days of the
      Execution Date.

      F. Administrative Expenses.

            1. The Collateral Trustee shall have the power to appoint such
      officers and hire such employees and engage such legal, financial,
      accounting, investment, auditing, forecasting and other professionals,
      service providers or consultants as the business of the Collateral Trust
      reasonably requires, and to delegate to such persons such powers and
      authorities as the fiduciary duties of the Collateral Trustee permits and
      as the Collateral Trustee deems necessary in order to carry out the terms
      of this Collateral Trust Agreement. The Collateral Trustee shall serve
      copies of statements and invoices for fees and expenses of the Collateral
      Trustee, prior to the payment of any such statements or invoices, upon the
      parties listed (the "Notice Parties"), and in the manner set out, in
      Section IV.F. Such statements or invoices may be paid by the Collateral
      Trustee unless, within ten (10) days after such service, any of the Notice
      Parties serves upon the Collateral Trustee and the other Notice Parties
      its objection to payment of all or part of such statement or invoice. The
      portion(s) of any statement or invoice with respect to which an objection
      is served may not be paid until the objection thereto is settled or is
      resolved in accordance with Section IV.L of this Collateral Trust
      Agreement.

      all Collateral Trust employees, payment of the reasonable fees of all

      Collateral Trustee shall, from time to time, set aside from the Trust
      Assets amounts sufficient to pay the estimated Administrative Expenses
      ("Administrative Funds") and shall not use Administrative Funds for any
      other purpose, except as otherwise required by this Collateral Trust

                  FIRST AMENDMENT TO COLLATERAL TRUST AGREEMENT

      This first amendment to the Collateral Trust Agreement ("Amendment to the
Collateral Trust Agreement") is entered into by and among Congoleum Corporation,
a Delaware Corporation ("Congoleum"), Arthur J. Pergament, solely in his
capacity as the Collateral Trustee hereunder (the "Collateral Trustee") and
Wilmington Trust Company, a Delaware banking corporation, solely in its capacity
as Delaware Trustee (the "Delaware Trustee") (Congoleum, the Collateral Trustee,
and the Delaware Trustee, collectively, the "Parties"), with the consent of
Claimants' Counsel, as designated in the Settlement Agreement Between Congoleum
Corporation And Various Asbestos Claimants.

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS Congoleum, the Collateral Trustee and the Delaware Trustee entered
into the Collateral Trust Agreement pursuant to which a statutory trust under
the Delaware Statutory Trust Act was created on April 17, 2003; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum and various Asbestos Claimants executed a settlement
agreement dated April 10, 2003, titled Settlement Agreement Between Congoleum
Corporation and Various Asbestos Claimants (the "Claimant Agreement"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum and various Asbestos Claimants contemporaneously
herewith are executing that certain first amendment to the Claimant Agreement
(the "Amendment to the Claimant Agreement"); and

      WHEREAS, on or about April 11, 2003 and April 17, 2003, respectively,
Congoleum executed agreements titled "Security Agreement" and "Second Security
Agreement" (collectively, the "Security Agreements") granting to the Collateral
Trust a present and continuing security interest in certain insurance proceeds;
and

                                                           EXHIBIT B TO THE PLAN


      WHEREAS, Congoleum and the Collateral Trustee contemporaneously herewith
have terminated the Security Agreements by the means of the Termination
Agreement and entered into a subsequent security agreement ("Superceding
Security Agreement"); and

      WHEREAS, the Parties desire to enter into this Amendment to the Collateral
Trust Agreement to confirm their agreement with respect to (i) the termination
of the Security Agreements; (ii) the execution of the Superceding Security
Agreement, (iii) certain technical corrections to the Collateral Trust
Agreement; and (iv) certain other matters relating to the foregoing, as
hereafter provided; and

      WHEREAS, Section IV.D. of the Collateral Trust Agreement authorizes the
Trustee, with the unanimous consent of Congoleum and Claimants' Counsel to
modify and amend the Collateral Trust Agreement.

      NOW, THEREFORE, the Parties hereby agree that the Collateral Trust
Agreement shall be amended as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

1. The paragraph below shall be added to the Claimant Agreement as Section I.C:

      C. Nontransferability of Beneficial Interests. The beneficial interests in
      the Collateral Trust are not transferable or assignable, except as may be
      provided under operation of law or after the death of an Asbestos Claimant
      pursuant to a will or the law applicable to decedent's estates. The
      beneficial interests in the Collateral Trust shall not be evidenced by a
      separate certificate. Nothing in this paragraph I.C shall in any way
      restrict the ability of the Collateral Trust to transfer the Trust Assets
      to any trust established pursuant to a plan of reorganization for
      Congoleum under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.


                                       2

                                                           EXHIBIT B TO THE PLAN


2. Sections II.E.1 and 2 of the Collateral Trust Agreement shall be replaced in
their entirety with:

      E. Enforcement of Security Interest.

      The Collateral Trustee shall have the power and authority to enforce the
      Collateral Trust's interest in the Collateral in accordance with the
      Superceding Security Agreement and applicable law.

3. Sections IV.C and IV.D of the Collateral Trust Agreement shall be replaced in
their entirety with:

      C. Termination. The Collateral Trust shall terminate upon the earliest of:
      (i) the payment in full of all of the Participating Asbestos Claimant's
      Secured Claims and the distribution of all Trust Assets pursuant to the
      terms of this Collateral Trust Agreement; (ii) the distribution of all
      Trust Assets pursuant to the terms of this Collateral Trust Agreement and
      the Collateral Trustee's determination that no further steps to recover
      any assets subject to the Security Interest are commercially reasonable;
      (iii) the transfer of the Trust Assets to the Plan Trust pursuant to the
      terms of this Collateral Trust Agreement; (iv) the payment of the Trust
      Assets to Congoleum pursuant to the terms of Section II.B.5; or (v) the
      expiration of any Perpetuities Period applicable to the Collateral Trust,
      provided that, to the extent permitted by applicable law, Congoleum
      directs that the Rule Against Perpetuities shall not apply to the
      Collateral Trust and that the Collateral Trust shall not be limited by a
      Perpetuities Period. "Perpetuities Period" shall mean the period (if any)
      defined by any applicable rule against perpetuities (the "Applicable
      Rule") within which interests in the Collateral Trust must vest in order
      to be valid when created. The Perpetuities Period includes any period in
      gross permitted by the Applicable Rule, such as twenty-one (21) years. If


                                       3
<PAGE>

      the Perpetuities Period is defined with reference to a given date or the
      death of the last survivor of a class of individuals living on a given
      date (the "Measuring Lives"), the date shall be the date prescribed by the
      Applicable Rule and the Measuring Lives shall be the members of the class
      of persons living on that date who are authorized to receive any payment
      from the Collateral Trust prior to its termination. If the Applicable Rule
      applies differently to different kinds of Trust Assets, a direction to
      terminate the Collateral Trust upon the expiration of the Perpetuities
      Period shall be applied separately to the different kinds of property. If
      Trust Assets transferred to the Collateral Trustee at different times have
      different Perpetuities Periods, a direction to terminate the Collateral
      Trust upon the expiration of the Perpetuities Period shall be applied
      separately to the different Trust Assets, provided that (i) Trust Assets
      for which no sufficient record exists to determine the date of transfer
      shall be deemed for this purpose to have been transferred on the earliest
      possible date, and (ii) an insurance policy or the proceeds of an
      insurance policy shall be deemed transferred on the date the policy is
      acquired by the Collateral Trust regardless of the dates on which premiums
      are subsequently paid. If the Collateral Trust suspends the power of
      alienation or permits accumulations within the meaning of any Applicable
      Rule limiting the period for such suspension or accumulations then this
      provision shall apply to such suspension or accumulations as if they were
      non-vested interests. Upon the termination of the Collateral Trust
      pursuant to the application of any Perpetuities Period, the Collateral
      Trustee shall pay the remaining principal to Congoleum.

      D. Amendments. The Collateral Trustee, with the unanimous consent of
      Congoleum and Claimants' Counsel, may modify and amend this Collateral
      Trust Agreement. Any modification made pursuant to this Section IV.D must
      be made in writing. The ability of the Collateral Trustee, Congoleum and

                                                           EXHIBIT B TO THE PLAN


      Claimants' Counsel to amend this Collateral Trust Agreement in accordance
      with this Section IV.D shall not be restricted by any third party not a
      party hereto, including without limitation any Asbestos Claimant.
      Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other provision of this Collateral
      Trust Agreement, no modification or amendment to this Collateral Trust
      Agreement shall be effective to alter the rights or duties of the Delaware
      Trustee unless consented to in writing by the Delaware Trustee.

4. Other than expressly provided for herein, the terms of the Collateral Trust
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

5. The Collateral Trust Agreement and this Amendment to the Collateral Trust
Agreement (collectively, the "Agreements") constitute a single integrated
written contract expressing the entire agreement among the parties hereto with
respect to the subject matter hereof. The Agreements supercede any prior
understandings and agreements between or among the parties with respect to the
subject matter of the Agreements. Any statements, promises or inducements,
whether made by any party or any agents of any party, that are not contained in
the Agreements shall not be valid or binding. The failure or invalidation of any
provision of the Agreements shall not in any way affect the validity or
performance of any party pursuant to any other provision of the Agreements.

6. References in the Claimant Agreement, the Superceding Security Agreement and
the Collateral Trust Agreement to the "Collateral Trust Agreement" shall be
deemed references to the Agreements.

7. This Amendment to the Collateral Trust Agreement may be executed in any
number of counterparts. Each of such counterparts for all purposes shall be
deemed to be an original, and all such counterparts together shall constitute
but one and the same Amendment to the Collateral Trust Agreement.

            6.    This Second Amendment to the Collateral Trust Agreement may be
                  executed in any number of counterparts, each of which shall be
                  deemed for all purposes to be an original, and all such

                 ASBESTOS INSURANCE RIGHTS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT

      This ASBESTOS INSURANCE RIGHTS ASSIGNMENT AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is
made as of ____________________, 2005 by and among the Congoleum Corporation,
Congoleum Sales, Inc. and Congoleum Fiscal, Inc. (the "Insurance Contributors")
and the Plan Trust. Capitalized terms used herein without definition shall have
the meanings given to such terms in the Third Modified Joint Plan of
Reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of Congoleum Corporation,
et al. (as amended, modified or supplemented from time to time in accordance
with the terms thereof, the "Plan").

      WHEREAS, to protect themselves from certain risks resulting from their
businesses, the Insurance Contributors purchased liability insurance policies;

      WHEREAS, numerous individuals, business organizations, and other persons
have asserted asbestos-related personal injury and property damage claims
against Congoleum and certain affiliated entities;

      WHEREAS, Congoleum has advised the Plan Trust that Congoleum previously
has assigned portions of the Asbestos Insurance Rights to certain Asbestos
Claimants listed on Schedule A hereto (collectively, the "Previously Assigned
Insurance Rights");

      WHEREAS, Congoleum previously has granted security interests in certain of
the Asbestos Insurance Rights to the Persons listed on Schedule B hereto
(collectively, the "Prior Insurance Security Interests");

      WHEREAS, on December 31, 2003, Congoleum and certain affiliated entities
filed voluntary petitions for relief under Chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy
Code in the United States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey;

      WHEREAS, the Plan was confirmed on ____________________, and has become
effective;

      WHEREAS, the Plan provides that the Insurance Contributors will assign the
Asbestos Insurance Rights to the Plan Trust;

      WHEREAS, the Insurance Contributors wish to implement the terms of the
Plan;

      WHEREAS, the Insurance Contributors are receiving good and valuable
consideration in exchange for the transfers, grants, assignments, and promises
made in this Agreement, including the releases and indemnification described in
the Plan and related documents, the receipt and sufficiency of which is
acknowledged and agreed;

      NOW, THEREFORE, subject to and on the terms and conditions herein set
forth, the Insurance Contributors and the Plan Trust hereby agree as follows:

I.    ASSIGNMENT TO THE PLAN TRUST

      A. Effective upon the Effective Date, the Insurance Contributors hereby
irrevocably transfer and assign to the Plan Trust any and all of their Asbestos
Insurance Rights and all rights and claims asserted in the pending Coverage
Litigation (including without limitation cash and other proceeds of all such
rights and claims received by any Insurance Contributor and/or any Debtor during
the pendency of the Reorganization Cases), free and clear of all Claims, Liens
and encumbrances except for Liens for the benefit of Richard Arsenault, Kenneth
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE PLAN


Cook and Dennis Matthews, provided, however, that such transfer and assignment
of the Asbestos Insurance Rights shall be subject to the terms of the Plan and
the Plan Trust Agreement, including without limitation the payment priorities
set forth therein.

      B. The Plan Trust and the Insurance Contributors intend that the Asbestos
Insurance Assignment be made to the maximum extent permitted under applicable
law.

      C. The Asbestos Insurance Assignment is not an assignment of any insurance
policy.

      D. To the extent the Asbestos Insurance Assignment is determined to be
invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, upon request by the Plan Trust and
at the cost of the Plan Trust (as provided in Section II herein), an Insurance
Contributor or Reorganized Debtor, as applicable, shall (i), provided that the
Plan Trust provides reasonable evidence of its ability to promptly pay all costs
incurred in such effort, use its best efforts to pursue any of the Asbestos
Insurance Rights for the benefit of and to the fullest extent required by the
Plan Trust, and (ii) immediately transfer any amounts recovered under or on
account of any of the Asbestos Insurance Rights to the Plan Trust; provided,
however, that while any such amounts are held by or under the control of an
Insurance Contributor or Reorganized Debtor, such amounts (and any interest
earned thereon) shall be segregated and held in trust for the benefit of the
Plan Trust.

II.   COOPERATION

      A. To the fullest extent permitted by applicable law, the Insurance
Contributors and/or Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, shall provide the
Plan Trust with such cooperation as the Plan Trust may reasonably request in
connection with the pursuit by the Plan Trust of the Asbestos Insurance Rights.
Such cooperation shall include, but not be limited to, making their books,
records, employees, agents and professionals available to the Plan Trust. The
Plan Trust shall reimburse the Insurance Contributors and/or Reorganized
Debtors, as the case may be, for their reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' and consultants' fees) incurred (i) in
connection with providing the cooperation described in the preceding sentences,
and (ii) in connection with the pursuit of Asbestos Insurance Rights as provided
in Section I.D. above. Such reimbursement shall be paid promptly following
request for reimbursement accompanied by appropriate documentation.

      B. Notwithstanding anything in the Plan Documents to the contrary, the
Insurance Contributors and/or Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, as part
of every settlement with any one or more London Market insurer(s) (including
Equitas), hereby agree that the Plan Trust, in its sole discretion, may
effectuate a complete policy buy-back of any policies subscribed by any one or
more London Market insurer(s) (following which the Insurance Contributors and/or
Reorganized Debtors shall retain no coverage with respect to such insurer(s)).
The Insurance Contributors and/or Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be,
hereby waive their rights to any proceeds of all such settlements, and all
proceeds of each such settlement (other than as reimbursement in accordance with
the Collateral Trust Agreement and the Plan Documents of Coverage Costs and/or
the Claims Handling Fee) shall be held for the benefit of Asbestos Claimants in
accordance with the Plan Documents.

      C. The Insurance Contributors and/or Reorganized Debtors, as the case may
be, upon request of the Plan Trustee, shall evaluate additional requests for
complete policy commutations. To the extent that additional complete policy
commutations do not materially impair the Insurance Contributors' and/or
Reorganized Debtors', as the case may be, ongoing need for insurance coverage
for potential non-asbestos liabilities and such additional releases are
reasonably necessary to permit the realization of asbestos-related insurance
settlements, the Insurance Contributors and/or Reorganized Debtors, as the case
may be, will cooperate with the Plan Trustee to provide additional policy
commutations. Such additional policy commutations may be conditioned upon a

                                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE PLAN


reasonable allocation of policy proceeds or other provisions to protect
Congoleum from potential non-asbestos liabilities as may be agreed between the
Insurance Contributors and/or Reorganized Debtors, as the case may be, and the
Plan Trustee.

      D. The Insurance Contributors and/or Reorganized Debtors, as the case may
be, agree that their collection or use, if any, of proceeds of any Asbestos
Insurance Policy, to the extent permitted under the Plan Documents, (i) will not
reduce any aggregate, per occurrence or other policy limit of any Asbestos
Insurance Policy that is or could potentially be applicable to Asbestos Claims,
and (ii) will not in any way interfere with the Plan Trust's exercise of any
Asbestos Insurance Rights.

III.  MISCELLANEOUS

      A. Binding Effect, Assignment, Third Party Beneficiaries. This Agreement
shall be binding on each of the parties hereto and their respective successors
and assigns. This Agreement is not intended, and shall not be construed, deemed
or interpreted, to confer on any person or entity not a party hereto any rights
or remedies hereunder.

      B. Entire Agreement; Amendment; Waivers. This Agreement, the Plan and the
other Plan Documents shall constitute the entire agreement and understanding
among the parties to this Agreement with respect to the subject matter hereof
and supersede all prior agreements and understandings, oral or written, among
the parties hereto relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. This
Agreement may not be amended or modified, and no provision hereof may be waived,
except by an agreement in writing signed by the party against whom enforcement
of any such amendment, modification or waiver is sought.

      C. Governing Law. This Agreement and the rights and obligations of the
parties hereto under this Agreement shall be governed by and construed and
enforced in accordance with the substantive laws of the State of Delaware,
without regard to any conflicts of law provisions thereof that would result in
the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction.

      D. Counterparts. This Agreement may be executed in multiple counterparts,
each of which will be an original, but all of which together will constitute one
and the same agreement.

      2.1 Creation and Name. The Settlors hereby create a trust known as the
"Congoleum Plan Trust" as a Delaware trust, which is the Plan Trust to be

Asbestos Claims (whether now existing or arising at any time hereafter) and to
use the Plan Trust Assets to pay holders of such Plan Trust Asbestos Claims in
accordance with the Plan, this Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP, as applicable,
and in such a way that all holders of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims that involve
similar claims are treated in substantially the same manner and to otherwise

Bankruptcy Code. All Plan Trust Asbestos Claims (other than the Settled Claims,
Asbestos Property Damage Claims and the ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity
Claims) shall be determined, liquidated, and paid, if Allowed, pursuant to this
Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP. The Settled Claims (including the Unsecured PI

shall be paid pursuant to this Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP. Asbestos
Property Damage Claims shall be determined pursuant to the Plan and paid, if
Allowed, pursuant to this Plan Trust Agreement. The ABI Asbestos Personal Injury

in, the Plan Trust, free and clear of all Claims, Liens or interests of the
Debtors or any creditor, shareholder, or other Entity, except for Liens
expressly preserved in the Plan and the order(s) confirming the Plan, and
subject to the payment priorities set forth in this Plan Trust Agreement, the
Plan and the TDP, without any further action of any Entity. Pursuant to the
Plan, the Settlors and ABI will transfer, issue or assign, as appropriate, and
deliver to the Plan Trust the other Plan Trust Assets at the time and in the
manner contemplated by the Plan Documents, in each case free and clear of all
Claims, Liens or interests of the Debtors or any creditor, shareholder, or other
Entity, expressly preserved in the Plan and the order(s) confirming the Plan,

and subject to the payment priorities set forth in this Plan Trust Agreement,
the Plan and the TDP. The Settlors and any other party transferring any Plan
Trust Asset to the Plan Trust shall execute and deliver, or cause to be executed
and delivered, such documents as the Plan Trustees may reasonably request from
time to time to reflect the transfer, issuance and assignment, as applicable, of
the Plan Trust Assets to the Plan Trust. To the extent that any Plan Trust
Asset, because of its nature or because it will accrue subsequent to the
Effective Date, cannot be transferred to or vested in and assumed by the Plan
Trust on the Effective Date, such Plan Trust Asset shall be transferred to,
vested in, and assumed by the Plan Trust as soon as practicable after the
Effective Date, free and clear of all Claims, Liens or interests of the Debtors
or any creditor, shareholder, or other Entity.

      2.4 Acceptance of Assets and Assumption of Liabilities.

            (a) In furtherance of the purposes of the Plan Trust, the Plan
Trustees, on behalf of the Plan Trust, hereby expressly accept the transfer,
issuance and assignment, as applicable, to the Plan Trust of the Plan Trust
Assets at the time and in the manner contemplated by the Plan Documents.

            (b) In furtherance of the purposes of the Plan Trust, the Plan
Trustees, on behalf of the Plan Trust, hereby expressly assume all Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims (whether now existing or arising at any time hereafter). The
Plan Trust shall have all defenses, cross-claims, offsets, and recoupments, as
well as rights of indemnification, contribution, subrogation, and similar
rights, regarding Plan Trust Asbestos Claims that any Debtor or any successors
of such Debtor has or would have had under applicable law or under any agreement
related thereto.

            (c) Nothing in this Plan Trust Agreement shall be construed in any
way to limit the scope, enforceability, or effectiveness of the Injunctions
issued in connection with the Plan or the Plan Trust's assumption of the Plan
Trust Asbestos Claims as and when provided herein.

                                   ARTICLE III

      3.2 General Administration.

            (a) To the extent not inconsistent with the terms of this Plan Trust
Agreement, the Plan Trust Bylaws shall govern the affairs of the Plan Trust with
respect to the matters set forth therein and each of the Plan Trustees shall act
in accordance with the Plan Trust Bylaws. In the event of an inconsistency
between the Plan Trust Bylaws and this Plan Trust Agreement, this Plan Trust
Agreement shall govern.

            (b) Tax Returns and Reports.

                  (i) The Plan Trustees shall cause to be obtained, at the cost
and expense of the Plan Trust, a Federal Employer Identification Number for the
Plan Trust and shall cause such income tax and other returns and statements as
are required by the applicable provisions of the IRC and the Treasury
Regulations and such other state or local laws and regulations as may be
applicable to be timely filed on behalf of the Plan Trust on the basis of a
December 31 year end. The Plan Trustees shall take all steps necessary to ensure
that any tax obligations imposed upon the Plan Trust are paid and shall
otherwise comply with Section 1.468B-2 of the Treasury Regulations and all other
reporting obligations of the Plan Trust. The Plan Trustees shall comply with all
applicable withholding obligations as required under the applicable provisions
of the IRC and such other state and local laws as may be applicable, and the
regulations promulgated thereunder.

                  (ii) The Plan Trustees shall cause the Plan Trust to qualify
and maintain qualification as a "qualified settlement fund" within the meaning
of section 1.468B-1(c) of the Treasury Regulations promulgated under section
468B of the IRC.

                  (iii) The Plan Trustees shall cause to be prepared and mailed
such information as required by law to enable payees to complete and file each
of their respective federal, state and local income and other tax returns.

            (c) (i) The Plan Trustees shall cause to be prepared, no later than
one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each fiscal year, an annual
report containing financial statements of the Plan Trust (including, without
limitation, a balance sheet of the Plan Trust as of the end of such fiscal year
and a statement of operations for such fiscal year) audited by a firm of
independent certified public accountants selected by the Plan Trustees and
accompanied by an opinion of such firm as to the fairness in all material
respects of the financial statements' presentation of the cash and investments
available for the payment of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims and as to the conformity
of the financial statements with generally accepted accounting principles;
provided, however, that if, in the reasonable determination of the Plan
Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and the Futures Representative, incurring
the cost of an audit would not be prudent, such financial statements shall not
be audited or accompanied by such an opinion.

                  (ii) The Plan Trustees shall cause to be prepared, no later
than one hundred twenty (120) days following the end of each fiscal year, a
report containing a summary regarding the number and type of Plan Trust Asbestos
Claims (and the amount paid in respect of each such Plan Trust Asbestos Claim)
disposed of during the period covered by the financial statements referred to in
Section 3.2(c)(i).

                  (iii) For so long as the Reorganization Cases remain open, the
Plan Trustees shall file the materials set forth in Section 3.1(c)(i) and
Section 3.1(c)(ii) as soon as available with the Bankruptcy Court and shall
provide a copy of such materials to the Futures Representative and the TAC when
such materials are filed with the Bankruptcy Court. All such materials filed
with the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to the previous sentence shall be available
for inspection by the public in accordance with procedures established by the
Bankruptcy Court. After the Reorganization Cases are closed, the Plan Trustees
shall make copies of the materials set forth in Section 3.1(c)(i) and Section
3.1(c)(ii) available, once such materials are prepared, with reasonable
promptness to any Entity upon written request and shall provide a copy of such
materials to the Futures Representative and the TAC when such materials are
available with reasonable promptness.

            (d) The Plan Trustees shall cause to be prepared as soon as
practicable prior to the commencement of each fiscal year a budget and cash flow
projections covering such fiscal year and the succeeding four fiscal years. The
Plan Trustees shall provide a copy of each such budget and cash flow projections
to the Futures Representative and the TAC.

            (e) The Plan Trustees shall consult with the Futures Representative
and the TAC on the implementation and administration of the Plan Trust and the
TDP. The Plan Trustees may consult with the Futures Representative and the TAC
with respect to any other matter affecting the Plan Trust. The Plan Trustees
shall meet with the Futures Representative and the TAC not less than one (1)
time each fiscal quarter of the Plan Trust during the 24 month period following
the Effective Date and then two (2) times each calendar year thereafter, which
shall be at a regular or special meeting of the Plan Trustees as mutually agreed
to by the Plan Trustees, the Futures Representative and the TAC, to discuss
general matters regarding the administration of the Plan Trust, the review,
allowance, and payment of Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, and the condition of the
Plan Trust Assets.

            (f) The Plan Trustees, upon notice from the Futures Representative
or the TAC requesting consideration of one or more issues, shall at their next
regular meeting or, if appropriate, at a specially called meeting, place on
their agenda and consider such issues.

      3.3 Claims Administration. Following the Effective Date, the Plan Trustees
shall promptly implement the TDP.

      3.4 Indemnification by the Plan Trust.

            (a) The Plan Trust shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless the
Plan Trustees and the Plan Trust's officers and employees, to the fullest extent
that a corporation or trust organized under the laws of the State of Delaware is
from time to time entitled to indemnify and defend its directors, trustees,
officers and employees, against any and all liabilities, expenses (including
reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), claims, damages or losses incurred by
them in the performance of their duties.

                                                           EXHIBIT D TO THE PLAN


            (b) Except with respect to matters to be indemnified pursuant to
Section 3.4(c) below, which shall only be entitled to indemnification as
provided therein and shall not be indemnifiable pursuant to this Section 3.4(b),
the Plan Trust shall indemnify, defend and hold harmless each of the Additional
Indemnitees, in each case to the extent that such Entity was or is a party, or
is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened or pending judicial,
administrative, or arbitrative action, suit or proceeding by reason of (1) any
act or omission of such Entity with respect to (i) any Reorganization Case, (ii)
the negotiation of the Plan or the Plan Documents or in anticipation of
commencing any Reorganization Case, (ii) the liquidation of any Plan Trust
Asbestos Claim, (iii) the administration of the Plan Trust and the
implementation of TDP, or (iv) any and all activities in connection with this
Plan Trust Agreement or the TDP or (2) the fact that such Entity is or was
serving as a member of the TAC, as the Futures Representative, or as a
Representative of the TAC or the Futures Representative. Each such Entity shall
be indemnified and defended by the Plan Trust, to the fullest extent that a
corporation or trust organized under the laws of the State of Delaware is from
time to time entitled to indemnify and defend its officers, directors, trustees,
and employees, against any and all liabilities, expenses (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and expenses), claims, damages or losses incurred by each such
Entity in connection with or resulting from such action, suit, or proceeding, if
such Entity acted in good faith and in a manner such Entity reasonably believed
to be in, or not opposed to, the best interests of the holders of Plan Trust
Asbestos Claims whom the applicable Entity represents (and in all respects such
Entity shall be entitled to rely upon the advice of counsel with respect to its
duties and responsibilities).

            (c) Subject to the limitations set forth in this Section 3.4(c), the
Plan Trust and the Reorganized Debtors shall indemnify and hold harmless each of
the Claimants' Representative and the Collateral Trustee to the extent that such
Entity was or is a party, or is threatened to be made a party, to any threatened
or pending judicial, administrative or arbitrative action, suit or proceeding by
reason of any act or omission of such Entity with respect to the negotiation and
implementation of modifications to the Plan, the other Plan Documents and the
Collateral Trust Agreement contemplated by the Third Modified Joint Plan of
Reorganization of the Debtors and made on or after October 1, 2004 to the
fullest extent that a trust or a corporation organized under the laws of the
State of Delaware is from time to time entitled to indemnify and defend its
officers, directors, trustees and employees, against any and all liabilities,
expenses (including reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses), claims, damages or
losses incurred by each such Entity in connection with or resulting from such
action, suit or proceeding. To the extent that the Claimants' Representative or
the Collateral Trustee seek indemnification under this Section 3.4(c), the
Reorganized Debtors shall be responsible to pay the first one million dollars
($1,000,000) of indemnifiable liabilities, expenses, claims, damages and losses
sought under this Section 3.4(c). Thereafter, the Reorganized Debtors and the
Plan Trust shall each be responsible, severally and not jointly, to pay on a
pari passu basis one half of the liabilities, expenses, claims, damages and
losses indemnifiable under this Section 3.4(c), provided that the Reorganized
Debtors' maximum obligation under this Section 3.4(c) shall in no event exceed
the aggregate sum of three million dollars ($3,000,000). If the Claimants'
Representative or Collateral Trustee seeks indemnification under this Section
3.4(c) (each, an "Indemnified Party"), such Indemnified Party shall give the
Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust prompt written notice of the basis upon
which such Indemnified Party seeks indemnification under this Section 3.4(c) (an
"Indemnification Claim Notice"). In no event shall the Plan Trust or the
Reorganized Debtors be liable for any liabilities, expenses, claims, damages or

losses that result from a delay in providing the Indemnification Claim Notice.
Each Indemnification Claim Notice shall contain a description of the action,
suit or proceeding related to the claim for indemnification and each Indemnified
Party shall furnish promptly to the Plan Trust and the Reorganized Debtors
copies of all papers and official documents received by it in respect thereof.
At their option, the Reorganized Debtors may assume the defense of any action,
suit or proceeding upon which the Indemnified Parties intend to base a request
for indemnification by giving written notice to such Indemnified Party within
fourteen (14) days after the Reorganized Debtors' receipt of an Indemnification
Claim Notice. The assumption of the defense of such action, suit or proceeding
shall not be construed as an acknowledgement that the Reorganized Debtors or the
Plan Trust are liable to indemnify any Indemnified Party in respect thereof, nor
shall it constitute a waiver by the Reorganized Debtors or the Plan Trust of any
defense any of them may assert against any Indemnified Party's claim for
indemnification. In the event that it is ultimately determined that the
Reorganized Debtors and/or the Plan Trust are not obligated to indemnify, defend
or hold harmless any Indemnified Party in respect of any action, suit or
proceeding for which indemnification is sought under this Section 3.4(c), such
Indemnified Party shall reimburse the Reorganized Debtors for any and all costs
and expenses (including attorneys' fees and costs) incurred by the Reorganized
Debtors in defense of such action, suit or proceeding. Regardless of whether the
Reorganized Debtors choose to defend or prosecute any such action, suit or
proceeding, no Indemnified Party shall admit any liability with respect to, or
settle, compromise or discharge, any such action, suit or proceeding without the
prior written consent of the Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust, which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. The Reorganized Debtors and the Plan
Trust shall not be liable for any settlement or disposition of a claim by any
Indemnified Party that is reached without the prior written consent of the
Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust. If the Reorganized Debtors choose to
defend or prosecute any action, suit or proceeding for which indemnification
shall be requested, (i) the Indemnified Parties shall reasonably cooperate in
the defense or prosecution thereof and (ii) the Reorganized Debtors shall keep
the Plan Trust reasonably informed of the status of, and issues in, the action,
suit or proceeding and shall consult with the Plan Trust in connection with the
defense or prosecution thereof (subject to any applicable privileges). In
addition, if the Reorganized Debtors choose to defend or prosecute any action,
suit or proceeding for which indemnification shall be requested, the Reorganized
Debtors shall not settle such action, suit or proceeding without the prior
written consent of the Plan Trust, which consent shall not be unreasonably
withheld.

            (d) Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.4 to the contrary,
neither the Plan Trustees nor any officer or employee of the Plan Trust, nor the
Futures Representative nor any member of the TAC shall be indemnified or
defended in any way for any liability, expense, claim, damage, or loss for which
they are ultimately liable under Sections 5.4, 6.8 or 7.9, as applicable.

            (e) The Plan Trust shall indemnify and hold harmless each of the
Debtors, the Reorganized Debtors and their past, present and future
Representatives for any expenses, costs and fees (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, but excluding any such expenses, costs and fees
incurred prior to the Effective Date), judgments, settlements or other
liabilities arising from or incurred in connection with, any Plan Trust Asbestos
Claim, including but not limited to indemnification or contribution for Plan
Trust Asbestos Claims prosecuted against the Reorganized Debtors after the
Effective Date but excluding (i) any amounts paid prior to or on the Effective

Date by the Debtors or their past or present Representatives, (ii) any amounts
paid or incurred by any Reorganized Debtor or its Representatives, whether
before or after the Effective Date, in connection with defending, objecting to,
or otherwise related to any proceedings to determine whether an Asbestos
Property Damage Claim is or should be Allowed, (iii) any amounts paid or
incurred by any Reorganized Debtor or its Representatives after the Effective
Date in connection with a proceeding under Section 7.5 of the Plan and (iv) any
amounts paid or payable by the Reorganized Debtors under Section 3.4(c) hereof.
Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.4 to the contrary, the Plan Trust
shall reimburse and pay promptly the Reorganized Debtors, from the proceeds of
Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries, for Coverage Costs in excess of six
million dollars ($6,000,000) to the extent that such Coverage Costs have not
been reimbursed or paid to the Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as
applicable, from Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries received on or after the
Petition Date. Further, if the proceeds of Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries
received on or after the Petition Date exceed $375 million ($375,000,000), net
of any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs, then the Plan Trust shall
reimburse and pay promptly the Reorganized Debtors, from the proceeds of
Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries, for (1) any Coverage Costs for which the
Debtors or the Reorganized Debtors, as applicable, have not been reimbursed
(whether pursuant to the Collateral Trust Agreement, this Section 3.4(e) or
otherwise) and (2) the Claims Handling Fee paid under the Claimant Agreement;
provided, however, if any Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries in excess of $375
million ($375,000,000) (but net of any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage
Costs) are not available to pay such unreimbursed or unpaid Coverage Costs or
the Claims Handling Fee due to restrictions on the use of such Asbestos
Insurance Action Recoveries imposed by any Asbestos Insurance Settlement
Agreement, the Plan Trust shall reimburse and pay promptly the Reorganized
Debtors from unrestricted funds held by the Plan Trust and/or grant the
Reorganized Debtors the right to offset any such unreimbursed or unpaid Coverage
Costs against any future payments due by the Reorganized Debtors under the
Promissory Note. Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries shall not be reserved for
the payment of Coverage Costs not yet incurred or not yet payable under the
terms of this Section 3.4(e). Coverage Costs shall be paid out of any Asbestos
Insurance Action Recoveries after the date when such Coverage Costs are or
become payable hereunder.

            (f) Reasonable expenses, costs and fees (including reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs, but excluding any expenses, costs or fees arising
prior to the Petition Date) incurred by or on behalf of any of the Plan
Trustees, any Additional Indemnitee, the Claimants' Representative or the
Collateral Trustee in connection with any action, suit, or proceeding, whether
civil, administrative or arbitrative, from which he or she is indemnified
pursuant to Section 3.4(a), Section 3.4(b) and Section 3.4(c), shall be paid, in
the case of Sections 3.4(a) and (b), by the Plan Trust and, in the case of
Section 3.4(c), by the Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust as provided
therein, in advance of the final disposition thereof upon receipt of an
undertaking, by or on behalf of such Plan Trustee, Additional Indemnitee,
Claimants' Representative or Collateral Trustee, as the case may be, to repay
such amount in the event that it shall be determined ultimately by Final Order
that such Plan Trustee, Additional Indemnitee, Claimants' Representative or
Collateral Trustee is not entitled to be indemnified by the Plan Trust or, in
the case of Section 3.4(c), the Reorganized Debtors and the Plan Trust as
provided therein.

            (g) The Plan Trustees shall have the power, generally or in specific
cases, to cause the Plan Trust to indemnify the agents, advisors, or consultants
of the Plan Trust, the TAC or the Futures Representative to the same extent as
provided in this Section 3.4 with respect to the Plan Trustees. Any
indemnification under this Section 3.4(g) shall be made by the Plan Trust upon a
determination by the Plan Trustees that indemnification of such Entity is proper
in the circumstances.

            (h) The Plan Trustees may purchase and maintain reasonable amounts
and types of insurance, or may establish and maintain appropriate reserves, on
behalf of the Plan Trust and any individual who is or was a Plan Trustee,
officer, employee, agent or representative of the Plan Trust or Additional
Indemnitee against liability asserted against or incurred by such individual in
that capacity or arising from his or her status as a Plan Trustee, Futures
Representative, member of the TAC, officer, employee, agent or other
representative.

            (i) The Plan Trust shall have the right to offset any amounts due to
any Entity pursuant to this Section 3.4 against any amounts owed to the Plan
Trust by such Entity.

      3.5 Lien. The Plan Trustees and the Additional Indemnitees shall have a
Lien upon the Plan Trust Assets which shall be prior to any other Lien thereon,
and the Plan Trust hereby grants a security interest in the Plan Trust Assets,
all proceeds thereof and all accounts into which such proceeds or the Plan Trust
Assets are deposited or maintained to each of the Plan Trustees and the

            (a) In the event the consent of the Futures Representative is
required pursuant to the terms of this Plan Trust Agreement, the Plan Trustees
shall promptly provide the Futures Representative and his or her counsel with
notice and with all information regarding the matter in question.

            (b) The Futures Representative must consider in good faith any
request by the Plan Trustees and may not withhold his or her consent
unreasonably. The Futures Representative shall respond to the Plan Trustees'
request for consent within 30 days of the receipt by the Futures Representative
of the same; provided, however, that such 30 days shall be extended to 45 days
upon the request of the Futures Representative.

      6.7 Lack of Consent of the Futures Representative. (a) In the event the
Plan Trustees are unable to obtain the consent of the Futures Representative to
any action or decision for which consent is required after following the
procedure set forth in Section 6.6 of this Plan Trust Agreement, or if the Plan
Trustees and the Futures Representative are unable to reach agreement on any
matter on which such consent is required, the matter shall be submitted promptly
to alternative dispute resolution if mutually agreeable to the Plan Trustees and
the Futures Representative. If the disagreement is not resolved by alternative
dispute resolution or if the Plan Trustees and the Futures Representative do not
agree to participate in any such alternative dispute resolution, the Plan
Trustees may apply to the Bankruptcy Court, or other court of competent
jurisdiction, on an expedited basis for approval of such action or decision, and
only if such approval is given by the Bankruptcy Court, or such other court of
competent jurisdiction, by entry of an appropriate order, shall the Plan
Trustees have the authority to implement such action or decision without the
Futures Representative's consent.

      6.8 Liability of Futures Representative, Officers and Employees. The
Futures Representative shall not be liable to the Plan Trust, to any Entity
holding a Plan Trust Asbestos Claim, or to any other Entity except for such
individual's (i) own recklessness or (ii) willful misappropriation. Such
protection may, in the discretion of the Plan Trustees, be extended to the
agents, advisors, or consultants of the Futures Representative. Neither the
Futures Representative nor any officer or employee of the Futures Representative
shall be liable for any act or omission of any other officer, employee, agent,
or consultant of the Plan Trust, unless the Futures Representative, or officer
or employee of the Futures Representative, acted with bad faith in the selection
or retention of such other officer, employee, agent, or consultant of the Plan
Trust.

      6.9 Copies to the TAC. The Plan Trustees shall provide the TAC with copies
of all notices and other written information provided to the Futures
Representative pursuant to this Plan Trust Agreement.

                            TRUST ADVISORY COMMITTEE

      7.1 Formulation and Number. The TAC shall be formed pursuant to the Plan

initial TAC members shall be appointed by the Bankruptcy Court pursuant to
Section 5.1(o) of the Plan and named on the signature page hereof.

      7.2 Duties. The TAC and its members shall serve in a fiduciary capacity
representing all holders of present Plan Trust Asbestos Claims. Where provided
in this Plan Trust Agreement or the TDP, certain actions by the Plan Trustees
are subject to the consent of the TAC.

      7.3 Term of Office.

            (a) Each member of the TAC shall serve until the earlier of (i) his
or her death, (ii) his or her resignation pursuant to Section 7.3(b), (iii) his
or her removal pursuant to Section 7.3(c) or (iv) the termination of the Plan
Trust pursuant to Section 8.2.

            (b) Any member of the TAC may resign at any time by written notice
to each of the remaining TAC members. Such notice shall specify a date when such
resignation shall take effect, which shall not be less than ninety (90) days
after the date such notice is given, where practicable.

            (c) Any member of the TAC may be removed in the event he or she
becomes unable to discharge his or her duties hereunder due to accident,
physical deterioration, mental incompetence, or for other good cause. Good cause
shall be deemed to include, without limitation, a consistent pattern of neglect
and failure to perform or to participate in performing the duties of such member
hereunder and under the TDP, such as repeated non-attendance at scheduled
meetings. Such removal shall be made at the recommendation of the remaining
members of the TAC with the approval of the Bankruptcy Court.

      7.4 Appointment of Successors. In the event of a vacancy caused by the
resignation or death of a TAC member, his or her successor shall be selected by
the TAC member who is resigning or is deceased, or by the member's law firm in
the event that such member has not pre-selected a successor. If neither the
member nor the law firm exercises the right to make such a selection, the
successor shall be chosen by a majority vote of the remaining TAC members. If a
majority of the remaining members cannot agree, the Bankruptcy Court shall
appoint the successor. In the event of a vacancy caused by the removal of a TAC
member, the remaining members of the TAC by majority vote shall name the
successor. If the majority of the remaining members of the TAC cannot reach
agreement, the Bankruptcy Court shall appoint the successor.

      7.5 The TAC's Employment of Professionals. The TAC may, but shall not be
required to, retain and/or consult with counsel, accountants, appraisers,
auditors, forecasters, asbestos experts and other Entities deemed by the TAC to
be qualified as experts on matters submitted to them, and the opinion of any
such Entities on any matters submitted to them shall be full and complete
authorization and protection in support of any action taken or not taken by the
TAC hereunder in good faith and in accordance with the written opinion of any
such Entity, and in the absence of gross negligence. The TAC and its experts
shall at all times have complete access to the Plan Trust's officers, employees
and agents, and the accountants, appraisers, auditors, forecasters and other
experts retained by the Plan Trust as well as all information generated by them
or otherwise available to the Plan Trust or the Plan Trustees; provided that in
no event shall the TAC or its members (i) have any role, whether by consent,
consultation or otherwise, in the Plan Trust's selection of counsel, experts or
other professionals to defend claims against the Plan Trust that are tendered to
any insurer for defense, or (ii) have any right to consult with or obtain
information from the Plan Trust or anyone employed by the Plan Trust concerning
the defense of any such claims.

      7.6 Compensation and Expenses of the TAC.

            (a) Each member of the TAC shall receive compensation from the Plan
Trust for his or her services as a member of the TAC in the form of a reasonable
hourly rate set by the Plan Trustees for attendance at meetings or other conduct
of Plan Trust business.

            (b) The Plan Trust will promptly reimburse, or pay directly if so
instructed, the TAC and each TAC member for all reasonable out-of-pocket costs
and expenses, including reasonable fees and costs associated with employment of
professionals pursuant to Section 7.5 and the procurement and maintenance of
insurance, incurred by the TAC in connection with the performance of its
members' duties hereunder. Such reimbursement or direct payment shall be deemed
a Plan Trust Expense. The Plan Trust shall include a description of the amounts
paid under this Section 7.6 in the reports to be prepared pursuant to Section
3.2(c).

      7.7 Procedure for Consulting With and Obtaining Consent of the TAC.

            (a) Consultation Process. In the event the Plan Trustees are
required to consult with the TAC pursuant to any provision in this Plan Trust
Agreement or the TDP, the Plan Trustees shall provide the TAC with written
advance notice of the matter under consideration, and with all relevant
information concerning the matter as is reasonably practicable under the
circumstances. The Plan Trustees shall also provide the TAC with such reasonable
access to professionals and other experts retained by the Plan Trust and its
staff (if any) as the TAC may reasonably request during the time that the Plan
Trustees are considering such matter, and shall also provide the TAC the
opportunity, at reasonable times and for reasonable periods of time, to discuss
and comment on such matter with the Plan Trustees. The Plan Trustees shall take
into consideration the time required for the TAC, if its members so wish, to
engage and consult with its own independent financial or investment advisors as
to such matter.

            (b) Consent Process. In the event the Plan Trustees are required to
obtain the consent of the TAC pursuant to any provision of this Plan Trust
Agreement or the TDP, the Plan Trustees shall provide the TAC with a written
notice stating that their consent is being sought pursuant to that provision,
describing in detail the nature and scope of the action the Plan Trustees
propose to take, and explaining in detail the reasons why the Plan Trustees
desire to take such action. The Plan Trustees shall provide the TAC as much
relevant additional information concerning the proposed action as is reasonably
practicable under the circumstances. The Plan Trustees shall also provide the
TAC with such reasonable access to professionals and other experts retained by
the Plan Trust and its staff (if any) as the TAC may reasonably request during
the time that the Plan Trustees are considering such action, and shall also
provide the TAC the opportunity, at reasonable times and for reasonable periods
of time, to discuss and comment on such action with the Plan Trustees.

                                                           EXHIBIT D TO THE PLAN


            The TAC must consider in good faith and in a timely fashion any
request for its consent by the Plan Trustees, and must in any event advise the
Plan Trustees in writing of its consent or its objection to the proposed action
within 30 days of receiving the original request for consent from the Plan
Trustees. The TAC may not withhold its consent unreasonably. If the TAC decides
to withhold its consent, it must explain in detail its objections to the
proposed action. If the TAC does not advise the Plan Trustees in writing of its
consent or its objections to the action within 30 days of receiving notice
regarding such request, the TAC's consent to the proposed actions shall be
deemed to have been affirmatively granted; provided, however, that such 30 days
shall be extended to 45 days upon the request of the TAC. If, after following
the procedures specified in this Section 7.7, the TAC continues to object to the
proposed action and to withhold its consent to the proposed action, the Plan
Trustees and/or the TAC shall resolve their dispute pursuant to the procedures
set forth in Section 7.8 below. However, the burden of proof with respect to the
validity of the TAC's objection and withholding of its consent shall be on the
TAC.

            (c) Except where otherwise provided for in this Plan Trust
Agreement, the TAC shall act in all cases by majority vote.

      7.8 Lack of Consent of the TAC. In the event the Plan Trustees are unable
to obtain the consent of the TAC on any action or decision for which consent of
the TAC is required, after following the procedure set forth in Section 7.7 of
this Plan Trust Agreement, or if the Plan Trustees and the TAC are unable to
reach agreement on any matter on which the TAC's consent is required, then the
matter may be submitted promptly to alternative dispute resolution if mutually
agreeable to the Plan Trustees and the TAC. If the disagreement is not resolved
by alternative dispute resolution, or if the Plan Trustees and the TAC do not
agree to participate in any such alternative dispute resolution, the Plan
Trustees may apply to the Bankruptcy Court, or other court of competent
jurisdiction, on an expedited basis for approval of such action or decision, and
only if such approval is given by the Bankruptcy Court, or such other court of
competent jurisdiction, by entry of an appropriate order, shall the Plan
Trustees have the authority to implement such action or decision without the
TAC's consent.

      7.9 Liability of the TAC, Officers and Employees. No member of the TAC
shall be liable to the Plan Trust, to any Entity holding a Plan Trust Asbestos
Claim, or to any other Entity except for such individual's (i) own recklessness
or (ii) willful misappropriation. Such protection may, in the discretion of the
Plan Trustees, be extended to the agents, advisors, or consultants of the TAC.
No member of the TAC, nor any officer or employee of the TAC, shall be liable
for any act or omission of any other officer, employee, agent or consultant of
the TAC unless the TAC, or officer or employee of the TAC, acted with bad faith
in the selection or retention of such other officer, employee, agent, or
consultant of the Plan Trust.

      7.10 Copies to the Futures Representative. The Plan Trustees shall provide
the Futures Representative with copies of all notices and other written
information provided to the TAC pursuant to this Plan Trust Agreement.

      8.2 Termination.

            (a) The Plan Trust shall automatically terminate on the date ninety
(90) days after the first to occur of the following events (the "Termination
Date"):

                  (i) subject to Section 3.1(f), the Plan Trustees in their
discretion decide to terminate the Plan Trust because (A) they deem it unlikely
that new Plan Trust Asbestos Claims will be filed against the Plan Trust, and
(B) Plan Trust Asbestos Claims duly filed with the Plan Trust have been Allowed
and paid to the extent provided in this Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP (and to
the extent possible based upon the funds available through the Plan Documents),
or Disallowed by a Final Order, and twelve (12) consecutive months have elapsed
during which no new Plan Trust Asbestos Claims have been filed with the Plan
Trust;

                  (ii) if the Plan Trustees have procured and have in place
irrevocable insurance policies and have established claims handling agreements
and other necessary arrangements with suitable third parties adequate to
discharge all expected remaining obligations and expenses of the Plan Trust in a
manner consistent with this Plan Trust Agreement and the TDP, the date on which
the Bankruptcy Court enters an order approving such insurance and other
arrangements and such order becomes a Final Order; or

                  (iii) to the extent that any rule against perpetuities shall
be deemed applicable to the Plan Trust, twenty-one (21) years less ninety-one
(91) days pass after the death of the last survivor of all of the descendants of
Joseph P. Kennedy, Sr. living on the date hereof.

            (b) On the Termination Date, after payment of all the Plan Trust's

all properties and other non-cash Plan Trust Assets then held by the Plan Trust,
all monies remaining in the Plan Trust estate shall be given to such
organization(s) exempt from federal income tax under section 501(c)(3) of the
IRC, which tax-exempt organization(s) shall be selected by the Plan Trustees
using their reasonable discretion; provided, however, that (i) if practicable,
the tax-exempt organization(s) shall be related to the treatment of, research
on, or the relief of suffering of individuals suffering from asbestos-related
disorders, and (ii) the tax-exempt organization(s) shall not bear any
relationship to the Reorganized Debtors within the meaning of Section 468B(d)(3)
of the IRC. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan Documents, this
Section 8.2(b) cannot be modified or amended.

      8.3 Amendments. The Plan Trustees, with the consent of each of the Futures
Representative and the TAC, may modify or amend this Plan Trust Agreement or any
document annexed to it, including, without limitation, the Plan Trust Bylaws or
the TDP. Any modification or amendment made pursuant to this Section 8.3 must be
done in writing. Notwithstanding anything contained in this Plan Trust Agreement
to the contrary, neither this Plan Trust Agreement, the Plan Trust Bylaws, the
TDP nor any document annexed to the foregoing shall be modified or amended in
any way that could jeopardize, impair, or modify the applicability of Section
524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code, the efficacy or enforceability of the injunctions
set out in the Plan, the Plan Trust's QSF status under section 468B of the IRC.

Plan Trust Agreement.

                                PLEDGE AGREEMENT

      THIS PLEDGE AGREEMENT (this "Agreement") is entered into this ___ day of
_____________, 2005, by and between the Congoleum Plan Trust created by the
Congoleum Plan Trust Agreement dated ________________, 2005 (the "Plan Trust")
and American Biltrite Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Pledgor")
(collectively, the "Parties" and, individually, a "Party"). Capitalized terms
used herein without definition shall have the meanings given to such terms in
the Plan, as defined below.

      WHEREAS, Congoleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation and a
majority-owned subsidiary of the Pledgor ("Congoleum"), has been named and
expects to be further named a defendant in numerous asbestos-related claims;

      WHEREAS, Congoleum is unable to meet its liabilities with respect to such
asbestos-related claims absent payment from its insurers;

      WHEREAS, on December 31, 2003, Congoleum commenced a case under Chapter 11
of the United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code") in the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (the "Bankruptcy Court");

      WHEREAS, Congoleum has filed the Joint Prepackaged Plan of Reorganization
under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code of Congoleum Corporation, et al. (the
"Plan"), which has been confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court;

      WHEREAS, the Plan provides that the Plan Trust be funded in part by a
promissory note in an initial aggregate amount of two million seven hundred
thirty-eight thousand two hundred thirty-four dollars and seventy-five cents
($2,738,234.75) to be executed by Congoleum, substantially in the form attached
hereto as Exhibit A (the "Congoleum Note"), subject to increase as provided in
the Congoleum Note, and secured by a pledge by the Pledgor of certain securities
of Congoleum and other property of Pledgor; and

      WHEREAS, this Agreement is being executed and delivered by the Parties
pursuant to the terms of the Plan;

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the foregoing premises and other good
and valuable consideration, the receipt and sufficiency of which is hereby
acknowledged, the Parties, intending to be legally bound, hereby agree,
effective as of the Effective Date, as follows:

      1. Pledge. The Pledgor hereby pledges to the Plan Trust all of the Pledgor
s rights, title and interest in and to

            (a) 151,100 shares of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per
share, and 4,395,605 shares of Class B common stock, par value $0.01 per share,
of Congoleum held by the Pledgor (the "Pledged Shares"), which represents a
majority of the voting power of Congoleum's outstanding voting stock and all of
Congoleum's voting stock owned by the Pledgor as of the date hereof,

                                                           EXHIBIT E TO THE PLAN


            (b) and any other equity interests of Congoleum held by the Pledgor
and

            (c) any amounts that the Pledgor would otherwise have the right to
receive from Congoleum or the Plan Trust pursuant to any rights of indemnity
that the Pledgor may have against Congoleum or the Plan Trust pursuant to the
Plan or the Joint Venture Agreement, dated as of December 16, 1992, by and among
the Pledgor, Resilient Holdings Incorporated, the Obligor, Hillside Industries
Incorporated and Hillside Capital Incorporated, as amended (the "Joint Venture
Agreement"), which amounts shall be paid into, set aside, placed and held in
escrow and in trust, and paid and distributed from such escrow and trust by the
Plan Trust, in the manner provided and contemplated by this Agreement, the Plan,
the Plan Trust Agreement and the Congoleum Note,

as security for the payment when due (whether by scheduled repayment,
acceleration, or otherwise) by Congoleum of all amounts payable or to become
payable pursuant to and in accordance with the terms of the Congoleum Note (such
amounts are referred to herein as the "Obligations").

      2. Deliverer of Pledged Shares. The Pledgor will deliver to the Plan
Trustee, upon execution of this Agreement, the certificates representing the
Pledged Shares, together with duly executed forms of assignment in blank and
undated sufficient to transfer title thereto. The Pledged Shares shall be held
by the Plan Trust during the term of this Agreement, subject to the terms and
conditions of this Agreement, the Congoleum Note, the Plan and the Plan Trust
Agreement.

      3. Voting Rights; Dividends and Distributions. Notwithstanding anything to
the contrary contained herein, during the term of this Agreement and until the
occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined in the Congoleum Note, which
remains uncured after the expiration of the Cure Period, as defined in the
Congoleum Note, the Pledgor shall be entitled to all of its voting rights with
respect to the Pledged Shares and shall be entitled to receive all dividends
and/or distributions paid or payable in respect of the Pledged Shares. At the
option of the Plan Trust, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which
remains uncured after the expiration of the Cure Period, and upon notice from
the Plan Trust that it is exercising such option, the Pledgor shall no longer be
entitled to vote the Pledged Shares and all such voting rights shall be vested
in the Plan Trust, and the Plan Trust shall thereupon become entitled to receive
all dividends and/or distributions payable thereafter as additional security
hereunder, and any such dividends and/or distributions may be applied in
reduction of any of the Obligations.

      4. Other Remedies. The Plan Trustee shall give notice of an Event of
Default to the persons and in the manner provided in the Congoleum Note.
Congoleum and the Pledgor shall have until the expiration of the Cure Period to
cure the Event of Default pursuant to the Congoleum Note. After expiration of
the Cure Period, if the Event of Default has not been cured, the Plan Trust may
exercise any and all of the rights, powers, and remedies of any owner of the
Pledged Shares and the other collateral pledged pursuant hereto and shall have
and, except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, may exercise without
demand, any and all rights and remedies granted to a secured party upon default
under the Uniform Commercial Code ("UCC") of [the State of Delaware] or
otherwise available to the Plan Trust under applicable law, this Agreement, the
Congoleum Note, the Plan Trust Agreement or the Plan. Without limiting the

                                                           EXHIBIT E TO THE PLAN


foregoing, upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which remains uncured
after expiration of the Cure Period, the Plan Trust is authorized to sell,
assign and deliver at its discretion, from time to time, all or any part of the
Pledged Shares at any private sale or public auction, on not less than ten (10)
days written notice to the Pledgor, at commercially reasonable prices and terms,
and to release to the Plan Trust the amounts held in trust and in escrow
pursuant to the Plan, the Plan Trust Agreement and the Congoleum Note with
regard to the Pledgor's rights to receive indemnity for certain claims pursuant
to the Joint Venture Agreement and the Plan. The Pledgor shall have no right to
redeem the Pledged Shares after any sale or assignment, but at any such sale or
auction the Pledgor may bid for, and become the purchaser of, all or any part of
the Pledged Shares offered for sale. In case of any sale of the Pledged Shares
pursuant hereto, the proceeds thereof shall be applied fast to the costs and
other expenses of such sale, and then in reduction of the Obligations in such
manner as the Plan Trustee may reasonably direct. The Pledgor acknowledges and
agrees that the Plan Trust shall have the continuing and exclusive right to
apply such proceeds as well as the other collateral pledged pursuant hereto to
reduce the Obligations until the Obligations are paid in full. The balance of
the proceeds of such sale and such other collateral, if any, remaining after the
payment in full of such costs and expenses and the Obligations and any unsold
Pledged Shares, shall be paid or delivered, as applicable, to the Pledgor. The
Pledgor shall not be liable for any deficiency with respect to the Obligations,
it being the intent of the Parties hereto that the Plan Trust's sole recourse
vis-a-vis the Pledgor upon the occurrence of an Event of Default which remains
uncured after expiration of the Cure Period shall be to the Pledged Shares and
the other collateral pledged pursuant hereto as provided herein and in the Plan
and the Plan Trust Agreement.

      5. Pledgor's Right of Repayment. In addition to any other rights the
Pledgor may have, the Pledgor agrees that its right to be repaid by Congoleum
with regard to any amounts paid or deemed to have been paid by the Pledgor to
the Plan Trust pursuant to this Agreement or the Congoleum Note, including
without limitation pursuant to Section 13 of the Congoleum Note, any exercise of
the Prepayment Option (as defined under the Congoleum Note) or curing an Event
of Default, or upon the Plan Trust exercising any of the rights, powers or
remedies with respect to any Pledged Shares and other collateral pledged
pursuant to this Agreement as a result of an Event of Default that remains
uncured after the applicable Cure Period in accordance with the terms of this
Agreement, or otherwise (a "Pledgor Payment") shall be governed by Section 6 of
the Congoleum Note and this Section 5. So long as the Obligations have not been
paid in full in cash, the Pledgor will not take, sue for, ask or demand from
Congoleum payment for any Pledgor Payment, or commence, or join with any
creditor other than the Plan Trust in commencing or directly or indirectly cause
Congoleum to commence any dissolution, winding up, total or partial liquidation,
reorganization or protection of Congoleum, whether voluntary or involuntary, in
any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership or other similar case
or proceeding under any federal or state bankruptcy or similar law or upon any
assignment for the benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the assets
and liabilities of Congoleum or otherwise.

      6. Release of Pledged Shares and Other Pledged Collateral. Upon (i) the
payment of all of the then outstanding principal under the Congoleum Note plus
all accrued but unpaid interest thereon in accordance with the terms of the
Congoleum Note (whether by scheduled repayment, acceleration, or otherwise) or
(ii) any breach by the Plan Trust of any term, covenant or agreement under this
Agreement or the Congoleum Note which remains uncured fifteen (15) days

                                                           EXHIBIT E TO THE PLAN


following notice to the Plan Trust from the Pledgor or Congoleum of such breach,
the Plan Trust shall promptly surrender all Pledged Shares then subject to this
Agreement, and release from trust and escrow all other collateral pledged
hereunder and promptly pay and distribute such collateral, to the Pledgor
together with all associated forms of assignment, and this Agreement shall be
automatically terminated without any further action by the Parties. In addition,
upon any assignment or transfer by the Plan Trust of the Congoleum Note, the
Plan Trust shall promptly pay and distribute all collateral held in trust and
escrow for the Pledgor's benefit pursuant to Section 1(c) of this Agreement (a)
first, to the Plan Trust in repayment of principal then outstanding on the
Congoleum Note together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon as of such
date and (b) second, any amounts remaining after such repayment in full shall be
immediately paid and distributed by the Plan Trust to the Pledgor. As of any
assignment or transfer of the Congoleum Note by the Plan Trust, Section l (c) of
this Agreement shall be void and of no further force or effect. Upon such
termination of this Agreement or assignment or transfer of the Congoleum Note by
the Plan Trust, the Plan Trust shall, at the expense of the Pledgor, execute and
deliver to the Pledgor all UCC termination statements and similar documents,
which the Pledgor shall reasonably request to evidence the termination of this
Agreement or Section 1(c) of this Agreement, as applicable.

      7. No Other Liens; No Sale or Transfers. The Pledgor hereby represents and
warrants that it has valid title to all of the Pledged Shares, free and clear of
all Liens, other than Liens created by this Agreement. The Pledgor represents
and warrants that the Pledged Shares constitute all of the shares of common
stock of Congoleum held by the Pledgor as of the date hereof. The Pledgor hereby
covenants that, until all outstanding principal under the Congoleum Note plus
all accrued but unpaid interest thereon has been paid in full in accordance with
the terms of the Congoleum Note, the Pledgor shall not create, incur, assume or
suffer to exist any Lien against the Pledged Shares or other collateral pledged
pursuant hereto, other than pursuant to this Agreement, the Congoleum Note, the
Plan Trust Agreement or the Plan, or sell or otherwise transfer any Pledged
Shares or other collateral pledged pursuant hereto or any interest therein,
except as otherwise required herein or in the Congoleum Note, the Plan or in the
Plan Trust Agreement. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the Pledgor may create,
incur, assume or suffer to exist a Lien on the Pledged Shares or other
collateral in favor of a third party so long as any such Lien ranks junior to
the rights of the Payee hereunder with regard to such Pledged Shares or other
collateral, provided that (i) no Event of Default has occurred or is continuing
or would occur after giving effect to the transaction pursuant to which the Lien
is to be granted, (ii) the Pledgor provides the Payee with advance notice of its
intention to so create, incur, assume or suffer to exist such a Lien and copies
of the documentation related to such Lien and such other information as the
Payee may reasonably request so that the Payee may confirm compliance with this
covenant, (iii) the Pledgor causes the third party to whom such Lien shall be
granted to acknowledge the prior Lien of the Payee in such Pledged Shares or
other collateral, (iv) the Pledgor causes the third party to whom such Lien
shall be granted to agree that for so long as any obligations under the
Congoleum Note (whether in respect of principal, interest or otherwise and other
than obligations owed to the Pledgor) remain outstanding and have not been paid
in full in cash, such third party Lien holder will not take, sue for, seek to
realize upon or assert any right against such Pledged Shares or other collateral
and (v) such Lien is not granted to an Affiliate (as such term is defined under
Rule 12b-2 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended) of the
Pledgor.

      8. Further Assurances. The Pledgor agrees that at any time and from time
to time during the term of this Agreement, upon the written request of the Plan
Trustee, the Pledgor shall execute and deliver such further documents and do
such further acts and things as the Plan Trustee may reasonably request in order
to effect the purposes of this Agreement or to perfect the security interests
granted herein.

      9. Severability. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal or
unenforceable, that provision will, to the extent possible, be modified in such
manner as to be valid, legal and enforceable but so as to most nearly retain the
intent of the Parties as expressed herein, and if such a modification is not
possible, that provision will be severed from this Agreement; and in either case
the validity, legality and enforceability of the remaining provisions of this
Agreement will not in any way be affected or impaired thereby, it being intended
by each Party that all the rights and privileges of the Parties hereunder will
be enforceable to the fullest extent permitted by applicable law.

      10. No Waiver of Remedies, Cumulative Remedies. The Plan Trust shall not
by any act, delay, omission or otherwise be deemed to have waived any of its
rights or remedies hereunder, and any such waiver shall not be valid unless in
writing, signed by the Plan Trustee, and then only to the extent therein set
forth. A waiver by the Plan Trustee of any right or remedy hereunder on any one
occasion shall not be construed as a bar to any right or remedy that the Plan
Trustee would otherwise have on any future occasion. No failure to exercise nor
any delay in exercising on the part of the Plan Trustee, any right, power or
privilege hereunder shall preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
exercise of any other right, power or privilege. The rights and remedies herein
provided are cumulative and may be exercised singly or concurrently, and are not
exclusive of any rights or remedies provided by law.

      11. Waivers, Amendment; Applicable Law. None of the terms or provisions of
this Agreement may be waived, altered, modified or amended except by an
instrument in writing, duly executed by the Parties. This Agreement and all
rights, remedies and obligations of the Parties shall inure to the benefit of
the Parties and their respective successors and assigns. This Agreement and the
rights and obligations of the Parties shall be construed in accordance with the
laws of the State of [Delaware], without giving effect to any choice or conflict
of law provision or rule (whether of the State of [Delaware] or any other
jurisdiction) that would cause the application of the laws of any jurisdiction
other than the State of [Delaware].

      12. Dispute Resolution. With respect to claims under this Agreement, each
Party hereby irrevocably (i) submits to the exclusive jurisdiction of the
Bankruptcy Court, provided that to the extent that the Bankruptcy Court is not
permitted under applicable law to exercise jurisdiction with respect to the
matter in question, then each Party hereby submits to the exclusive jurisdiction
of the federal and state courts in the State of [Delaware] and (ii) agrees that
any and all claims in respect of such action, suit or proceeding may be heard
and determined in any such court.

      13. Enforcement Costs. The Pledgor shall pay to the Plan Trust the
reasonable costs incurred by the Plan Trust (including reasonable attorney's
fees) pursuant to the Plan Trust's enforcement of the rights afforded to it
hereunder.

                     CONGOLEUM SUBORDINATED PROMISSORY NOTE

$2,738,234.75 (subject to adjustment)                   __________________, 2005

      FOR VALUE RECEIVED, Congoleum Corporation, a Delaware corporation (herein
called the "Obligor", which term includes any successor to Congoleum
Corporation), hereby promises to pay to the order of the Congoleum Plan Trust
created by the Congoleum Plan Trust Agreement dated _____________________, 2005
(the "Payee"), the principal sum of two million seven hundred thirty-eight
thousand two hundred thirty-four dollars and seventy-five cents ($2,738,234.75)
(the "Original Principal Amount"), subject to increase as provided herein, and
to pay interest from the date hereof in accordance with the terms hereunder
until this Congoleum Subordinated Promissory Note (this "Note") is paid in full
in cash, on the principal balance outstanding hereunder from time to time at the
rate of nine percent (9%) per annum. Capitalized terms used but not defined
herein shall have the meanings ascribed to them under the Joint Prepackaged Plan
of Congoleum Corporation, et. al (the "Plan").

      The obligations of the Obligor under this Note are secured by a Pledge
Agreement, dated the date hereof, by and between American Biltrite Inc. (the
"Pledgor") and the Payee (the "Pledge Agreement"), and any exercise of any
rights, powers or remedies with respect to the Pledged Stock or other collateral
specified therein shall be governed by the terms of the Pledge Agreement.

      This Note is being executed and delivered by the Obligor pursuant to the
terms of the Plan.

      1. The aggregate principal amount of this Note, along with any accrued but
unpaid interest thereon, shall be due and payable in cash on the tenth
anniversary of the date of this Note (the "Maturity Date"), unless the aggregate
principal amount owing hereunder is accelerated in connection with the
occurrence of an Event of Default, as defined below, and in accordance with the
terms of this Note. Any prepayment of principal shall be accompanied by payment
of all accrued but unpaid interest on such principal amount prepaid. The Obligor
shall make each payment required under this Note (whether principal, interest or
otherwise) not later than 5:00 PM, New York, New York time on the date when due
in immediately available funds and in lawful money of the United States of
America to an account designated in writing by the Payee sufficiently in advance
of such due date. Whenever any payment to be made under this Note shall be
stated to be due on a day that is not a Business Day, as defined below, such
payment shall be made on the next Business Day, and such extension of time shall
be included in the computation of the payment of interest. The term "Business
Day" shall mean a day which is not a Saturday, Sunday or a day on which banking
institutions are authorized or required by law to be closed in New York, New
York.

      2. The principal amount of the Note shall be subject to increase on the
Principal Adjustment Date, as defined below, in an amount, if any, by which the
Re-Measurement Value, as defined below, exceeds the Original Principal Amount.
The "Principal Adjustment Date" means the later of (a) June 30, 2005 and (b) the
last Trading Day, as defined below, of the 90 consecutive Trading Day period
commencing on the first anniversary of the Effective Date. The "Re-Measurement
Value" shall equal the product of (a) 51 % multiplied by (b) the product of (i)
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT F TO THE PLAN


the number of shares of common stock of the Obligor outstanding as of the close
of business on the Principal Adjustment Date multiplied by (ii) the average
trading prices per share of Class A common stock, par value $0.01 per share (the
"Class A Common Stock"), of the Obligor (or such other class of common stock of
the Obligor that has been registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as
amended, or the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended, and is listed for
trading on a national securities exchange in the United States, if such Class A
Common Stock is not so registered and listed) at the close of trading for the 90
consecutive Trading Days ending on the Principal Adjustment Date (as adjusted
for any stock dividends, splits or combinations, or transactions of similar
effect); provided, however, that if none of the Obligor's common stock is listed
for trading on a national securities exchange in the United States for the
relevant measurement period, the Re-Measurement Value shall equal the product of
51% multiplied by the average of the high bid and low asked prices in the
over-the-counter market, as reported by the National Association of Securities
Dealers Automated Quotation System ("NASDAQ"), per share of Class A Common Stock
(or such other class of common stock of the Obligor that is so reported, if the
Class A Common Stock is not so reported) for each Trading Day over the 90
consecutive Trading Day period ending on the Principal Adjustment Date (as
adjusted for any stock dividends, splits or combinations, or transactions of
similar effect), or if none of the Obligor's common stock is so reported for the
relevant measurement period, the Re-Measurement Value shall equal the product of
51 % multiplied by the equity valuation of the Company as of the Principal
Adjustment Date, as determined by the Board of Directors of the Obligor in good
faith. The excess, if any, by which the Re-Measurement Value exceeds the
Original Principal Amount is referred to herein as the "Additional Principal
Amount." "Trading Day" means a day on which the principal national securities
exchange on which the shares of the Obligor's common stock are listed or
admitted to trading is open for the transaction of business or, if the shares of
common stock are not listed or admitted to trading on any national securities
exchange, a Business Day.

      3. Interest shall accrue on the outstanding Original Principal Amount and
be payable in full in cash on each September 30, December 31, March 31 and June
30 after the date of this Note until the Original Principal Amount is paid in
full. Interest shall accrue beginning on the Principal Adjustment Date on the
Additional Principal Amount, and on each September 30, December 31, March 31 and
June 30 after the Principal Adjustment Date all accrued interest relating
thereto as of each such date shall be capitalized by increasing the then
outstanding Additional Principal Amount by the amount of such accrued interest;
provided, however, that upon the earlier of (a) August 1, 2008 and (b) the date
that all of the Obligor's outstanding 8 %% Senior Notes Due 2008 (the "Senior
Notes") are repaid in full (the "Accrual Termination Date"), interest accruing
on the then outstanding Additional Principal Amount (including any interest
added thereto on account of the capitalization of accrued but unpaid interest
pursuant to this Section 3) shall accrue and be payable in full in cash on each
September 30, December 31, March 31 and June 30 after the Accrual Termination
Date. Interest shall be calculated on the basis of the actual number of days the
principal is outstanding and a year of 365 days.

      4. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, the Obligor agrees and
the Payee by accepting this Note agrees that the indebtedness evidenced by this
Note is subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full
of (a) all Obligations (as such term is defined in the Credit Agreement referred
to below) under the Loan and Security Agreement, dated as of December 10, 2001,
by and between Congress Financial Corporation (the "Lender") and the Obligor, as

amended (the "Credit Agreement"), and all permitted refinancings, renewals,
extensions, amendments, modifications, restatements, replacements and refundings
of the Credit Agreement and (b) all amounts owing and payable pursuant to the
Senior Notes issued pursuant to the Indenture, dated as of August 3, 1998,
between the Obligor and Wachovia Bank, National Association (as successor to
First Union National Bank), as Trustee, as amended (the "Indenture"); provided,
however, that regularly scheduled interest payments on principal outstanding
under this Note to the extent provided hereunder may be paid by the Obligor to
the Payee so long as no default or event of default has occurred or is
continuing under the Credit Agreement (and all permitted refinancings, renewals,
extensions, amendments, modifications, restatements, replacements and refundings
of the Credit Agreement, as applicable) or the Indenture.

      5. After the Principal Adjustment Date, the Pledgor shall, in its sole
discretion, have the option of prepaying the principal of this Note, in whole
but not in part, at any time, without penalty or premium of any kind (the
"Prepayment Option"). The accrued and unpaid interest with respect to the
principal to be prepaid pursuant to the Prepayment Option is due and payable on
the date of such prepayment. Nothing contained in this Section 5 shall limit the
Pledgor's ability to cure any Event of Default pursuant to the terms of this
Note or the Pledge Agreement. The Obligor shall have no right to prepay the
principal of this Note, in whole or in part, at any time.

      6. In addition to any other rights the Pledgor may have, the Obligor shall
be obligated to repay the Pledgor any amounts paid or deemed to have been paid
to the Payee by the Pledgor pursuant to this Note or the Pledge Agreement,
including without limitation pursuant to Section 13 of this Note, any exercise
by the Pledgor of the Prepayment Option or curing an Event of Default, or upon
the Payee exercising any of its rights, powers or remedies with respect to any
Pledged Stock and other collateral pledged by the Pledgor pursuant to the Pledge
Agreement as a result of an Event of Default that remains uncured after the
applicable Cure Period, as defined below, in accordance with the terms of the
Pledge Agreement, or otherwise (a "Pledgor Payment"), as provided in this
Section 6. If the Pledgor makes any Pledgor Payment, the Pledgor shall, with
regard to each such amount, have all of the rights, privileges and protections
afforded to the Payee under this Note as if the Pledgor were a Payee. Subject to
Section 4 of this Note, the terms of which shall apply to any right of repayment
of the Pledgor with regard to a

      Pledgor Payment made by the Pledgor, as if the Pledgor were the Payee for
purposes of Section 4, the terms of such repayments shall be as follows:

            (a)   For any prepayment of this Note pursuant to the exercise of
                  the Prepayment Option by the Pledgor, amounts so paid relating
                  to

                  i.    the Original Principal Amount shall be repaid by the
                        Obligor to the Pledgor, and all such Pledgor Payments
                        made by the Pledgor (whether in the form of principal,
                        interest or otherwise) shall be deemed to be principal
                        for purposes hereof and interest shall accrue and be
                        payable thereon beginning as of the date of each such
                        Pledgor Payment in accordance with the terms of the Note

                        with regard to the Original Principal Amount and any and
                        all principal, along with any accrued but unpaid
                        interest thereon, shall be due and payable on the
                        Maturity Date, and

                  ii.   the Additional Principal Amount shall be repaid by the
                        Obligor to the Pledgor, and all such Pledgor Payments
                        made by the Pledgor (whether in the form of principal,
                        interest or otherwise) shall be deemed to be principal
                        for purposes hereof and interest shall accrue and be
                        payable thereon beginning as of the date of each such
                        Pledgor Payment in accordance with the terms of the Note
                        with regard to the Additional Principal Amount and any
                        and all principal, along with any accrued but unpaid
                        interest thereon, shall be due and payable on the
                        Maturity Date.

            (b)   For any payment or deemed payment made by the Obligor pursuant
                  to the exercise by the Payee of any of its rights, powers or
                  remedies with respect to any Pledged Stock and other
                  collateral pledged by the Pledgor pursuant to the Pledge
                  Agreement as a result of an Event or Default that remains
                  uncured after the applicable Cure Period, the Obligor's
                  repayment obligation to the Pledgor shall be immediately due
                  and payable to the Pledgor but in no event later than the
                  first Business Day following the Maturity Date (the "Repayment
                  Maturity Date").

            (c)   For any payment made by the Pledgor to cure an Event of
                  Default within the Gore Period, the Obligor's repayment
                  obligation to the Pledgor shall be immediately due and payable
                  to the Pledgor but in no event later than the Repayment
                  Maturity Date.

            (d)   For any payment made pursuant to Section 13 of this Note or
                  otherwise not covered in clauses (a), (b) or (c) of this
                  Section 6, such payment shall first be deemed to be payment of
                  Additional Principal Amount (together with any accrued but
                  unpaid interest thereon) with the excess, if any, after such
                  payment application deemed to be payment of the Original
                  Principal Amount (together with accrued but unpaid interest
                  thereon). With regard to such payment and payment allocation,
                  the Obligor shall repay the Pledgor in accordance with clause
                  (a) of this Section 6 but in no event later than the Repayment
                  Maturity Date.

            (e)   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this Note or the
                  Pledge Agreement, the Pledgor's right of repayment under this
                  Section 6 shall be subordinate and subject in right of payment
                  to the prior payment in full in cash of the obligations
                  payable under this Note by the Obligor to the Payee. Any
                  amounts received by the Pledgor from the Obligor as a
                  repayment pursuant to this Section 6 prior to the date on
                  which all outstanding obligations under this Note (whether in
                  respect of principal, interest or otherwise and other than
                  obligations owed to the Pledgor) have been paid in full in
                  cash to the Payee shall be set aside, placed and held in trust

                  and in escrow by the Pledgor and shall be payable to the Payee
                  on demand by the Payee. The Obligor shall be obligated to
                  repay the Pledgor any such amounts so paid by the Pledgor in
                  accordance with the terms of this Section 6.

            (f)   So long as any obligations under this Note (whether in respect
                  of principal, interest or otherwise and other than obligations
                  owed to the Pledgor) remain outstanding and have not been paid
                  in full in cash to the Payee (other than the Pledgor), the
                  Pledgor will not take, sue for, ask or demand from the Obligor
                  payment for any Pledgor Payment, or commence, or join with any
                  creditor other than the Payee in commencing or directly or
                  indirectly cause the Obligor to commence any dissolution,
                  winding up, total or partial liquidation, reorganization or
                  protection of the Obligor, whether voluntary or involuntary,
                  in any bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership or
                  other similar case or proceeding under any federal or state
                  bankruptcy or similar law or upon any assignment for the
                  benefit of creditors or any other marshalling of the assets
                  and liabilities of the Obligor or otherwise.

            (g)   The Obligor agrees to promptly execute and deliver a
                  promissory note substantially similar in form as this Note to
                  the Pledgor after any Pledgor Payment made by the Pledgor,
                  which note shall evidence the Pledgor's right of repayment as
                  provided under this Section 6.

7.    Covenants of the Obligor.

            (a)   From the date of this Note until the Principal Adjustment
                  Date, the Obligor agrees to the following:

                  i.    The Obligor will not issue any securities which are
                        convertible into shares of the Company's capital stock
                        at a price per share less than the Current Market Price
                        as of the date of issuance of such securities. The term
                        "Current Market Price" for any share of the Obligor's
                        capital stock on any date as used herein shall be the
                        average trading prices of such capital stock at the
                        close of trading for the twenty (20) consecutive Trading
                        Days ending on the day immediately prior to the date of
                        determination of the Current Market Price of such
                        capital stock, or if such capital stock is not listed
                        for trading on a national securities exchange in the
                        United States for the relevant measurement period, the
                        Current Market Price for such capital stock shall be the
                        average of the high bid and low asked prices in the
                        over-the-counter market, as reported by NASDAQ, or if
                        such capital stock is not so reported for the relevant
                        measurement period, the Current Market Price for such
                        capital stock shall be determined by the Board of
                        Directors of the Obligor in good faith; provided,
                        however, that with regard to shares of capital stock of
                        the Obligor sold by the Obligor pursuant to an
                        underwritten

                        offering, the tern "Current Market Price" shall mean the
                        price per share paid by the underwriter(s) to the
                        Obligor pursuant to that offering with regard to that
                        capital stock, and with regard to any securities of the
                        Obligor sold by the Obligor pursuant to an underwritten
                        offering which are convertible into shares of capital
                        stock of the Obligor, the Current Market Price for that
                        capital stock which is issuable upon conversion shall be
                        the per share price for that capital stock implied by
                        the conversion features of the convertible security as
                        of the date the Obligor sells that convertible security
                        to the underwriter(s) pursuant to that underwritten
                        offering.

                  ii.   The Obligor will not (x) increase the number of shares
                        authorized for issuance pursuant to the Obligor's 1995
                        Stock Option Plan (the "1995 Plan") or the Obligor's
                        1999 Stock Option Plan for Non-Employee Directors (the
                        "1999 Plan") or (y) issue any options exercisable for
                        shares of the Obligor's capital stock, stock

                        pursuant to the 1995 Plan or the 1999 Plan.

                  iii.  The Obligor will not issue any capital stock for less
                        than its Current Market Price as of the date of
                        issuance.

                  iv.   The Obligor will not (x) declare or pay dividends or
                        make any other distributions on its capital stock, (y)
                        effect a reverse stock split of its capital stock
                        (except in an effort to maintain the listing of its
                        shares of Class A Common Stock on the American Stock
                        Exchange pursuant to Section 7(a)v. of this Note) or (z)
                        purchase, redeem, retire or acquire any shares of its
                        capital stock, other than pursuant to a contractual
                        obligation currently in effect or in connection with the
                        acquisition of stock options from terminated employees,
                        provided, that no Event of Default has occurred or is
                        continuing or would occur as a result of giving effect
                        to such transaction.

                  v.    The Obligor will use best efforts to maintain the
                        listing of its shares of Class A Common Stock on the
                        American Stock Exchange.

            (b)   From the date of this Note until the Note is paid in full in
                  accordance herewith, the Obligor agrees to the following:

                  i.    The Obligor will deliver to the Payee, within 45 days

                        activities of the Obligor during the preceding quarter
                        has been made under the supervision of the signing
                        officer with a view to determining whether the Obligor
                        has kept, observed, performed and fulfilled each and

                        every covenant contained in this Note (including Exhibit
                        A attached hereto) and that the Obligor is not in
                        default in the performance or observance of any terns,
                        provisions and conditions of this Note.

                  ii.   The Obligor shall deliver to the Payee all financial
                        statements and other information provided to the

                        within five (5) Business Days of delivery to such senior
                        lender.

                  iii.  The Obligor will not make any payments to the Pledgor
                        pursuant to any rights of indemnity that the Pledgor may
                        have against the Obligor for claims pursuant to the Plan
                        or the Joint Venture Agreement, dated as of December 16,
                        1992, by and among the Pledgor, Resilient Holdings
                        Incorporated, the Obligor, Hillside Industries
                        Incorporated and Hillside Capital Incorporated, as
                        amended (the "Joint Venture Agreement"), until after any
                        amounts due and payable under this Note have been paid
                        in full to the Payee in accordance herewith, and until
                        such time, any such payments that would otherwise have
                        been payable to the Pledgor absent the foregoing, shall
                        be timely paid by the Obligor to the Payee and the Payee
                        shall, upon receipt of such payment, set aside, place
                        and hold in separate trust and escrow all such payments
                        (together with other payments made pursuant to Section
                        11 of this Note and this Section 7(b)iii.) solely for
                        the Pledgor's benefit (except as provided under the
                        Pledge Agreement) until paid as required by, and in the
                        manner provided in, the Pledge Agreement or as further
                        provided under the Plan and the Plan Trust Agreement.
                        Amounts set aside, placed and held in escrow and trust
                        pursuant to the foregoing shall be deemed to be pledged
                        to the Payee by the Pledgor as additional collateral
                        securing the Obligor's obligation under this Note and
                        will be subject to the terms of the Pledge Agreement.

                  iv.   The additional covenants and agreements contained in
                        Exhibit A attached hereto are hereby incorporated by
                        reference herein and are hereby made a part hereof. All
                        references to the Note include Exhibit A and the
                        provisions thereof.

8.    An "Event of Default" shall mean the occurrence of any of the following
      events:

      (a)   a default in the payment of any principal or interest under this
            Note when due and continuance of such default for a period of ten
            (l0) days;

      (b)   the occurrence of an Event of Default under the Indenture, as
            determined under the Indenture;

                                                           EXHIBIT F TO THE PLAN


      (c)   the breach by the Obligor of any covenant or agreement of the
            Obligor contained in this Note, which breach remains uncured thirty
            (30) days after notice by the Payee to the Obligor and the Pledgor
            informing the Obligor and the Pledgor of such breach, specifying
            what is claimed to have given rise to such breach; and

      (d)   a material breach of the Pledge Agreement by the Pledgor, which
            breach remains uncured thirty (30) days after notice by the Payee to
            the Pledgor and the Obligor informing the Pledgor and the Obligor of
            such breach, specifying what is claimed to have given rise to such
            breach.

      9. The Payee shall give notice of an Event of Default to the Obligor and
the Pledgor, specifying what is claimed to have given rise to the Event of
Default. The Obligor and the Pledgor shall have until the expiration of the Cure
Period to cure the Event of Default. For purposes of an Event of Default
pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Note, payment to the Payee of all principal
then outstanding under this Note together with any accrued but unpaid interest
thereon would constitute a cure of such an Event of Default. A "Cure Period"
means the period running from the date any notice of an Event of Default is
delivered in accordance hereof until the end of the tenth day following the
deemed delivery date of such notice.

      10. If there is an Event of Default pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Note
which remains uncured after the expiration of the Cure Period, the aggregate
outstanding principal amount of this Note, along with any accrued but unpaid
interest thereon, shall automatically be immediately due and payable, and the
Payee may exercise any rights or remedies permitted under this Note, the Pledge
Agreement, or applicable law as a result. If there is an Event of Default other
than pursuant to Section 8(b) of this Note which remains uncured after the
expiration of the Cure Period, the Payee may, upon notice to the Obligor and the
Pledgor, declare the aggregate outstanding principal amount of this Note, along
with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon, to be immediately due and payable,
and exercise any rights or remedies permitted under this Note, the Pledge
Agreement, or applicable law. In connection with the foregoing, except as
otherwise set forth herein or in the Pledge Agreement, the Obligor waives notice
of intent to demand, demand, presentment for payment, notice of nonpayment,
protest, notice of protest, grace, notice of dishonor, notice of intent to
accelerate and all other notices.

      11. The Obligor agrees that any amounts that the Payee would be obligated
to pay to the Pledgor pursuant to any rights of indemnity that the Pledgor may
have against the Payee for asbestos-related claims pursuant to the Joint Venture
Agreement or the Plan will not be made by the Payee until after any amounts due
and payable under this Note have been paid in full to the Payee, and until such
time, any such payments that would otherwise have been payable to the Pledgor
absent the foregoing, shall be set aside, placed, and held in separate trust and
in escrow (together with other payments made pursuant to Section 7(b)iii. of
this Note and this Section 11) by the Payee for the Pledgor's sole benefit
(except as provided under the Pledge Agreement) until paid or distributed as
required by, and in the manner provided in, the Pledge Agreement or as further
provided under the Plan and the Plan Trust Agreement. Amounts set aside, placed
and held in escrow and trust pursuant to the foregoing shall be deemed to be
pledged to the Payee by the Pledgor as additional collateral securing the
Obligor's obligations under this Note, and will be subject to the terms of the
Pledge Agreement.

      12. To the extent required by applicable tax law, if the Payee fails to
comply with certain certification procedures or otherwise establish an exemption
from withholding, the Obligor or the Pledgor (as the case may be) shall be
entitled to deduct and withhold from any payments made with regard to principal
of or interest on the Note hereunder to the Payee such amounts as may be
required to be withheld. To the extent that amounts are so withheld by the
Obligor or the Pledgor (as the case may be), (i) such withheld amounts shall be
treated for all purposes of this Note as having been paid to the Payee in
respect of which such deduction and withholding was made by the Obligor or the
Pledgor (as the case may be), (ii) the Obligor or the Pledgor (as the case may
be) shall timely pay to the applicable taxing authority the amount so withheld
and (iii) the Obligor or the Pledgor (as the case may be) shall promptly provide
to the Payee evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Payee of such payment.

      13. The Obligor may not assign any of its rights or delegate any of its
duties under this Note. At no time prior to the Principal Adjustment Date may
the Payee assign this Note or any part thereof. After the Principal Adjustment
Date, the Payee may assign, in whole but not in part, this Note. The Payee shall
give the Obligor and the Pledgor not less than ten (10) days notice of an
intended assignment by the Payee of this Note, including the identity and notice
information pertaining to the assignee of such intended assignment. If the Payee
assigns this Note, all amounts held in trust and escrow for the Pledgor's
benefit pursuant to Sections 7(b)iii. and 11 of this Note shall as of the date
of such assignment be released and shall be paid and distributed in accordance
with the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Plan and the Plan Trust Agreement.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, or in the Pledge Agreement, the
Plan or the Plan Trust Agreement to the contrary, as of the date of any
assignment of this Note by the Plan Trust, the covenants and agreements under
Sections 7(b)iii. and 11 of this Note regarding the payment into, setting aside,
placement and holding in trust and in escrow of amounts that would otherwise be
payable to the Pledgor pursuant to the Pledgor's rights of indemnity under the
Plan or the Joint Venture Agreement, and any pledging of such amounts as
collateral securing the Obligor's obligations hereunder, shall be void and be of
no further force or effect, and from that time any amounts that would be payable
to the Pledgor pursuant to the Pledgor's rights of indemnity under the Plan or
the Joint Venture Agreement will be payable directly to the Pledgor pursuant to
the terms of the Pledge Agreement, the Plan, the Joint Venture Agreement and the
Plan Trust Documents. The term "Payee" as used in this Note (including Exhibit A
hereto) shall include any assignee of the Payee.

      14. With respect to claims under this Note, the Payee and the Obligor
hereby irrevocably (i) submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the Bankruptcy
Court, provided that to the extent that the Bankruptcy Court is not permitted
under applicable law to exercise jurisdiction with respect to the matter in
question, then the Payee and the Obligor hereby submit to the exclusive
jurisdiction of the federal and state courts in the State of [Delaware] and (ii)
agree that any and all claims in respect of such action, suit or proceeding may
be heard and determined in any such court.

      15. The Obligor shall pay to the Payee the reasonable costs incurred by
the Payee (including reasonable attorney's fees) pursuant to the Payee's
enforcement of the rights afforded to it hereunder.

                           Purpose and Interpretation

2.1. Submission of All Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims. All Plan Trust PI Asbestos
Claims (other than ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims) shall be
submitted to the Plan Trust in accordance with the TDP, and the TDP shall
constitute the sole and exclusive method by which the holder of such claim
against the Plan Trust or any Protected Party may pursue such claim. All ABI
Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims shall be determined and liquidated
pursuant to the procedures set forth in the Plan and the Liquidated Value
thereof shall be paid by the Plan Trust in accordance with the Plan, the TDP,
and the Plan Trust Agreement, and the procedures set forth in the Plan shall
constitute the sole and exclusive method by which the holder of such claims
against the Plan Trust or any Protected Party may pursue such claims. Plan Trust
PI Asbestos Claims liquidated prior to the Effective Date shall be payable by
the Plan Trust in accordance with the Plan and the TDP. TDP Valued Asbestos
Claims shall be liquidated by the Plan Trust after the Effective Date in
accordance with the TDP and shall be payable by the Plan Trust in accordance
with the TDP.

2.2. Purpose. The TDP is adopted pursuant to the Plan Trust Agreement. The TDP
is designed to provide prompt determination of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims, to
provide prompt payment of all Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims and to
provide reasonable assurance that the Plan Trust will value and be in a
financial position to pay similar Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims in substantially
the same manner. The TDP provides for (i) processing, liquidating, determining
allowance and paying, if Allowed, all TDP Valued Asbestos Claims, including the
future TDP Valued Asbestos Claims and Demands of holders of TDP Valued Asbestos
Claims, (ii) paying and satisfying all Settled Claims (including the Unsecured
PI Asbestos Claims contained therein), which were determined and liquidated
pursuant to the Claimant Agreement or a Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement, as
applicable, as provided in and required by the Plan, and (iii) paying all
Allowed ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims, which were determined and
liquidated pursuant to the Plan. The TDP shall not apply to any Asbestos
Property Damage Claims. The Plan Trustees shall implement and administer the TDP
in accordance with the Plan Trust Agreement.

2.3. Interpretation. Nothing in the TDP shall be deemed to create a substantive
right for any holder of a Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim. The TDP is procedural
and may be amended, deleted, or added to pursuant to the terms of the Plan Trust
Agreement and the TDP.

2.4. General Principles. The formation of the Plan Trust is premised upon the
overarching goal of the Reorganization Cases, which is to maximize the amount
paid to each holder of an Allowed Plan Trust Asbestos Claim, including each
holder of an Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim. Simultaneously, the Plan
Trustees must act in a manner designed to provide substantially the same
treatment to each holder of similar Plan Trust Asbestos Claims, including
holders of Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims. In order to aid the Plan
Trustees, the following general principles shall guide their decisions and
actions:

      (a) The Plan Trustees shall favor negotiated or mediated settlement over
arbitration or another form of binding alternative dispute resolution,
arbitration or another form of binding alternative dispute resolution over
resort to the tort system, and fair and efficient resolution of Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claims in all cases, while endeavoring to preserve and enhance the Plan
Trust Assets.

      (b) The Plan Trustees shall employ mechanisms such as the review of
estimates of the numbers and values of Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims, or other
comparable mechanisms, that provide reasonable assurance that the Plan Trust
will value, and be in a financial position to pay, Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims
that involve similar Claims in substantially the same manner.

      (c) The Plan Trustees shall pay the Settled Claims and the ABI Asbestos
Personal Injury Indemnification Claims in accordance with the provisions of the
Plan, the TDP and the Collateral Trust Agreement, as applicable.

      (d) There is inherent uncertainty regarding the Debtors' total liabilities
to holders of Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims as well as the total value
of the Plan Trust Assets available to pay Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims.
Without the benefit of the TDP, there is inherent uncertainty as to whether
similar amounts would be paid in respect of all similar present and future
Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims. The Plan Trustees will make
determinations and predictions about the amount and timing of the receipt of
Plan Trust Assets and the proceeds thereof, as well as determinations and
predictions about the amount and timing of payment of, and cost of processing,
Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims. The determination of the Payment Percentage shall
be based, on the one hand, upon estimates of the number, types, and amounts of
present and expected future Unsecured PI Asbestos Claims and, on the other hand,
on the value of the Plan Trust Assets then available to pay Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claims, the Plan Trust's anticipated expenses, as well as other
material matters that are reasonable and likely to affect the sufficiency of
funds to pay a comparable percentage of full value to all holders of Unsecured
PI Asbestos Claims. When making these determinations, the Plan Trustees shall
recognize that both present and future holders of Unsecured PI Asbestos Claims
bear a risk that the determinations will be incorrect, either too low or too
high. In making determinations, the Plan Trustees shall not prefer either
present or future holders of Unsecured PI Asbestos Claims by giving either group
greater protection from such risks. Rather, the Plan Trustees shall make
determinations based on their best estimates of total Plan Trust Assets
available for the payment of Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims, the Unsecured PI
Asbestos Claims, the Plan Trust Expenses, and related matters. The Plan Trustees
will properly discharge their duties in this regard, and be protected from
liability, by making reasonable determinations in light of the current
information available at the time.

              Security and Payment of Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims

3.1. Secured Asbestos Claims. (a) The Secured Asbestos Claim of each Qualified
Pre-Petition Settlement Claimant holding a Class 2 Claim shall be fully secured
and shall be paid as provided in Sections 3.2(a) and 3.2(d)below.

      (b) The Secured Asbestos Claim of each Qualified Participating Claimant
shall be equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of such Qualified Participating
Claimant's Liquidated Value determined pursuant to the Claimant Agreement and
shall be paid in three parts as provided in Sections 3.2(b), (d) and (e)(i)
below.

3.2. Payment of Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims. The Plan Trust shall pay
the Allowed Amount of Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims as follows (and in the
following order):

      (a) First, holders of Class 2 Claims shall be paid the greater of (i)
$200,000 and (ii) 50% of the applicable Liquidated Value specified in the
certification provided by the Collateral Trustee or its designee pursuant to the
Plan (less all amounts in respect thereof previously received by the holder
thereof from any Debtor, the Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor
trust) of their Class 2 Claims (unless such Liquidated Value is less than
$200,000, in which case such holder shall be paid, in full satisfaction of such
Class 2 Claim, the applicable Liquidated Value specified in the certification
provided by the Collateral Trustee or its designee pursuant to the Plan (less
all amounts in respect thereof previously received by the holder thereof from
any Debtor, the Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor trust)). Such
payments shall be made out of the first $75 million ($75,000,000) of proceeds of
Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries, net of any payment of or reserve for Plan
Trust Expenses and any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in
accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement (such net proceeds are
referred to as the "First Proceeds"), prior to all other Allowed Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claims (including the Secured Asbestos Claims of the Qualified
Participating Claimants) but not prior to payment of or reserve for Plan Trust
Expenses nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in
accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement. Class 2 Claims shall be
paid in the order in which the holders of such Class 2 Claims became Qualified
Pre-Petition Settlement Claimants under the Collateral Trust Agreement.

      (b) Second, the Plan Trust shall pay subsequent distributions out of the
First Proceeds to Qualified Participating Claimants on a pro-rata basis,
determined by multiplying the aggregate amount of each distribution to be made
in respect of this clause (b) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the applicable Qualified Participating Claimant's Secured Asbestos
Claim and the denominator of which is the total of all Qualified Participating
Claimants' Secured Asbestos Claims; provided that the aggregate of all
distributions made under this clause (b) to a Qualified Participating Claimant
shall not exceed such Qualified Participating Claimant's Secured Asbestos Claim
(less all amounts in respect thereof previously received by the holder thereof
from any Debtor, the Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor trust);
provided, further, that such distributions shall not be prior to payment of or
reserve for Plan Trust Expenses nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for
Coverage Costs in accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement.

      (c) Third, the next $50 million ($50,000,000) of proceeds of Asbestos
Insurance Action Recoveries following the First Proceeds, net of any payment of
or reserve for Plan Trust Expenses and any payment of or reimbursement for
Coverage Costs in accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement (such
net proceeds are referred to as the "Second Proceeds"), shall be paid to the
holders of Payment Percentage Claims in accordance with the TDP; provided that
such distributions shall not be prior to payment of or reserve for Plan Trust
Expenses nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in
accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement.

      (d) Fourth, the next $50 million ($50,000,000) of proceeds of Asbestos
Insurance Action Recoveries following the First Proceeds and the Second
Proceeds, net of any payment of or reserve for Plan Trust Expenses and any
payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in accordance with the terms of
the Plan Trust Agreement (such net proceeds are referred to as the "Third
Proceeds"), shall be allocated exclusively to the payment of any unpaid Class 2
Claims (that is, the Liquidated Value of such Class 2 Claims less all amounts in
respect thereof previously received by the holder thereof from any Debtor, the
Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor trust); provided that such
distributions shall not be prior to payment of or reserve for Plan Trust
Expenses nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in
accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement. Such Class 2 Claims shall
be paid in the order in which such holders thereof became Qualified Pre-Petition
Settlement Claimants under the Collateral Trust Agreement. Following payment in
full of the Class 2 Claims, the Plan Trust shall pay subsequent distributions
out of the Third Proceeds to Qualified Participating Claimants on a pro-rata
basis, determined by multiplying the aggregate amount of each distribution to be
made in respect of this clause (d) by a fraction, the numerator of which is the
amount of the applicable Qualified Participating Claimant's Secured Asbestos
Claim and the denominator of which is the total of all Qualified Participating
Claimants' Secured Asbestos Claims; provided that the aggregate of all
distributions made under this clause (d) to a Qualified Participating Claimant
shall not exceed such Qualified Participating Claimant's Secured Asbestos Claim
(less all amounts in respect thereof previously received by the holder thereof
from any Debtor, the Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor trust);
provided, further, that such distributions shall not be prior to payment of or
reserve for Plan Trust Expenses nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for
Coverage Costs in accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement.

      (e) Fifth, any proceeds of Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries in excess
of the Third Proceeds, net of any payment of or reserve for Plan Trust Expenses
and any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in accordance with the
terms of the Plan Trust Agreement, shall be distributed as follows, provided
that such distributions shall not be prior to payment of or reserve for Plan
Trust Expenses nor prior to payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in
accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement:

            (i) Fifty percent (50%) to Qualified Participating Claimants on a
pro rata basis, determined by multiplying the aggregate amount of the
distribution to be made by a fraction, the numerator of which is the applicable
Qualified Participating Claimant's Secured Asbestos Claim and the denominator of
which is the total of all Qualified Participating Claimants' Secured Asbestos
Claims; provided the aggregate of all distributions made under this clause
(e)(i) to a Qualified Participating Claimant shall not exceed such Qualified

Participating Claimant's Secured Asbestos Claim (less all amounts in respect
thereof previously received by the holder thereof from any Debtor, the
Collateral Trust, the Plan Trust or any successor trust); and

            (ii) Fifty percent (50%) to Payment Percentage Claims in accordance
with the TDP.

      (f) Following payment in full of the Secured Asbestos Claims of the
Qualified Participating Claimants, the Plan Trust shall pay 100% of the proceeds
of any Asbestos Insurance Action Recoveries, net of any payment of or reserve
for Plan Trust Expenses and any payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs
in accordance with the terms of the Plan Trust Agreement, to the Payment
Percentage Claims in accordance with the TDP, provided that such distributions
shall not be prior to payment of or reserve for Plan Trust Expenses nor prior to
payment of or reimbursement for Coverage Costs in accordance with the terms of
the Plan Trust Agreement.

3.3. Payment of the Claims Handling Fee. Notwithstanding any other provision
contained in the TDP, the holder of the Claim for the Claims Handling Fee shall
be paid as provided in the Plan Trust Agreement.

3.4.  Other Provisions.

      (a) Payments to holders of Allowed Secured Asbestos Claims shall be made
solely from the Asbestos Personal Injury Sub-Account.

      (b) The Plan Trustees, after consultation with the TAC and the Futures
Representative, shall determine the timing and the appropriate method for making
payments in respect of Allowed Secured Asbestos Claims under this Section III,
subject to the requirements and general principles of the TDP. Methods for
making payments in respect of Allowed Secured Asbestos Claims may include
payment on an installment basis. In the event that the Plan Trust faces periods
of limited liquidity, the Plan Trustees may defer, delay, limit, or suspend
altogether, payments or a portion thereof in respect of Allowed Secured Asbestos
Claims.

      (c) Consistent with the provisions hereof, the Plan Trustees shall
commence the payment of Allowed Secured Asbestos Claims as promptly as possible,
and the Plan Trust shall make payments to holders of Allowed Secured Asbestos
Claims promptly as funds become available for the payment thereof.

      (d) A holder of an Allowed Secured Asbestos Claim who receives payment for
a nonmalignant disease shall execute and deliver to the Plan Trustees a limited
written release in a form satisfactory to the Plan Trustees, after consultation
with the TAC and the Futures Representative, and may thereafter file a new TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim for an asbestos- related malignancy that is subsequently
diagnosed, which claims shall be processed as a new TDP Valued Asbestos Claim
pursuant to the terms of Section V. Any additional payments to which such
claimant may be entitled shall not be reduced by the amount of the prior payment
for a nonmalignant disease.

                                  SECTION IV.
                      Payment of Payment Percentage Claims

4.1.  Payment Percentage.

      (a) The Plan Trustees shall, in a manner consistent with the provisions of
Section II of the TDP, determine the Payment Percentage of the Liquidated Value
that will be paid to holders of Payment Percentage Claims. The Initial Payment
Percentage shall be determined by the Plan Trustees with the consent of the TAC
and the Futures Representative as soon as practicable following the Effective
Date. Thereafter, the Payment Percentage shall be reviewed no less frequently
than once every two years. Because of the increased uncertainty during the
initial period of the Plan Trust's operation, the Initial Payment Percentage is
particularly susceptible to review and modification as the Plan Trust
accumulates necessary and relevant data. The Plan Trustees shall not change the
Payment Percentage without the consent of the TAC and the Futures
Representative.

      (b) If a redetermination of the Payment Percentage has been proposed in
writing by the Plan Trustees to the TAC and the Futures Representative but has
not yet been adopted, the claimant shall receive the lower of the current
Payment Percentage or the proposed Payment Percentage. However, if the proposed
Payment Percentage was the lower amount but was not subsequently adopted, the
claimant shall thereafter receive the difference between the lower proposed
amount and the higher current amount. Conversely, if the proposed Payment
Percentage was the higher amount and was subsequently adopted, the claimant
shall thereafter receive the difference between the lower current amount and the
higher adopted amount.

      (c) If the Payment Percentage has been increased, the Plan Trustees are
not required to, but may, with the consent of the TAC and the Futures
Representative, make supplemental payments to claimants who previously
liquidated their Allowed Unsecured PI Asbestos Claims against the Plan Trust and
received payments for such claims based on a lower Payment Percentage, provided,
however, that the Plan Trustees first shall have determined that the benefit of
making any such supplemental payments to the relevant claimants is greater than
the administrative costs associated with making any such payments and shall take
into account all other factors that the Plan Trustees consider relevant for such
decision. The amount of any such supplemental payment to the respective holder
of an Allowed Unsecured PI Asbestos Claim shall be the Liquidated Value of such
holder's Allowed Unsecured PI Asbestos Claim multiplied by the newly adjusted
Payment Percentage, less all amounts previously paid in respect of such claim.
The timing, order and method of all such supplemental payments shall be
determined by the Plan Trustees in a manner consistent with the principles of
this TDP.

4.2.  Payment of Payment Percentage Claims.

      (a) Each holder of a Payment Percentage Claim shall be paid an amount in
respect of such Payment Percentage Claim determined by multiplying (a) the
Payment Percentage in effect on the date of payment by (b) the Liquidated Value
of such Payment Percentage Claim, and upon payment of such amount in full,
notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, such holder shall not be
entitled to any further payment in respect of such holder's Payment Percentage
Claim. The Secured Asbestos Claims shall not be subject to the Payment

<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


Percentage and such secured portions shall be paid in accordance with the Plan
and Section III of the TDP. The Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and
the Futures Representative, shall determine the timing and the appropriate
method for making payments in respect of Payment Percentage Claims, subject to
the requirements and general principles of the TDP, including but not limited to
this Section IV. Methods for making payments in respect of Payment Percentage
Claims may include payment on an installment basis.

      (b) Payments to holders of Payment Percentage Claims shall be made solely
from the Asbestos Personal Injury Sub-Account.

      (c) Notwithstanding any provision in the TDP to the contrary, all amounts
to be distributed in respect of Allowed ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity
Claims shall be held by the Plan Trust as provided in Section 4.1(d) of the Plan
Trust Agreement, and shall be paid and distributed by the Plan Trust in
accordance with the Plan Trust Agreement.

      (d) In the event that the Plan Trust faces periods of limited liquidity,
the Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and the Futures Representative,
may defer, delay, limit, or suspend altogether, payments or a portion thereof in
respect of Payment Percentage Claims.

      (e) In the event that the Plan Trustees conclude that the use of the
Payment Percentage in effect at a particular point in time will unfairly
adversely affect the interests of future holders of Payment Percentage Claims or
present holders of Payment Percentage Claims who have not yet been paid, the
Plan Trustees may suspend payments pending a redetermination of the Payment
Percentage pursuant to Section 4.1 hereof. The Payment Percentage, as
redetermined, shall be the Payment Percentage applicable to all unpaid Payment
Percentage Claims. Consistent with the provisions hereof, the Plan Trustees
shall commence the payment of Payment Percentage Claims as promptly as possible,
and the Plan Trustees shall make payments to holders of Payment Percentage
Claims promptly as funds become available for the payment thereof, while
maintaining sufficient resources to pay future Payment Percentage Claims in
substantially the same manner as present Payment Percentage Claims. Because
decisions about payments must be based on estimates and cannot be made
precisely, such decisions may have to be revised in light of experience over
time, and the holder of a Payment Percentage Claim who receives payment early in
the life of the Plan Trust may receive a smaller or larger percentage of the
Allowed Amount of such holder's Payment Percentage Claim than a claimant who
receives payment in the middle of or late in the life of the Plan Trust.
Therefore, there can be no guarantee of any specific level of payment to holders
of Payment Percentage Claims. A reduction of the Payment Percentage shall not
create any refund obligation for those holders of Payment Percentage Claims
previously paid, and an increase of the Payment Percentage shall not create any
right for additional payment for those holders of Payment Percentage Claims
previously paid. Nevertheless, the Plan Trustees shall use their best efforts to
treat similar Payment Percentage Claims in a substantially equivalent manner,
consistent with their duties as Plan Trustees in these circumstances and the
purposes of the Plan Trust, and given the practical limitations imposed by the
inability to predict the future with precision.

      (f) Where the claimant is deceased or incompetent, and the settlement and
payment of his or her claim must be approved by a court of competent
jurisdiction or through a probate process prior to acceptance of the settlement
offer by the Plan Trust made in respect of such claim by the claimant's


                                       12
<PAGE>

representative, such settlement offer shall remain open so long as proceedings
before such court or in such probate process remain pending, provided that the
Plan Trust has been furnished with evidence that such settlement offer has been
submitted to such court or probate process for approval. If such settlement
offer is ultimately approved by the court or through the probate process and
accepted by such claimant's representative, the Plan Trust shall pay such claim
in the amount so offered, multiplied by the Payment Percentage in effect at the
time the offer was first made.

4.3. Order of Payment of Payment Percentage Claims. Payment Percentage Claims
shall be paid in FIFO order based on the date their liquidation became final
(the "FIFO Payment Queue"). If any claims are liquidated on the same date, each
such claimant's position in the FIFO Payment Queue shall be determined by the
date of diagnosis of such claimant's (or the underlying claimant's, as
applicable) asbestos-related disease, with earlier diagnosis dates given
priority over later diagnosis dates. If any claims are liquidated on the same
date and the respective claimants' asbestos-related diseases were diagnosed on
the same date, the position of those claims in the FIFO Payment Queue shall be
further determined by the dates of the claimants' (or the underlying claimants',
as applicable) birth, with older claimants given priority over the younger
claimants.

4.4   Payment of Settled Claims.

      (a) Notwithstanding any provision of the TDP to the contrary, no holder of
a Settled Claim shall be paid any amount in respect of his or her Unsecured PI
Asbestos Claim by the Plan Trust except in accordance with this Section 4.4.

      (b) The Plan Trust shall not be authorized to pay a particular holder of a
Settled Claim in respect of his or her Unsecured PI Asbestos Claim until such
time as such holder's Prepetition Payment Percentage is then equal to or less
than the then-current Payment Percentage.

      (c) At such time as the Plan Trust is authorized pursuant to this Section
4.4 to make payments to a particular holder of a Settled Claim in respect of
such holder's Unsecured PI Asbestos Claim, such holder's Unsecured PI Asbestos
Claim shall be entered into the FIFO Payment Queue in accordance with the
principles set forth in Section 4.3 and shall be paid in accordance with the
other applicable provisions of this TDP. If the Payment Percentage is reduced
below a particular holder's Prepetition Payment Percentage at any time, the Plan
Trust shall suspend all payments in respect of such holder's Unsecured PI
Asbestos Claim until such time as the conditions to payment set forth in this
Section 4.4 are again satisfied. The amount of any payment made to a particular
holder of a Settled Claim's Unsecured PI Asbestos Claim by the Plan Trust shall
be calculated by multiplying the Liquidated Value of such holder's Unsecured PI
Asbestos Claim by a percentage which equals the then-applicable Payment
Percentage less such holder's Prepetition Payment Percentage.

                                   SECTION V.
         Determination of Liquidated Value of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims

5.1.  Review of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims.

      (a) Purpose. Upon filing a proof of claim along with the required
supporting documentation, each holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim shall have
his or her TDP Valued Asbestos Claim reviewed by the Plan Trust using either the
Expedited Review Process or the Individual Review Process, each as described
below. The review processes for TDP Valued Asbestos Claims provide the holder
thereof with a consideration and evaluation of his or her TDP Valued Asbestos
Claim and is intended to result in payments equal to the Liquidated Value for
each Allowed TDP Valued Asbestos Claim multiplied by the then applicable Payment
Percentage, subject to the Plan Trustees' power to change such Payment
Percentage as set forth herein.

      (b) Ordering of Processing of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims.

            (i) Establishment of the FIFO Processing Queue.

                  (1) The Plan Trust will order TDP Valued Asbestos Claims that
are sufficiently complete to be reviewed for processing purposes on a FIFO basis
except as otherwise provided herein (the "FIFO Processing Queue"). For all
claims filed on or before the date six months after the Effective Date (the
"Initial Claims Filing Date"), a claimant's position in the FIFO Processing
Queue shall be determined as of the earlier of (i) the date prior to the
Petition Date that the specific claim was either filed against a Debtor in the
tort system or was actually submitted to a Debtor pursuant to a settlement
agreement; (ii) the date before the Petition Date that a claim was filed against
another defendant in the tort system if at the time the claim was subject to a
tolling agreement with a Debtor; (iii) the date after the Petition Date but
before the Effective Date that the claim was filed against another defendant in
the tort system; (iv) the date after the Petition Date but before the Effective
Date that a proof of claim was filed against a Debtor in the Reorganization
Cases; (v) the date a ballot was submitted in the Reorganization Cases for
purposes of voting on the Plan in accordance with the voting procedures adopted
by the Bankruptcy Court; or (vi) the date after the Effective Date but on or
before the Initial Claims Filing Date that the claim was filed with the Plan
Trust.

                  (2) Following the Initial Claims Filing Date, a claimant's
position in the FIFO Processing Queue will be determined by the date of receipt
by the Plan Trust of an acceptable claim form. If any claims are filed on the
same date, the claimant's position in the FIFO Processing Queue shall be further
determined by the date of diagnosis of the asbestos-related disease, with
earlier diagnosis dates given priority over later diagnosis dates. If any claims
are filed and diagnosed on the same date, the claimants' position in the FIFO
Processing Queue shall be further determined by the claimants' date of birth,
with older claimants given priority over younger claimants. Notwithstanding the
FIFO Processing Queue, the Plan Trustees shall have the right to establish
appropriate procedures to evaluate TDP Valued Asbestos Claims which constitute
Extraordinary TDP Valued Asbestos Claims or Exigent Hardship Claims.

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


                  (3) The Plan Trust shall review its claims files on a regular
basis and provide each claimant with notice at least six months in advance of
the date on which it expects to reach such claimant's TDP Valued Asbestos Claim
in the FIFO Processing Queue. Following such notice such claimant shall promptly
(A) advise the Plan Trust whether such claimant's TDP Valued Asbestos Claim
should be liquidated under the Expedited Review Process or under the Individual
Review Process; (B) provide the Plan Trust with any additional medical and/or
exposure evidence that was not provided with the original submission of such
claimant's proof of claim form; and (C) advise the Plan Trust of any change in
such claimant's Disease Category. If a claimant fails to respond to the Plan
Trust's notice prior to the Plan Trust reaching such claimant's TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim in the FIFO Processing Queue, the Plan Trust will process and
liquidate such TDP Valued Asbestos Claim under the Expedited Review Process
based on the medical and or exposure evidence submitted by such claimant with
his or her proof of claim form, provided that such claimant shall retain the
right to request review in the Individual Review Process.

            (ii) Effect of Statutes of Limitations and Repose.

                  (1) To be eligible for a place in the FIFO Processing Queue, a
TDP Valued Asbestos Claim must meet either (A) for claims first filed in the
tort system against a Debtor prior to the Petition Date, the applicable federal,
state and foreign statute of limitation and repose that was in effect at the
time of the filing of the claim in the tort system, or (B) for claims that were
not filed against a Debtor in the tort system prior to the Petition Date, the
applicable statute of limitation that was in effect at the time of the filing
with the Plan Trust. However, the running of the relevant statute of limitation
shall be tolled as of the earliest of (I) the actual filing of the claim against
a Debtor prior to the Petition Date, whether in the tort system or by submission
of the claim to a Debtor pursuant to a settlement agreement; (II) the filing of
the claim against another defendant in the tort system prior to the Petition
Date if the claim was tolled against a Debtor at the time by an agreement or
otherwise; (III) the filing of a claim after the Petition Date but prior to the
Effective Date against another defendant in the tort system; (IV) the date after
the Petition Date but before the Effective Date that a proof of claim was filed
against a Debtor in the Reorganization Cases; (V) the date a ballot was
submitted in the Reorganization Cases for purposes of voting on the Plan in
accordance with the voting procedures adopted by the Bankruptcy Court; or (VI)
the filing of a proof of claim with the requisite supporting documentation with
the Plan Trust after the Effective Date.

                  (2) If a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim meets any of the tolling
provisions described in Section 5.1(b)(ii)(1) and the claim was not barred by
the applicable statute of limitation at the time of the tolling event, it will
be treated as timely filed if it is actually filed with the Plan Trust within
three (3) years after the Effective Date. In addition, any claims that were
first diagnosed after the Petition Date, irrespective of the application of any
relevant statute of limitation or repose, may be filed with the Plan Trust
within three (3) years after the date of diagnosis or within three (3) years
after the Effective Date, whichever occurs later. Notwithstanding the forgoing,
the processing of any TDP Valued Asbestos Claim may be deferred at the election
of the claimant pursuant to Section 7.4.

      (c) Expedited Review Process.

            (i) The expedited review process for TDP Valued Asbestos Claims (the
"Expedited Review Process") is designed primarily to provide an expeditious,
efficient and inexpensive method for liquidating all claims where the claim can
easily be verified by the Plan Trust as meeting the Exposure Evidence and the
Medical Criteria for the relevant Disease Category. The Expedited Review Process
thus provides claimants with a substantially less burdensome process for
pursuing TDP Valued Asbestos Claims than does the Individual Review Process. The
Expedited Review Process is also intended to provide qualifying claimants a
fixed and certain claims payment. Claims that undergo the Expedited Review
Process and meet the Exposure Evidence and the Medical Criteria for the relevant
Disease Category shall be liquidated at the Scheduled Value for such Disease
Category.

            (ii) All claimants seeking liquidation of their claims pursuant to
the Expedited Review Process shall file a proof of claim form provided by the
Plan Trust. As a proof of claim form is reached in the FIFO Processing Queue,
the Plan Trust shall determine whether the claim described therein meets the
Exposure Evidence and the Medical Criteria for one of the Disease Categories,
and shall advise the claimant of its determination. If a Disease Category is
determined, the Plan Trust shall tender to the claimant an offer of payment of
the Scheduled Value for the relevant Disease Category multiplied by the
applicable Payment Percentage, together with a form of release approved by the
Plan Trust. If the claimant accepts the Scheduled Value and returns the release
properly executed, the claim shall be placed in the FIFO Payment Queue,
following which the Plan Trust shall disburse payment subject to the limitations
of the Payment Percentage and the other terms of the TDP.

      (d) Individual Review Process.

            (i) A holder of (1) a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim in the Mesothelioma
Disease Category, (2) an Extraordinary Claim in the Lung Cancer, Other Cancer or
Level II Non-Malignant Disease Category, or (3) a secondary exposure claim as
set forth in Section 5.1(j), may request that the Plan Trust individually
consider and review such claimant's claim (the "Individual Review Process"). In
such a case, if the Plan Trust is satisfied that the claimant has presented a
claim that would be cognizable and valid in the tort system, the Plan Trust may
offer such claimant a liquidated value up to the Maximum Amount. The Liquidated
Value of any TDP Valued Asbestos Claim that undergoes the Individual Review
Process may be determined to be less than the Scheduled Value the claimant may
have otherwise received in the Expedited Review Process. Because the detailed
examination and valuation process pursuant to Individual Review Process requires
substantial time and effort, claimants electing to undergo the Individual Review
Process will ordinarily be paid the Liquidated Value of their TDP Valued
Asbestos Claims later than would have been the case had the claimant elected the
Expedited Review Process.

            (ii) The Plan Trust shall liquidate the value of each TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim that undergoes Individual Review Process based on the historic
liquidated values of other similarly situated claims in the tort system for the
same Disease Category. The Plan Trust will thus take into consideration all of
the factors that affect the severity of damages and values within the tort
system including, but not limited to (i) the degree to which the characteristics


                                       16
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


of a claim differ from the Exposure Evidence and the Medical Criteria for the
Disease Category in question; (ii) factors such as the claimant's age,
disability, employment status, disruption of household, family or recreational
activities, dependencies, special damages, and pain and suffering; (iii)
evidence that the claimant's damages were (or were not) caused by asbestos
exposure, including exposure to an asbestos-containing product for which a
Debtor has legal responsibility (for example, alternative causes, and the
strength of documentation of injuries); (iv) the industry of exposure; and (v)
settlements, verdicts, and the claimant's and other law firms' experience in the
Claimant's Jurisdiction for similarly situated claims.

            (iii) The Plan Trust shall use reasonable efforts to ensure that the
average Liquidated Value of all TDP Valued Asbestos Claims in each Disease
Category determined pursuant to the Individual Review Process (determined for
each Disease Category by dividing (x) the aggregate of Liquidated Value for all
TDP Valued Asbestos Claims in such Disease Category which have been liquidated
in the Individual Review process during prior twelve (12) month period by (y)
the aggregate number of such Claims in each such Disease Category liquidated in
such twelve (12) month period) (the " Actual Average") does not exceed the
Average Value; provided; however, that, for any or all of the relevant Disease
Categories, the Actual Average for any Disease Category may be less than the
Average Value specified for such Disease Category.

            (iv) The Plan Trust shall administer the Individual Review Process
so that Individual Review Process does not reduce payments to claimants electing
the Scheduled Value for such TDP Valued Asbestos Claims under the Expedited
Review Process, which administration may include limiting the number of claims
reviewed each year in the Individual Review Process and/or limiting the amount
of distributions to claims reviewed in the Individual Review Process.

            (v) The liquidated value of Foreign Claims shall be established
pursuant to the Plan Trust's Individual Review Process. Because TDP Valued
Asbestos Claims of individuals exposed in Canada who were resident in Canada
when such claims were filed were routinely litigated and resolved in the courts
of the United States, and because the resolution history of these claims has
been included in developing the Expedited Review Process, such claims shall not
be considered Foreign Claims hereunder and shall be eligible for liquidation
under the Expedited Review Process. Accordingly, a "Foreign Claim" is a TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim with respect to which the claimant's exposure to an
asbestos-containing product for which a Debtor has legal responsibility occurred
outside of the United States and its territories and possessions, and outside of
the provinces and territories of Canada.

            In reviewing Foreign Claims, the Plan Trust shall take into account
all relevant procedural and substantive legal rules to which the claims would be
subject in the Claimant's Jurisdiction. The Plan Trust shall determine the
liquidated value of Foreign Claims based on historical settlements and verdicts
in the Claimant's Jurisdiction as well as the other valuation data set forth in
Section 5.1(d)(ii) above.

            At such time as the Plan Trust has a sufficient historical
settlement, verdict and other valuation data for claims from a particular
foreign jurisdiction, the Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and the


                                       17
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


Futures Representative, may also establish a separate valuation matrix for such
claims based on that data.

      (e) Compensable Disease Matrix. The Plan Trust shall use the Compensable
Disease Matrix set forth in this Section 5.1(e) to resolve TDP Valued Asbestos
Claims as expeditiously and economically as possible. Using the Medical
Criteria, the Plan Trust will place a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim in the most
serious applicable Disease Category (i.e., the category with the highest
values). Unless a holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim qualifies for other
treatment under the TDP, the Plan Trust shall value and liquidate each TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim at the Scheduled Value specified for the Disease Category
set forth in the Compensable Disease Matrix corresponding to such TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim. The Scheduled Values for the Medical Criteria associated with a
Disease Category set forth in the Compensable Disease Matrix are based on tort
system values and represent equitable settlement values for most TDP Valued
Asbestos Claims that meet the Medical Criteria associated with a Disease
Category set forth in the Compensable Disease Matrix and the Exposure Evidence.

      This Compensable Disease Matrix, Medical Criteria and Exposure Evidence
requirements, as well as the Initial Payment Percentage, shall apply to all TDP
Valued Asbestos Voting Claims. The term "TDP Valued Asbestos Voting Claim" means
any TDP Valued Asbestos Claim (i) that was filed against a Debtor or a Protected
Party in the tort system or actually submitted to a Debtor or a Protected Party
pursuant to an administrative settlement agreement prior to the Petition Date;
and (ii) any TDP Valued Asbestos Claim filed against another defendant in the
tort system prior to the date the Plan was filed with the Bankruptcy Court
(January 22, 2004 (the "Plan Filing Date")), provided, however, that the holder
of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim described in subsection (i) or (ii) above, or his
or her authorized agent, actually voted to accept or reject the Plan pursuant to
the voting procedures established by the Bankruptcy Court, and provided further
that the claim was subsequently filed with the Plan Trust by the Initial Claims
Filing Date.

      (f) Requirements for Allowance. To receive an offer for one of the five
Disease Categories, the holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim must provide
Exposure Evidence (defined below) and satisfy the Medical Criteria (defined
below) applicable to the associated Disease Category as set forth below.

            (i) The holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim must provide evidence
(the "Exposure Evidence") of exposure to an asbestos-containing product
manufactured, sold, or distributed by a Debtor or for which a Debtor has legal
liability. Exposure Evidence can be established by deposition testimony,

invoices, affidavits, and other credible evidence acceptable to the Plan
Trustees.

            (ii) The holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim must satisfy the
following Medical Criteria applicable to the associated Disease Category (the
"Medical Criteria"):

                  (1) Mesothelioma. In order for the holder of a TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim to qualify for compensation as a "Mesothelioma" claim under the
Compensable Disease Matrix, such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim must
submit a report by a Board-certified Pathologist, or another competent physician
acceptable to the Plan Trust, supporting such holder's diagnosis of a malignant
mesothelioma.

                  (2) Lung Cancer. In order for the holder of a TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim to qualify for compensation as a "Lung Cancer" claim under the
Compensable Disease Matrix, such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim must
submit a report by a Qualified Physician establishing that such holder of a TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim has a primary carcinoma of the lung; and either one of the
following: (A) a statement from a Qualified Physician that the carcinoma in
question is causally related to such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim's
asbestos exposure; or (B) a report by a Certified B-reader showing that such
holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim has a Chest X-Ray reading of 1/0 or higher
on the ILO scale and/or bilateral pleural plaques, bilateral pleural thickening,
or bilateral pleural calcification.

                  (3) Other Cancer. In order for the holder of a TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim to qualify for compensation as an "Other Cancer" claim under the
Compensable Disease Matrix, such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim must
submit a report by a Board-certified Pathologist establishing such holder of a
TDP Valued Asbestos Claim with a primary colorectal, esophageal, laryngeal,
pharyngeal or gastric carcinoma; and both of the following: (A) a statement by a
Qualified Physician that the carcinoma in question is causally related to such
holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim's asbestos exposure; and (B) a report by a
Certified B-reader showing that such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim has a
Chest X-Ray reading of 1/0 or higher on the ILO scale and/or bilateral pleural
plaques, bilateral pleural thickening, or bilateral pleural calcification. No
other asbestos-related cancer shall be compensable as an Other Cancer under the
TDP.

                  (4) Level II Non-Malignant. In order for the holder of a TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim to qualify for compensation as a "Level II Non-Malignant"
claim under the Compensable Disease Matrix, such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos
Claim must submit each of the following items in Sections 5.1(f)(ii)(4)(A), (B)
and (C):

                        (A) Clinical Evidence of Asbestosis: A diagnosis of
pulmonary asbestosis by a Qualified Physician based upon either of the following
two sets of minimum objective criteria:

                              (I) Chest X-Rays which, in the opinion of a
Certified B-reader, show small irregular opacities of ILO Grade 1/0; and
Pulmonary Function Testing and physical examination that show either: (I)
FVC<80% of Predicted Value with FEV-1/FVC $65%; (II)TLC<80% of Predicted Value;


                                       19

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


or (III) Bilateral Basilar Crackles, and also the absence of any more probable
explanation for the crackles other than the presence of asbestos-related lung
disease; or

                              (II) Chest X-Rays which, in the opinion of a
Certified B-reader show small irregular opacities of ILO grade 1/1 or greater;
and Pulmonary Function Testing that shows either (I) FVC<80% of Predicted Value
with FEV-1/FVC$ 65%; or (II) TLC<80% of Predicted Value.

                        (B) Pathological Evidence of Asbestosis: A statement by
a Board-certified Pathologist that more than one representative section of lung
tissue otherwise uninvolved with any other process (e.g., cancer or emphysema)
demonstrates a pattern of peribronchiolar or parenchymal scarring in the
presence of characteristic asbestos bodies, and also that there is no other more
probable explanation for the presence of the fibrosis.

                        (C) Bilateral Pleural Thickening: Chest X-Rays
demonstrating bilateral pleural thickening of ILO Grade B2 or greater that (A)
has not been followed by a malignancy; and (B) is not explained by any other
condition in such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim's history; and Pulmonary
Function Testing that, in the opinion of a Board-certified Internist, Pulmonary
Specialist, or Occupational Physician shows (I) TLC<80% of Predicted Value; or
(II) FVC<80% of Predicted Value; and for either (I) or (II), includes a
statement by the Board-certified Internist, Pulmonary Specialist, or
Occupational Physician that the asbestos-related changes are substantial
contributing factors in causing the pulmonary function changes.

                  (5) Level I Non-Malignant. In order for the holder of a TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim to qualify for compensation as a "Level I Non-Malignant"
claim under the Compensable Disease Matrix, such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos
Claim must submit either:

                        (A) A report by a Qualified Physician stating that such
holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim has or had a Chest X-Ray reading of 1/0 or
higher on the ILO scale, or a CT scan read by a Qualified Physician showing
bilateral pleural plaques, bilateral pleural thickening, or bilateral pleural
calcification or if an ILO reading is not available, a Chest X-Ray reading or CT
scan read by a Qualified Physician showing bilateral interstitial fibrosis,
bilateral interstitial markings, bilateral pleural plaques, bilateral pleural
thickening, or bilateral pleural calcification consistent with, or compatible
with, a diagnosis of asbestos-related disease, or such other competent evidence
acceptable to the Plan Trust with medical evidence such as a diagnosis of an
asbestos-related condition by a Qualified Physician, showing that such holder of
a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim's non-malignant condition is causally related to
asbestos exposure; or

                        (B) A statement by a Board-certified Pathologist that:
(A) more than one representative section of lung tissue otherwise uninvolved
with any other process (e.g. cancer, emphysema) demonstrates a pattern of per
bronchiolar or parenchymal scarring in the presence of characteristic asbestos
bodies; and (B) there is no other more likely explanation for the presence of
the fibrosis.

      (g) Failure to Meet and Changes to Disease Levels, Values and Criteria.
The Plan Trust may, in its sole discretion, determine that, although a
particular requirement in the Medical Criteria or Exposure Evidence for a
particular Disease Category has not been met, other factors and evidence may
satisfy the objective of such requirement and, therefore, such TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim should be considered to be within such Disease Category. In
addition, the Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and the Futures
Representative, may add to, change, or eliminate Disease Categories, Scheduled
Values, Average Values, Maximum Values, Medical Criteria or Exposure Evidence;
develop subcategories of Disease Categories, Scheduled Values, Average Values,
Maximum Values, Medical Criteria or Exposure Evidence; or determine that a novel
or exceptional asbestos personal injury claim is compensable even though it does
not meet the Medical Criteria and/or Exposure Evidence for any of the
then-current Disease Categories. The Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC
and the Futures Representative, shall also establish separate Medical Criteria,
Exposure Evidence, and/or standards, as well as separate requirements for
physicians and other professional qualifications, for purposes of processing
foreign TDP Valued Asbestos Claims; provided, however, that such criteria,
standards or requirements shall not effectuate substantive changes to the TDP's
eligibility requirements, but shall be made only for the purpose of adapting the
Plan Trust's substantive requirements to the particular licensing provisions
and/or medical customs or practices of a foreign country.

      (h) Extraordinary TDP Valued Asbestos Claims. If any Debtor's asbestos
related activity constituted an exceptionally large portion of a claimant's
asbestos exposure then such claimant's TDP Valued Asbestos Claim may be
classified as an extraordinary TDP Valued Asbestos Claim (an "Extraordinary TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim"), and such Extraordinary TDP Valued Asbestos Claim may be
liquidated in an amount that exceeds the value for the applicable Disease
Category as set forth in the Compensable Disease Matrix; provided however, that
a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim in the Level I Non-Malignant Disease Category shall
not be eligible for classification as an Extraordinary TDP Valued Asbestos
Claim. As part of the Individual Review Process, the Plan Trustees may award a
holder of an Extraordinary TDP Valued Asbestos Claim a Liquidated Value up to
the Maximum Amount for such holder's relevant Disease Category if (i) at the
same time such holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim submits the documentation
required by the TDP, such holder also requests in writing to the Plan Trustees
that his or her TDP Valued Asbestos Claim be deemed an Extraordinary TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim and be considered under the Individual Review Process, (ii) such
holder satisfies the requirements of the Medical Criteria for the Disease
Category in question, (iii) such holder establishes the Exposure Evidence, (iv)
such holder demonstrates that his or her exposure to asbestos (1) was greater
than 40% the result of exposure to an asbestos-containing product installed,
manufactured, sold, supplied, produced, distributed, released or marketed by a
Debtor or for which a Debtor otherwise has legal liability, or (2) occurred
predominantly as the result of working in a manufacturing facility of Debtor
during a period in which a Debtor was manufacturing asbestos-containing products
at that facility, and (v) such holder demonstrates that there is little
likelihood of a substantial recovery elsewhere. The Plan Trustees, with the
consent of the TAC and the Futures Representative, may at any time and from time
to time change the Maximum Amount for any one or more of the Disease Categories
or the basis for classifying claims as extraordinary. An Extraordinary TDP
Valued Asbestos Claim, following its liquidation, shall be placed in the FIFO
Payment Queue ahead of all other TDP Valued Claims except Exigent Hardship
Claims (which shall be first in the FIFO Payment Queue) based on its date of
liquidation and shall be subject to the Payment Percentage.


                                       21
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


      (i) Exigent Hardship Claims. If a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim in the Disease
Categories of Mesothelioma, Lung Cancer or Other Cancer meets the Medical
Criteria and Exposure Evidence for the applicable Disease Category, or otherwise
is Allowed under the Individual Review Process, and the Plan Trust, in its sole
discretion, determines (i) that such claimant needs financial assistance
immediately based upon such claimant's expenses and all sources of available
income, and (ii) that there is a causal connection between the claimant's dire
financial condition and the claimant's asbestos-related disease (an "Exigent
Hardship Claim"), then, notwithstanding any other provision herein, at any time
the Plan Trust may liquidate and pay such TDP Valued Asbestos Claims as set
forth in this Section 5.1(i). The Plan Trust shall consider all Exigent Hardship
Claims separately no matter what the order of processing otherwise would have
been for such claims under the TDP. An Exigent Hardship Claim, following its
liquidation, shall be placed first in the FIFO Payment Queue ahead of all other
liquidated TDP Valued Asbestos Claims, and shall be subject to the Payment
Percentage.

      (j) Secondary Exposure Claims. If a claimant alleges an asbestos-related
disease resulting solely from exposure to an occupationally exposed person, such
as a family member, the claimant may seek for his or claim to undergo the
Individual Review Process. In such a case, the claimant must establish that the
occupationally exposed person would have met the Exposure Evidence had such
occupationally exposed person filed a direct claim against the Plan Trust. In
addition, the claimant with secondary exposure must establish that he or she is
suffering from one of the Disease Categories or an asbestos-related disease
otherwise compensable under the TDP, that his or her own exposure to the
occupationally exposed person occurred within the same time frame as the
occupationally exposed person was exposed to asbestos-containing products for
which a Debtor has legal liability, and that such secondary exposure was a cause
of the claimed disease. The proof of claim form provided by the Plan Trust shall
include a section for Secondary Exposure Claims. All other liquidation and
payment rights and limitations under the TDP shall be applicable to such
secondary exposure claims.

      (k) Categorizing of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims by Disease. As a TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim is reached in the FIFO Processing Queue, the Plan Trust shall
evaluate it to determine whether the TDP Valued Asbestos Claim meets the Medical
Criteria and Exposure Evidence for a Disease Category. The Plan Trust shall
advise the claimant of its determination and, if Allowed, offer the holder of
TDP Valued Asbestos Claim the Liquidated Value related to the applicable Disease
Category. If the Plan Trust determines that a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim does not
meet the Medical Criteria for a Disease Category and is not compensable, the
claimant may dispute the determination as provided in Section 5.1(l).

      (l) Disputes Over Review. Claimants who reject the Plan Trust's offer and
who wish to dispute whether a Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement is binding and
judicially enforceable in the absence of a Final Order determining the issue,
whether the Plan Trust's rejection or denial of a claim was proper, whether the
claimant's medical condition or exposure history meets the requirements of the
TDP for purposes of categorizing a claim or to resolve a dispute over the
liquidated value of such claimant's claim, must initiate arbitration pursuant to
procedures set forth in Section 5.2. Only after claimants have rejected any
non-binding arbitration award pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
5.2 may they file suit against the Plan Trust. Notwithstanding the foregoing,
the Plan Trustees shall have the right to establish appropriate mediation
procedures as a prerequisite to arbitration.


                                       22
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


      (m) Auditing and Verification. The Plan Trustees shall conduct random or
other audits, or shall devise and implement a mechanism for conducting such
audits, in order to verify information submitted by claimants under this Section
5.1 or to otherwise satisfy themselves as to the reliability of medical
evidence.

5.2.  Arbitration; Jury Trials.

      (a) The Plan Trust, with the consent of the TAC and the Futures
Representative, shall institute binding and non-binding arbitration procedures
in accordance with the Alternative Dispute Resolution ("ADR") Procedures for
resolving disputes concerning whether a Pre-Petition Settlement Agreement is
binding and judicially enforceable in the absence of a Final Order determining
the issue, whether the Plan Trust's outright rejection or denial of a claim was
proper, or whether the claimant's medical condition or exposure history meets
the requirements of the TDP for purposes of categorizing a claim, and for
resolving disputes over the liquidated value of a claim.

      (b) In all arbitrations, the arbitrator shall consider the same medical
and exposure evidentiary requirements that are set forth in Section 5.1(f)
above. With respect to all claims eligible for arbitration, the claimant, but
not the Plan Trust, may elect either non-binding or binding arbitration. The
arbitration rules adopted by the Plan Trust may be modified by the Plan Trustees
with the consent of the TAC and the Futures Representative. Such amendments may
include adoption of mediation procedures as well as establishment of a panel to
review Extraordinary TDP Valued Asbestos Claims pursuant to Section 5.1(h)
above.

      (c) In order to be eligible for arbitration, the claimant must first
complete the Individual Review Process as well as any other alternative dispute
resolution procedures which may be established by the Plan Trust and set forth
in the ADR Procedures with respect to the disputed issue. The Individual Review
Process will be treated as completed for these purposes when the claim has been
individually reviewed by the Plan Trust, the Plan Trust has made an offer on the
claim, the claimant has rejected the liquidated value resulting from the
Individual Review Process, and the claimant has notified the Plan Trust of the
rejection in writing. The Individual Review Process will also be treated as
completed if the Plan Trust has rejected the claim.

      (d) In no case shall an arbitrator award a holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos
Claim an amount in excess of the Maximum Value for the appropriate Disease Level
as set forth in Section 5.1(e) above. A claimant who submits to arbitration and
who accepts the arbitral award will receive payments in the same manner as one
who accepts the Plan Trust's original valuation of the claim.

      (e) Only claimants who opt for non-binding arbitration and then reject
their arbitration awards retain the right to a trial (including the right to a
trial by jury) to determine the Liquidated Value of their TDP Valued Asbestos
Claims against the Plan Trust. All other claimants shall have and shall be
deemed to have irrevocably waived any right to a trial (including the right to a
trial by jury), and any and all notices with respect to the filing or


                                       23
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


liquidation of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims shall contain a provision that clearly
and conspicuously explains such trial waiver. A holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos
Claim desiring to file suit against the Plan Trust may do so only after the
rejection of a non-binding arbitration award. In all cases, the statute of
limitations will be tolled as provided in Section 5.1(b)(ii), and the right to a
trial (including a trial by jury) shall be preserved. To the extent the statute
of limitations has been tolled, it shall commence running sixty (60) days after
the entry of a non-binding arbitration award.

      (f) All claims and defenses (including, with respect to the Plan Trust,
all claims and defenses which could have been asserted by any Debtor) that exist
under applicable law shall be available to both sides at trial. The Plan Trust
may waive any defense or concede any issue of fact or law. The award of an
arbitrator or the recommendation of a mediator and the positions and admissions
of the parties during the compliance with alternative dispute resolution
procedures shall not be admissible for any purpose at trial by any party or
third party, and they are expressly determined not to be admissions by either
party.

      (g) If necessary, the Plan Trustees may obtain an order from the District
Court or any other court of competent jurisdiction incorporating an offer of
judgment to liquidate the amount of the TDP Valued Asbestos Claim, scheduling
discovery and trials in such a fashion as not to create an undue burden on the
Plan Trust, or containing any other provisions, in order to ensure that the Plan
Trust fulfills its obligations in accordance with the principles set forth in
the Plan Trust Agreement. Any such lawsuit must be filed by the claimant in his
or her own right and name and not as a member or representative of a class, and
no such lawsuit may be consolidated with any other lawsuit. If the claimant was
alive at the time the initial pre-petition complaint was filed or on the date
the proof of claim was filed with the Plan Trust, the case will be treated as a
personal injury case with all personal injury damages to be considered even if
the claimant has died during the pendency of the claim.

      (h) If and when a claimant obtains a judgment in the tort system in
accordance with the TDP, such claim shall be placed in the FIFO Payment Queue
based on the date on which the judgment became final. Thereafter, the claimant
shall receive from the Plan Trust an initial payment (subject to the applicable
Payment Percentage provisions) of an amount equal to one-hundred percent (100%)
of the greater of (i) the Plan Trust's last offer to the claimant or (ii) the
award that the claimant declined in non-binding arbitration. The claimant shall
receive the balance of the judgment, if any, in five equal installments in years
six (6) through ten (10) following the year of the initial payment (which
payments shall also be subject to the applicable Payment Percentage provisions).

5.3. Indirect Asbestos Claims. Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims that constitute
Indirect Asbestos Claims shall be disallowed by the Plan Trust unless and until
the holder thereof establishes to the satisfaction of the Plan Trustees (a)
that, with respect to such Claims based on theories of indemnification or
contribution, (i) there is a direct Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim with respect to
which the Plan Trust would have liability under the Plan Trust Agreement or the
TDP and such liability has been fixed and liquidated in a manner acceptable to
the Plan Trustees, (ii) such holder has paid in full the liability and
obligations of the Plan Trust to the direct claimant to whom the Plan Trust
would otherwise have had a liability or obligation under the Plan Trust
Agreement or the TDP, (iii) the direct claimant and such holder have forever
released the Plan Trust from all liability to the direct claimant pursuant to a


                                       24
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


written agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Plan Trustees, and
(iv) the claim is not otherwise barred by a statute of limitation or repose or
by other applicable law or (b) that, with respect to any other such Claims, a
factual and legal basis upon which such holder is entitled to recover from the
Plan Trust in respect of such Claim exists and is proven. In no event shall any
holder of a Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim that constitutes an Indirect Asbestos
Claim based on theories of indemnification or contribution have any rights
against the Plan Trust superior to the rights of the related direct claimant,
including any rights with respect to the timing, amount or manner of payment. In
addition, no Indirect Asbestos Claim may be liquidated and paid in an amount
that exceeds the amount that the holder of the Indirect Asbestos Claim has
actually paid to the direct claimant, and the liquidated value of any Indirect
Asbestos Claim paid by the Plan Trust to the holder thereof shall be treated as
an offset to or reduction of the full liquidated value of any Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claim that might be subsequently asserted by the direct claimant
against the Plan Trust.

5.4.  General Provisions for TDP Valued Asbestos Claims.

      (a) Releases. A holder of a TDP Valued Asbestos Claim who receives payment
for a claim involving the Disease Categories of Level II Non-Malignant and Level
I Non-Malignant shall execute and deliver to the Plan Trustee a limited written
release in a form satisfactory to the Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC
and the Futures Representative, and may thereafter file a new TDP Valued PI
Asbestos Claim for an asbestos related claim involving the Disease Categories of
Mesothelioma, Lung Cancer or Other Cancer that is subsequently diagnosed. Any
additional payments to which such claimant may be entitled shall not be reduced
by the amount of the prior payment for a claim involving the Disease Categories
of Level II Non-Malignant and Level I Non-Malignant. Holders of TDP Valued
Asbestos Claims who receive payment for claims involving the Disease Categories
of Mesothelioma, Lung Cancer or Other Cancer shall execute and deliver to the
Plan Trustees written releases and other documents pursuant to Section 7.3 in a
form satisfactory to the Plan Trustees, after consultation with the TAC and the
Futures Representative.

      (b) Modifications to Assure Substantial Equivalency. The Plan Trustees
shall assure the substantially equivalent treatment of TDP Valued Asbestos
Claims, to the extent reasonably practicable, and may, with the consent of the
TAC and the Futures Representative, in addition to the powers set forth
elsewhere in the TDP, change, add, or delete Disease Categories, change Medical
Criteria, and modify the values for any Disease Category to reflect relevant
developments, including, without limitation, changes in the applicable law.

                                  SECTION VI.
                        Claims Materials, Processing Fee

6.1. Claims Materials. The Claims Materials will be developed by the Plan
Trustees in consultation with, and with the approval of, the TAC and the Futures
Representative. Because the Liquidated Values for the Settled Claims were
determined prior to the Effective Date, the Claims Materials developed for the
holders of Settled Claims may be different from the Claims Materials developed
for the holders of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims. In addition, a separate claim
form for Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims that constitute Indirect Asbestos Claims


                                       25
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


or Allowed ABI Asbestos Personal Injury Indemnity Claims may be developed. If
feasible, the claims forms developed and used for each TDP Valued Asbestos Claim
should be similar and should be based on the claims forms used by other asbestos
claims resolution facilities for such claims. The Plan Trust may obtain
information with respect to any TDP Valued Asbestos Claim from electronic data
bases maintained by any asbestos claims resolution organization provided that
the Plan Trust informs the holder of such Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim that the
Plan Trust plans to obtain such information as is available from such other
organization(s) unless the claimant objects in writing or provides such
information directly to the Plan Trust. Any information obtained by the Plan
Trust from an asbestos claims resolution organization concerning a TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim may be used to determine independently the value of such Claim.
The Plan Trust may send Claims Materials to one or more claimants represented by
the same attorney or law firm in care of such attorney or law firm representing
such claimant(s), and the requirements of this Section 6.1 will be satisfied if
the Plan Trust mails to such attorney or law firm one copy of the Claims
Materials.

6.2. Third Party Services. Nothing in this Section VI shall preclude the Plan
Trust from contracting with another asbestos claims resolution organization to
provide services to the Plan Trust so long as decisions about the allowability
and value of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims are based on the provisions of the TDP
and the Compensable Disease Matrix; provided, however, that the Plan Trustees
shall not enter into any such contract without the consent of the TAC and the
Futures Representative.

6.3. Eligibility Requirements And Processing Fee. The Plan Trustees, with the
consent of the TAC and the Futures Representative, shall have the discretion to
determine whether the initial claim form filed by the holder of a TDP Valued
Asbestos Claim must be accompanied by a non-refundable processing fee payable to
the Plan Trust in an amount determined by the Plan Trustees, with the consent of
the TAC and the Futures Representative. A claimant who for any reason refiles a
TDP Valued Asbestos Claim previously submitted to the Plan Trust shall not be
required to submit an additional processing fee. The Plan Trustees shall have
the power to increase or decrease the amount of the processing fee with the
consent of the TAC and the Futures Representative.

6.4. Confidentiality. All materials, records and information submitted by
holders of Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims, including that provided with regard to
medical audits under Section 5.1, are confidential and submitted solely for
settlement purposes.

                                  SECTION VII.
                               General Guidelines

7.1. Monitoring and Verifying Evidence. The Plan Trust may refuse to accept
evidence from doctors or facilities it finds to provide consistently unreliable
information or exercise other remedies, such as seeking sanctions from the
Bankruptcy Court, disallowing the Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim, requiring
payment of the costs associated with the audit and any future audit or audits,
reordering the priority of payment of the affected claimants' TDP Valued
Asbestos Claims, raising the level of scrutiny of additional information
submitted from the same source or sources, or prosecuting the claimant or
claimant's attorney for presenting a fraudulent Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim in
violation of federal law, including 18 U.S.C. ss. 152, or applicable state law.


                                       26
<PAGE>

                                                           EXHIBIT H TO THE PLAN


The existence of differing medical opinions in individual cases is expected and
anticipated. The fact that qualified physicians may differ on the existence or
extent of a claimant's asbestos-related disease is not by itself grounds for the
Plan Trust to refuse to accept evidence of the TDP Valued Asbestos Claim, unless
the TDP Valued Asbestos Claim is based on information from a source shown to be
generally unreliable by medical audits.

7.2. Non-Compensatory Damages and Other Theories of Liability. In determining
the value of any liquidated or unliquidated TDP Valued Asbestos Claim,
Non-Compensatory Damages shall not be considered or allowed, notwithstanding
their availability in the tort system. For purposes of the TDP, awards or
judgments arising out of claims by employees of a Debtor against such Debtor for
gross negligence shall not be deemed Non-Compensatory Damages. Further, the Plan
Trust shall not (i) pay claims based upon conspiracy, concerted action, or any
other theories of liability that do not meet the criteria for eligibility for
payment articulated in Section V or (ii) pay interest on Allowed Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claims.

In the event a personal representative or authorized agent makes a claim under
this TDP for wrongful death with respect to which the governing law of the
Claimant's Jurisdiction could only be the Alabama Wrongful Death Statute, the
Claimant's Jurisdiction for such claim shall be the Commonwealth of
Pennsylvania, and such claimant's damages shall be determined pursuant to the
statutory and common laws of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania without regard to
its choice of law principles. This provision is applicable to any claim with
respect to which, but for this choice of law provision, the applicable law of
the Claimant's Jurisdiction is determined to be the Alabama Wrongful Death
Statute, and shall only govern the rights between the Plan Trust and the
claimant, and, to the extent the Plan Trust seeks recovery from any entity that
provided insurance coverage to a Debtor or a Protected Party, the Alabama
Wrongful Death Statute shall govern.

7.3. Releases. The Plan Trustees, with the consent of the TAC and the Futures
Representative, shall determine the form and nature of the releases given to the
Plan Trust in order to maximize recovery for claimants against other tortfeasors
without increasing the risk or amount of claims for indemnification or
contribution from the Plan Trust. If allowed by applicable state law, the
endorsing of a check or draft for payment by or on behalf of a claimant shall
constitute such a release. In addition, and as a prerequisite to receiving
payment, the claimant shall execute any documents necessary (i) for the Plan
Trust to perfect its claims, if any, against insurers of any Debtor or any
related company to receive indemnity for payments, (ii) to release any Plan
Trust PI Asbestos Claim the claimant may have against the insurer, and (iii) for
the Plan Trust to receive and keep any and all payments made by such insurer for
payment of such Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim.

7.4. Withdrawal or Deferral of Claims. A claimant can withdraw a Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claim at any time upon written notice to the Plan Trustee and file
another Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim subsequently, but any Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claim filed after such withdrawal shall be given a FIFO date based on
such subsequent filing. A claimant can also request that the processing of his
or her Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claim by the Plan Trust be deferred for a period
not to exceed three (3) years without affecting the status of the claim for
statute of limitation purposes, in which case the claimant shall also retain his
or her original place in the FIFO Processing Queue. Except for Plan Trust PI
Asbestos Claims held by representatives of deceased or incompetent claimants for

which court or probate approval of the Plan Trust's offer is required, a Plan
Trust PI Asbestos Claim will be deemed to have been withdrawn if the claimant
neither accepts, rejects, nor initiates dispute resolution within six (6) months
of the Plan Trust's offer of payment or rejection of the Plan Trust PI Asbestos
Claim. Upon written request and good cause, the Plan Trustees may extend either
the deferral or withdrawal period for an additional six (6) months.

7.5. Managing Administrative Costs. Notwithstanding any provision of the TDP to
the contrary, the Plan Trustees shall always give appropriate consideration to
the cost of investigating and uncovering invalid Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims
so that the payment of Allowed Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims is not further
impaired by such processes. In issues related to the allowabililty of Plan Trust
PI Asbestos Claims, e.g., exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing materials
installed, manufactured, sold, supplied, produced, distributed, released or
marketed by any Debtor or for which any Debtor has legal liability or evidence
of injury, the Plan Trustees shall have the latitude to make judgments regarding
the amount of transaction costs to be expended by the Plan Trust so that Allowed
Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims are not further impaired by the costs of
additional investigation. Nothing herein shall prevent the Plan Trustees, in
appropriate circumstances, from contesting the allowabililty of any Plan Trust
PI Asbestos Claim whatever the costs.

                                  SECTION VIII.
                                  Miscellaneous

8.1. Amendments. The Plan Trustees may amend, modify, delete, or add to the TDP
(including, without limitation, amendments to conform the procedures set forth
herein to advances in scientific or medical knowledge, developments in the law,
or other changes in circumstances), provided they obtain the prior written
consent of the TAC and the Futures Representative. Notwithstanding anything
contained herein to the contrary, the TDP shall not be modified or amended in
any way could jeopardize, impair, or modify the applicability of Section 524(g)
of the Bankruptcy Code, the efficacy or enforceability of the Injunctions, the
Plan Trust's qualified settlement fund status under Section 468B of the IRC.

8.2. Severability. Should any provision contained in the TDP be determined to be
unenforceable, such determination shall in no way limit or affect the
enforceability and operative effect of any and all other provisions of the TDP.
Should any provision contained in the TDP be determined to be inconsistent with
or contrary to any Debtor's obligations to any insurance company providing
insurance coverage to any Debtor in respect of claims for personal injury based
on exposure to asbestos-containing products, the Plan Trustees, with the consent
of the TAC and the Futures Representative, may amend the TDP and/or the Plan
Trust Agreement to make the provisions of either or both documents consistent
with the duties and obligations of such Debtor to said insurance company.

8.3. Governing Law. The TDP shall be governed by, and construed in accordance
with, the laws of the State of Delaware without regard to Delaware conflict of
laws principles. Except for the liquidation of TDP Valued Asbestos Claims under
the Alabama Wrongful Death Statute as provided in Section 7.2 above, the law
governing the liquidation of Plan Trust PI Asbestos Claims in the case of

Individual Review, arbitration, or litigation in the tort system shall be the
law of the Claimant's Jurisdiction.

8.4. Plan Trust Expenses. Nothing in the TDP shall be construed to apply to the
payment by the Plan Trust of any Plan Trust Expenses.

                              Congoleum Corporation
                 Liquidation Valuation as of September 30, 2004
                                      Notes

(1)   Excludes $14.45 million of cash received from an insurance company that is
      payable to the Plan Trust or, under a liquidation scenario whereby the
      Plan of Reorganization is not confirmed, to asbestos claimants.

(2)   The Company's accounts receivable history is characterized by typically
      prompt payment by customers and negligible write-offs. However, the
      realization of receivables under a liquidation scenario would be adversely
      affected by the selling reserve balance, which was $19.6 million as of
      September 30, or 97.8% of the gross accounts receivable balance. The
      selling reserve consists of pricing discount credits, warranty claims and
      incentive rebates that are owed to customers. Under a liquidation
      scenario, it is likely that customers would offset these selling reserve
      balances against the accounts receivable balance, thereby substantially
      diminishing the collection of outstanding receivables.

(3)   The Company's raw material is characterized by certain commodity products,
      such as resins, as well as certain items that are specific to the
      Company's production process, such as urethanes. The Company's
      work-in-process consists mostly of product that is finished but not yet
      inspected, and, to a lesser extent, product that is on the production
      line.

(4)   As per an appraisal performed by Daley-Hodkin, LLC dated August 17, 2004.
      The machinery and equipment auction sale value (removal) was $7.25 million
      and the machinery and equipment forced liquidation value (in-place) was
      $34.4 million. The real estate as-is liquidation value was $11.175
      million.

(5)   Other current assets primarily consist of deferred taxes, deposits,
      prepaid insurance, prepaid marketing expenses and an asbestos insurance
      receivable from the Plan Trust.

(6)   The largest component of other noncurrent assets is a casualty insurance
      receivable that has a corresponding liability, rendering its liquidation
      value as negligible.

                Report of Ernst & Young LLP, Independent Auditors

To the Board of Directors
and Stockholders of
Congoleum Corporation:

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Congoleum
Corporation as of December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the related consolidated
statements of operations, changes in stockholders' equity, and cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended December 31, 2003. Our audits also
included the financial statement Schedule listed in the index at Item 15(2).
These financial statements and schedule are the responsibility of the Company's
management. Our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial
statements and schedule based on our audits.

We conducted our audits in accordance with auditing standards generally accepted
in the United States. Those standards require that we plan and perform the audit
to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free
of material misstatement. An audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence
supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. An audit
also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.

In our opinion, the financial statements referred to above present fairly, in
all material respects, the consolidated financial position of Congoleum
Corporation at December 31, 2003 and 2002, and the consolidated results of its
operations and its cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended
December 31, 2003, in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States. Also, in our opinion, the related financial statement
schedule, when considered in relation to the basic financial statements taken as
a whole, presents fairly in all material respects the information set forth
therein.

As discussed in Note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, in 2002,
Congoleum Corporation changed its method of accounting for goodwill in
accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142, "Goodwill
and Other Intangible Assets."

The accompanying financial statements have been prepared assuming that Congoleum
Corporation will continue as a going concern. As more fully described in Note 1,
"Basis of Presentation," to the consolidated financial statements, the Company
has been and continues to be named in a growing number of lawsuits stemming
primarily from the Company's manufacture of asbestos-containing products. The
Company has incurred significant charges to earnings to reflect its estimate of
costs associated with this litigation. On December 31, 2003 Congoleum filed a
voluntary petition with the United States Bankruptcy court for the District of
New Jersey (Case No. 03-51524) seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United
States Bankruptcy Code, as a means to resolve claims asserted against it related
to the use of asbestos in its products decades ago. These conditions raise
substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern.
Management's plans in regard to these matters are also described in Note 1,
"Basis of Presentation," to the consolidated financial statements. The financial

statements do not include any adjustments to reflect the possible future effects
on the recoverability and classification of assets or the amounts and
classification of liabilities that may result from the outcome of this
uncertainty.

Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements

1. Basis of Presentation

      The Consolidated Financial Statements of Congoleum Corporation (the
"Company" or "Congoleum") have been prepared on a going concern basis, which
contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in
the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial statements do not
include any adjustments that might be necessary should the Company be unable to
continue as a going concern. As described more fully below, there is substantial
doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern unless it
obtains relief from its substantial asbestos liabilities through a successful
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code.

      On December 31, 2003 Congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (Case No. 03-51524)
seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code, as a means
to resolve claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its
products decades ago. During 2003, Congoleum obtained the asbestos personal
injury claimant votes necessary for approval of a proposed pre-packaged Chapter
11 plan of reorganization and in January 2004 filed its pre-packaged plan of
reorganization and disclosure statement with the court. The Bankruptcy Court has
not yet scheduled a hearing to consider approval of the plan of reorganization.
Congoleum is also involved in litigation with certain insurance carriers related
to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related liabilities, and certain
insurance carriers have filed various objections to Congoleum's plan or
reorganization and related matters.

      The pre-packaged plan, if confirmed, would leave non-asbestos creditors
unimpaired and would resolve all pending and future asbestos claims against the
Company. The plan of reorganization would provide, among other things, for an
assignment of certain rights in, and proceeds of, Congoleum's applicable
insurance to a trust that would fund the settlement of all pending and future
asbestos claims and protect the Company from future asbestos-related litigation
by channeling all asbestos claims to the trust under Section 524(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code. Other creditors would be unimpaired under the plan. The
Bankruptcy Court has authorized the Company to pay trade creditors in the
ordinary course of business. The Company expects that it will take most of 2004
to obtain confirmation of its plan.

      Based on its pre-packaged bankruptcy strategy, the Company has made
provision in its financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of
estimates for its contribution and costs to effect its plan to settle asbestos
liabilities through a plan trust established under Section 524(g) of the
Bankruptcy Code. The Company recorded a charge of $17.3 million in the fourth
quarter of 2002 and an additional $3.7 million in the fourth quarter of 2003 to
provide for the estimated minimum costs of completing its reorganization. Actual
amounts that will be contributed to the plan trust and costs for pursuing and
implementing the plan of reorganization could be materially higher.

                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      For more information regarding the Company's asbestos liability and plan
for resolving that liability, please refer to Note 16 of the Notes to
Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that the Company
will be successful in realizing its goals in this regard or in obtaining
confirmation of its proposed plan. As a result, any alternative plan of
reorganization pursued by the Company or confirmed by a bankruptcy court could
vary significantly from the description in this report and the estimated costs
and contributions to effect the contemplated plan of reorganization could be
significantly greater than currently estimated. Any plan of reorganization
pursued by the Company will be subject to numerous conditions, approvals and
other requirements, including bankruptcy court approvals, and there can be no
assurance that such conditions, approvals and other requirements will be
satisfied or obtained. Delays in getting the Company's plan of reorganization
approved by the Bankruptcy Court could result in a proceeding that takes longer
and is more costly than the Company has estimated.

      AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code" ("SOP 90-7") provides financial
reporting guidance for entities that are reorganizing under the Bankruptcy Code.
The Company will implement this guidance in consolidated financial statements
for periods after December 31, 2003.

      Pursuant to SOP 90-7, companies are required to segregate pre-petition
liabilities that are subject to compromise and report them separately on the
balance sheet. Liabilities that may be affected by a plan of reorganization are
recorded at the amount of the expected allowed claims, even if they may be
settled for lesser amounts. Substantially all of the Company's liabilities at
December 31, 2003 will be reclassified as liabilities subject to compromise.
Obligations arising post petition, and pre-petition obligations that are secured
or that the Bankruptcy Court authorizes the Company to pay, will not be
classified as liabilities subject to compromise.

      Additional pre-petition claims (liabilities subject to compromise) may
arise due to the rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases, or as a
result of the allowance of contingent or disputed claims.

2. Summary of Significant Accounting Policies:

Nature of Business - Congoleum manufactures resilient sheet and tile flooring
products. These products, together with a limited quantity of related products
purchased for resale, are sold primarily to wholesale distributors and major
retailers in the United States and Canada. Based upon the nature of the
Company's operations, facilities and management structure, the Company considers
its business to constitute a single segment for financial reporting purposes.

Basis of Consolidation - The accompanying consolidated financial statements
reflect the operations, financial position and cash flows of Congoleum
Corporation and include the accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries after
elimination of all significant intercompany transactions in consolidation.


                                      C-9
<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


Use of Estimates and Critical Accounting Policies - The preparation of financial
statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the
United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Critical
accounting policies are defined as those that entail significant judgments and
estimates, and could potentially result in materially different results under
different assumptions and conditions. The Company believes that the most
critical accounting policies upon which its financial condition depends, and
which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments, concern
asbestos liabilities, environmental contingencies, valuation of deferred tax
assets, and pension plan and post-retirement benefits. A discussion on the
application of these and other accounting policies is provided in "Management's
Discussion And Analysis Of Financial Condition And Results Of
Operations-Critical Accounting Policies".

      Although the Company makes every effort to ensure the accuracy of the
estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of its financial statements or
in the application of accounting policies, if business conditions are different
than the Company has assumed they will be, or if the Company used different
estimates and assumptions, it is possible that materially different amounts
could be reported in the Company's financial statements.

Revenue Recognition - Revenue is recognized when products are shipped. Net sales
are comprised of the total sales billed during the period less the estimated
sales value of goods returned, trade discounts and customers' allowances.

Cash and Cash Equivalents - All highly liquid debt instruments with a maturity
of three months or less at the time of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents.

Restricted Cash - Under the terms of its revolving credit agreement, payments on
the Company's accounts receivable are deposited in an account assigned by the
Company to its lender and the funds in that account are used by the lender to
pay down any loan balance. Restricted cash represents funds deposited in this
account but not immediately applied to the loan balance. At December 31, 2003,
cash of approximately $1.8 million was restricted. There was no restricted cash
at December 31, 2002 as there were no borrowings under the Company's revolving
credit agreement.

Short-Term Investments - The Company invests in highly liquid debt instruments
with strong credit ratings. Commercial paper investments with a maturity greater
than three months, but less than one year at the time of purchase, are
considered to be short-term investments. The Company maintains cash and cash
equivalents and short-term investments with certain financial institutions. The
Company performs periodic evaluations of the relative credit standing of those
financial institutions that are considered in the Company's investment strategy.

Inventories - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. The LIFO
(last-in, first-out) method of determining cost is used for substantially all
inventories. The Company records as a charge to cost of goods sold any amount
required to reduce the carrying value of inventories to the net realizable sales
value.

                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


Property, Plant, and Equipment - Property, plant, and equipment are recorded at
cost and are depreciated over their estimated useful lives (30 years for
buildings, 15 years for building improvements, production equipment and
heavy-duty vehicles, 3 to 10 years for light-duty vehicles and office
furnishings and equipment) on the straight-line method for financial reporting
and accelerated methods for income tax purposes. Costs of major additions and
betterments are capitalized; maintenance and repairs which do not improve or
extend the life of the respective assets are charged to operations as incurred.
When an asset is sold, retired or otherwise disposed of, the cost of the asset
and the related accumulated depreciation are removed from the respective
accounts and any resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.

Debt Issue Costs - Costs incurred in connection with the issuance of debt have
been capitalized and are being amortized over the life of the related debt. Such
costs at December 31, 2003 and 2002 amounted to $1.6 million and $2.2 million,
net of accumulated amortization of $2.2 million and $1.7 million, respectively,
and are included in other noncurrent assets.

Environmental Remediation - The Company is subject to federal, state and local
environmental laws and regulations. The Company records a liability for
environmental remediation claims when a cleanup program or claim payment becomes
probable and the costs can be reasonably estimated. The recorded liabilities are
not discounted for delays in future payments (see Notes 4, 6, and 15).

Asbestos Liabilities and Plan of Reorganization - The Company is a defendant in
a large number of asbestos-related lawsuits and has filed a pre-packaged plan of
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code as part of
its strategy to resolve this liability (See Note 16). Accounting for
asbestos-related and reorganization costs includes significant assumptions and
estimates, and actual results could differ materially from those estimates.

Income Taxes - The Company accounts for income taxes in accordance with SFAS No.
109, "Accounting for Income Taxes" ("SFAS No. 109"). Under SFAS No. 109,
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary
differences between the financial statement and tax basis of assets and
liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the
differences are expected to reverse. SFAS No. 109 requires current recognition
of net deferred tax assets to the extent that it is more likely than not that
such net assets will be realized. To the extent that the Company believes that
its net deferred tax assets will not be realized, a valuation allowance must be
recorded against those assets.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts and Cash Discounts - The Company provides an
allowance for doubtful accounts and cash discounts based on estimates of
historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade
accounts receivable, revising its estimates when circumstances dictate.

Product Warranties - The Company provides product warranties for specific
product lines and accrues for estimated future warranty cost in the period in
which the revenue is recognized. The following table sets forth activity in the
Company's warranty reserves (in millions):

                                                           December 31,

                                                 ======      ======      ======

Shipping and Handling Costs - Shipping costs for the years ended December 31,
2003, 2002 and 2001 were $1.6 million, $2.1 million, and $3.5 million,
respectively, and are included in selling, general and administrative expenses.

Earnings Per Share - SFAS No. 128, "Earnings Per Share", requires the
computation of basic and diluted earnings per share. The calculation of basic
earnings per share is based on the average number of common shares outstanding
during the period. Diluted earnings per share reflect the effect of all
potentially diluted securities which consist of outstanding common stock
options. For all periods presented, basic and diluted shares outstanding are the
same.

Goodwill - Goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the
estimated fair value of the net assets acquired and was amortized through
year-end 2001 using the straight-line method principally over 40 years. During
the first quarter of 2002, the Company performed a transitional impairment test
in accordance with Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 142,
"Goodwill and Other Intangible Assets" ("SFAS No. 142"). As a result, the
Company concluded that the goodwill was impaired and recorded a goodwill
impairment charge for the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of
$10.5 million.

      The following table reflects consolidated results adjusted as though the
Company's adoption of SFAS 142 occurred as of January 1, 2001:

      Long-lived assets - The Company periodically considers whether there has
been a permanent impairment in the value of its long-lived assets, primarily
property and equipment, in accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board
("FASB") issued Statement No. 144, "Accounting for the Impairment or Disposal of
Long-Lived Assets." The Company evaluates various factors, including current and
projected future operating results and the undiscounted cash flows for the under
performing long-lived assets. The Company then compares the carrying amount of
the asset to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result
from the use of the asset. To the extent that the estimated future undiscounted
cash flows are less than the carrying amount of the asset, the asset is written
down to its estimated fair market value and an impairment loss is recognized.
The value of impaired long-lived assets is adjusted periodically based on
changes in these factors. At December 31, 2003, the Company determined, based on
its evaluation, that the carrying value of its long-lived assets was
appropriate. No adjustments to the carrying costs were made.

      Accounting for stock-based compensation - The Company discloses
stock-based compensation information in accordance with FASB issued Statement
No. 148 ("SFAS 148"),"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation--Transition and
Disclosure--an amendment of FASB Statement No. 123" and FASB issued Statement
No. 123 ("SFAS 123"),"Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation." SFAS 148
provides additional transition guidance for companies that elect to voluntarily
adopt the provisions of SFAS 123. SFAS 148 does not change the provisions of
SFAS 123 that permit entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of
Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"),"Accounting for Stock
Issued to Employees." The Company has elected to continue to account for its
stock-based plans under APB 25, as well as to provide disclosure of stock-based
compensation as outlined in SFAS 123 as amended by SFAS 148.

      Recently Issued Accounting Standards - In November 2001, Emerging Issues
Task Force (EITF) issue 01-9, "Accounting for Consideration Given by a Vendor to
a Customer or Reseller of the Vendor's Products ("EITF 01-9"), was issued.
Congoleum adopted EITF 01-9 effective January 1, 2002 as required. This issue
addresses the manner in which companies account for sales incentives to their
customers. The Company's current accounting policies for the recognition of
costs related to these programs, which is to accrue for costs as benefits are
earned by the Company's customers, are in accordance with the consensus reached
in this issue. The Company has reclassified amounts previously recorded in
selling, general and administrative expense as a reduction in net sales. The
impact for the twelve months ending December 31, 2002 and 2001 was a reduction
of net sales and of selling, general and administrative expenses of $4.1
million, and $4.5 million, respectively.

      In November 2002, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation (FIN) No. 45,
Guarantor's Accounting and Disclosure Requirements for Guarantees, Including
Indirect Guarantees of Indebtedness of Others. FIN No. 45 clarifies that a
guarantor is required to recognize, at the inception of a guarantee, a liability
for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee. The
initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of FIN No. 45 are
applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after
December 31, 2002. Adoption of this standard did not have an effect on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

      In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,
which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities (VIEs). In December 2003, the FASB completed deliberations of proposed
modifications to FIN 46 (Revised Interpretations) resulting in multiple
effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the VIE. The
Revised Interpretations must be applied no later than the second quarter of
fiscal year 2004. The adoption of FIN 46 has no impact on the Company's
consolidated financial statements as of December 31, 2003 and the Company does
not expect there to be an impact on the consolidated financial statements from
the adoption of the deferred provisions in the second quarter of fiscal year
2004.

      Reclassifications - Certain amounts appearing in the prior years'
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year's
presentation.

3. Inventories:

      ---------------------------------------------------------------------

      If the FIFO (first-in, first-out) method of inventory accounting (which
approximates current cost) had been used, inventories would have been
approximately $3.6 million and $2.1 million lower than reported at December 31,
2003 and 2002, respectively.

facilities and equipment. The capitalized interest is recorded as part of the
asset to which it relates and is amortized over the asset's estimated useful
life. Capitalized interest cost was $0.3 million in each of 2003, 2002, and
2001.

6. Debt:

      In connection with its bankruptcy filing on December 31, 2003, the Company
obtained debtor-in-possession financing which expires at the end of 2004 that
provides for borrowings up to $30.0 million depending on levels of the Company's
inventory and receivables. This agreement, the terms of which are substantially
the same as the pre-petition credit agreement it replaced, provides for a
monthly commitment fee based on the average daily unused portion of the
commitment equal to three-eighths of one percent and a monthly servicing fee of
approximately three thousand dollars. This financing agreement contains certain
covenants, which include the maintenance of a minimum tangible net worth and
EBITDA. It also includes restrictions on the incurrence of additional debt and
limitations on capital expenditures. The Company was in compliance with these
covenants at December 31, 2003. While the Company expects it will be able to
meet these covenants during the balance of 2004, there can be no assurances of
continued compliance. Borrowings under this facility are collateralized by
inventory and receivables. At December 31, 2003, based on the level of
receivables and inventory, $22.4 million was available under this facility.
There were $10.2 million in borrowings outstanding under this facility at
December 31, 2003 and no borrowings outstanding at December 31, 2002. The
facility also provides for standby letters of credit, the outstanding amount of
which was $4.1 million and $1.8 million at December 31, 2003 and 2002,
respectively.

      Long-term debt consists of the following (in thousands):

                                             December 31,      December 31,

      -----------------------------------------------------------------------

      On August 3, 1998, the Company issued $100 million of 8 5/8% Senior Notes
maturing August 1, 2008 priced at 99.505 to yield 8.70%. The Senior Notes are
redeemable at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time on or
after August 1, 2003 at predetermined redemption prices (ranging from 104% to
100%), plus accrued and unpaid interest to date of redemption. The Indenture
under which the notes were issued includes certain restrictions on additional
indebtedness and uses of cash, including dividend payments. During 2003, the
Company and the trustee of the indenture governing the Company's 8 5/8% Senior
Notes Due 2008 amended the indenture, and sufficient note holders consented to
amendments, to explicitly permit the Company to take steps in connection with
preparing and filing its prepackaged plan of reorganization under Chapter 11 of
the Bankruptcy Code.

In developing the overall expected long-term return on plan assets assumption, a
building block approach was used in which rates of return in excess of inflation
were considered separately for equity securities, debt securities, and other
assets. The excess returns were weighted by the representative target allocation
and added along with an appropriate rate of inflation to develop the overall
expected long-term return on plan assets assumption. The Company believes this
determination is consistent with SFAS 87.

Assumed healthcare cost trend rates as of year-end were as follows:

The Company has developed an investment strategy for the pension plans. The
investment strategy is to emphasize total return; that is, the aggregate return
from capital appreciation and dividend and interest income. The primary
objective of the investment management for the plan's assets is the emphasis on
consistent growth; specifically, growth in a manner that protects the Plan's
assets from excessive volatility in market value from year to year. The
investment policy takes into consideration the benefit obligations, including
timing of distributions.

The primary objective for the plan is to provide long-term capital appreciation
through investment in equity and debt securities. The Company's target asset
allocation is consistent with the weighted - average allocation at December 31,
2003.

The Company selects professional money managers whose investment policies are
consistent with the Company's investment strategy and monitors their performance
against appropriate benchmarks.

14.  Major Customers:

      Substantially all the Company's sales are to select flooring distributors
and retailers located in the United States and Canada. Economic and market
conditions, as well as the individual financial condition of each customer, are
considered when establishing allowances for losses from doubtful accounts.

      Two customers, LaSalle-Bristol Corporation and Mohawk Industries, Inc.,
accounted for 24% and 41%, respectively, of the Company's net sales for the year
ended December 31, 2003, 23% and 36%, respectively, for the year ended December
31, 2002, and 25% and 23%, respectively, for the year ended December 31, 2001.

15. Environmental and Other Liabilities:

      The Company records a liability for environmental remediation claims when
a cleanup program or claim payment becomes probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated. As assessments and cleanup programs progress, these
liabilities are adjusted based upon the progress in determining the timing and
extent of remedial actions and the related costs and damages. The recorded
liabilities are not reduced by the amount of insurance recoveries. Such
estimated insurance recoveries approximated $2.8 million and $2.2 million at
December 31, 2003 and 2002, respectively, and are reflected in other noncurrent
assets and are considered probable of recovery.

      The Company is named, together with a large number (in most cases,
hundreds) of other companies, as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") in
pending proceedings under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, ("CERCLA"), and similar state laws.
In addition, in four other instances, although not named as a PRP, the Company
has received a request for information. These pending proceedings currently
relate to four disposal sites in New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Maryland and
Connecticut in which recovery from generators of hazardous substances is sought
for the cost of cleaning up the contaminated waste sites. The Company's ultimate
liability in connection with those sites depends on many factors, including the
volume of material contributed to the site, the number of other PRP's and their
financial viability, the remediation methods and technology to be used and the
extent to which costs may be recoverable from insurance. However, under CERCLA
and certain other laws, the Company, as a PRP, can be held jointly and severally
liable for all environmental costs associated with a site.

      The most significant exposure to which the Company has been named a PRP
relates to a recycling facility site in Elkton, Maryland. The PRP group at this
site is made up of 81 companies, substantially all of which are large
financially solvent entities. Two removal actions were substantially complete as
of December 31, 1998; however, the groundwater remediation phase has not begun
and the remedial investigation/feasibility study related to the groundwater
remediation has not been approved. The PRP group estimated that future costs of
groundwater remediation, based on engineering and consultant studies conducted,
would be approximately $26 million. Congoleum's proportionate share, based on
waste disposed at the site, is estimated to be approximately 5.8%.

      The Company also accrues remediation costs for certain of the Company's
owned facilities on an undiscounted basis. The Company has entered into an
administrative consent order with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and has self-guaranteed certain remediation funding sources and
financial responsibilities. Estimated total cleanup costs, including capital
outlays and future maintenance costs for soil and groundwater remediation are
primarily based on engineering studies.

      The outcome of these matters could result in significant expenses or
judgments that could have a material adverse effect on the financial position of
the Company.

16. Asbestos Liabilities:

      Claims Settlement and Chapter 11 Reorganization

      In early 2003 the Company announced that it was seeking to resolve its
asbestos liabilities through confirmation of a pre-packaged plan of
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

      In furtherance of the agreement in principle, the Company entered into a
settlement agreement with various asbestos claimants (the "Claimant Agreement").
As contemplated by the Claimant Agreement, the Company also entered into
agreements establishing a pre-petition trust (the "Collateral Trust") to
distribute funds in accordance with the terms of the Claimant Agreement, and
granting the Collateral Trust a security interest in its rights under applicable
insurance coverage and payments from insurers for asbestos claims.

      The Claimant Agreement established a compensable disease valuation matrix
(the "Matrix") and allows claimants who qualify and participate in the Claimant
Agreement to settle their claim for the Matrix value secured in part (75%) by
the security interest in the collateral granted to the Collateral Trust. The
Collateral Trust provides for distribution of trust assets according to various
requirements that give priority (subject to aggregate distribution limits) to
participating claimants who had pre-existing unfunded settlement agreements
("pre-existing settlement agreements") with the Company and participating
claimants who qualify for payment under unfunded settlement agreements entered
into by the Company with plaintiffs that have asbestos claims pending against
the Company and which claims are scheduled for trial after the effective date of
the Claimant Agreement but prior to the commencement of the Company's
anticipated Chapter 11 reorganization case ("trial-listed settlement
agreements").

      The Claimant Agreement settled claims pertaining to pre-existing
settlement agreements or trial-listed settlement agreements for a fully secured
claim against the Collateral Trust, and it settled all other claims for a
secured claim against the Collateral Trust equal to 75% of the claim value and
an unsecured claim against Congoleum for the remaining 25%. Under the proposed
plan, after the establishment of the Plan Trust (as defined below), the assets
in the Collateral Trust would be transferred to the Plan Trust. The Company
expects that any claims contemplated by the Claimant Agreement that are
unsatisfied as of the confirmation of the plan of reorganization by the
Bankruptcy Court would be channeled to be paid in accordance with the Plan
Trust.

      In October 2003, the Company began soliciting acceptances for its
pre-packaged plan of reorganization, and received the votes necessary for
acceptance of the plan in late December 2003.


                                      C-27
<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      The Company's proposed plan of reorganization provides for, among other
things, an assignment of certain rights in, and proceeds of, the Company's
applicable insurance to a trust that will be established upon confirmation of
the Company's proposed plan of reorganization (the "Plan Trust"), which would
fund the settlement of all pending and future asbestos claims and protect the
Company from future asbestos-related litigation by channeling all asbestos
claims to the Plan Trust under Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code.
Congoleum's other creditors are unimpaired under the proposed plan and will be
paid in the ordinary course of business. In January 2004, the Bankruptcy Court
approved payment of pre-petition obligations to trade creditors in the ordinary
course of business.

      The Company expects to issue a promissory note (the "Company Note") to the
Plan Trust as part of the Company's proposed plan of reorganization. Under the
terms of the proposed plan, the original principal amount of the Company Note
will be $2,738,234.75 (the "Original Principal Amount") and will be subject to
increase as of the later of June 30, 2005 and the last trading day of the 90
consecutive trading day period commencing on the first anniversary of the
effective date of the Company's confirmed pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan of
reorganization (the "Principal Adjustment Date") in an amount equal to the
excess, if any, of the amount by which 51% of the Company's market
capitalization as of the Principal Adjustment Date (based upon (subject to
certain exceptions) the total number of shares of the Company's common stock
outstanding as of such date multiplied by the average of the closing trading
prices of the Company's Class A common stock for the 90 consecutive trading days
ending on the Principal Adjustment Date) exceeds the Original Principal Amount
(the "Additional Principal Amount"), plus any accrued but unpaid interest or
other amounts that may be added to such principal amount pursuant to the terms
of the Company Note. Under the terms of the proposed plan, interest on
outstanding principal of the Company Note will accrue at a rate of 9% per annum,
interest on the Original Principal Amount will accrue and be payable quarterly
and interest on the Additional Principal Amount will accrue quarterly and be
added to the Additional Principal Amount as additional principal. Upon the
earlier of August 1, 2008 and the date that all of the Senior Notes are repaid
in full, interest on the then outstanding Additional Principal Amount will then
accrue and be payable quarterly.

      Under the terms of the proposed plan of reorganization all principal on
the Company Note then outstanding together with any accrued but unpaid interest
will be payable in full on the tenth anniversary of the date of the Company
Note, subject to the right of the Plan Trust to accelerate all amounts then owed
on the Company Note following an uncured event of default under the Company
Note. Events of default under the Company Note would include the failure to pay
interest and principal prior to the expiration of a 10-day grace period
following the applicable due date, the occurrence of an event of default under
the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the breach by the Company of any
covenant or agreement contained in the Company Note which remains uncured 30
days following notice by the Plan Trust to the Company and ABI of the breach and
a material breach of the pledge agreement (the "ABI Pledge Agreement") by ABI
(which agreement is discussed below) which remains uncured 30 days following
notice by the Plan Trust to ABI and the Company of the breach. The terms of the
Company Note would provide that, upon the occurrence of an event of default
under the Company Note, the Company and ABI would have 10 days from the date
they receive notice that an event of default has occurred to cure the event of
default. If the event of default remains uncured after the 10-day cure period,
the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company Note together with any
accrued but unpaid interest thereon would become immediately due and payable if

the event of default relates to an uncured event of default of the indenture
governing the Company's Senior Notes, and with regard to other events of default
of the Company Note, the Plan Trust may, upon notice to the Company and ABI,
declare the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company Note together
with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon to be immediately due and payable.
The Plan Trust's rights to payment under the Company Note will be subordinate
and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all amounts
owing and payable pursuant to the Senior Notes and the Company's credit
facility, except that regularly scheduled interest payments under the Company
Note are expected to be payable by the Company so long as no default or event of
default has occurred or is continuing under the indenture governing the
Company's Senior Notes or the Company's credit facility.

      The proposed plan of reorganization contemplates that, pursuant to the ABI
Pledge Agreement, ABI will pledge all of the shares of the Company's common
stock that ABI owns, together with any other equity interests and rights ABI may
own or hold in the Company, as of the date of the Company Note, as collateral
for the Company's obligations under the Company Note. As additional security for
the Company Note, the ABI Pledge Agreement and the terms of the Company's
proposed plan of reorganization provide that any amounts that the Plan Trust
would be obligated to pay ABI pursuant to any rights of indemnity that ABI may
have against the Plan Trust for asbestos-related claims pursuant to the
Company's pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or a certain Joint
Venture Agreement, entered into in 1992, as to which both the Company and ABI
are parties to (as amended, the "Joint Venture Agreement"), will not be paid by
the Plan Trust until after any amounts due and payable to the Plan Trust under
the Company Note have been paid in full to the Plan Trust. Until such time, any
such indemnity payments that would otherwise have been payable by the Plan Trust
to ABI, would be set aside by the Plan Trust and held in escrow by the Plan
Trust for ABI's benefit and pledged by ABI as additional collateral securing the
Company's obligations under the Company Note until released from such escrow and
paid to ABI, as further provided under the Company's proposed plan of
reorganization, the Company Note and the ABI Pledge Agreement.

      The Company Note, the ABI Pledge Agreement and the Company's proposed plan
of reorganization also provide that the Company would be prohibited from making
any payments to ABI pursuant to any rights of indemnity that ABI may have
against the Company for claims pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement until
after any amounts due and payable to the Plan Trust under the Company Note have
been paid in full to the Plan Trust. Until such time, any such indemnity
payments that would otherwise have been payable to ABI by the Plan Trust, will
be paid by the Company to the Plan Trust and the Plan Trust will set aside and
hold in escrow such amounts for ABI's benefit and ABI will pledge such amounts
as additional collateral securing the Company's obligations under the Company
Note until released from such escrow and paid to ABI, as further provided under
the Company's pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, the Company Note
and the ABI Pledge Agreement.

      Under the proposed plan of reorganization ABI would be permitted to prepay
the principal amount of the Company Note, in whole but not in part, without any
penalty or premium at any time following the Principal Adjustment Date and any
interest that may have accrued but not yet paid at the time of any principal
repayment would be due and payable at the time of the principal repayment. The
Company would be obligated to repay ABI for any amounts paid by ABI pursuant to
the Company Note, which repayment obligation would by evidenced by a promissory


                                      C-29
<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


note or notes to be issued by the Company to ABI. Any such note would have
similar payment terms as those expected to be afforded to the Plan Trust with
regard to the Company Note, which rights of repayment are expected to be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all
amounts owing and payable to the Plan Trust with regard to the Company Note and
with regard to amounts owing and payable pursuant to the Senior Notes and credit
facility, except that the right of full subordination with regard to the Senior
Notes and credit facility would contain an exception that would allow the
Company to make regularly scheduled interest payments to ABI pursuant to any
such note so long as no default or event of default has occurred or is
continuing under the indenture or the Company's credit facility.

      The proposed plan of reorganization also provides that if ABI prepays the
Company Note and ABI sells all or substantially all of the shares of the
Company's stock that it holds as of the Principal Adjustment Date during the
three-year period following such date, ABI would be obligated to make a
contribution to the Plan Trust if the equity value of the Company implied by the
price paid to ABI for the shares of the Company's stock exceeded the greater of
$2,738,234.75 or 51% of the Company's market capitalization as of the Principal
Adjustment Date (based upon (subject to certain exceptions) the total number of
shares of the Company's common stock outstanding as of such date multiplied by
the average of the closing trading prices of the Company's Class A common stock
for the 90 consecutive trading days ending on the Principal Adjustment Date). In
such instance, the proposed plan would obligate ABI to pay to the Plan Trust an
amount equal to 50% of such excess amount. Under the terms of the Company's
proposed plan of reorganization, the Company would be obligated to repay ABI for
any amounts paid by ABI to the Plan Trust pursuant to this obligation. In
satisfaction of this repayment obligation, the Company would issue a promissory
note to ABI in a principal amount equal to the amount of any such payments made
by ABI plus any accrued but unpaid interest or other amounts that may be added
to such principal amount pursuant to the terms of the promissory note which
would be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in
full of all amounts owing and payable pursuant to the Senior Notes and credit
facility, except that regularly scheduled interest payments could be paid on
such note so long as no default or event of default has occurred or is
continuing under the indenture governing the Senior Notes or the Company's
credit facility.

      The proposed plan provides that the Plan Trust would be able to transfer
the Company Note, in whole but not in part, at any time following the Principal
Adjustment Date. Upon any transfer of the Company Note, the amounts pledged by
ABI and held in escrow by the Plan Trust for ABI's benefit with regard to ABI's
indemnity rights discussed above, will be paid by the Plan Trust, first, to the
Plan Trust in repayment of principal then outstanding on the Company Note
together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and, second, any amounts
remaining would be distributed by the Plan Trust to ABI.

      ABI has agreed to make a cash contribution in the amount of $250 thousand
to the Plan Trust upon the formation of the Plan Trust. As previously discussed,
under the expected terms of the Company's proposed plan of reorganization, ABI
would receive certain relief as may be afforded under section 524(g)(4) of the
Bankruptcy Code from asbestos claims that derive from claims made against the
Company, which claims are expected to be channeled to the Plan Trust. However,
the proposed plan of reorganization does not provide that any other asbestos
claims that may be asserted against ABI would be channeled to the Plan Trust.

      While the Company believes its proposed pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan is
feasible and should be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, there are sufficient
risks and uncertainties such that no assurances of the outcome can be given. In
addition, the costs to effect the reorganization process, consisting principally
of legal and advisory fees and contributions to the Plan Trust, including one or
more notes expected to be contributed to the Plan Trust by the Company are
expected to be approximately $25 million at a minimum. Of this estimated amount,
the Company paid, during the year December 31, 2003, $18.8 million for legal
fees, indemnity settlements and reorganization costs related to asbestos
litigation.

      Pending Asbestos Claims

      The Company has been served notice that it is one of many defendants in
approximately 22 thousand pending lawsuits (including workers' compensation
cases) involving approximately 106 thousand individuals as of December 31, 2003,
alleging personal injury or death from exposure to asbestos or
asbestos-containing products. There were approximately 16 thousand lawsuits at
December 31, 2002 that involved approximately 57 thousand individuals. Activity
related to asbestos claims was as follows:

      Nearly all asbestos-related claims that have been brought against the
Company to date allege that various diseases were caused by exposure to
asbestos-containing products, including resilient sheet vinyl and tile
manufactured by the Company (or, in the workers' compensation cases, exposure to
asbestos in the course of employment with the Company). The Company discontinued
the manufacture of asbestos-containing sheet products in 1983 and
asbestos-containing tile products in 1974. In general, governmental authorities
have determined that asbestos-containing sheet and tile products are nonfriable
(i.e., cannot be crumbled by hand pressure) because the asbestos was
encapsulated in the products during the manufacturing process. Thus,
governmental authorities have concluded that these products do not pose a health
risk when they are properly maintained in place or properly removed so that they
remain nonfriable. The Company has issued warnings not to remove
asbestos-containing flooring by sanding or other methods that may cause the
product to become friable.

      Status of Insurance Coverage

      During the period that Congoleum produced asbestos-containing products,
the Company purchased primary and excess insurance policies providing in excess
of $1 billion coverage for general and product liability claims. Through August
2002, substantially all asbestos-related claims and defense costs were paid
through primary insurance coverage. In August 2002, the Company received notice
that its primary insurance coverage was exhausted. The exhaustion of limits by
one of the primary insurance companies was based on its contention that limits
in successive policies were not cumulative for asbestos claims and that
Congoleum was limited to only one policy limit for multiple years of coverage.
Certain excess insurance carriers claimed that the non-cumulation provisions of
the primary policies were not binding on them and that there remained an
additional $13 million in indemnity coverage plus related defense costs before
their policies were implicated. On April 10, 2003, the New Jersey Supreme Court
ruled in another case involving the same non-cumulation provisions as in the
Congoleum primary policies (the "Spaulding Case") that the non-cumulation
provisions are invalid under New Jersey law and that the primary policies
provide coverage for the full amount of their annual limits for all successive
policies. Although Congoleum is not a party to this case, the decision in the
Spaulding Case is likely binding on Congoleum and its primary insurance
companies. Thus, based on the Spaulding Case decision, the primary insurance
companies are obligated to provide the additional coverage previously disputed
by the excess carriers. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had entered into
additional settlement agreements with asbestos claimants exceeding the amount of
previously disputed coverage. While the excess carriers have objected to the
reasonableness of several of these settlements, Congoleum believes that the
primary insurance company will now cover these settlements. Notwithstanding that
the primary insurance company will likely pay these settlements, Congoleum also
believes that the excess carriers will continue to dispute the reasonableness of
the settlements and contend that their policies still are not implicated and
will dispute their coverage for that and other various reasons in ongoing
coverage litigation and have also raised various objections to the Company's
planned reorganization strategy and negotiations.

      The excess insurance carriers have objected to the global settlement of
the asbestos claims currently pending against Congoleum ("Claimant Agreement")
on the grounds that, among other things, the negotiations leading to the
settlement and the Claimant Agreement violate provisions in their insurance
policies, including but not limited to the carriers' right to associate in the
defense of the asbestos cases, the duty of Congoleum to cooperate with the
carriers and the right of the carriers to consent to any settlement, and also
contend the Claimant Agreement is not fair, reasonable or in good faith.
Congoleum disputes the allegations and contentions of the excess insurance
carriers. On Friday, November 7, 2003, the court denied a motion for summary
judgment by the excess insurance carriers that the Claimant Agreement was not
fair, reasonable or in good faith, ruling that material facts concerning these
issues were in dispute. Discovery continues in the coverage litigation.

      Given the actions of its excess insurance carriers, the Company believes
it likely that, pending settlement with or payment of re-opened limits by the
primary policies, it will have to continue funding asbestos-related expenses for
defense expense and indemnity itself. However, litigation by asbestos claimants
against the Company is stayed pursuant to the Company's bankruptcy, and the
Company does not anticipate its future expenditures for defense and indemnity of
asbestos related claims, other than expenditures pursuant to its proposed (or an
alternative) plan of reorganization, will be significant.

      Payments Related to Asbestos Claims

      The following table sets forth amounts paid to defend and settle claims:

      (in millions)                                      Year Ended December 31,
                                                           2003          2002
                                                           ----          ----

      Indemnity costs paid by the Company's
           insurance carriers                               $0.0         $1.3

      Indemnity costs paid by the Company                    0.8          2.7

      Defense costs paid by the Company                      4.5          1.4

      The amounts shown in the above table do not include non-cash settlements
using assignments of insurance proceeds, which amounted to $477 million in 2003
and $14.4 million in 2002.

      The Company's primary insurance carriers paid defense costs in addition to
the above amounts through August 2002. Such amounts were not reported to the
Company by year of payment, and have not been included in the table.

      At December 31, 2003, there were no additional settlements outstanding
that the Company had agreed to fund other than settlements pursuant to the
Claimant Agreement.

      The Company is seeking recovery from its insurance carriers of the amounts
it has paid for defense and indemnity, and intends to seek recovery for any
future payments of defense and indemnity. In light of the planned assignment of
or grant of a security interest in certain rights in and proceeds of its
applicable insurance to the Collateral Trust and the planned reorganization, the
Company does not anticipate recovering these costs from the insurance companies.

      Accounting for Asbestos-Related Claims

      Under the terms of the Claimant Agreement, the Company's claims processing
agent processed 79,630 claims meeting the requirements of the Claimant Agreement
with a settlement value of $466 million. In addition, pre-existing settlements
agreements and trial listed settlement agreements with claims secured by the
collateral trust total $25 million.

      The Company's gross liability of $491 million for these settlements is
substantially in excess of both the total assets of the Company as well as the
Company's previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for
both known and unasserted claims. The Company believes that it does not have the
necessary financial resources to litigate and/or fund judgments and/or
settlements of the asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business.
Therefore, the Company believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss
due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the Plan
Trust plus the costs to effect its reorganization under Chapter 11. The Company

<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT C TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


estimates the minimum remaining amount of the contributions and costs to be $9.8
million, which it has recorded as a current liability. During the fourth quarter
of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of $3.7 million to increase its recorded
liability to the minimum estimated amount. The maximum amount of the range of
possible asbestos-related losses is limited to the going concern or liquidation
value of the Company, an amount which the Company believes is substantially less
than the minimum gross liability for the known claims against it.

      The Company has not attempted to make an estimate of its probable
insurance recoveries given the accounting for its estimate of future
asbestos-related costs. Substantially all future insurance recoveries have been
assigned to the Collateral or Plan Trust.

17. Stock Option Plans:

      Under the Company's 1995 Stock Option Plan, as amended, (the "1995 Plan")
options to purchase up to 800,000 shares of the Company's Class A common stock
may be issued to officers and key employees. Such options may be either
incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options, and the options' exercise
price must be at least equal to the fair value of the Company's Class A common
stock on the date of grant. All options granted under the 1995 Plan have
ten-year terms and vest over five years at the rate of 20% per year beginning on
the first anniversary of the date of grant.

      On July 1, 1999, the Company established its 1999 Stock Option Plan for
Non-Employee Directors, as amended (the "1999 Plan"), under which non-employee
directors may be granted options to purchase up to 50,000 shares of the
Company's Class A common stock. Options granted under the 1999 Plan have
ten-year terms and vest six months from the grant date.

      In December 2001, the Company offered its eligible option holders an
exchange of all options then outstanding and granted to them under the 1995 Plan
or the 1999 Plan for new stock options to be granted under those plans not
earlier than six months and one day after the date the Company canceled any
options tendered to and accepted by it pursuant to the offer to exchange. On
January 4, 2002, the Company accepted and canceled 667,500 options that had been
previously granted under the 1995 Plan and 9,500 options that had been
previously granted under the 1999 Plan that were tendered to and accepted by the
Company pursuant to the offer to exchange.

      On July 11, 2002, the Company issued 665,500 options under the 1995 Plan
and 9,500 options under the 1999 Plan at an exercise price of $2.05 per share
pursuant to the exchange. The new options granted under the 1995 Plan will
generally vest annually in equal installments over a five-year period beginning
on the first anniversary of the date of grant, and the new options granted under
the 1999 Plan will generally vest fully six months from the date of grant.

      On February 1, 2003, the Company issued 28,000 options under the 1995 Plan
at an exercise price of $0.36 per share. The new options granted under the 1995
Plan will generally vest annually in equal installments over five year period
beginning on the first anniversary of the date of the grant.

      On July 1, 2003, the Company issued 2,500 options under the 1999 Plan at
an exercise price of $0.75 per share. The new options granted under the 1999
Plan will generally vest fully six months from the date of grant.

      The weighted average grant date fair value of options granted under the
1999 Plan in 2003, 2002, and 2001 was $0.75, $1.20 and $1.67, respectively.

18. Stockholders' Equity:

      Holders of shares of the Company's Class B common stock are entitled to
two votes per share on all matters submitted to a vote of stockholders other
than certain extraordinary matters. The holders of shares of the Company's Class
A common stock are entitled to one vote per share on all matters submitted to a
vote of stockholders.

      In November 1998, the Board of Directors authorized the Company to
repurchase an additional $5.0 million of the Company's common stock (Class A and
Class B shares) through the open market or through privately negotiated
transactions, bringing the total authorized common share repurchases to $15.0
million. Under the total plan, Congoleum has repurchased shares of its common
stock at an aggregate cost of $14.0 million through December 31, 2003. No shares
were repurchased during 2003 or 2002. Shares of Class B stock repurchased
(totaling 741,055 shares) have been retired. As of December 31, 2003, American
Biltrite Inc. owned 151,100 Class A shares and 4,395,605 Class B shares that
represented an aggregate 69.5% of the voting interest of the Company.

19. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

      The Company's cash and cash equivalents, short-term investments, accounts
receivable, accounts payable and long-term debt are financial instruments. With
the exception of the Company's long-term debt, the carrying value of these
financial instruments approximates their fair value at December 31, 2003 and
2002. The Company's long-term debt had a book value of $99.7 million and a fair
market value of $65.0 million at December 31, 2003. The Company's long-term debt
had a book value of $99.7 million and a fair market value of $45.0 million at
December 31, 2002.

      The fair value of the Company's long-term debt is determined based on
quoted market values. The fair value of the Company's other financial
instruments is determined based on discounted cash flows. Due to the short
period over which the cash flows are expected to be realized, the carrying value
of the financial instruments approximates the net present value of cash flows
and changes in interest rate assumptions would not have a material effect on the
calculation.

                              CONGOLEUM CORPORATION
         NOTES TO UNAUDITED CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
                               September 30, 2004
                                   (Unaudited)

1.    Basis of Presentation

      The accompanying unaudited condensed consolidated financial statements
have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted
in the United States for interim financial information and with Rule 10-01 of
Regulation S-X. Accordingly, they do not include all of the information and
footnotes required by accounting principles generally accepted in the United
States for complete financial statements. In the opinion of management, all
adjustments (consisting of normal and recurring adjustments) considered
necessary for a fair presentation of Congoleum Corporation's (the "Company" or
"Congoleum") consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash
flows have been included. Operating results for the three and nine-month periods
ended September 30, 2004 are not necessarily indicative of the results that may
be expected for the year ending December 31, 2004. For further information,
refer to the consolidated financial statements and related footnotes included in
the Company's Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2003.

      Based upon the nature of the Company's operations, facilities and
management structure, the Company considers its business to constitute a single
segment for financial reporting purposes.

      Certain amounts appearing in the prior period's condensed consolidated
financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current period's
presentation.

      The financial statements of Congoleum have been prepared on a going
concern basis, which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction
of liabilities in the normal course of business. Accordingly, the financial
statements do not include any adjustments that might be necessary should the
Company be unable to continue as a going concern. As described more fully below
and in Note 6, there is substantial doubt about the Company's ability to
continue as a going concern unless it obtains relief from its substantial
asbestos liabilities through a successful reorganization under Chapter 11 of the
United States Bankruptcy Code (the "Bankruptcy Code").

      On December 31, 2003, Congoleum filed a voluntary petition with the United
States Bankruptcy Court for the District of New Jersey (Case No. 03-51524)
seeking relief under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code as a means to resolve
claims asserted against it related to the use of asbestos in its products
decades ago. During 2003, Congoleum obtained the requisite votes of asbestos
personal injury claimants necessary to seek approval of a proposed, pre-packaged
Chapter 11 plan of reorganization. In January 2004, the Company filed its
proposed plan of reorganization and disclosure statement with the Bankruptcy
Court. On November 8, 2004 Congoleum filed a modified plan of reorganization and
related documents with the Bankruptcy Court reflecting the result of further
negotiations with representatives of the Asbestos Creditors' Committee, the
Future Claimants representative and other asbestos claimant representatives. The
Bankruptcy Court has scheduled a hearing to consider approval of the disclosure

statement and plan voting procedures for December 9, 2004. There can be no
assurance that the disclosure statement hearing will not be rescheduled to a
later date, or that the proposed plan of reorganization will not be modified
further. Congoleum is presently involved in litigation with certain insurance
carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related
liabilities, and certain insurance carriers filed various objections to
Congoleum's previously proposed plan of reorganization and related matters.
There can be no assurances that these or other insurance carriers will not file
objections to the recently filed modified plan of reorganization.

      The proposed modified plan of reorganization, if confirmed, would leave
non-asbestos creditors unimpaired and would resolve all pending and future
asbestos claims against the Company. The proposed modified plan of
reorganization would provide, among other things, for an assignment of certain
rights in, and proceeds of, Congoleum's applicable insurance to a trust (the
"Plan Trust") that would fund the settlement of all pending and future asbestos
claims and protect the Company from future asbestos-related claims and
litigation by channeling all asbestos claims to the Plan Trust pursuant to the
provisions of Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. Other creditors would be
unimpaired under the plan. The Company anticipates that it will take until the
second quarter of 2005 to obtain confirmation of its proposed plan of
reorganization. There can be no assurance that the proposed plan will not be
modified again.

      Based on its reorganization, the Company has made provision in its
financial statements for the minimum amount of the range of estimates for its
contribution and costs to effect the proposed plan to settle asbestos
liabilities through a Plan Trust established pursuant to the provisions of
Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. The Company recorded a charge of $17.3
million in the fourth quarter of 2002 and an additional $3.7 million in the
fourth quarter of 2003 to provide for the estimated minimum costs of completing
its reorganization. Actual amounts that will be contributed to the Plan Trust
and costs for pursuing and implementing the plan of reorganization could be
materially higher, and the Company may record significant additional charges
should the minimum estimated cost increase.

      For more information regarding the Company's asbestos liability and plan
for resolving that liability, please refer to Note 6 of the Notes to Unaudited
Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements. There can be no assurance that the
Company will be successful in realizing its goals in this regard or in obtaining
confirmation of its proposed plan of reorganization. As a result, any
alternative plan of reorganization pursued by the Company or confirmed by the
Bankruptcy Court could vary significantly from the description in this report
and the estimated costs and contributions to effect the contemplated plan of
reorganization could be significantly greater than currently estimated. Any plan
of reorganization pursued by the Company will be subject to numerous conditions,
approvals and other requirements, including Bankruptcy Court approval, and there
can be no assurance that such conditions, approvals and other requirements will
be satisfied or obtained. Delays in getting the Company's plan of reorganization
approved by the Bankruptcy Court could result in a proceeding that takes longer
and is more costly than the Company has estimated.

      AICPA Statement of Position 90-7, "Financial Reporting by Entities in
Reorganization under the Bankruptcy Code" ("SOP 90-7"), provides financial
reporting guidance for entities that are reorganizing under the Bankruptcy Code.
The Company has implemented this guidance in its consolidated financial
statements for periods commencing after December 31, 2003.

      Pursuant to SOP 90-7, companies are required to segregate pre-petition
liabilities that are subject to compromise and report them separately on the
balance sheet. Liabilities that may be affected by a plan of reorganization are
recorded at the amount of the expected allowed claims, even if they may be
settled for lesser amounts. Liabilities for asbestos claims are recorded based
upon the minimum amount the Company expects to spend for its contribution to,
and costs to settle asbestos liabilities through, a Plan Trust established under
Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. Obligations arising post-petition, and
pre-petition obligations that are secured or that the Bankruptcy Court has
authorized the Company to pay, are not classified as liabilities subject to
compromise. Other pre-petition claims (liabilities subject to compromise) may
arise due to the rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases, or as a
result of the allowance of contingent or disputed claims.

2.    Recent Accounting Principles

      In January 2003, the FASB issued FASB Interpretation No. 46 (FIN 46),
Consolidation of Variable Interest Entities, an Interpretation of ARB No. 51,
which addresses consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest
entities ("VIEs"). In December 2003, the FASB completed deliberations of
proposed modifications to FIN 46 ("Revised Interpretation") resulting in
multiple effective dates based on the nature as well as the creation date of the
VIE. The adoption of FIN 46 and the Revised Interpretation had no impact on the
Company's consolidated financial statements.

      The Company discloses stock-based compensation information in accordance
with FASB Statement No. 148 ("SFAS 148"), "Accounting for Stock-Based
Compensation--Transition and Disclosure--an Amendment of FASB Statement No. 123"
and Statement No. 123 ("SFAS 123"), "Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation."
SFAS 148 provides additional transition guidance for companies that elect to
voluntarily adopt the provisions of SFAS 123. SFAS 148 does not change the
provisions of SFAS 123 that permit companies to continue to apply the intrinsic
value method of Accounting Principles Board Opinion No. 25 ("APB 25"),
"Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees." The Company has elected to continue
to account for its stock-based plans under APB 25, as well as to provide
disclosure of stock-based compensation as outlined in SFAS 123 as amended by
SFAS 148.

4.    Income / (Loss) Per Share

      Basic net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net loss by
the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period.
Diluted net income (loss) per share is calculated by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of shares of common stock and common stock equivalents
outstanding during the period.

5.    Environmental and Other Liabilities

      The Company records a liability for environmental remediation claims when
a cleanup program or claim payment becomes probable and the costs can be
reasonably estimated in accordance with SOP 96-1. As assessments and cleanup
programs progress, these liabilities are adjusted based upon the progress in
determining the timing and extent of remedial actions and the related costs and
damages. The recorded liabilities are not reduced by the amount of insurance
recoveries. Such estimated insurance recoveries are reflected in other
non-current assets and are considered probable of recovery.

      The Company is named, together with a large number (in most cases,
hundreds) of other companies, as a potentially responsible party ("PRP") in
pending proceedings under the federal Comprehensive Environmental Response,
Compensation and Liability Act, as amended, ("CERCLA"), and similar state laws.
In addition, in four other instances, although not named as a PRP, the Company
has received a request for information. The pending proceedings relate to eight
disposal sites in New Jersey, Maryland and Pennsylvania in which recovery from
generators of hazardous substances is sought for the cost of cleaning up the
contaminated waste sites. The Company's ultimate liability in connection with
those sites depends on many factors, including the volume of material
contributed to the site, the number of other PRP's and their financial
viability, the remediation methods and technology to be used and the extent to
which costs may be recoverable from insurance. However, under CERCLA and certain
other laws, the Company, as a PRP, can be held jointly and severally liable for
all environmental costs associated with a site.

      The most significant exposure to which the Company has been named a PRP
relates to a recycling facility site in Elkton, Maryland. The PRP group at this
site is made up of 81 companies, substantially all of which are large
financially solvent entities. Two removal actions were substantially complete as
of December 31, 1998; however, the groundwater remediation phase has not begun
and the remedial investigation/feasibility study related to the groundwater
remediation has not been approved. The PRP group estimated that future costs of
groundwater remediation, based on engineering and consultant studies conducted,
would be approximately $26 million. Congoleum's proportionate share, based on
waste disposed at the site, is estimated to be approximately 5.8%.

      The Company also accrues remediation costs for certain of the Company's
owned facilities on an undiscounted basis. The Company has entered into an
administrative consent order with the New Jersey Department of Environmental
Protection and has self-guaranteed certain remediation funding sources and
financial responsibilities. Estimated total cleanup costs, including capital
outlays and future maintenance costs for soil and groundwater remediation are
primarily based on engineering studies.

      The outcome of these matters could result in significant expenses or
judgments that could have a material adverse effect on the results of
operations, cash flows, and the financial position of the Company.

6.    Asbestos Liabilities

      Claims Settlement and Chapter 11 Reorganization

      In early 2003, the Company announced that it was seeking to resolve its
asbestos liabilities through confirmation of a pre-packaged plan of
reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, and later in 2003,
consistent with this strategy, the Company entered into a settlement agreement
with various asbestos personal injury claimants (the "Claimant Agreement"). As
contemplated by the Claimant Agreement, the Company also entered into agreements
establishing a pre-petition trust (the "Collateral Trust") to distribute funds
in accordance with the terms of the Claimant Agreement and granting the
Collateral Trust a security interest in its rights under applicable insurance
coverage and payments from insurers for asbestos claims.

      The Claimant Agreement established a compensable disease valuation matrix
(the "Matrix") and allowed claimants who qualified to participate in the
Claimant Agreement (the "Qualifying Claimants") to settle their claims for the
Matrix value, secured in part (75%) by a security interest in the collateral
granted to the Collateral Trust. The Collateral Trust provides for distribution
of trust assets according to various requirements that give priority (subject to
aggregate distribution limits) to participating claimants who had pre-existing
unfunded settlement agreements ("Pre-Existing Settlement Agreements") with the
Company and participating claimants who qualified for payment under unfunded
settlement agreements entered into by the Company with plaintiffs that had
asbestos claims pending against the Company and which claims were scheduled for
trial after the effective date of the Claimant Agreement but prior to the
commencement of the Company's anticipated Chapter 11 reorganization case
("Trial-Listed Settlement Agreements").

      The Claimant Agreement incorporated pre-existing settlement agreements and
settled certain trial-listed claims for a fully secured claim against the
Collateral Trust, and it settled all other claims for a secured claim against
the Collateral Trust equal to 75% of the claim value and an unsecured claim for
the remaining 25%. Under the proposed plan of reorganization, after the
establishment of the Plan Trust, the assets in the Collateral Trust would be
transferred to the Plan Trust. The Company expects that any claims subject to
the Claimant Agreement that are unsatisfied as of the confirmation of the plan
of reorganization by the Bankruptcy Court would be channeled to the Plan Trust.

      In October 2003, the Company began soliciting acceptances for its proposed
pre-packaged plan of reorganization and the Company received the votes necessary
for acceptance of the plan in late December 2003.

      On November 8, 2004 Congoleum announced that it had filed a modified plan
of reorganization and related documents with the Bankruptcy Court reflecting the
result of further negotiations with representatives of the Asbestos Creditors'
Committee, the Future Claimants representative and other asbestos claimant
representatives. The Bankruptcy Court has scheduled a hearing to consider
approval of the disclosure statement and plan voting procedures for December 9,
2004.

<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT D TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      The Company's proposed modified plan of reorganization provides for, among
other things, an assignment of certain rights in, and proceeds of, the Company's
applicable insurance to the Plan Trust that would fund the settlement of all
pending and future asbestos claims and protect the Company from future
asbestos-related litigation by channeling all asbestos claims to the Plan Trust
pursuant to the provisions of Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. The
Company's other creditors are unimpaired under the proposed plan and will be
paid in the ordinary course of business. There can be no assurance that the
disclosure statement will not be modified.

      There can be no assurance that the hearing will not be rescheduled to a
later date or that the proposed plan of reorganization will not be modified
further.

      Congoleum is presently involved in litigation with certain insurance
carriers related to disputed insurance coverage for asbestos related
liabilities, and certain insurance carriers filed various objections to
Congoleum's previously proposed plan of reorganization and related matters.
There can be no assurances that these or other insurance carriers will not file
objections to the recently filed modified plan of reorganization.

      Under the modified plan of reorganization and related documents,
Congoleum's assignment of insurance recoveries to the Collateral Trust is net of
costs incurred in connection with insurance coverage litigation. Congoleum is
entitled to withhold from recoveries, or seek reimbursement from the trust, for
coverage litigation costs incurred after January 1, 2003 in excess of $6 million
of coverage litigation costs. Furthermore, once insurance recoveries exceed $375
million, Congoleum is entitled to withhold from recoveries, or seek
reimbursement from the trust, for the first $6 million of coverage litigation
costs. Congoleum also paid $1.3 million in claims processing fees in connection
with claims settled under the Claimant Agreement. Congoleum is entitled to
withhold from recoveries, or seek reimbursement from the trust for the $1.3
million claims processing fee once insurance recoveries exceed $375 million.

      In connection with the modifications to the Plan and Collateral Trust,
Congoleum agreed to indemnify the Claimants Counsel and the trustee of the
Collateral Trust for all acts relating to the modification of the Plan and the
Collateral Trust, including attorneys' fees, up to a maximum of $3 million.

      The Company's proposed plan of reorganization and related documents
provide for the channeling of asbestos property damage claims in addition to
asbestos personal injury claims to the Plan Trust established pursuant to the
provisions of Section 524(g) of the Bankruptcy Code. There were no property
damage claims asserted against the Company at the time of its bankruptcy filing.
The Bankruptcy Court approved an order establishing a bar date of May 3, 2004
for the filing of asbestos property damage claims. The claims agent appointed in
the Company's bankruptcy proceeding has advised the Company that, as of the Bar
date, it received 35 timely filed asbestos property damage claims asserting
liquidated damages in the amount of approximately $0.8 million plus additional
unspecified amounts. The Company is currently reviewing the filed asbestos
property damage claims.

                                           EXHIBIT D TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      The Company expects to issue a promissory note (the "Company Note") to the
Plan Trust as part of the Company's proposed plan of reorganization. Under the
terms of the proposed plan, the original principal amount of the Company Note
will be $2,738,234.75 (the "Original Principal Amount") and will be subject to
increase as of the last trading day of the 90 consecutive trading day period
commencing on the first anniversary of the effective date of the Company's
confirmed pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization (the "Principal
Adjustment Date") in an amount equal to the excess, if any, of the amount by
which 51% of the Company's market capitalization as of the Principal Adjustment
Date (based upon (subject to certain exceptions) the total number of shares of
the Company's common stock outstanding as of such date multiplied by the average
of the closing trading prices of the Company's Class A common stock for the 90
consecutive trading days ending on the Principal Adjustment Date) exceeds the
Original Principal Amount (the "Additional Principal Amount"), plus any accrued
but unpaid interest or other amounts that may be added to such principal amount
pursuant to the terms of the Company Note. This adjustment amount could result
in the principal amount of the note increasing materially. For example, if the
adjustment amount were calculated based on the excess of 51% of the equity value
of Congoleum over $2.7 million during the 90 consecutive day trading period
ended September 30, 2004, the resulting adjustment amount would be $11 million.
Under the terms of the proposed plan, interest on the outstanding principal of
the Company Note will accrue at a rate of 9% per annum, with interest on the
Original Principal Amount payable quarterly and interest on the Additional
Principal Amount added to the Additional Principal Amount as additional
principal. Upon the earlier of August 1, 2008 and the date that all of the
Senior Notes are repaid in full, interest on the then outstanding Additional
Principal Amount will become payable quarterly.

      Under the terms of the proposed plan of reorganization all principal on
the Company Note then outstanding together with any accrued but unpaid interest
will be payable in full on the tenth anniversary of the date of the Company
Note, subject to the right of the Plan Trust to accelerate all amounts then owed
on the Company Note following an uncured event of default under the Company
Note. Events of default under the Company Note would include the failure to pay
interest and principal prior to the expiration of a 10-day grace period
following the applicable due date, the occurrence of an event of default under
the indenture governing the Senior Notes, the breach by the Company of any
covenant or agreement contained in the Company Note which remains uncured 30
days following notice by the Plan Trust to the Company and ABI of the breach and
a material breach of the pledge agreement (the "ABI Pledge Agreement") by
American Biltrite, Inc. (ABI) (which agreement is discussed below) which remains
uncured 30 days following notice by the Plan Trust to ABI and the Company of the
breach. The terms of the Company Note would provide that, upon the occurrence of
an event of default under the Company Note, the Company and ABI would have 10
days from the date they receive notice that an event of default has occurred to
cure the event of default. If the event of default remains uncured after the
10-day cure period, the aggregate outstanding principal amount of the Company
Note together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon would become
immediately due and payable if the event of default relates to an uncured event
of default of the indenture governing the Company's Senior Notes, and with
regard to other events of default of the Company Note, the Plan Trust may, upon
notice to the Company and ABI, declare the aggregate outstanding principal
amount of the Company Note together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon

to be immediately due and payable. The Plan Trust's rights to payment under the
Company Note will be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior
payment in full of all amounts owing and payable pursuant to the Senior Notes
and the Company's credit facility, except that regularly scheduled interest
payments under the Company Note are expected to be payable by the Company so
long as no default or event of default has occurred or is continuing under the
indenture governing the Company's Senior Notes or the Company's credit facility.

      The proposed plan of reorganization contemplates that, pursuant to the ABI
Pledge Agreement, ABI will pledge all of the shares of the Company's common
stock that ABI owns, together with any other equity interests and rights ABI may
own or hold in the Company, as of the date of the Company Note, as collateral
for the Company's obligations under the Company Note. As additional security for
the Company Note, the ABI Pledge Agreement and the terms of the Company's
proposed plan of reorganization provide that any amounts that the Company would
be obligated to pay ABI pursuant to any rights of indemnity that ABI may have
against the Plan Trust for asbestos-related claims pursuant to the Company's
pre-packaged Chapter 11 plan of reorganization or a certain Joint Venture
Agreement, entered into in 1992, as to which both the Company and ABI are
parties to (as amended, the "Joint Venture Agreement"), will not be paid by the
Plan Trust until after any amounts due and payable to the Plan Trust under the
Company Note have been paid in full to the Plan Trust. Until such time, any such
indemnity payments that would otherwise have been payable by the Plan Trust to
ABI, would be set aside by the Plan Trust and held in escrow by the Plan Trust
for ABI's benefit and pledged by ABI as additional collateral securing the
Company's obligations under the Company Note until released from such escrow and
paid to ABI, as further provided under the Company's proposed plan of
reorganization, the Company Note and the ABI Pledge Agreement.

      The Company Note, the ABI Pledge Agreement and the Company's proposed plan
of reorganization also provide that the Company would be prohibited from making
any payments to ABI pursuant to any rights of indemnity that ABI may have
against the Company for claims pursuant to the Joint Venture Agreement until
after any amounts due and payable to the Plan Trust under the Company Note have
been paid in full to the Plan Trust. Until such time, any such indemnity
payments that would otherwise have been payable to ABI by the Company, will be
paid by the Company to the Plan Trust and the Plan Trust will set aside and hold
in escrow such amounts for ABI's benefit and ABI will pledge such amounts as
additional collateral securing the Company's obligations under the Company Note
until released from such escrow and paid to ABI, as further provided under the
Company's modified Chapter 11 plan of reorganization, the Company Note and the
ABI Pledge Agreement.

      Under the proposed plan of reorganization ABI would be permitted to prepay
the principal amount of the Company Note, in whole but not in part, without any
penalty or premium at any time following the Principal Adjustment Date and any
interest that may have accrued but not yet paid at the time of any principal
repayment would be due and payable at the time of the principal repayment. The
Company would be obligated to repay ABI for any amounts paid by ABI pursuant to
the Company Note, which repayment obligation would by evidenced by a promissory
note or notes to be issued by the Company to ABI. Any such note would have
similar payment terms as those expected to be afforded to the Plan Trust with
regard to the Company Note, which rights of repayment are expected to be
subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in full of all


                                      D-12

amounts owing and payable to the Plan Trust with regard to the Company Note and
with regard to amounts owing and payable pursuant to the Senior Notes and credit
facility, except that the right of full subordination with regard to the Senior
Notes and credit facility would contain an exception that would allow the
Company to make regularly scheduled interest payments to ABI pursuant to any
such note so long as no default or event of default has occurred or is
continuing under the indenture or the Company's credit facility.

      The proposed plan of reorganization also provides that if ABI prepays the
Company Note and ABI sells all or substantially all of the shares of the
Company's stock that it holds as of the Principal Adjustment Date during the
three-year period following such date, ABI would be obligated to make a
contribution to the Plan Trust if the equity value of the Company implied by the
price paid to ABI for the shares of the Company's stock exceeded the greater of
$2,738,234.75 or 51% of the Company's market capitalization as of the Principal
Adjustment Date (based upon (subject to certain exceptions) the total number of
shares of the Company's common stock outstanding as of such date multiplied by
the average of the closing trading prices of the Company's Class A common stock
for the 90 consecutive trading days ending on the Principal Adjustment Date). In
such instance, the proposed plan would obligate ABI to pay to the Plan Trust an
amount equal to 50% of such excess amount. Under the terms of the Company's
proposed plan of reorganization, the Company would be obligated to repay ABI for
any amounts paid by ABI to the Plan Trust pursuant to this obligation. In
satisfaction of this repayment obligation, the Company would issue a promissory
note to ABI in a principal amount equal to the amount of any such payments made
by ABI plus any accrued but unpaid interest or other amounts that may be added
to such principal amount pursuant to the terms of the promissory note which
would be subordinate and subject in right of payment to the prior payment in
full of all amounts owing and payable pursuant to the Senior Notes and credit
facility, except that regularly scheduled interest payments could be paid on
such note so long as no default or event of default has occurred or is
continuing under the indenture governing the Senior Notes or the Company's
credit facility.

      The proposed plan provides that the Plan Trust would be able to transfer
the Company Note, in whole but not in part, at any time following the Principal
Adjustment Date. Upon any transfer of the Company Note, the amounts pledged by
ABI and held in escrow by the Plan Trust for ABI's benefit with regard to ABI's
indemnity rights discussed above, will be paid by the Plan Trust, first, to the
Plan Trust in repayment of principal then outstanding on the Company Note
together with any accrued but unpaid interest thereon and, second, any amounts
remaining would be distributed by the Plan Trust to ABI.

      ABI has agreed to make a cash contribution in the amount of $250 thousand
to the Plan Trust upon the formation of the Plan Trust. As previously discussed,
under the expected terms of the Company's proposed plan of reorganization, ABI
would receive certain relief as may be afforded under Section 524(g)(4) of the
Bankruptcy Code from asbestos claims that derive from claims made against the
Company, which claims are expected to be channeled to the Plan Trust. However,
the proposed plan of reorganization does not provide that any other asbestos
claims that may be asserted against ABI would be channeled to the Plan Trust.

      While the Company believes its proposed modified plan is feasible and
should be confirmed by the Bankruptcy Court, there are sufficient risks and
uncertainties such that no assurances of the outcome can be given. In addition,
the remaining costs to effect the reorganization process, consisting principally
of legal and advisory fees and contributions to the Plan Trust, including one or
more notes expected to be contributed to the Plan Trust by the Company, are
expected to be approximately $7.2 million at a minimum, and could be materially
higher.

      Pending Asbestos Claims

      In 2003, the Company was one of many defendants in approximately 22
thousand pending lawsuits (including workers' compensation cases) involving
approximately 106 thousand individuals, alleging personal injury or death from
exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products. Claims involving
approximately 80 thousand individuals have been settled pursuant to the Claimant
Agreement and litigation related to unsettled or new claims is presently stayed
by the bankruptcy statute. The Company expects unsettled and future claims to be
handled in accordance with the terms of its plan of reorganization and related
trust.

      Nearly all asbestos-related claims that have been brought against the
Company to date allege that various diseases were caused by exposure to
asbestos-containing products, including resilient sheet vinyl and tile
manufactured by the Company (or, in the workers' compensation cases, exposure to
asbestos in the course of employment with the Company). The Company discontinued
the manufacture of asbestos-containing sheet products in 1983 and
asbestos-containing tile products in 1974. In general, governmental authorities
have determined that asbestos-containing sheet and tile products are nonfriable
(i.e., cannot be crumbled by hand pressure) because the asbestos was
encapsulated in the products during the manufacturing process. Thus,
governmental authorities have concluded that these products do not pose a health
risk when they are properly maintained in place or properly removed so that they
remain nonfriable. The Company has issued warnings not to remove
asbestos-containing flooring by sanding or other methods that may cause the
product to become friable.

      Status of Insurance Coverage

      During the period that Congoleum produced asbestos-containing products,
the Company purchased primary and excess insurance policies providing in excess
of $1 billion coverage for general and product liability claims. Through August
2002, substantially all asbestos-related claims and defense costs were paid
through primary insurance coverage. In August 2002, the Company received notice
that its primary insurance limits had been paid in full. The payment of limits
in full by one of the primary insurance companies was based on its contention
that limits in successive policies were not cumulative for asbestos claims and
that Congoleum was limited to only one policy limit for multiple years of
coverage. Certain excess insurance carriers claimed that the non-cumulation
provisions of the primary policies were not binding on them and that there
remained an additional $13 million in primary insurance limits plus related
defense costs before their policies were implicated. On April 10, 2003, the New
Jersey Supreme Court ruled in another case involving the same non-cumulation
provisions as in the Congoleum primary policies (the "Spaulding Case") that the
non-cumulation provisions are invalid under New Jersey law and that the primary
policies provide coverage for the full amount of their annual limits for all


                                      D-14
<PAGE>

                                           EXHIBIT D TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


successive policies. Congoleum has reached a settlement agreement with the
insurance carrier whose policies contained the non-cumulation provisions,
pursuant to which that carrier will pay Congoleum $15.4 million in full
satisfaction of its policy limits. Pursuant to the terms of the Security
Agreement, the Company is obligated to pay any insurance proceeds it receives
under the settlement agreement, net of any fees and expenses it may be entitled
to deduct, to the Collateral Trust. Payment of such fees and expenses are
subject to Court Order or approval. The Company does not expect this settlement
agreement to have a material effect on its financial condition or results of
operations. As of December 31, 2002, the Company had entered into additional
settlement agreements with asbestos claimants exceeding the amount of previously
disputed coverage. The excess carriers have objected to the reasonableness of
several of these settlements, and Congoleum believes that they will continue to
dispute the reasonableness of the settlements and contend that their policies
still are not implicated and will dispute their coverage for that and other
various reasons in ongoing coverage litigation. The excess insurance carriers
have also raised various objections to the Company's proposed plan of
reorganization.

      The excess insurance carriers have objected to the global settlement of
the asbestos claims currently pending against Congoleum ("Claimant Agreement")
on the grounds that, among other things, the negotiations leading to the
settlement and the Claimant Agreement violate provisions in their insurance
policies, including but not limited to the carriers' right to associate in the
defense of the asbestos cases, the duty of Congoleum to cooperate with the
carriers and the right of the carriers to consent to any settlement. The excess
insurance carriers also contend the Claimant Agreement is not fair, reasonable
or in good faith. Congoleum disputes the allegations and contentions of the
excess insurance carriers. On November 7, 2003, the court denied a motion for
summary judgment by the excess insurance carriers that the Claimant Agreement
was not fair, reasonable or in good faith, ruling that material facts concerning
these issues were in dispute. On April 19, 2004, the court denied a motion for
summary judgment by the excess carriers that the Claimant Agreement was not
binding on them because Congoleum had breached the consent and cooperation
clauses of their insurance policies by, among other things, entering into the
Claimant Agreement without their consent. Congoleum argues, among other things,
that it was entitled to enter into the Claimant Agreement and/or the Claimant
Agreement was binding on the excess insurance carriers because they were in
breach of their policies and/or had denied coverage and/or had created a
conflict with Congoleum by reserving rights to deny coverage and/or the Claimant
Agreement was fair, reasonable and in good faith and/or there was and is no
prejudice to the excess insurance carriers from the Claimant Agreement and/or
the excess insurance carriers had breached their duties of good faith and fair
dealing.

      On August 12, 2004, the Court entered a case management order that sets
forth the deadlines for completing fact and expert discovery, establishes
deadlines for dispositive and pre-trial motion practice and divides the trial
into three phases.

      The first phase of the trial is scheduled to begin on February 28, 2005,
and will address the following issues:

      All issues and claims relating to whether the insurers are obligated to
provide coverage under the policies at issue in this litigation for the global
claimant's agreement entered into by Congoleum including but not limited to all
issues and claims relating to both Congoleum's decision and conduct in entering


                                      D-15

into the Claimant Agreement and filing a pre-packaged bankruptcy and the
insurance company defendants' decisions and conduct in opposing the Claimant
Agreement and Congoleum's pre-packaged bankruptcy, the reasonableness and good
faith of the Claimant Agreement, whether the Claimant Agreement breached any
insurance policies and, if so, whether the insurance companies suffered any
prejudice, and whether the insurance companies' opposition to the Claimant
Agreement and bankruptcy and various other conduct by the insurers has breached
their duties of good faith and fair dealing such that they are precluded from
asserting that Congoleum's decision to enter into the Claimant Agreement
constitutes any breach(es) on the part of Congoleum.

      The second phase of the trial will address all coverage issues, including
but not limited to trigger and allocation. The final phase of the trial
remaining will address bad faith punitive damages, if appropriate.

      Given the actions of its excess insurance carriers, the Company believes
it likely that it would currently have to fund any asbestos-related expenses for
defense expense and indemnity itself. However, litigation by asbestos claimants
against the Company is stayed pursuant to the Company's bankruptcy, and the
Company does not anticipate its future expenditures for defense and indemnity of
asbestos related claims, other than expenditures pursuant to its proposed (or an
alternative) plan of reorganization, will be significant.

      Payments Related to Asbestos Claims

      The following table sets forth amounts paid to defend and settle claims:

                                              Nine Months Ended   Year Ended
      (in millions)                             September 30,    December 31,

                                                     ----            ----

      Indemnity costs paid by the Company            --               0.8

      Defense costs paid by the Company             0.4               4.5


      The amounts shown in the above table do not include non-cash settlements
using assignments of insurance proceeds, which amounted to $477 million in 2003.
There were no non-cash settlements with assignment of insurance proceeds in the
nine months ended September 30, 2004.

      At December 31, 2003, there were no additional settlements outstanding
that the Company had agreed to fund other than settlements pursuant to the
Claimant Agreement.

      The Company is seeking recovery from its insurance carriers of the amounts
it has paid for defense and indemnity, and intends to seek recovery for any
future payments of defense and indemnity. In light of the assignment of the
rights to its applicable insurance proceeds to the Collateral Trust and the
planned reorganization, the Company does not anticipate recovering these costs.

                                           EXHIBIT D TO THE DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      Accounting for Asbestos-Related Claims

      Under the terms of the Claimant Agreement, the Company's claims processing
agent processed 79,630 claims meeting the requirements of the Claimant Agreement
with a settlement value of $466 million. In addition, pre-existing settlement
agreements and trial listed settlement agreements with claims secured by the
Collateral Trust total $25 million.

        The Company's gross liability of $491 million for these settlements is
substantially in excess of both the total assets of the Company as well as the
Company's previous estimates made in prior periods of the maximum liability for
both known and unasserted claims. The Company believes that it does not have the
necessary financial resources to litigate and/or fund judgments and/or
settlements of the asbestos claims in the ordinary course of business.
Therefore, the Company believes the most meaningful measure of its probable loss
due to asbestos litigation is the amount it will have to contribute to the Plan
Trust plus the costs to effect its reorganization under Chapter 11. At September
30, 2004, the Company estimates the minimum remaining amount of the
contributions and costs to be $7.2 million, which it has recorded as a current
liability. During the fourth quarter of 2003, the Company recorded a charge of
$3.7 million to increase its recorded liability to the minimum estimated amount.
Although no additional charge has been recorded in 2004, additional charges may
be required later in the year should the minimum estimated cost increase. The
maximum amount of the range of possible asbestos-related losses is limited to
the going concern or liquidation value of the Company, an amount which the
Company believes is substantially less than the minimum gross liability for the
known claims against it.

      The Company has not attempted to make an estimate of its probable
insurance recoveries given the accounting for its estimate of future
asbestos-related costs. Substantially all future insurance recoveries have been
assigned to the Collateral or Plan Trust.

8.    Liabilities Subject to Compromise

      As a result of the Company's Chapter 11 filing (see Notes 1 and 6 to the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements), pursuant to SOP 90-7,
the Company is required to segregate pre-petition liabilities that are subject
to compromise and report them separately on the consolidated balance sheet.
Liabilities that may be affected by a plan of reorganization are recorded at the
amount of the expected allowed claims, even if they may be settled for lesser
amounts. Substantially all of the Company's pre-petition debt is recorded at
face value and is classified within liabilities subject to compromise. In
addition, the Company's accrued interest expense on its Senior Notes is also
recorded in liabilities subject to compromise. See Notes 1 and 6 to the
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements for further discussion of
the Company's asbestos liability.

Liabilities subject to compromise at September 30, 2004 are as follows:
(dollars in thousands)

Debt (at face value)                                                  $100,000

      Additional pre-petition claims (liabilities subject to compromise) may
arise due to the rejection of executory contracts or unexpired leases, or as a
result of the allowance of contingent or disputed claims.

                           VARIOUS ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

      This settlement agreement (the "Claimant Agreement") is entered into by,
between and among Congoleum Corporation, its predecessors, successors,
distributors and assigns (collectively, "Congoleum"), and the Participating
Asbestos Claimants (as defined below), by and through representative plaintiffs'
counsel, Perry Weitz, Esq. and Joseph F. Rice, Esq. ("Claimants' Counsel").

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, numerous individuals have asserted asbestos-related bodily injury
claims against Congoleum (each an "Asbestos Claimant" and collectively, the
"Asbestos Claimants"), each alleging exposure to an asbestos-containing product
manufactured, sold, or distributed by Congoleum or for which Congoleum otherwise
may have legal liability (the "Asbestos Claims"), and it is anticipated that
additional asbestos-related bodily injury claims will continue to be asserted
against Congoleum; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum is unable to meet its liability with respect to the
Asbestos Claims absent prompt payment from its insurers of their obligations
under the Policies, (as defined in the Collateral Trust Agreement referenced to
below); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum believes that substantial insurance coverage is
available under the Policies for asbestos-related bodily injury claims and
Congoleum intends vigorously to pursue such insurance coverage; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum, contemporaneously herewith, is executing an agreement,
titled Collateral Trust Agreement, establishing a trust (the "Collateral Trust")
for, among other lawful purposes not inconsistent with this Claimant Agreement,
distributing certain proceeds of the Policies in accordance with the Collateral
Trust Agreement and this Claimant Agreement; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum, contemporaneously herewith, is executing an agreement
titled Security Agreement ("Security Agreement"), granting to the Collateral
Trust a present and continuing security interest in Congoleum's rights to
receive payment under and in certain insurance proceeds relating to the
Policies; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum entered into settlement agreements prior to this
Claimant Agreement to resolve certain Asbestos Claims, under which some or all
of the consideration has yet to be paid (the "Pre-Existing Settlement
Agreements"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum may enter into additional settlement agreements to
resolve certain Asbestos Claims that are scheduled for trial prior to the
commencement of an anticipated chapter 11 reorganization case for Congoleum in
an aggregate amount not to exceed $15,000,000.00 (the "Trial-Listed Settlement
Agreements"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum and Claimants' Counsel, on behalf of Participating
Asbestos Claimants (as defined below), wish to resolve and settle, in the
amounts set forth in the compensable disease matrix attached hereto as Appendix
A ("Compensable Disease Matrix"), all of the Asbestos Claims asserted by
Asbestos Claimants who qualify as Participating Asbestos Claimants (as defined
below) and to secure, in part, payment of the amounts for which such Asbestos
Claims are settled by the grant of a security interest in the Collateral (as
defined in the Security Agreement); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum wishes to settle the Asbestos Claims asserted by
Asbestos Claimants in order to attain certainty as to its asbestos-related
liability to Participating Asbestos Claimants so that it may concentrate its
attention on the operation of its business; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum anticipates that it will commence a reorganization case
under chapter 11 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum intends to incorporate the terms of this Claimant
Agreement in a "pre-packaged" plan of reorganization that Congoleum shall seek
to confirm in its anticipated chapter 11 case (assuming the requisite
acceptances are obtained).

      NOW, THEREFORE, in consideration of the mutual covenants below contained
and intending to be legally bound hereby, Congoleum and each of the Asbestos
Claimants agree as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

I.    ASBESTOS CLAIM SETTLEMENT AND QUALIFICATION

      A. Upon the terms and conditions herein, Congoleum and each Asbestos
Claimant who submits the information and documentation satisfactory to the
Claims Reviewer (as defined below) as required under Section I.B (such Asbestos
Claimant, together with any successor or assign, a "Participating Asbestos
Claimant"), hereby compromise and settle the Asbestos Claim of such
Participating Asbestos Claimant. The amount for which an Asbestos Claim is
liquidated, compromised and settled (the "Participating Asbestos Claimant's
Settlement Amount") shall be the respective amount set forth in the Compensable
Disease Matrix applicable to the particular Participating Asbestos Claimant's
disease category.

      B. To qualify as a Participating Asbestos Claimant, each Asbestos
Claimant, or his counsel, must

            1. On or before May 15, 2003, submit in an electronic form
      reasonably satisfactory to the Claims Reviewer the following documents and
      information in form and substance satisfactory to the Claims Reviewer: (1)
      the Asbestos Claimant's name and social security number; (2) the Asbestos
      Claimant's alleged disease or injury; (3) a statement that his or her
      Asbestos Claim was filed in a court of competent jurisdiction on or before


                                        3
<PAGE>

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      the Effective Date (as defined below); and (4) a statement that the
      Asbestos Claimant is interested in participating in this Claimant
      Agreement; and

            2. On or before July 1, 2003, submit in writing the following
      documents and information in form and substance satisfactory to the Claims
      Reviewer: (1) evidence of bodily injury, sickness or disease consistent
      with the terms and meaning of the Compensable Disease Matrix however, if
      such Asbestos Claimant was qualified as a Participating Category D
      Claimant under the Settlement Agreement Between ACandS, Inc. and Various
      Asbestos Claimants, dated April 17, 2002 (the "ACandS Claimant
      Agreement"), a notice indicating that the claimant will rely upon the
      evidence submitted to the Claims Reviewer in connection with the ACandS
      Claimant Agreement will satisfy this requirement; (2) a verified statement
      that the Asbestos Claimant was exposed to an asbestos-containing product
      manufactured, sold, or distributed by Congoleum or for which Congoleum has
      legal liability; (3) a claim form that will indicate the Asbestos
      Claimant's name, address, social security number, exposure date and
      diagnosis date; (4) proof that the Asbestos Claimant had filed a claim in
      a court of competent jurisdiction against Congoleum on or before the
      Effective Date (as defined below); and (5) a release in the form of
      Appendix B hereto or another form acceptable to Congoleum (collectively
      "Claim Documentation"). Asbestos Claimants should note that if they were
      qualified under the ACandS Claimant Agreement as a Non-Malignant
      Participating Category D Claimant, reliance on the submission in
      connection with the ACandS Claimant Agreement will mean qualification here
      as a Level 1 Non-Malignant disease category pursuant to the attached
      Compensable Disease Matrix.

            3. If the Asbestos Claimant's claim was first filed after January
      13, 2003, the Asbestos Claimant shall submit a sworn affidavit or other
      evidence satisfactory to the Claims Reviewer in order to satisfy the
      requirements of I.B.2.(2).

      C. A claims reviewer (the "Claims Reviewer") shall review the Claim
Documentation provided by an Asbestos Claimant and shall notify the Collateral
Trustee (as defined below) in writing that a particular Asbestos Claimant has
satisfied the Claim Documentation requirements. The Claims Reviewer shall
provide Congoleum and Claimants' Counsel with a copy of any such notices
provided to the Collateral Trustee. The initial Claims Reviewer shall be the
Kenesis Group. Should the Claims Reviewer identify deficiencies in the Claim
Documentation submitted by an Asbestos Claimant, the Claims Reviewer shall
notify Claimants' Counsel of such deficiencies. Any Asbestos Claimant who is
subject to a notice of Claim Documentation deficiency shall have a period of
sixty (60) days from the date of mailing of notice of deficiency to remedy such
deficiencies. The Claims Reviewer and the Asbestos Claimant shall confer in good
faith for fifteen (15) days in order to resolve such deficiencies. If the
deficiencies identified by the Claims Reviewer are not remedied within the
fifteen (15) day meet and confer period, such Asbestos Claimant will not become
a Participating Asbestos Claimant and such Asbestos Claimant will be allowed to
withdraw its claim.

      D. Any Asbestos Claimant may appeal a disallowance pursuant to Section
I.C. by having the court in which the claim is pending determine on summary
judgment basis whether the documentation satisfies the standards of allowance,
and no appeal of the court's determination shall be allowed. Congoleum,
Claimants' Counsel or the Plan Trustee may oppose the Asbestos Claimant's
appeal.

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      E. As to any Asbestos Claimant who submits Claim Documentation on or
before May 20, 2003, the Claims Reviewer will mail any notice of deficiencies in
Claim Documentation within forty (40) days after receipt of the Claims
Documentation. As to any Asbestos Claimant who submits Claim Documentation after
May 20, 2003, the Claims Reviewer will mail any notice of deficiencies in Claim
Documentation within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Claims Documentation.
If the Claims Reviewer does not mail notices of deficiencies within the time
period set forth above to a particular Asbestos Claimant, that Asbestos
Claimant's Claim Documentation shall be deemed satisfactory.

      F. Should the Claims Reviewer be unable or unwilling at any time to serve
in the above-described capacity, Claimants' Counsel and Congoleum shall agree on
an acceptable replacement. The Claims Reviewer shall provide periodic reports to
Congoleum and Claimants' Counsel as they may reasonably request, at the expense
of Congoleum.

      G. An Asbestos Claimant shall not qualify as a Participating Asbestos
Claimant hereunder if the Asbestos Claimant's cause of action has been dismissed
with prejudice by a court of competent jurisdiction on or before the Effective
Date.

      H. Upon the Effective Date, a Participating Asbestos Claimant shall be
deemed to have fully and finally liquidated, compromised and settled any and all
of his or her Asbestos Claims in accordance with the terms of this Claimant
Agreement.

II.   SECURED RIGHTS OF PARTICIPATING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

      A. On the Effective Date of this Claimant Agreement, Congoleum shall grant
to the collateral trustee of the Collateral Trust (the "Collateral Trustee") for
the benefit of each Participating Asbestos Claimant, a security interest (the
"Security Interest") in the Collateral (as defined in the Security Agreement),
as provided in and subject to the terms and conditions of the Security
Agreement.

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      B. The Security Interest shall secure an amount equal to seventy-five
percent (75%) of the aggregate of all Participating Asbestos Claimants'
Settlement Amounts (the "Secured Amount") as provided in the Collateral Trust
Agreement and the Security Agreement. Congoleum's obligation to pay each
Participating Asbestos Claimant its pro rata share of the Secured Amount shall
be referred to herein as the "Secured Asbestos Claims."

      C. Until all of the Secured Asbestos Claims for all Participating Asbestos
Claimants are paid in full, Congoleum shall evaluate, bring, prosecute,
litigate, defend and settle any claim against its insurers to obtain Insurance
Proceeds. Congoleum shall consult with Claimants' Counsel in order to retain a
mutually acceptable counsel to prosecute any claim against its insurers to
obtain Insurance Proceeds. Congoleum agrees to obtain the consent of Claimants'
Counsel prior to entering into settlement of any claim against its insurers to
obtain Insurance Proceeds, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

III.  TRUST ACCOUNT FOR INSURANCE PROCEEDS

      A. Payment of Secured Asbestos Claims shall be made from the Collateral
Trust in accordance with the provisions of Section IV below and in accordance
with the Collateral Trust Agreement.

      B. Congoleum may qualify the Collateral Trust as a Qualified Settlement
Fund, pursuant to Section 468B of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended,
and the Treasury regulations promulgated thereunder ("QSF").

      C. It is the expectation of Congoleum and Participating Asbestos Claimants
that the Secured Asbestos Claims shall be paid entirely out of the Insurance
Proceeds (as defined in the Security Agreement). Until such time as the Secured
Asbestos Claims have been paid in full, Congoleum shall direct that payment of
all Insurance Proceeds be made to the Collateral Trust and, in the event
Congoleum receives any Insurance Proceeds, Congoleum, no later than five (5)

business days after its receipt of any Insurance Proceeds, shall remit such
Insurance Proceeds to the Collateral Trust.

IV.   PAYMENT OF SECURED ASBESTOS CLAIMS

      A. The Collateral Trustee shall make payments to each Participating
Asbestos Claimant up to the amount of such Participating Asbestos Claimant's
Secured Asbestos Claim, by payment to the respective Claimants' Counsel for such
Participating Asbestos Claimant, in accordance with the terms of the Collateral
Trust Agreement.

      B. The portion of Congoleum's obligation to a Participating Asbestos
Claimant to pay in excess of such Participating Asbestos Claimant's Secured
Asbestos Claim shall constitute an unsecured claim (an "Unsecured Asbestos
Claim"). Such an Unsecured Asbestos Claim shall be treated in accordance with
the terms of a confirmed plan of reorganization in the event Congoleum files a
chapter 11 case. If unpaid and if Congoleum does not commence a chapter 11 case
within 24 months of the Effective Date, the Unsecured Asbestos Claim shall
become immediately due and payable.

V.    LITIGATION MORATORIUM

      Congoleum and each Asbestos Claimant that has submitted the documents and
information pursuant to Section I.B.1 agree to a 150-day litigation moratorium,
commencing from the Effective Date, during which such Asbestos Claimant shall
not pursue any lawsuit or other legal process with respect to any claim against
Congoleum or any parent, subsidiary, distributor, or affiliate of Congoleum
other than the claims process set forth in Section I above. Congoleum and each
such Asbestos Claimant agree to toll all time-related affirmative defenses
(including statute of limitation defenses) applicable to the respective Asbestos
Claims during the period of the 150-day litigation moratorium.

                                    RECITALS

      WHEREAS, Congoleum and Participating Asbestos Claimants entered into an
agreement titled Settlement Agreement Between Congoleum Corporation And Various
Asbestos Claimants (the "Claimant Agreement") dated April 10, 2003; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum and Participating Asbestos Claimants wish to extend the
time within which Asbestos Claimants may accept the terms of the Claimant
Agreement and agree to be bound by the Claimant Agreement and to extend the time
for such Asbestos Claimants to be eligible to provide Claim Documentation and to
qualify as a Participating Asbestos Claimant; and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum, the Collateral Trustee and the Delaware Trustee
entered into the Collateral Trust Agreement pursuant to which a statutory trust
under the Delaware Statutory Trust Act was created on April 17, 2003 (the
"Collateral Trust Agreement"); and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum, the Collateral Trustee, and the Delaware Trustee, with
the consent of Claimants' Counsel, contemporaneously herewith are executing that
certain first amendment to the Collateral Trust Agreement (the "Amendment to the

<PAGE>

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


      WHEREAS, on or about April 11, 2003 and April 17, 2003, respectively,
Congoleum executed agreements titled "Security Agreement" and "Second Security
Agreement" (collectively, the "Security Agreements") granting to the Collateral
Trust a present and continuing security interest in certain insurance proceeds;
and

      WHEREAS, Congoleum and the Collateral Trustee have contemporaneously
herewith terminated the Security Agreements and entered into a subsequent
security agreement ("Superceding Security Agreement") to eliminate any confusion
as to the effective date of the grant of the Security Interest; and

      WHEREAS, the Parties desire to enter into this Amendment to the Claimant
Agreement to confirm their agreement with respect to (i) the amendment of
certain deadlines related to qualification as Participating Claimants; (ii) the
termination of the Security Agreements; (iii) the execution of the Superceding
Security Agreement; and (iv) certain other matters relating to the foregoing, as
hereafter provided;

      NOW, THEREFORE, intending to be legally bound hereby, Congoleum and each
of the Participating Asbestos Claimants agree that the Claimant Agreement shall
be amended as follows:

                                    AGREEMENT

      1. Section I.B.1 and I.B.2 of the Claimant Agreement shall be replaced in
its entirety with:

            B. To qualify as a Participating Asbestos Claimant, each Asbestos
Claimant, or his counsel, must

      1. On or before July 1, 2003, submit in an electronic form reasonably
satisfactory to the Claims Reviewer the following documents and information in


                                        2
<PAGE>

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


form and substance satisfactory to the Claims Reviewer: (1) the Asbestos
Claimant's name and social security number; (2) the Asbestos Claimant's alleged
disease or injury; (3) for all cases filed after February 14, 2003, a statement
by counsel of record that the claimant can comply with exposure requirements of
the Agreement; (4) a statement that his or her Asbestos Claim was filed in a
court of competent jurisdiction on or before July 1, 2003; and (5) a statement
that the Asbestos Claimant is interested in participating in this Claimant

and information in form and substance satisfactory to the Claims Reviewer: (1)
evidence of bodily injury, sickness or disease consistent with the terms and
meaning of the Compensable Disease Matrix; however, if such Asbestos Claimant
was qualified as a Participating Category D Claimant under the Settlement
Agreement Between ACandS, Inc. and Various Asbestos Claimants, dated April 17,
2002 (the "ACandS Claimant Agreement"), a notice indicating that the claimant
will rely upon the evidence submitted to the Claims Reviewer in connection with
the ACandS Claimant Agreement will satisfy this requirement; (2) a statement
swearing under penalty of perjury or witnessed by a notary, that the Asbestos
Claimant was exposed to an asbestos-containing product manufactured, sold, or
distributed by Congoleum or for which Congoleum has legal liability; (3) a claim
form that will indicate the Asbestos Claimant's name, social security number,
exposure date and diagnosis date; (4) proof that the Asbestos Claimant had filed
a claim in a court of competent jurisdiction against Congoleum on or before July
1, 2003; and (5) a release in the form of Appendix B hereto or another form
acceptable to Congoleum (collectively "Claim Documentation"). Asbestos Claimants
should note that if they were qualified under the ACandS Claimant Agreement as a
Non-Malignant Participating Category D Claimant, reliance on the submission in

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


connection with the ACandS Claimant Agreement will mean qualification here as a
Level 1 Non-Malignant disease category pursuant to the attached Compensable
Disease Matrix.

      2. Section I.E of the Claimant Agreement shall be replaced in its entirety
with:

            E. As to any Asbestos Claimant who submits Claim Documentation on or
before July 7, 2003, the Claims Reviewer will mail any notice of deficiencies in
Claim Documentation within thirty (30) days after receipt of the Claims
Documentation. As to any Asbestos Claimant who submits Claim Documentation after
July 7, 2003, the Claims Reviewer will mail any notice of deficiencies in Claim
Documentation within sixty (60) days after receipt of the Claims Documentation.
If the Claims Reviewer does not mail notices of deficiencies within the time
period set forth above to a particular Asbestos Claimant, that Asbestos
Claimant's Claim Documentation shall be deemed satisfactory.

      3. Sections II.A and II.B of the Claimant Agreement shall be replaced in
their entirety with:

II.   SECURED RIGHTS OF PARTICIPATING ASBESTOS CLAIMANTS

      A. The Security Interest contemplated by the Superceding Security
Agreement shall secure an amount equal to seventy-five percent (75%) of the
aggregate of all Participating Asbestos Claimants' Settlement Amounts (the
"Secured Amount") as provided in the Collateral Trust Agreement and the
Superceding Security Agreement. Congoleum's obligation to pay each Participating
Asbestos Claimant its pro rata share of the Secured Amount shall be referred to
herein as the "Secured Asbestos Claims."

      B. Until all of the Secured Asbestos Claims for all Participating Asbestos
Claimants are paid in full, Congoleum shall evaluate, bring, prosecute,
litigate, defend and settle any claim against its insurers to obtain Insurance
Proceeds. Congoleum shall consult with Claimants' Counsel in order to retain a


                                        4
<PAGE>

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


mutually acceptable counsel to prosecute any claim against its insurers to
obtain Insurance Proceeds. Congoleum agrees to obtain the consent of Claimants'
Counsel prior to entering into settlement of any claim against its insurers to
obtain Insurance Proceeds, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld,
conditioned or delayed.

      4. Section II.C of the Claimant Agreement shall be deleted.

      5. The paragraph below shall be added to the Claimant Agreement as Section
III.D:

            D. The beneficial interests in the Collateral Trust are not
transferable or assignable, except as may be provided under operation of law or
after the death of a Participating Asbestos Claimant pursuant to a will or the
law applicable to the decendent's estate. The beneficial interests in the
Collateral Trust shall not be evidenced by a separate certificate. Nothing in
this paragraph III.D shall in any way restrict the ability of the Collateral
Trust to transfer the Trust Assets (as defined in the Collateral Trust
Agreement) to any trust established pursuant to a plan of reorganization for
Congoleum under chapter 11 of the United States Bankruptcy Code.

      6. Other than expressly provided for herein, the terms of the Claimant
Agreement shall remain in full force and effect.

      7. The Claimant Agreement and this Amendment to the Claimant Agreement
(collectively, the "Agreements") constitute a single integrated written contract
expressing the entire agreement among the parties hereto with respect to the
subject matter hereof. The Agreements supercede any prior understandings and
agreements between or among the parties with respect to the subject matter of
the Agreements. Any statements, promises or inducements, whether made by any
party or any agents of any party, that are not contained in the Agreements shall
not be valid or binding. The failure or invalidation of any provision of the

                                               EXHIBIT E TO DISCLOSURE STATEMENT


Agreements shall not in any way affect the validity or performance of any party
pursuant to any other provision of the Agreements.

      8. References in the Claimant Agreement, the Superceding Security
Agreement, and the Collateral Trust Agreement to the "Claimant Agreement" shall
be deemed references to the Agreements.

      9. This Amendment to the Claimant Agreement may be executed in any number
of counterparts. Each of such counterparts for all purposes shall be deemed to
be an original, and all such counterparts together shall constitute but one and
the same Amendment to the Claimant Agreement.

      IN WITNESS WHEREOF, the parties have caused this First Amendment to the
Claimant Agreement to be duly executed this 6th day of June 2003.

      B.    A statement by a Board-certified Pathologist that:

            1.    More than one representative section of lung tissue otherwise
                  uninvolved with any other process (e.g. cancer, emphysema)

                  the fibrosis.

                              Extraordinary Claims

      The Claims Reviewer may award a settlement amount to a Participating
Asbestos Claimant up to five (5) times the Settlement Amount for the Disease
Category in question ("Extraordinary Claim Settlement Amount"). The procedures
relating to any such award are as follows:

      A.    At the same time that an Asbestos Claimant submits the documentation
            required under Section I.B.2 of the Claimant Agreement, an Asbestos
            Claimant may request in writing to the Claims Reviewer that his or
            her Asbestos Claim be considered for an Extraordinary Claim
            Settlement Amount.

      B.    A Participating Asbestos Claimant may be entitled to an
            Extraordinary Claim Settlement Amount only if he or she:

            1.    Satisfies the requirements to the Medical Criteria above for
                  the Disease Category in question; and

            2.    Demonstrates that his or her exposure to asbestos was greater
                  than 40% the result of exposure to an asbestos-containing
                  product manufactured, sold, or distributed by Congoleum or for
                  which Congoleum otherwise may have legal liability; and

            3.    Demonstrates that there is little likelihood of a successful
                  recovery elsewhere.

      C.    The Claims Reviewer shall consider simultaneously all requests for
            an Extraordinary Claim Settlement Amount no later than ninety (90)
            days from the deadline to submit Claim Documentation under Section
            I.B.2 of the Claimant Agreement. The Claims Reviewer shall notify
            the Participating Asbestos Claimants in writing as to whether the
            Participating Asbestos Claimants is entitled to the requested
            Extraordinary Claims Settlement Amount and the amount of the
            Extraordinary Claims Settlement Amount, if any.

                  Reviewer's determination by requesting arbitration in writing
                  to the Claims Reviewer within ten (10) days of receipt of the
                  Claims Reviewer's determination.

            2.    The neutral arbitrator shall be Michael Rozen from The
                  Feinberg Group, LLP (the "Arbitrator"). Should Mr. Rozen be
                  unable or unwilling at any time to serve as the Arbitrator,
                  Claimants' Counsel and Congoleum shall agree on an acceptable
                  replacement.

            3.    The Arbitrator shall consider the positions of the parties as
                  set forth in written submissions to be filed with the
                  Arbitrator within sixty (60) days after the written request
                  for arbitration.

            4.    The Arbitrator shall make a final decision within sixty (60)
                  days of the date set for submission. The Arbitrator is not
                  empowered to award damages in excess of the maximum amount of
                  the Extraordinary Claims Settlement Amount for the Disease
                  Category in question and the Participating Asbestos Claimant
                  expressly waives and foregoes any right to punitive, exemplary
                  or similar damages. The decision of the Arbitrator shall be
                  final and binding.

            5.    The Participating Asbestos Claimant shall bear its own costs.
                  The reasonable fees and costs of the Arbitrator and the
                  reasonable costs incurred by the Claims Reviewer shall be paid
                  by the Collateral Trust, Plan Trust or any successor trust (as
                  defined in Collateral Trust Agreement).
