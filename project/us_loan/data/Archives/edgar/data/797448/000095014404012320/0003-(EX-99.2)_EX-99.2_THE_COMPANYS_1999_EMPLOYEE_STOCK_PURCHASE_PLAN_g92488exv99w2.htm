</FONT></B><FONT size="2">This Eltrax Systems, Inc. 1999
Employee Stock Purchase Plan adopted as of the 16th day of
November, 1999, is intended to encourage eligible employees of
the Company and its Subsidiaries to acquire or increase their
ownership of common stock of the Company on reasonable terms.
The opportunity so provided is intended to foster in
participants a strong incentive to put forth maximum effort for
the continued success and growth of the Company and its
Subsidiaries, to aid in retaining individuals who put forth such
efforts, and to assist in attracting the best available
individuals to the Company and its Subsidiaries in the future.
It is the Company&#146;s intention that this Employee Stock
Purchase Plan qualify as an &#147;employee stock purchase
plan&#148; under Section&nbsp;423 of the Code. Accordingly, the
provisions of the Plan shall be construed so as to extend and
limit participation in a manner consistent with the requirements
of that section of the Code.
