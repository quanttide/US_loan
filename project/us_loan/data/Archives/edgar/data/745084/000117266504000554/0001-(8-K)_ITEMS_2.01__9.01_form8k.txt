of the note, provided the Company has sufficient authorized shares of common
stock available, the note is convertible at the option of the holder into such
number of shares of common stock that is obtained by dividing the sum of the
outstanding principal balance of the note by $0.01. All accrued and unpaid
interest on the note is payable in cash at the time of conversion of the Note.
The Company's prior disclosure in its public filings was not accurate with
respect o the payment details of this transaction. Even if the Company does not
receive shareholder approval to increase its authorized shares of common stock,
this acquisition cannot be unwound by any of the parties to the transaction.

         In August 2004, the Company acquired all of the issued and outstanding
shares of capital stock of AuthDirect, Inc., a California corporation pursuant
to (i) the issuance of 1,500,000 shares of common stock of the Company, (ii)
$170,000 in cash and notes, and (iii) warrants to purchase 1,500,000 shares of
common stock. AuthDirect provides back-office settlement services and network
monitoring for Wi-Fi providers. The Company's prior disclosure in its public
filings was not accurate with respect to the payment terms of this transaction.
