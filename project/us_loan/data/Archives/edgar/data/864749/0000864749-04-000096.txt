Item 1.01.        Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

         On December 7, 2004,  Rajat Bahri entered into an employment  agreement
with the Company for the  position of Chief  Financial  Officer,  subject to his
election to the position by the Company's  Board of Directors and effective upon
his employment start date. The following is a brief  description of the material
terms and conditions of the agreement:

         Mr. Bahri's employment agreement provides for a base salary of $275,000
and he is eligible to participate in the Company's Management Incentive Plan for
2005,  with a target  potential  payout level of 50%. In addition Mr. Bahri will
receive a special bonus of $55,000 per year for the first three  calendar  years
of  employment  and $40,000 for his fourth and fifth  years of  employment.  Mr.
Bahri is also eligible to  participate  in our Executive  Deferred  Compensation
Plan and other standard Company employee benefits.

         Pursuant to the terms of Mr. Bahri's employment agreement,  on December

Plan, an option to purchase  100,000 shares of our common stock,  effective upon
his employment  start date and an additional  50,000 shares,  effective upon the
one-year anniversary of his employment.

         Under the terms of the agreement,  upon his  employment  start date, we
will enter into an agreement with Mr. Bahri  providing for payment of one year's
base pay and bonus in the event of the  termination  of Mr.  Bahri's  employment
following  a  change  in  control  of  the  Company,   under   certain   defined
circumstances.  The  agreement  will also  provide  for an  acceleration  of the
vesting  of  Bahri's  outstanding  stock  options  in the  event of a change  in
control.

         The  employment  agreement  also provides  that in connection  with his
relocation  to  California,  Mr.  Bahri  will  receive  payment  for  moving and
temporary living costs, in addition to an allowance of $15,000 for miscellaneous
expenses related to the relocation.

 Item 5.02 Departure of Directors or Principal Officers;  Election of Directors;
