                  without limitation, the Mortgagor's rights thereunder so long

                  (i) all of the Mortgagor's right, title and interest from time
                  to time in the Subject Property of whatever nature (including

                        taxes, assessments, insurance premiums or costs incurred
                        for the protection of the Security Property, and such
                        protective advances, together with interest thereon at
                        the Overdue Rate from the date of each such advance
                        until it is repaid in full, shall be secured by this
                        Mortgage to the fullest extent and with the highest
                        priority contemplated by Applicable Law.

                  (ii)  Mortgage. Subject to the limitation set forth in the
                        next succeeding sentence, the Mortgagor and the
                        Mortgagee intend that this Mortgage shall secure
                        Mortgagor's obligation to repay the unpaid balance of
                        advances made by the Mortgagee and/or the holder hereof
                        under the Master Lease and other Operative Documents to

<PAGE>

                        Master Lease. The maximum amount of the Obligations
                        secured by this Mortgage, exclusive of interest thereon
                        (whether or not identified as interest and including
                        specifically all Accrual Rent under the Master Lease),
                        and exclusive of advances made for the payment of real
                        estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and costs
                        incurred for the protection of the Security Property and
                        all other protective advances as described in Section
                        1(a)(i) above, all of which are also secured by this
                        Mortgage, shall not exceed FIVE MILLION AND 00/100 U.S.
                        DOLLARS ($5,000,000).

            (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease, as
                  supplemented by the Related Lease Supplement (including,
                  without limitation, the Mortgagor's rights thereunder so long
                  as no Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing),
                  the Mortgagor hereby grants to the Mortgagee a security
                  interest in the Mortgagor's interest in that portion of the
                  Security Property (the "UCC Property") subject to the Uniform
                  Commercial Code of the State of New York (the "UCC"). This
                  Mortgage shall also be deemed to be a security agreement and
                  shall support any financing statement showing the Mortgagee's
                  interest as a secured party with respect to any portion of the
                  UCC Property described in such financing statement. The
                  Mortgagor agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to execute,
                  deliver and file from time to time such further instruments as
                  may be requested by the Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the
                  lien of the security interest in the collateral described in
                  this Mortgage.

            (c)   The Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys, transfers
                  and sets over unto the Mortgagee (subject, however, to the
                  Master Lease, as supplemented by the Related Lease Supplement,
                  and the rights of the Mortgagor thereunder) all and every part
                  of the rents, issues and profits (collectively, the "Profits")
                  that may from time to time become due and payable on account
                  of any and all subleases or other occupancy agreements now
                  existing, or that may hereafter come into existence with
                  respect to the Subject Property or any part thereof, including
                  any guaranties of such sublease or occupancy agreements
                  (collectively, the "Subleases") provided, that, unless a Lease
                  Event of Default is continuing, the Mortgagor shall have the
                  right to collect and retain such Profits. Upon request of the
                  Mortgagee, the Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be
                  recorded, at its expense, supplemental or additional
                  assignments of any Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the
                  occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease Event of
                  Default, the Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and
                  empowered in its discretion (in addition to all other powers
                  and rights herein granted), to apply for and collect and
                  receive all such Profits and enforce such guaranty or
                  guaranties, and all money so received under and by virtue of
                  this assignment shall be applied as further security for the
                  payment and performance of the Obligations secured hereby.

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Mortgage is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in,
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Mortgagee grants to the
                  Mortgagor a revocable license to enforce all of its rights and
                  remedies under the Subleases, to collect and receive the
                  Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits. Such
                  license shall be automatically revoked upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of any Lease Event of Default.

      SECTION 2. Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
a Lease Event of Default, each of which is also a default under this Mortgage,
the Mortgagee may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies
as it, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate:

                  (i)   collect interest on all past due sums at the Overdue
                        Rate;

                  (ii)  either in person or by agent, with or without bringing
                        any action or proceeding, or by a receiver appointed by
                        a court, and without regard to the adequacy of security,
                        enter upon and take possession of the Security Property,
                        or any part thereof, in its own name, and do any acts
                        which it deems necessary or desirable to preserve the
                        value, marketability or rentability of the Security
                        Property, or any part thereof or interest therein, to
                        increase the income therefrom or to protect the security
                        hereof and, with or without taking possession of the
                        Security Property, to sue for or otherwise to collect
                        the Profits thereof, including, without limitation,
                        those past due and unpaid, and to apply the same, less
                        costs and expenses of operation and collection,
                        including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
                        fees, upon any Obligations secured hereby, all in such
                        order as the Mortgagee may determine. The entering upon
                        and taking possession of the Security Property, and the
                        collection of such Profits and the application thereof
                        as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Lease Event of
                        Default or notice of a Lease Event of Default hereunder
                        or invalidate any act done in response to such Lease
                        Event of Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in
                        possession of the Mortgagee or the collection, receipt
                        and application of Profits by the Mortgagee, the
                        Mortgagee shall be entitled to exercise every right
                        provided for herein or by law upon the occurrence and
                        during the continuance of any Lease Event of Default,
                        including, without limitation, to the extent permitted
                        by Applicable Law, the right to exercise the power of
                        sale;

                  (iii) to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, utilize the
                        procedures set forth in Article 14 of the New York Real
                        Property Actions and Proceedings Law and commence a
                        non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale. To the extent
                        permitted by Applicable Law, Mortgagor waives any right
                        granted pursuant to Section 1421 or

                                     - 4 -

                        any other provision of the New York Real Property
                        Actions and Proceedings Law to challenge Mortgagee's
                        election to enforce this Mortgage by means of such
                        non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale;

                  (iv)  foreclose this Mortgage in the manner provided by
                        Applicable Law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real
                        property;

                  (v)   declare immediately due and payable without notice or
                        demand, except as otherwise required hereunder or under
                        Applicable Law, all amounts payable by the Mortgagor
                        hereunder or under the other Operative Documents which
                        are then unpaid, with all interest and sums accrued and
                        accelerate payment thereof notwithstanding contrary
                        terms of payment stated therein and exercise all other
                        rights and remedies available hereunder, under
                        Applicable Law, in equity or otherwise;

                  (vi)  in any action to foreclose this Mortgage, and upon
                        notice to the Mortgagor or anyone under the Mortgagor
                        and without regard to the adequacy of its security or
                        the then value of the Security Property or the interest
                        of the Mortgagor therein, apply to any court having
                        jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers of the
                        Security Property and the Mortgagor hereby irrevocably
                        consents to such appointment and, to the extent
                        permitted by Applicable Law, waives notice of any
                        application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers
                        shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers
                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Mortgagee provided for in Section D(a)(ii) above, to the
                        extent permitted by Applicable Law, and shall continue
                        as a receiver and exercise all such powers until the
                        date of confirmation of sale of the Security Property
                        unless such receivership is sooner terminated by the
                        Mortgagee in its sole discretion or as a court of
                        competent jurisdiction shall direct.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall be entitled to enforce
                  payment and performance of any Obligations secured hereby and
                  to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any laws now or
                  hereafter in force notwithstanding that some or all of said
                  Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise
                  secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien,
                  assignment or otherwise. To the extent permitted by Applicable
                  Law, neither the acceptance nor the enforcement hereof,
                  whether by court action or pursuant to the power of sale or
                  other powers herein contained, shall prejudice or in any

                  and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Mortgagee

                  herein and any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in its absolute
                  discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or reserved to
                  the Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy,
                  but each shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
                  other remedy given hereby or now or hereafter existing at law
                  or in equity or by statute. To the extent permitted by
                  Applicable Law, every power or remedy given hereby to the
                  Mortgagee or to which the Mortgagee may be otherwise entitled,
                  may be exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to
                  time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Mortgagee,
                  and the Mortgagee may pursue inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Mortgagee, in addition to and not in
                  lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies provided
                  above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured
                  party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

            (c)   It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease
                  be treated as a secured borrowing as provided in Section 1,
                  and that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a
                  Lease Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall have remedies
                  provided for herein. In the event that, notwithstanding the
                  intention of the parties, a court of competent jurisdiction
                  determines that, for the purpose of remedies, the transaction
                  contemplated by the Master Lease constitutes a leasing
                  arrangement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
                  Mortgagee shall have, as a result of such determination, in
                  addition to the remedies set forth in this Section 2, all of
                  the rights and remedies of a landlord provided for in Article
                  XVI of the Master Lease, provided that the parties hereto
                  acknowledge and agree that it is their intent that the Master
                  Lease be construed as provided in Section 1.

      SECTION 3. Mortgagee Grant. (a) The Mortgagee hereby conditionally grants
a Lien to the Mortgagor against all of the Mortgagee's right, title and interest
in and to the Security Property, which Lien shall be effective only if the
Mortgagee shall become the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceeding and such proceeding shall result in the rejection of the Master
Lease. Such Lien shall secure the satisfaction of the Mortgagor's right to
damages and other claims arising out of the rejection of the Master Lease to the
extent and in the manner provided for pursuant to the Operative Documents.

      (b) The Mortgagor agrees that the conditional Lien created in paragraph
(a) of this Section will terminate upon the termination of the Master Lease with
respect to the Subject Property for any reason other than a rejection of the
Master Lease in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding
with respect to the Mortgagee. Mortgagor covenants to promptly deliver any
releases or reconveyances reasonably required by Mortgagee to evidence such
termination of Lien.

      (c) The Lien created in paragraph (a) of this Section is junior and
subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted by the Mortgagor in favor of
the Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage and the other Operative Documents.

      SECTION 4. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Mortgage
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of

to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any suit on this Mortgage
in such state. The terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III attached
hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. In
the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions contained in this
Mortgage and the terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III, the terms and
provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 5. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master
Lease (as amended by the Related Lease Supplement) or of the leasehold estate
created thereby by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or
hold, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, (a) the Master Lease (as
amended by the Related Lease Supplement) or the leasehold estate created thereby
or any interest in the Master Lease (as amended by the Related Lease Supplement)
or such leasehold estate, or (b) the fee estate or ground leasehold estate in
the Subject Property, except as may expressly be stated in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered by the Mortgagee.

      SECTION 6. Satisfaction of the Mortgage, Security Interest and Assignment
of Rents and Subleases. If the Mortgagor complies with the provisions of this
Mortgage and irrevocably pays and performs all of the Obligations secured
hereby, in accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease, as supplemented
by the Related Lease Supplement, and the other Operative Documents and in the
manner and at the times set forth therein, without deduction, fraud or delay,
then and from thenceforth this Mortgage and the estate hereby granted and
created in favor of the Mortgagee, shall cease and become void, anything
hereinbefore contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

      SECTION 7. Maximum Interest Rate. No provision of this Mortgage or any
transaction related thereto shall require the payment or permit the collection
of interest or any other amount in excess of the maximum permitted by Applicable
Law. If any excess of interest or any other amount in such respect is herein or
any other Operative Document provided for, the Mortgagor shall not be obligated
to pay such excess interest or any other amounts in excess of the amount
permitted by applicable law, and the right to demand the payment of any such
excess shall be and hereby is waived, and this provision shall control any other
provision of this Mortgage and the other Operative Documents.

      SECTION 8. Security Agreement and Fixture Financing Statement. This
Mortgage is both a real property mortgage and a "security agreement" within the
meaning of the UCC. The Subject Property includes both real and personal
property and all other rights and interests, whether tangible or intangible in
nature, of Mortgagee in the Subject Property. In Section 1(b), Mortgagor has
granted to Mortgagee, as security for the Obligations, a security interest in
the UCC Property to the full extent that the UCC Property may be subject to the
UCC. The information contained in this Section 9 is provided in order that this
Mortgage shall comply with

                                     - 7 -

The Mortgagee is the record owner of the Land.

      SECTION 9. Notices. For purposes of this instrument as a fixture filing,
and for all other purposes, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all
notices, offers, acceptances, rejections, consents, requests, demands or other
communications to or upon the respective parties hereto shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given as set forth in Section 26.4 of the Master
Lease.

      SECTION 10. Counterpart Execution. This Mortgage may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, all such counterparts together constituting but one and the same
