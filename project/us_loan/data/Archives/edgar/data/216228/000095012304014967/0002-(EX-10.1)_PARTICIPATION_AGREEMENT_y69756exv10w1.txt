      (b) The Lessor shall, immediately upon its receipt of the Acquisition Date

                      OVERDUE AMOUNTS; RENT PAYMENTS; FEES

      Section 4.1. Overdue Amounts; Application of Rent Payments, etc. (a) If
all or any portion of the Aggregate Property Cost, any Accrual Rent, Fixed Rent,
Supplemental Rent or any other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when

overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is equal to the
Overdue Rate.

      (a) All Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent paid by the Lessee under the
Lease from time to time shall be applied as set forth in Article VII.

      (b) If not repaid sooner, the Aggregate Property Cost shall be repaid in
full on the Scheduled Lease Termination Date.

      Section 4.2. Structuring Fee. The Lessee agrees to pay to the Arranger on
the Acquisition Date the Structuring Fee in accordance with the Arrangement
Letter.

      Section 4.3. Place and Manner of Payments. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments by the Lessee hereunder, under the
Master Lease or under any other Operative Document shall be made to the Lessor
(or, in the case of Supplemental Rent owing under Article XIII, directly to the
Person entitled thereto), in Dollars in immediately available funds, without
offset, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any kind (except as provided
in Section 12.3(a)), to the Account in New York, New York not later than 10:00
a.m. (New York time) on the date when due. Payments received after such time

specify to the Lessor the Basic Rent, Property Cost, Termination Price,
Termination Base Amount, Fees, Supplemental Rent or other amounts payable by the
Lessee hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that
it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the
terms hereof, the Lessor shall apply such payment in such manner as the Lessor
may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by Lessee

such Investor under the Operative Documents through the exercise of a right of
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from,
or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Investor under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any
other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in
this Participation Agreement and the Lessor LLC Agreement, such Investor shall
promptly purchase from the other Investor a participation in such amounts, and
make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end
that all Investors share such payment in accordance with their respective
ratable shares as provided for in the Lessor LLC Agreement. The Investors
further agree among themselves that if payment to an Investor obtained by such
Investor through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim
or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored,
each Investor which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by
repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Investor whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Lessee agrees that any Investor so purchasing such a participation may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Investor were a holder of such obligation in the amount of such
participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any Investor
shall fail to remit to any other Investor an amount payable by such party to
such other Investor pursuant to the Operative Documents on the date when such
amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for
each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to
the Lessor at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight LIBOR. If under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Investor receives a
secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 4.4 applies, such
Investor shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of
such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Investors under
this Section 4.4 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

                                    ARTICLE V

                           AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE LEASE

the contrary notwithstanding, it is the intention of the Lessee, the Lessor and
the Investors that: (i) the amount and timing of installments of Basic Rent due
and payable from time to time from the Lessee under the Lease shall be equal to
the sum of (x) the aggregate payments due and payable as Accrual Rent on each
Scheduled Payment Date and (y) the aggregate payments due and payable as Fixed
Rent on each Scheduled Payment Date; (ii) if the Lessee elects to purchase or
becomes obligated to purchase all of the Properties under the Lease or elects
the Return Option, the Lease Balance with respect thereto and all other
obligations of the Lessee owing to the Lessor and the Investors shall be due and
payable in full by the Lessee on the date set forth in the Lease; (iii) upon a
Lease Event of Default resulting in an acceleration of the Lessee's obligation
to purchase the Lessor's interest in each Property under the Lease, the amounts
then due and payable by the Lessee under the Lease shall include all amounts
necessary to pay in full the Lease Balance plus all other amounts then due from
the Lessee under the Operative Documents (and the Lessee agrees that, in any
such event, it will pay such amounts regardless of whether the Lease is then in
effect); and (v) if the Lessee elects to terminate or is required to purchase or
terminate any Property pursuant to Section 15.1 or 19.1 of the Master Lease, the
amounts then due and payable by the Lessee shall include all amounts necessary
to pay the Termination Base Amount or Termination Price (as applicable) of such
Property together with all Rent allocable thereto.

                                  ARTICLE VIII

                                 REPRESENTATIONS

      Section 8.1. Representations of the Lessee. The Lessee hereby represents
and warrants to the Lessor, each Investor and the Arranger that:

            (a) Organization; Powers. Each of the Lessee and each of the
      Subsidiaries (i) is a corporation duly organized, validly existing and in
      good standing under the laws of the jurisdiction of its organization, (ii)
      has all requisite power and authority to own its property and assets and
      to carry on its business as now conducted and as proposed to be conducted,
      (iii) is qualified to do business in every jurisdiction where such
      qualification is required, except where the failure so to qualify would
      not result in a Material Adverse Effect, and (iv) in the case of the
      Lessee, has the corporate power and authority to execute, deliver and
      perform its obligations under the Operative Documents to which it is a
      party and to incur the Obligations hereunder and thereunder.

            (b) Authorization. The execution, delivery and performance by the
      Lessee of each Operative Document to which it is or will be a party and
      the incurrence of the Obligations thereunder (collectively, the
      "Transactions") (i) have been or, upon execution and delivery thereof,
      will be duly authorized by all requisite corporate action and (ii) will
      not (x) violate (A) any provision of any law, statute, rule or regulation
      (including the Margin Regulations) or of the certificate of incorporation
      or other constitutive documents or by-laws of the Lessee, (B) any order of
      any Governmental Authority or (C) any provision of any indenture,
      agreement or other instrument to which the Lessee is a party or by which
      it or any of its property is or may be bound, (y) be in conflict with,
      result in a breach of or constitute (alone or with notice or lapse of time
      or both) a default under any such indenture, agreement or other instrument
      or (z) result in the creation or imposition of any lien upon any property
      or assets of the Lessee.

            (c) Enforceability. This Participation Agreement and each other
      Operative Document to which the Lessee is a party constitutes a legal,
      valid and binding obligation of the Lessee enforceable in accordance with
      its terms.

            (d) Governmental Approvals. No action, consent or approval of,
      registration or filing with or other action by any Governmental Authority,
      other than those which have been taken, given or made, as the case may be,
      is or will be required with respect to the Lessee in connection with the
      Transactions.

            (e) Financial Statements.

                  (i) The Lessee's consolidated balance sheet and consolidated
            statements of income, cash flows and changes in shareholders' equity
            as of and for the year ended December 31, 2003, and the Lessee's
            consolidated condensed income statements, consolidated condensed
            balance sheets and consolidated condensed statement of cash flows
            for the nine months ended September 30, 2004, in each case as posted

            www.itt.com on the Closing Date, present fairly, in all material
            respects, the consolidated combined financial condition and the
            results of operations of the Lessee and the Subsidiaries as of such
            dates and for such periods in accordance with GAAP.

                                                         Participation Agreement

                  (ii) As of the Documentation Date and as of the Acquisition
            Date, there has been no material adverse change in the consolidated
            financial condition of the Lessee and the Lessee Subsidiaries taken
            as a whole from the financial condition reported in the financial
            statements referenced in paragraph (i) of this Section 8.1(e).

            (f) Litigation; Compliance with Laws.

                  (i) As of the Documentation Date, there are no actions,
            proceedings or investigations filed or (to the knowledge of the
            Lessees) threatened or affecting the Lessee or any Subsidiary in any
            court or before any Governmental Authority or arbitration board or
            tribunal which question the validity or legality of this
            Participation Agreement, the Master Lease or any other Operative
            Document, the Transactions or any action taken or to be taken
            pursuant to this Participation Agreement, the Lease or any other
            Operative Document and no order or judgment has been issued or
            entered restraining or enjoining the Lessee or any Subsidiary from
            the execution, delivery or performance of this Participation
            Agreement, the Lease or any other Operative Document nor is there
            any other action, proceeding or investigation filed or (to the
            knowledge of the Lessee or any Subsidiary) threatened against the
            Lessee or any Subsidiary in any court or before any Governmental
            Authority or arbitration board or tribunal which would be reasonably
            likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially restrict
            the ability of the Lessee to comply with its obligations under the
            Operative Documents to which it is a party.

                  (ii) Neither the Lessee nor any Subsidiary is in violation of
            any law, rule or regulation (including any law, rule or regulation
            relating to the protection of the environment or to employee health
            or safety), or in default with respect to any judgment, writ,
            injunction or decree of any Governmental Authority, where such
            violation or default would be reasonably likely to result in a
            Material Adverse Effect.

                  (iii) No exchange control law or regulation materially
            restricts the Lessee from complying with its obligations in respect
            of the Obligations or otherwise under the Operative Documents.

            (g) Federal Reserve Regulations. (i) Neither the Lessee nor any
      Subsidiary that will receive proceeds of any Property Costs paid hereunder
      is engaged principally, or as one of its important activities, in the
      business of extending credit for the purpose of purchasing or carrying
      Margin Stock.

            (ii) No part of the proceeds of any Original Property Costs paid by
      the Lessor will be used, whether directly or indirectly, and whether
      immediately, incidentally or ultimately, to purchase or carry Margin Stock
      or to refund indebtedness originally incurred for such purpose, or for any
      other purpose which entails a violation of, or which is inconsistent with,
      the provisions of the Margin Regulations.

            (h) Investment Company Act; Public Utility Holding Company Act. The
      Lessee is not (i) an "investment company" as defined in, or subject to
      regulation under, the Investment Company Act of 1940 (the "1940 Act") or
      (ii) a "holding company" as defined in, or subject to regulation under,
      the Public Utility Holding Company Act of 1935.

            (i) Full Disclosure; No Material Misstatements. None of the
      representations or warranties made by the Lessee in connection with this
      Participation Agreement as of the date

                                     - 14 -
<PAGE>

                                                         Participation Agreement

      such representations and warranties are made or deemed made, and no
      report, financial statement or other information furnished by or on behalf
      of the Lessee to the Lessor, any Investor or the Arranger pursuant to or
      in connection with this Participation Agreement or the other Operative
      Documents, contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or
      omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
      statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
      were or will be made, not misleading.

            (j) Taxes. Each of the Lessee and each of the material Subsidiaries
      have filed or caused to be filed all federal, state and local tax returns
      which are required to be filed by them, and have paid or caused to be paid
      all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns or on any
      assessments received by any of them, other than any Taxes or assessments
      the validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate
      proceedings, and with respect to which appropriate accounting reserves
      have to the extent required by GAAP been set aside. No liens for Taxes
      have been imposed on or with respect to any Property.

            (k) Employee Pension Benefit Plans. The present aggregate value of
      accumulated benefit obligations of all unfunded and underfunded pension
      plans of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries (based on those assumptions used
      for disclosure in corporate financial statements in accordance with GAAP)
      did not, as of December 31, 2003, exceed by more than $645,000,000 the
      value of the assets of all such plans. Of such $645,000,000, $185,000,000
      is primarily attributable to employee pension plans in countries where the
      funding of such obligations is not required or customary and $101,000,000
      relates primarily to domestic pension plans where funding is not permitted
      under current tax regulations. In these cases the Lessee has recorded book
      reserves to meet the obligations. Trust assets totaling approximately
      $23,100,000 have been established to provide for certain of the foregoing
      domestic pension benefits, however, because of restrictions relating to
      bankruptcy or insolvency, such funds are not included in the funded amount
      of plans for purposes of GAAP.

            (l) Information Delivered to Appraiser. All information heretofore
      furnished by the Lessee in writing to the Lessor, the Investors, the
      Arranger and any appraiser of any Property in connection with an Appraisal
      with respect to the intended use and operation of the Properties for
      purposes of or in connection with this Participation Agreement and the
      other Operative Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or
      thereby is, and all such information hereafter furnished by the Lessee in
      writing to any such Person or to any such appraiser will be, complete and
      correct in all material respects taken as a whole.

            (m) Name, Location, Etc. As of the Documentation Date, the Lessee's
      (i) exact name as such name appears in its certificate of formation is ITT
      Industries, Inc., (ii) jurisdiction of organization is the State of
      Indiana and (iii) chief executive office and principal place of business
      are located at 4 West Red Oak Lane, White Plains, NY 10604.

            (n) Liens. The Lessor Mortgage with respect to the Subject Property
      creates, or upon its execution will create, a valid security interest in
      and mortgage lien on the Subject Property purported to be covered thereby
      in favor of the Lessor, and upon recordation of such Lessor Mortgage and
      the Lessor Financing Statements relating to the Subject Property, such
      security interest and mortgage lien will constitute first priority
      perfected security interests and mortgage liens, prior to all Liens other
      than Permitted Property Liens and no Property shall be encumbered by any
      Liens not identified in Title Abstracts approved in writing by the Lessor.

            (o) Offer of Securities, etc. Neither the Lessee nor any Person
      authorized to act on their behalf has, directly or indirectly, (i) offered
      any interest in the Properties (or, if such sale or

                                     - 15 -
<PAGE>

                                                         Participation Agreement

      offer would be integrated with the sale or offer of such interest in the
      Properties, any other interest similar thereto) for sale to any Person or
      (ii) solicited from any Person any offer to acquire any interest in the
      Properties (or any such other interest), in either case in violation of
      the Securities Act.

            (p) Compliance with Law and Insurance Requirements. The contemplated
      use of each Subject Property by the Lessee and its agents, assignees,
      employees, lessees, sublessees, licensees, tenants and subtenants shall be
      in material compliance with all Applicable Law (including all zoning and
      land use laws and Environmental Laws) and Insurance Requirements, except
      for such Applicable Law as it shall be contesting in good faith by
      appropriate proceedings. There is no action, suit or proceeding (including
      any proceeding in condemnation or eminent domain or under any
      Environmental Law) pending or, to Lessee's actual knowledge, threatened
      with respect to it, or the Subject Property that materially adversely
      affects the title to, or the use, operation or value of, the Subject
      Property.

            (q) Utilities, etc. All utilities required to adequately service the
      applicable Improvements for each Subject Property in accordance with its
      intended use will be available pursuant to adequate permits (including any
      that may be required under applicable Environmental Laws). No Casualty has
      had a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the rights
      and remedies of the Lessor or any Investor under the Operative Documents,
      the ability of the Lessee to perform its obligations under the Operative
      Documents or the Fair Market Sales Value, utility, condition or residual
      value of any Subject Property. Each Subject Property has available all
      material services of public facilities and other utilities necessary for
      use and operation of such Property for its intended purpose, including
      adequate water and electricity. All utilities serving the Subject Property
      are located in, and access to such Property is provided by, either public
      rights-of-way abutting such Property or Appurtenant Rights. All material
      licenses, approvals, authorizations, consents, permits (including
      building, demolition and Environmental Permits, licenses, approvals,
      authorizations and consents), easements and rights-of-way, including proof
      and dedication, required for (x) the use, treatment, storage, transport,
      disposal or disposition of any Hazardous Material on, at, under or from
      the Subject Property during the construction of the Improvements thereon,
      and (y) construction of Modifications (if any) on each Subject Property
      have been obtained from the appropriate Governmental Authorities having
      jurisdiction or from private parties, as the case may be. The Lessee has
      obtained all appropriate Governmental Action, and has and will keep in
      full force and effect, all material operating permits, in each case to the
      extent necessary to allow for each Subject Property to be operated in
      accordance with its intended use.

            (r) Deed. The Deed for each Subject Property that is or is to be a
      Leased Property is sufficient to convey to the Lessor good and marketable
      title to such Property (subject to any Permitted Property Liens).

            (s) Insurance. The Lessee will, on or before the Acquisition Date,
      have obtained insurance coverage covering the Subject Property that meets
      the requirements set forth in Article XIII of the Master Lease, and such
      coverage shall be in full force and effect.

            (t) Flood Hazard Areas. Except as otherwise identified on the
      applicable survey, plat or map with respect to the Subject Property
      delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(d), no portion of the Subject Property
      will be located within an area identified as a special flood hazardous
      area by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

            (u) Title. The representations and warranties of the Lessee set
      forth in Section 13.5(a) are true and correct.

      Section 8.2. Representations on the Acquisition Date and each Replacement
Date. The Lessee represents and warrants to the other parties hereto as of the

            (a) Representations and Warranties. The Lessee's representations and
      warranties set forth in Section 8.1 are true and correct on and as of the
      Acquisition Date or applicable Replacement Date, as the case may be,
      except to the extent such representations or warranties relate solely to
      an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall
      have been true and correct on and as of such earlier date.

            (b) No Lease Default, etc. The Lessee is in compliance with its
      obligations under the Operative Documents and there exists no Lease
      Default or Lease Event of Default. No Lease Default or Lease Event of
      Default will occur as a result of, or after giving effect to, (i) in the
      case of a Subject Property that is a Mortgaged Property, the granting of
      the Liens under the Lessor Mortgages on the Acquisition Date or
      Replacement Date (as applicable) or (ii) in the case of a Subject Property
      that is a Leased Property, the purchase of such Leased Property on the
      Acquisition Date or the replacement of the applicable Property on the
      Replacement Date, as the case may be.

            (c) Liens. The Lessee has not permitted any Liens to be placed
      against any Property other than Permitted Property Liens.

            (d) Advance. The applicable conditions precedent to the closing date
      for the applicable acquisition or replacement of Property set forth in
      Article VI have been satisfied (to the extent required to be satisfied by
      the Lessee).

      Section 8.3. Warranties and Representations of the Lessor. The Lessor
hereby represents and warrants to the Lessee that:

            (a) The Lessor is a limited liability company duly organized,
      validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
      Delaware and has all requisite limited liability company power and
      authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under,
      the Operative Documents to which it is a party.

            (b) The Operative Documents to which it is, or will be, a party have
      been duly authorized by all requisite limited liability company action,
      have been duly executed and delivered by the Lessor, and constitute, and
      each other Operative Document to which Lessor is a party when executed and
      delivered by Lessor will constitute, the valid and binding obligations of
      the Lessor enforceable against the Lessor in accordance with the
      respective terms thereof, except as such enforceability may be limited by
      (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
      similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
      (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
      enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

            (c) Neither the execution and delivery of the Operative Documents,
      the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby nor the
      fulfillment of or compliance with the provisions thereof will require
      consent, approval, authorization, filing, registration or

                                     - 17 -

      qualification under or conflict with or violate any Applicable Law that
      applies to the Lessor or any of its property, except as contemplated by
      the Operative Documents.

            (d) The Lessor is not and will not be funding the Property Costs
      hereunder, and is not performing its obligations under the Operative
      Documents, with the assets of an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
      Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is subject to Title I of ERISA, or "plan" (as
      defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code).

            (e) The Lessor is participating in the Transactions for its own
      account and not with a view toward redistribution; provided that
      disposition of its rights hereunder shall remain in its control and the
      foregoing shall not affect the ability of the Lessor to assign, transfer
      or sell participations in its rights in accordance with the Operative
      Documents.

            (f) Lessor Liens. There are no Lessor Liens on any Property or any
      part thereof, and the execution, delivery and performance by the Lessor of
      the Operative Documents to which it is or will be a party will not subject
      any Property or any part thereof to any Lessor Liens.

      Section 8.4. Representations of each Investor. Each Investor represents
and warrants to the other parties hereto that:

            (a) Source of Funds. Such Investor is not and will not be making its
      capital contributions to the Lessor under the Lessor LLC Agreement, and is

      any Lessor Liens attributable to such Investor.

      businesses (it being understood that the Lessee and its Subsidiaries may
      self-insure to the extent customary with companies similarly situated and
      in the same or similar businesses).

            (e) Obligations and Taxes. Pay and discharge promptly when due all
      taxes, assessments and governmental charges imposed upon it or upon its

      extent required by GAAP, have been set aside.

            (f) Litigation and Other Notices. Give to the Lessor and each
      Investor prompt written notice of the following:

      Financial Officer of the Lessee and such other officers as the Lessee
      shall deem appropriate.

            (h) Use of Proceeds. Use the proceeds of the Property Costs paid by

      representation set forth in Sections 8.1(b) and 8.1(g)(ii).

            (j) Visitation and Inspection of the Properties. At any reasonable
      time and from time to time, the Lessee shall permit the Lessor, any
      Investor and any agents or representatives thereof to visit and inspect
      the Properties upon reasonable notice to the Lessee (except that no such
      notice will be required to be given during the existence and continuance
      of a Lease Event of Default); provided, however, that (x) no such visit or
      inspection shall include any "cleared areas" that require United States
      government security clearances unless the applicable agent or
      representative conducting the inspection has received such required
      security clearances and (y) any visit or inspection by an individual that
      is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident will require notification of
      the Lessee's security office and will be limited to plant-approved public
      tour areas (the restrictions described in this proviso, collectively, the
      "DOD Restrictions"). Any visit to a Property pursuant to this Section
      10.1(j) shall be at the sole risk and expense of the visiting party unless
      a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case any
      such visit shall be at the sole expense of the Lessee.

      take all actions, at its sole cost and expense, to maintain Compliance
      with ISRA with respect to the Clifton Property. "Compliance with ISRA"
      shall mean performance by the Lessee of any requirements imposed under
      ISRA as a result of the Transactions. The ISRA process shall be deemed
      completed upon the receipt by the Lessee of an NFA Letter, as defined by
      N.J.S.A. 13:I K-9(e); with respect to the ISRA proceeding related to the
      Transactions, and full satisfaction of any and all conditions or
      requirements established by NJDEP in such NFA Letter.

            (l) Title Abstract for Clifton Property; Title Insurance for
      Properties.

                  (i) The Lessee will furnish to the Lessor, not later than
            ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, a new Title Abstract for
            the Clifton Property, which Title Abstract shall be dated down to a
            date after the Closing Date and shall identify no Liens (including
            any easements, covenants, leases, agreements or other items), claims
            or lawsuits affecting the Clifton Property other than Permitted
            Property Liens.

                  (ii) If the Lessee's senior unsecured debt rating falls below
            "BBB - " (in the case of S&P) or below "Baa3" (in the case of
            Moody's), or if either Moody's or S&P shall cease to provide a
            rating for the Lessee's senior unsecured debt, then, in any such
            case, the Lessee shall (x) notify the Lessor of such downgrade or
            such cessation immediately and in any event no later than five (5)
            Business Days after the occurrence thereof and (y) upon the request
            of the Lessor, obtain a Title Insurance Policy within fifteen (15)
            Business Days after such request with respect to each Property
            specified by the Lessor that is then subject to the Master Lease (as
            a Leased Property or as a Mortgaged Property) and had a Go Dark
            Value in excess of $7,000,000. Each Title Insurance Policy required
            under this Section 10.1(l)(ii) shall be in an amount not less than
            the then outstanding Termination Base Amount of each applicable
            Property.

      Section 10.2. Negative Covenants. The Lessee covenants and agrees with the
Lessor and each Investor that so long as this Participation Agreement shall
remain in effect or any portion of the Lease Balance or any other amounts
payable hereunder or under the other Operative Documents shall be unpaid, unless
the Lessor shall otherwise consent in writing, it will not, and will not cause
or permit any of the Lessee Subsidiaries to:

      (a) Consolidations, Mergers, and Sales of Assets. Consolidate or merge
with or into any other person or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially
all of its property and assets, or agree to do any of the foregoing, unless (i)

case of a consolidation or merger involving the Lessee and in which the Lessee

corporation or person purchasing, leasing or receiving such property and assets
is organized in the United States of America or a state thereof and agrees to be
bound by the terms and provisions applicable to the Lessee hereunder.

assume (directly or indirectly) any mortgage, pledge or other lien upon any
Principal Property, or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create, suffer to be
created, or assume (directly or indirectly) any mortgage, pledge or other lien
upon any Principal Property; provided, however, that this covenant shall not
apply to any of the following:

      of such construction or improvement, or any mortgage, pledge or other lien

      merger, consolidation or acquisition; provided that such mortgage, pledge

development or improvement of properties, facilities or equipment used for
operating purposes which are, or upon such acquisition, construction,

(ii) at the time of entering into such arrangement, such Principal Property
could have been subjected to a mortgage, pledge or other lien securing
indebtedness of the Lessee or a Restricted Subsidiary in a principal amount

      Section 12.1. Assignments. (a) Each Investor may, without the prior
written consent of the Lessee, assign or otherwise transfer all or a portion of
its Lessor Interest to one or more transferees in accordance with Article X of
the Lessor LLC Agreement; provided that the name and address of the transferee
shall be provided to the Lessee at the time of the transfer for recordation in
its books and records. Upon the effectiveness of any such assignment or other

all purposes of the Operative Documents and, to the extent of such transfer, the
assigning Investor shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent
of the Lessor Interest being assigned or otherwise transferred.

      (b) The Lessor may, with the prior written consent of the Lessee (which
consent shall not be unreasonably withheld or delayed), assign all of its rights
and obligations hereunder to any Person pursuant to an assignment agreement in
form and substance reasonably satisfactory to the Lessee; provided that the name

effective date of the applicable assignment agreement. The Lessor shall make
such filings and give such notices as shall be necessary to evidence such
assignment in all public offices where filings have been made under the
Operative Documents, and the Lessee shall cooperate with the Lessor in effecting
such filings and notices. Upon the effectiveness of any such assignment, the
assignee shall become the "Lessor" for all purposes of the Operative Documents
and the assignor shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder. The Lessee
shall not be responsible for any costs or expenses incurred in connection with
an assignment of all or any of the Lessor's rights and obligations pursuant to
this Section 12.1, and the Lessor (or its assignee) shall pay all such costs and
expenses, including (x) any and all Taxes and fees incurred in recording,
registering or filing any document or instrument, or giving any notices in
connection with any such assignment and (y) all reasonable costs and expenses
(including legal expenses) incurred by the Lessee in connection with such
assignment. In connection with any assignment pursuant to this Section 12.1(b),
the Lessee will, promptly upon the request of the Lessor, execute and deliver an
acknowledgment of such assignment and the succession of the transferee to all
rights and obligations of the transferor Lessor under the Operative Documents in
such form as the transferee may reasonably request.

      Section 12.2. Participations. Each Investor may sell, transfer, grant or
assign participations in all or any part of such Investor's interests and
obligations hereunder; provided that (i) such selling Investor shall remain an
"Investor", for all purposes under the Operative Documents (such selling
Investor's obligations under the Operative Documents remaining unchanged) and
the sub-participant shall not constitute an Investor, (ii) no such
sub-participant shall have, or be granted, rights to approve any amendment or
waiver relating to the Operative Documents except to the extent any such
amendment or waiver would (A) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on or
fees in respect of any investment in which the sub-participant is participating,
(B) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal (including extension of
the Expiration Date or the date of any mandatory prepayment), interest or fees
in which the sub-participant is participating, or (C) release all or
substantially all of the collateral or guarantees (except as expressly provided
in the Operative Documents) supporting any of the investment in which the
sub-participant is participating, (iii) sub-sub-participations by the
sub-participant (except to an Affiliate, parent company or Affiliate of a parent
company of the sub-participant) shall be prohibited and (iv) written notice of
each such participation is given to the Lessee and the name and address of the
sub-participant shall be provided to the Lessee at the time of the participation
for recordation in its books and records. In the case of any such participation,
the sub-participant shall not have any rights under the Operative Documents (the
sub-participant's rights against the selling Investor in respect of such
participation to be those set forth in the participation agreement with such
Investor creating such participation) and all amounts payable by the Lessee
hereunder shall be determined as if such Investor had not sold such
participation; provided, however, that such sub-participant shall be entitled to
receive additional amounts under Sections 13.7, 13.8 and 13.9 on the same basis
as if it were an Investor (but only to the extent that the Investor would have
been entitled to receive such additional amounts with respect to the interest
participated had it not sold such participation). The Lessee shall not be
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by any Investor in connection
with a sale, transfer, grant or assignment of participations pursuant to this
Section 12.2.

      Section 12.3. Withholding Taxes; Pledge Under Regulation A. (a)If the
assignee of any Investor pursuant to Section 12.1 or the subparticipant of any
Investor pursuant to Section 12.2 is (i) not a citizen or resident of the United
States of America, (ii) not a corporation, partnership or other entity created
or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America (or any
jurisdiction thereof), or (iii) not an estate or trust that is subject to
federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (each, a
"Non-U.S. Transferee"), then such Non-U.S. Transferee shall deliver upon the
request of the Lessee (or cause to be delivered) to each of the Lessor and the
Lessee one of the following properly completed and signed U.S. tax forms: (i) an
IRS form W-8ECI (or successor applicable form) or (ii) an IRS form W-8BEN (or
successor applicable form) certifying its foreign status and, if applicable,

Transferee under the Operative Documents. If a Non-U.S. Transferee fails, upon
request by the Lessee, to deliver one of the above valid forms, the Lessee may
(notwithstanding Section 13.6) withhold the applicable amount of U.S. income tax
on payments it makes to (or to the Lessor on behalf of) the Non-U.S. Transferee,
and the Non-U.S. Transferee shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 13.4 for the U.S. withholding taxes so imposed. If the assignee of any
Investor pursuant to Section 12.1 or the subparticipant of any Investor pursuant
to Section 12.2 is not a Non-U.S. Transferee (each, a "U.S. Transferee"), then
such U.S. Transferee shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to each of the
Lessor and the Lessee a properly completed and signed U.S. tax form W-9.

      (a) The Lessor and each Investor may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Article
XII, disclose to such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Lessee or the transactions under
the Operative Documents, subject to appropriate confidentiality requirements
relating to such information.

      (b) Anything in this Article XII to the contrary notwithstanding, any
Investor may without the consent of Lessee or the Lessor, assign and pledge all
or any portion of its investment in the transactions contemplated hereby to any
Federal Reserve Bank, the United States Treasury or to any other financial
institution as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the F.R.S. Board
and any operating circular issued by the Federal Reserve System and/or the
Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise; provided, any payment by the Lessee for the
benefit of the assigning or pledging Investor shall be deemed to satisfy the
Lessee's obligations with respect thereto.

Lessee shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee under this Section 13.1
for any Claim to the extent arising or resulting from (1) the willful misconduct

the Lessee of the commencement thereof, and the Lessee shall be entitled, at the
Lessee's expense, to participate in, and, to the extent that the Lessee desires
to, assume and control the defense thereof; provided, however, that if the
Lessee shall have exercised its rights to control the defense of such Claim to
the exclusion of the applicable Indemnitee, the Lessee shall have acknowledged
in writing its obligation to fully indemnify such Indemnitee in respect of such
action, suit or proceeding, and the Lessee shall keep such Indemnitee fully
apprised of the status of such action, suit or proceeding and shall provide such
Indemnitee with all information with respect to such action, suit or proceeding

involves any risk of imposition of criminal liability or will involve a material
risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than
a Permitted Property Lien) on the Properties or any part thereof or any
interference with the payment of Rent unless, in the case of civil liability
only, the Lessee shall have posted a bond or other security reasonably
satisfactory to the relevant Indemnitees in respect of such risk or (y) the
control of such action, suit or proceeding would involve an actual or potential
conflict of interest, (B) such proceeding involves Claims not fully indemnified
by the Lessee that the Lessee and the Indemnitee have been unable to sever from
the indemnified claim(s), or (C) a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. The Indemnitee will join in the Lessee's efforts to sever such
action. In the event that an Indemnitee has assumed control of any such
proceeding, it shall keep the Lessee fully apprised of the status of such
action, suit or proceeding and shall provide the Lessee with all information
with respect to such action, suit or proceeding as the Lessee may reasonably
request. The Indemnitee may participate at its own expense and with its own
counsel in any proceeding conducted by the Lessee in accordance with the
foregoing. The Lessee shall not enter into any settlement or other compromise
with respect to any Claim which is entitled to be indemnified under Section 13.1
or 13.2 without prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld in the case of a money settlement not involving an
admission of liability of such Indemnitee.

      Each Indemnitee shall at the expense of the Lessee supply the Lessee with
such information and documents reasonably requested by the Lessee as are
necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or
proceeding to the extent permitted by Section 13.1 or 13.2. Unless a Lease Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no Indemnitee shall enter into
any settlement or other compromise with respect to any Claim that is entitled to
be indemnified under Section 13.1 or 13.2 without the prior written consent of
the Lessee, unless such Indemnitee waives its rights to be indemnified under
Section 13.1 or 13.2, as the case may be, with respect to such Claim.

      Upon payment in full of any Claim by the Lessee pursuant to Section 13.1
or 13.2 to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, the Lessee, without any further
action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee may have
relating thereto (other than claims in respect of insurance policies maintained
by such Indemnitee at its own expense), and such Indemnitee shall execute such
instruments of assignment and conveyance, evidence of claims and payment and
such other documents, instruments and agreements as may be necessary to preserve
any such claims and otherwise cooperate with the Lessee and

give such further assurances as are necessary or advisable to enable the Lessee
vigorously to pursue such claims.

      Any amount payable to an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 shall
be paid to such Indemnitee promptly upon receipt of a written demand therefor
from such Indemnitee, accompanied by a written statement describing in
reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the computation of the amount
so payable.

      Section 13.4. General Tax Indemnity.

      (a) Indemnification. Without limitation of the rights of any Tax
Indemnitee under any other indemnification provision of this Article XIII, the
Lessee shall pay and assume liability for, and does hereby agree to indemnify,
protect and defend each Property and all Tax Indemnitees, and hold them harmless
against, all Impositions on an After Tax Basis. The determination of all
Impositions to be paid or indemnified against by the Lessee on an After Tax
Basis shall be made (in good faith) by the Tax Indemnitee. Such determination
shall state with reasonable clarity and detail the basis for such determination
and shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the
Lessee.

      (b) Contests. If any claim shall be made against any Tax Indemnitee or if
any proceeding shall be commenced against any Tax Indemnitee (including a
written notice of such proceeding) for any Imposition as to which the Lessee may
have an indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.4, or if any Tax
Indemnitee shall determine that any Imposition to which the Lessee may have an
indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.4 may be payable, such Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly (and in any event, within thirty (30) days) notify the
Lessee in writing (provided that failure to so notify the Lessee within thirty
(30) days shall not alter such Tax Indemnitee's rights under this Section 13.4
except to the extent such failure precludes the ability to conduct a contest of
the applicable Impositions) and, so long as no Lease Default or Lease Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, shall not take any action with respect
to such claim, proceeding or Imposition without the written consent of the
Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed)
for thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice by the Lessee; provided,
however, that in the case of any such claim or proceeding, if such Tax
Indemnitee shall be required by Applicable Law to take action prior to the end
of such thirty (30) day period, such Tax Indemnitee shall, in such notice to the
Lessee, so inform the Lessee and such Tax Indemnitee shall not take any action
with respect to such claim, proceeding or Imposition without the consent of the
Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed)
for 10 days after the receipt of such notice by the Lessee unless such Tax
Indemnitee shall be required by Applicable Law to take action prior to the end
of such ten (10) day period, provided, further, however, that the failure of the
Tax Indemnitee to give notice referred to in this sentence shall not diminish
Lessee's obligations hereunder except to the extent that such failure precludes
Lessee from contesting such claim.

      The Lessee shall be entitled for a period of thirty (30) days from receipt
of such notice from such Tax Indemnitee (or such shorter period as such Tax
Indemnitee has notified the Lessee is required by Applicable Law for such Tax
Indemnitee to commence such contest), to request in writing that such Tax
Indemnitee contest the Imposition, at the Lessee's sole expense. If (x) such
contest can be pursued in the name of the Lessee and independently from any
other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee for which the
Lessee has not agreed to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee, (y) such contest must be
pursued in the name of such Tax Indemnitee, but can be pursued independently
from any other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee for
which the Lessee has not agreed to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee or (z) such Tax
Indemnitee so requests, then the Lessee shall be permitted to control the
contest of such claim, provided that in the case of any such contest, if such
Tax Indemnitee reasonably determines that such contest by the Lessee could have
an adverse impact on the business or operations of such Tax Indemnitee and
provides a written explanation to the Lessee of such

                                     - 32 -

                                                         Participation Agreement

determination, such Tax Indemnitee may elect to control or reassert control of
the contest. In all other claims relating to Impositions requested to be
contested by the Lessee, such Tax Indemnitee shall control the contest of such
claim, acting through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Lessee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the
Lessee be permitted to pursue or continue any contest (or such Tax Indemnitee be
required to pursue or continue any contest) of any Imposition or claim thereof
through any action, suit or proceeding (A) if such Tax Indemnitee provides the
Lessee with a legal opinion of independent counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Lessee that such action, suit or proceeding involves a risk of imposition of
criminal liability or could involve a material risk of the sale, forfeiture or
loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Property Lien) on
any Property or any part thereof or any interference with the payment of Rent
unless, with respect to civil liability only, the Lessee shall have posted a
bond or other security reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Tax Indemnitee in
respect of such risk, (B) if any Lease Default or Lease Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, (C) unless the Lessee shall have agreed to pay and
shall pay to such Tax Indemnitee on demand and on an After-Tax Basis all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, losses and expenses that such Tax Indemnitee may
incur in connection with contesting such Imposition or claim thereof, including
all reasonable legal, accounting and investigatory fees and disbursements as
well as the Impositions which are the subject of such contest to the extent the
contest is unsuccessful, or (D) if such contest shall involve the payment of a
Tax prior to the contest, unless the Lessee shall provide to such Tax Indemnitee
an interest-free advance in an amount equal to, on an After Tax Basis, the
Imposition that the Tax Indemnitee is so required to pay or (E) unless prior to
commencing any contest the Lessee shall have acknowledged its liability for the
Imposition (if and to the extent that the Tax Indemnitee or Lessee, as the case
may be, shall not prevail in the contest in respect of the Imposition). In
addition, for Tax Indemnitee controlled contests and claims contested in the
name of a Tax Indemnitee, no contest of any Imposition shall be required unless:
(A) the amount of the potential indemnity (taking into account all similar or
logically related claims that have been or are likely to be raised in any audit
involving any or all of such Tax Indemnitees for which the Lessee may be liable
to pay an indemnity under this Section 13.4(b)) exceeds $100,000 and (B) if
requested by such Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee shall have provided to such Tax
Indemnitee at the Lessee's sole expense, an opinion of independent counsel
selected by the Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Tax Indemnitee that a
reasonable basis exists to contest such Imposition (or, in the case of an appeal
from an adverse judicial determination, that there is substantial authority for
a reversal or favorable modification of such decision of such appeal). In no
event shall a Tax Indemnitee be required to appeal an adverse judicial
determination to the United States Supreme Court. In addition, a Tax Indemnitee
shall not be required to contest any claim in its name (or that of an Affiliate)
if the subject matter thereof shall be of a continuing nature and shall have
previously been decided adversely by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant
to the contest provisions of this Section 13.4(b), unless there shall have been
a change in law and the Tax Indemnitee shall have received, at the Lessee's
expense, an opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Lessee and
reasonably acceptable to the Tax Indemnitee stating that, as a result of such
change in law, it is more likely than not that the Tax Indemnitee will prevail
in such contest.

      The party conducting the contest of an Imposition shall consult in good
faith with the other party and its counsel with respect to such contest (or
claim for refund) but the decisions regarding what actions are to be taken with
respect to such contest shall be made by the controlling party in its sole
judgment. In addition, the party controlling the contest shall keep the
non-controlling party reasonably informed as to the progress of the contest, and
shall provide the noncontrolling party with a copy of (or appropriate excerpts
from) any reports or claims issued by the relevant Governmental Authority to the
controlling party thereof, relating to such contest.

      Each Tax Indemnitee shall, at the Lessee's sole expense, supply the Lessee
with such information and documents reasonably requested by the Lessee as are
necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or
proceeding to the extent permitted by this Section 13.4(b), provided,

                                     - 33 -
<PAGE>

                                                         Participation Agreement

however, that such Tax Indemnitee shall not be required to provide to the Lessee
copies of (i) any information, documentation or materials that it reasonably
deems to be confidential or proprietary or (ii) its tax returns or any other
information, documentation or materials in respect of such Tax Indemnitee's
financial position. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13.4(b) to the
contrary, so long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, no Tax Indemnitee shall enter into any settlement or other
compromise or fail to appeal an adverse determination with respect to any claim
for which it is entitled to be indemnified under this Section 13.4 (and with
respect to which contest is required under this Section 13.4(b)) without the
prior written consent of the Lessee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), unless such Tax Indemnitee waives its right to be indemnified under
this Section 13.4 with respect to such claim pursuant to the next paragraph.

      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, a Tax
Indemnitee will not be required to contest or continue to contest (and the
Lessee shall not be permitted to contest or continue to contest) a claim with
respect to any Imposition and shall be permitted to settle or commence any such
claim without the consent of Lessee if such Tax Indemnitee shall waive its right
to indemnification under this Section 13.4 with respect to such claim (and any
claim with respect to such year or any other taxable year the contest of which
is materially adversely affected as a result of such waiver).

      (c) Payments. Any Imposition indemnifiable under this Section 13.4 shall
be paid when due directly to the applicable taxing authority if such direct
payment is practicable and permitted. If direct payment to the applicable taxing
authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made, any amount payable to a Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 13.4 shall be paid to the relevant Tax
Indemnitee within twenty (20) days after receipt of a written demand therefor
from such Tax Indemnitee, which demand shall be accompanied by a written
statement describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable, but in no event
shall the Lessee be required to pay such reimbursement prior to fifteen (15)
days before the date that the relevant Taxes are due. Any payments made pursuant
to this Section 13.4 shall be made directly to such Tax Indemnitee entitled
thereto or the Lessee, as the case may be, in immediately available funds at
such bank or to such account as specified by the payee in written directions to
the payor, or, if no such direction shall have been given, by check of the payor
payable to the order of the payee by certified mail, postage prepaid at its
address as set forth in Schedule II hereto. Upon the request of any Tax
Indemnitee with respect to Imposition that the Lessee is required to pay, the
Lessee shall furnish to such Tax Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of
a receipt for the Lessee's payment of such Tax or such other evidence of payment
as is reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee.

      (d) Reports. In the case of any report, return or statement required to be
filed by the Lessor with respect to any Impositions that are subject to
indemnification under this Section 13.4, the Lessee shall promptly notify the
Lessor of such requirement and, at the Lessee's sole expense (i) if the Lessee
is permitted by Applicable Law, timely file such report, return or statement in
its own name and send a copy of such report, return or statement to the Lessor,
or (ii) if such report, return or statement is required to be in the name of or
filed by the Lessor, or the Lessor otherwise requests that such report, return
or statement be filed in the name of or by the Lessor, the Lessee shall prepare
and finish such report, return or statement in such manner as shall be
satisfactory to the Lessor and shall send the same to the Lessor for filing no
later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date therefor. In any case in
which any Tax Indemnitee will file any such report, return or statement with
respect to any Impositions that are subject to indemnification under this
Section 13.4, the Lessee shall, upon written request of such Tax Indemnitee,
provide such Tax Indemnitee with such information as is reasonably necessary to
allow such Tax Indemnitee to file such report, return or statement.

      Section 13.5. Title Representation and Indemnity.

      (a) The Lessee represents and warrants to the Lessor, each Investor and
the Arranger that: (i) the Seller of each Leased Property is the sole fee owner
thereof and the Lessee is the sole fee owner of each Mortgaged Property, (ii)
none of the Properties are encumbered or affected by any Liens, including any
mortgages or encumbrances, or any easements, covenants, leases, agreements,
restrictions, purchase options, rights of first offer (other than the right of
first offer with respect to the Clifton Property that is described on Schedule
10.2(b) hereto), reversionary rights or other interests, other than Permitted
Property Liens, (iii) all appurtenances to each Property, including any and all
easements, access and other rights appropriate for use and occupancy of such
Property for commercial and other purposes are also owned by the Seller thereof
free and clear of any third-party rights or claims, (iv) there are no mechanics,
tax, judgment or other Liens affecting any of the Properties and all real estate
and other Taxes with regard to each Property are current and fully paid and (v)
there has not been any work performed or materials supplied to any Property
prior to the date hereof which has not been fully paid for and which could give
rise to the filing of any mechanic's liens against any Property. With regard to
third-party leases, the Lessee also represents and warrants to the Lessor that
any leases still appearing in the public records relative to any of the
Properties have expired or been terminated and that the tenants named therein
have no further rights with respect to the applicable Property or Properties.

      (b) In furtherance of the representations and warranties set forth in
clause (a) above and in lieu of title insurance, the Lessee hereby indemnifies
and holds the Lessor, the Investors and the Arranger harmless from any and all
losses, costs and expenses and any diminution in the value of the Lessor's
interest in the Properties that might result from (x) any of the foregoing
representations and warranties being incorrect or inaccurate, either now or in
the future, or (y) any of the following: (i) the invalidity or unenforceability
of the lien of any Lessor Mortgage, (ii) any lack of priority of the Lien of any
Lessor Mortgage over any other Lien encumbering any Property, (iii) any
violation, variation, encroachment or adverse circumstance that would have been
disclosed by an accurate Survey, including any discrepancy which would have been
disclosed with respect to the legal description of any Leased Property attached
to Exhibit A of the Lease Supplement therefor, or (iv) the existence of any Lien
on any Property, including any Permitted Property Lien (other than a Permitted
Property Lien of the type described in clause (i), clause (vii) or clause (viii)
of the definition thereof), it being understood that the Lessee's liability with
respect to the indemnification set forth in this Section 13.5(b) is absolute,
joint and several and shall include both intentional and unintentional
misrepresentations and breaches. In addition to the foregoing, the Lessee agrees
that the representations embodied in Section 13.5(a) are continuing in nature,
and the Lessee covenants and agrees that it shall not cause, permit or allow any
act to occur or any document to be executed which is or may be at variance with
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 13.5(a). In addition,
the Lessee agrees that the indemnification embodied in this Section 13.5(b)
shall also apply to any breach of the foregoing covenant.

      Section 13.6. Withholding Taxes, etc.

      (a) Payments Free of Taxes.

            (i) All payments made by the Lessee under this Participation
      Agreement, the Master Lease and the other Operative Documents shall be
      made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on
      account of, any present or future income (but excluding those Taxes
      described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Impositions),
      excise, stamp, transfer or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties,
      withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever (including interest
      and penalties) now or hereafter imposed (the "Withholding Taxes") by any
      Governmental Authority or taxing authority domestic or foreign (the
      "Taxing Authority"), whether or not such Withholding Taxes were correctly
      or legally asserted. If any

<PAGE>

                                                         Participation Agreement

      Withholding Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts
      payable to, or for the benefit of, any Tax Indemnitee or any Affiliate
      thereof under this Participation Agreement or the other Operative
      Documents, the amounts so payable to such Tax Indemnitee shall be
      increased to the extent necessary to yield on an After Tax Basis such
      amounts payable under this Participation Agreement and the other Operative
      Documents at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Participation
      Agreement and the other Operative Documents. Whenever any Withholding
      Taxes are payable by the Lessee with respect to any payment to or for the
      account of a particular Tax Indemnitee, as promptly as possible
      thereafter, the Lessee shall send to such Tax Indemnitee a certified copy
      of an original official receipt received by the Lessee showing payment
      thereof. If the Lessee fails to pay any Withholding Taxes when due to the
      appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Tax Indemnitee
      required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Lessee shall
      indemnify the Tax Indemnitee for any obligations that may become payable
      by the Tax Indemnitee as a result of any such failure.

            (ii) All payments made by the Lessor under this Participation
      Agreement and the other Operative Documents to any other Tax Indemnitee
      shall be made net of any deduction or withholding for Withholding Taxes.
      If any Withholding Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any
      amounts payable by the Lessor to, or for the benefit of, any other Tax
      Indemnitee under this Participation Agreement or any other Operative
      Document, then the Lessee shall indemnify and pay such Tax Indemnitee on
      an After Tax Basis an amount necessary to yield such Tax Indemnitee (after
      payment of all Withholding Taxes) such amounts payable under this
      Participation Agreement and the other Operative Documents at the rates or
      in the amounts specified in this Participation Agreement and the other
      Operative Documents.

            (iii) Moreover, if any Taxes (the "Indirect Withholding Taxes") in
      the nature of Withholding Taxes are directly asserted by any Taxing
      Authority against any of the Lessor or any Investor with respect to any
      payment received by such Person, such Person may pay such Taxes and the
      Lessee will pay directly to such Person (which payment shall constitute
      Supplemental Rent hereunder), within fifteen (15) Business Days after
      receipt of a written demand therefor accompanied by a written statement
      describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable from the Lessor or
      such Investor (as applicable) such additional amounts (including any
      interest, reasonable costs or expenses and any penalties incurred in
      connection therewith) as are necessary in order that on a fully After Tax
      Basis the net amount received by such Person after the payment of such
      Indirect Withholding Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount)
      shall equal the amount such Person would have received had such Indirect
      Withholding Taxes not been asserted plus interest on such additional
      amounts at a rate per annum of Overnight LIBOR plus 77 basis points (or,
      in the case of any such additional amounts outstanding after the
      expiration of such fifteen (15) Business Day period, a rate per annum
      equal to the Overdue Rate), calculated (on the basis of actual days
      elapsed in a year of 360 days) from the date of payment of such Indirect
      Withholding Taxes by the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable) to the
      date of payment of such additional amounts by the Lessee. If the Lessee
      fails to pay any such Indirect Withholding Taxes as and when due to the
      appropriate Taxing Authority or fails to remit to the Lessor for the
      benefit of the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable), the required
      receipts or other required documentary evidence, then the Lessee shall
      indemnify the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable), on an After Tax
      Basis, for any incremental Taxes (whether or not constituting Withholding
      Taxes), interest, penalties and reasonable expenses that may become
      payable by the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable) as a result of any
      such failure.

            (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
      13.6(a), if the applicable Tax Indemnitee is a direct or indirect
      transferee or assignee of an original Tax Indemnitee, then Lessee shall be
      obligated to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee for Withholding

      Taxes and Indirect Withholding Taxes only to the extent that based on the
      Applicable Law in effect on the date such Withholding Tax or Indirect
      Withholding Tax is imposed or becomes payable, the amount of such Tax does
      not exceed the amount of such Tax that would have been imposed against or
      payable by such original Tax Indemnitee.

            (v) The obligations of the Lessee under this Section 13.6(a) shall
      survive the termination of this Participation Agreement and the other
      Operative Documents and the payment of the Lease Balance and all other
      amounts payable under the Operative Documents.

      (b) Withholding Exemption Certificates. On or prior to the Acquisition
Date, or if such date does not occur within thirty (30) days after the date of
this Participation Agreement, by the end of such 30-day period, each Investor
that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state
or political subdivision thereof shall deliver to the Lessor and the Lessee two
duly completed copies of (i) an IRS form W-8ECI (or successor applicable form)
or (ii) an IRS form W-8BEN(or successor applicable form) certifying its foreign
status and, if applicable, claiming an exemption under a U.S. tax treaty. Each
such Investor further agrees (i) promptly to notify the Lessee and the Lessor of
any change of circumstances that would prevent such Investor from receiving
payments hereunder without any deduction or withholding or with reduced
deduction or withholding of such taxes as indicated on the most recent such
certificate or other form previously delivered by such Investor and (ii) if such
Investor has not so notified the Lessee and the Lessor of any change of
circumstances which would prevent such Investor from receiving payments
hereunder without any deduction or withholding or with reduced deduction or
withholding of taxes as indicated on the most recent such certificate or other
form previously delivered by such Investor, then on or before the date that any
certificate or other form delivered by such Investor under this Section 13.6(b)
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent such certificate or form previously delivered by such
Investor, to deliver to the Lessee and the Lessor a new certificate or form,
certifying that such Investor is entitled to receive payments under the
Operative Documents without deduction or withholding or with reduced deduction
or withholding of such taxes. If any Investor fails to provide to the Lessee or
the Lessor pursuant to this Section 13.6(b) (or, in the case of any Person that
becomes an Investor through an assignment by another Investor, pursuant to
Section 12.1) any certificates or other evidence required by such provision to
establish that such Investor is, at the time it becomes an Investor hereunder,
entitled to receive payments under the Operative Documents without deduction or
withholding or with reduced deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes, such Investor shall not be entitled to any indemnification
under Section 13.6(a) for any withholding taxes to the extent imposed on such
Investor primarily as a result of such failure.

      (c) Tax Returns. Nothing contained in this Section 13.6 shall require the
Lessor or any Investor (or any other Person) to make available any of its Tax
returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes, which it deems to be
confidential).

      Section 13.7. Increased Costs, etc. If the adoption of or any change in
any Applicable Law or in the interpretation or application thereof applicable to
any Affected Party, or compliance by any Affected Party with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Documentation
Date (or, if later, the date on which such Affected Party becomes an Affected
Party):

            (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special

            (ii) shall impose on such Affected Party any other condition
      (excluding any Tax of any kind) whatsoever in connection with the
      Operative Documents;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Affected
Party of making, continuing or maintaining its investment in the Transactions,
or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any
such case, upon notice to the Lessee from such Affected Party, through the
Lessor in accordance herewith, the Lessee shall pay such Affected Party any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Affected Party for such
increased cost or reduced amount receivable; provided, however, that the Lessee
shall not be obligated to pay any Affected Party that is a direct or indirect
transferee or assignee of an original Affected Party any such additional amounts
in excess of the amounts, if any, that would have been payable to the original
Affected Party after giving effect to such adoption, change or compliance. All
payments required by this Section 13.7 shall be made by the Lessee within five
(5) Business Days after demand by the applicable Affected Party. If any Affected
Party becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this
subsection, it shall provide prompt notice thereof to the Lessee, through the
Lessor, certifying (x) that one of the events described in this Section 13.7 has
occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to
the increased cost or reduced amount resulting from such event and (z) as to the
additional amount demanded by such Affected Party and a reasonably detailed
explanation of the calculation thereof (including the method by which such
Affected Party allocated such amounts to the Lessee). Such a certificate as to
any additional amounts payable pursuant to this clause submitted by such
Affected Party, through the Lessor, to the Lessee shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

      Section 13.8. Funding Losses; Break Costs. (a) The Lessee agrees to
indemnify each Indemnitee and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from any Break
Costs that such Indemnitee may sustain or incur (other than through such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) as a consequence of (i)
failure by the Lessor to pay the Property Cost for any Property on the date
specified in the Acquisition Date Notice as the Acquisition Date therefor, (ii)
default by the Lessee in paying any Property Cost or Aggregate Property Cost
after the Lessee has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of
the Master Lease, (iii) the Lessee paying Basic Rent on a day that is not a
Scheduled Payment Date or (iv) the Lessee paying any Property Cost, Aggregate
Property Cost, Termination Base Amount or Termination Price.

      (b) The Lessee shall, upon receipt from the Lessor or any Investor of a
statement of the amount of any loss, cost or expense constituting Break Costs
prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail (which statement shall be
binding absent manifest error), pay the amount of such Break Costs to the
requesting Person.

      Section 13.9. Capital Adequacy. If the adoption of any applicable law,
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Affected Party with any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, in each case made
subsequent to the Documentation Date has or will have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on any Affected Party's or its parent company's capital, as a
consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Affected Party or its parent company could have achieved but for such
adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such
Affected Party's or its parent company's policies with respect to capital
adequacy), then, upon notice from such Affected Party, the Lessee shall pay to
such Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Affected Party and its parent company for such reduction (it being understood
that such parent company shall not be reimbursed to the extent its subsidiary
Affected Party is reimbursed by the Lessee in connection with the same or a
similar law, rule, regulation, change,

request or directive applicable to such Affected Party). All payments required
by this Section 13.9 shall be made by the Lessee within five (5) Business Days
after demand by the Affected Party. If any Affected Party becomes entitled to
claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 13.9, it shall provide
prompt written notice thereof to the Lessee certifying (x) that one of the
events described in this Section 13.9 has occurred and describing in reasonable
detail the nature of such event, (y) as to the increased cost or reduced amount
resulting from such event and (z) as to the additional amount demanded by such
Affected Party and a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof.
Such a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section
13.9 submitted by such Affected Party, through the Lessor, to the Lessee shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

      Section 13.10. Indemnity Payments in Addition to Lease Obligations. The
Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Lessee's obligations to make indemnity
payments under this Article XIII are separate from, in addition to, and do not
reduce, the Lessee's obligations to pay any amounts owing from time to time
under the Lease.

      Section 13.11. Payment of Amounts Due under this Article XIII. All amounts
payable by the Lessee pursuant to this Article XIII shall be paid by the Lessee
directly to the Lessor, the Lessor Administrator, the applicable Investor or the
Arranger (as applicable), upon demand from such Person therefor, in immediately
available funds consisting of lawful currency of the United States of America
together with interest on such amounts at a rate per annum of Overnight LIBOR
plus 77 basis points from the date of demand until the same shall be paid (or,
in the case of any such amounts outstanding ten (10) Business Days after the
date of such demand, a rate per annum equal to the Overdue Rate).

      Section 13.12. Survival. The obligations of the Lessee under this Article
XIII shall survive the termination of this Participation Agreement and the other
Operative Documents and the payment of the Lease Balance and all other amounts
payable under the Operative Documents, and shall be separate and independent
from any remedy under the Lease or any other Operative Document.

                                   ARTICLE XIV

                                  MISCELLANEOUS

      Section 14.1. Survival of Agreements. All covenants, agreements,
representations and warranties made by the Lessee in the Operative Documents and
in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection
therewith shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lessor, the
Investors and the Arranger and shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Participation Agreement, the payment by the Lessor of the Property Costs and the
transfer of the Leased Properties to the Lessor regardless of any investigation
made by any Indemnitee or on its behalf, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as any portion of the Lease Balance is outstanding and unpaid.
The provisions of Article IX and Article XIII shall remain operative and in full
force and effect regardless of the occurrence of the Expiration Date, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents, the
payment of the Lease Balance, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of any Operative Document or any investigation made by or on behalf of
any Indemnitee.

      Section 14.2. No Broker, Etc. Each of the parties hereto represents to the
others that it has not retained or employed any broker, finder or financial
adviser (other than the Arranger) to act on its behalf in connection with this
Participation Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or in the other
Operative Documents nor has it authorized any broker, finder or financial
adviser retained or employed by any other Person so to act. In the event that
any party retains any other broker, finder or financial advisor, such party will
promptly notify the other parties in writing of such broker, finder or financial

designate a new address or facsimile number or electronic mail address for
purposes of notice hereunder by written notice to each of the other parties
hereto in accordance with this Section.

      Section 14.4. Counterparts. This Participation Agreement may be executed
by the parties hereto in separate counterparts, each of which when so executed
and delivered shall be an original, but all such counterparts shall together
constitute but one and the same instrument.

      Section 14.5. Amendments, Etc. Neither any Operative Document nor any of
the terms thereof may be terminated (except as expressly required under the
terms of any Operative Document or upon payment in full of the Lease Balance),
amended, supplemented, waived or modified without the written agreement or
consent of the Lessee and the Lessor; provided, however, that the Lessee's
consent shall not be required with respect to any termination, amendment,
supplement, waiver or modification of the Lessor Administration Agreement or the
Lessor LLC Agreement other than (x) any such amendment, supplement, waiver or
modification that increases the costs, expenses or other amounts required to be
paid by the Lessee (provided that the Lessee's consent to any such amendment,
supplement, waiver or modification shall not be unreasonably withheld) or (y)
any amendment or other modification to the Lessor LLC Agreement that expands the
scope of the Lessor's permitted activities beyond those activities relating to
the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents or permits the Lessor
to dissolve prior to the Expiration Date or earlier termination of the Master
Lease with respect to all of the Properties.

      Section 14.6. Headings, Etc. The Table of Contents and headings of the
various Articles and Sections of this Participation Agreement are for

PRINCIPLES, EXCEPT TITLE 14 OF ARTICLE 5 OF THE NEW YORK GENERAL OBLIGATIONS
LAW.

      Section 14.9. Severability. Any provision of this Participation Agreement
that is prohibited or unenforceable in any jurisdiction shall, as to such
jurisdiction, be ineffective to the extent of such prohibition or
unenforceability without invalidating the remaining provisions hereof, and any
such prohibition or unenforceability in any jurisdiction shall not invalidate or
render unenforceable such provision in any other jurisdiction.

      Section 14.10. Liability Limited. (a) Notwithstanding any provision to the
contrary in any Operative Document, the obligations and agreements of the Lessor
hereunder and under the other Operative Documents and any other certificate,
instrument or document executed in connection herewith or therewith, and any
other document supplemental hereto or thereto, shall be nonrecourse to the
Lessor and its shareholders, members, officers, agents and employees, and none
of the Lessor and its shareholders, officers, agents and employees shall have
any personal liability or accountability whatsoever under or in respect of any
Operative Document or any transaction contemplated thereby, recourse being
limited to the Lessor's interest in the Properties (including the proceeds

negligence, (b) breach of any of its representations or warranties under the
Operative Documents, (c) any Lessor Liens attributable to it, or (d) breach of

preceding sentence: (i) the Lessor shall have no personal liability under any of
the Operative Documents; (ii) all obligations of the Lessor to the Investors are
solely nonrecourse obligations except to the extent that the Lessor has received

expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as consideration for, the
execution and delivery of the Operative Documents by the Lessor.

      (b) No Investor shall have any obligation to any other Investor or to the
Lessee with respect to transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents
except those obligations of such Investor expressly set forth in the Operative
Documents or except as set forth in the instruments delivered in connection
therewith, and no Investor shall be liable for performance by any other party
hereto of such other party's obligations under the Operative Documents except as
otherwise so set forth.

      Section 14.11. Further Assurances. The parties hereto shall promptly cause
to be taken, executed, acknowledged or delivered, at the sole expense of the
Lessee, all such further acts, conveyances, documents and assurances as the
other parties may from time to time reasonably request in order to carry out and

be created pursuant to this Participation Agreement, the other Operative
Documents, and the transactions thereunder (including the preparation, execution
and filing of any and all Uniform Commercial Code financing statements and other
filings or registrations which the parties hereto may from time to time request
to be filed or effected). The Lessee, at its own expense and upon prior request
from any other party, shall take such action as specified in such request, to

in the preceding sentence) in order to maintain and protect all security
interests provided for hereunder or under any other Operative Document.

      Section 14.13. Setoff. Each Investor and the Lessor shall, upon the
occurrence of any Lease Event of Default, have the right to appropriate and,
subject to Section 7.4, apply to the payment of the Obligations as security for
the payment of such Obligations, any and all balances, credits, deposits,
accounts or moneys of the Lessee then or thereafter maintained with any Investor
or the Lessor. The rights of the Investors and the Lessor under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff under
applicable law or otherwise) which such Person may have.

      Section 14.14. Successors and Assigns. All the terms and provisions of
this Participation Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, that the Lessee

SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROVISION (AND EACH OTHER PROVISION OF EACH
OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY) AND THAT THIS PROVISION IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE LESSOR AND THE INVESTORS ENTERING INTO THIS
PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT AND EACH SUCH OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT.

      Section 14.16. NO ORAL AGREEMENTS. THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT AND THE
OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS EMBODY THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING AMONG

PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO
UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

      Section 14.17. No Investor Responsible for Other Investors. The
obligations of each of the Lessor and each Investor under this Participation
Agreement and the other Operative Documents are several and not joint; and, in
the event of a failure by any such Person to perform any of its obligations
hereunder or under any other Operative Document, neither the Lessor nor any
Investor (other than such defaulting Lessor or Investor, as the case may be)
shall have any liability as a consequence thereof.
