ITEM 1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement

On December 15, 2004, ITT Industries, Inc. (ITT) entered into a financing
arrangement with Rexus L.L.C (Rexus), and Air Bail S.A.S. and RBS Lombard, Inc.
as the investors. Pursuant to a participation agreement among ITT, Rexus and the
investors and a master lease agreement and certain lease supplements between
Rexus, as lessor, and ITT, as lessee, ITT transferred certain real property
owned by ITT to Rexus, an entity wholly owned by the investors, for a total
consideration of $120 million, and Rexus leased such properties back to ITT. The
proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes. The leases have a term of
ten years and the total amount payable by ITT under all of the leases, including
the interest component of the lease payments, is approximately $160 million. The
properties involved in the sale-leaseback transaction include facilities owned
by ITT in Fort Wayne, Indiana, Cheektowaga, New York, Colorado Springs,
Colorado, Archbold, Ohio, Morton Grove, Illinois, and Chicago, Illinois.

The parties intend that for (i) financial accounting purposes with
respect to ITT, (ii) United States federal and all United States state and
local income tax purposes and (iii) United States state real estate and
commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (1) the lease arrangement will be
treated as a financing arrangement, (2) Rexus will be deemed a lender making a
loan to ITT which loan is secured by the properties, and (3) ITT will be
treated as the owner of the properties and will be entitled to all tax benefits
ordinarily available to an owner of properties similar to the properties for
such tax purposes. Lease payments during the term of the leases will be paid
yearly in arrears in amounts sufficient to satisfy ITT's obligations under the
master lease. ITT will also pay supplemental rent from time to time to cover
administrative costs of the lessor and other amounts that may be due the lessor
or the investors. ITT will remain responsible for operating, repairing,
insuring and maintaining the leased properties, the payment of taxes due on the
properties, and all costs, expenses and liabilities incurred in connection with
the properties.

ITT's obligations under the leases are unconditional and absolute, without
set-off, counterclaim or recoupment rights, and are secured by a collateral
assignment of its leasehold interests as well as by a lien on its facility in
Clifton, New Jersey which was not included in the sale-leaseback arrangements
described above.

The participation agreement includes covenants of ITT that are usual and
customary for agreements of this type, including covenants requiring the
provision of financial reports to the lessor, maintaining insurance on each of
the properties, and limitations on mergers and sales of assets, liens and
further sale and leaseback transactions. The participation agreement also
requires that ITT will not permit its ratio of consolidated earnings to
consolidated interest expense to be less than 3.75 to 1.0.

In the event of a default by ITT under the master lease, the lessor may, among
other things, declare the entire remaining amounts under the leases due and
payable, terminate the master lease and expel ITT from the properties.

At the end of the lease term, ITT retains the right to repurchase all (but not
less than all) of the leased properties from the lessor for total consideration
of one dollar.

Copies of the participation agreement, master lease and lease supplements are
attached as Exhibits 10.1 through 10.10 and are incorporated herein by
reference. The foregoing summaries of the terms of the participation agreement,
master lease and supplemental leases do not purport to be complete and are
qualified in their entirety by reference to each of the participation agreement,
master lease and the supplemental leases.

                      OVERDUE AMOUNTS; RENT PAYMENTS; FEES

      Section 4.1. Overdue Amounts; Application of Rent Payments, etc. (a) If
all or any portion of the Aggregate Property Cost, any Accrual Rent, Fixed Rent,
Supplemental Rent or any other amount payable hereunder shall not be paid when

overdue amount shall bear interest at a rate per annum which is equal to the
Overdue Rate.

      (a) All Basic Rent and Supplemental Rent paid by the Lessee under the
Lease from time to time shall be applied as set forth in Article VII.

      (b) If not repaid sooner, the Aggregate Property Cost shall be repaid in
full on the Scheduled Lease Termination Date.

      Section 4.2. Structuring Fee. The Lessee agrees to pay to the Arranger on
the Acquisition Date the Structuring Fee in accordance with the Arrangement
Letter.

      Section 4.3. Place and Manner of Payments. Except as otherwise
specifically provided herein, all payments by the Lessee hereunder, under the
Master Lease or under any other Operative Document shall be made to the Lessor
(or, in the case of Supplemental Rent owing under Article XIII, directly to the
Person entitled thereto), in Dollars in immediately available funds, without
offset, deduction, counterclaim or withholding of any kind (except as provided
in Section 12.3(a)), to the Account in New York, New York not later than 10:00
a.m. (New York time) on the date when due. Payments received after such time
shall be deemed to have been received on the next succeeding Business Day. The
Lessee shall, at the time it makes any payment under any Operative Document,
specify to the Lessor the Basic Rent, Property Cost, Termination Price,
Termination Base Amount, Fees, Supplemental Rent or other amounts payable by the
Lessee hereunder to which such payment is to be applied (and in the event that
it fails so to specify, or if such application would be inconsistent with the
terms hereof, the Lessor shall apply such payment in such manner as the Lessor
may determine to be appropriate in respect of obligations owing by Lessee
subject to the terms of Article VII). Whenever any payment hereunder shall be
stated to be due on a day which is not a Business Day, the due date thereof
shall be extended to the next Business Day (subject to accrual of interest and
fees for the period of such extension); provided that if the next Business Day
falls in the next calendar year, payment shall instead be due on the preceding
Business Day.

      Section 4.4. Sharing of Payments. The Investors agree among themselves

respect of any obligation owing to the Lessor or to

such Investor under the Operative Documents through the exercise of a right of
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, or pursuant to a secured claim under
Section 506 of the Bankruptcy Code or other security or interest arising from,
or in lieu of, such secured claim, received by such Investor under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law or otherwise, or by any
other means, in excess of its pro rata share of such payment as provided for in
this Participation Agreement and the Lessor LLC Agreement, such Investor shall
promptly purchase from the other Investor a participation in such amounts, and
make such other adjustments from time to time, as shall be equitable to the end
that all Investors share such payment in accordance with their respective
ratable shares as provided for in the Lessor LLC Agreement. The Investors
further agree among themselves that if payment to an Investor obtained by such
Investor through the exercise of a right of setoff, banker's lien, counterclaim
or other event as aforesaid shall be rescinded or must otherwise be restored,
each Investor which shall have shared the benefit of such payment shall, by
repurchase of a participation theretofore sold, return its share of that benefit
(together with its share of any accrued interest payable with respect thereto)
to each Investor whose payment shall have been rescinded or otherwise restored.
The Lessee agrees that any Investor so purchasing such a participation may, to
the fullest extent permitted by law, exercise all rights of payment, including
setoff, banker's lien or counterclaim, with respect to such participation as
fully as if such Investor were a holder of such obligation in the amount of such
participation. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, if any Investor
shall fail to remit to any other Investor an amount payable by such party to
such other Investor pursuant to the Operative Documents on the date when such
amount is due, such payments shall be made together with interest thereon for
each date from the date such amount is due until the date such amount is paid to
the Lessor at a rate per annum equal to the Overnight LIBOR. If under any
applicable bankruptcy, insolvency or other similar law, any Investor receives a
secured claim in lieu of a setoff to which this Section 4.4 applies, such
Investor shall, to the extent practicable, exercise its rights in respect of
such secured claim in a manner consistent with the rights of the Investors under
this Section 4.4 to share in the benefits of any recovery on such secured claim.

                                    ARTICLE V

                           AMOUNTS DUE UNDER THE LEASE

      Section 5.1. Amounts Due Under the Lease. Anything herein or elsewhere to
the contrary notwithstanding, it is the intention of the Lessee, the Lessor and
the Investors that: (i) the amount and timing of installments of Basic Rent due
and payable from time to time from the Lessee under the Lease shall be equal to
the sum of (x) the aggregate payments due and payable as Accrual Rent on each
Scheduled Payment Date and (y) the aggregate payments due and payable as Fixed
Rent on each Scheduled Payment Date; (ii) if the Lessee elects to purchase or
becomes obligated to purchase all of the Properties under the Lease or elects
the Return Option, the Lease Balance with respect thereto and all other
obligations of the Lessee owing to the Lessor and the Investors shall be due and
payable in full by the Lessee on the date set forth in the Lease; (iii) upon a
Lease Event of Default resulting in an acceleration of the Lessee's obligation
to purchase the Lessor's interest in each Property under the Lease, the amounts
then due and payable by the Lessee under the Lease shall include all amounts
necessary to pay in full the Lease Balance plus all other amounts then due from
the Lessee under the Operative Documents (and the Lessee agrees that, in any
such event, it will pay such amounts regardless of whether the Lease is then in
effect); and (v) if the Lessee elects to terminate or is required to purchase or
terminate any Property pursuant to Section 15.1 or 19.1 of the Master Lease, the
amounts then due and payable by the Lessee shall include all amounts necessary
to pay the Termination Base Amount or Termination Price (as applicable) of such
Property together with all Rent allocable thereto.

      matters the Lessor and the Lessee reasonably agree are not material. If
      such Environmental Audit reveals the need for additional review or
      testing, the Lessee shall have provided such additional assessments as are
      recommended by such consultant.

            (d) Property Survey. With respect to each Replacement Date, the

      the Subject Property subject only to matters approved by the Lessor in its
      reasonable discretion. Title insurance will not be required and the Lessor
      will rely upon the Lessee's title indemnity set forth in Section 13.5.

            (f) Evidence of Insurance. The Lessor shall have received evidence
      that the insurance maintained by the Lessee with respect to the Subject

            Lessee or any Subsidiary in any court or before any Governmental
            Authority or arbitration board or tribunal which would be reasonably
            likely to result in a Material Adverse Effect or materially restrict
            the ability of the Lessee to comply with its obligations under the
            Operative Documents to which it is a party.

                  (ii) Neither the Lessee nor any Subsidiary is in violation of

      immediately, incidentally or ultimately, to purchase or carry Margin Stock
      or to refund indebtedness originally incurred for such purpose, or for any
      other purpose which entails a violation of, or which is inconsistent with,
      the provisions of the Margin Regulations.

                                                         Participation Agreement

      such representations and warranties are made or deemed made, and no
      report, financial statement or other information furnished by or on behalf
      of the Lessee to the Lessor, any Investor or the Arranger pursuant to or
      in connection with this Participation Agreement or the other Operative
      Documents, contains or will contain any material misstatement of fact or
      omits or will omit to state any material fact necessary to make the
      statements therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they
      were or will be made, not misleading.

            (j) Taxes. Each of the Lessee and each of the material Subsidiaries
      have filed or caused to be filed all federal, state and local tax returns
      which are required to be filed by them, and have paid or caused to be paid
      all Taxes shown to be due and payable on such returns or on any
      assessments received by any of them, other than any Taxes or assessments
      the validity of which is being contested in good faith by appropriate
      proceedings, and with respect to which appropriate accounting reserves
      have to the extent required by GAAP been set aside. No liens for Taxes
      have been imposed on or with respect to any Property.

            (k) Employee Pension Benefit Plans. The present aggregate value of
      accumulated benefit obligations of all unfunded and underfunded pension
      plans of the Lessee and its Subsidiaries (based on those assumptions used
      for disclosure in corporate financial statements in accordance with GAAP)
      did not, as of December 31, 2003, exceed by more than $645,000,000 the
      value of the assets of all such plans. Of such $645,000,000, $185,000,000
      is primarily attributable to employee pension plans in countries where the
      funding of such obligations is not required or customary and $101,000,000
      relates primarily to domestic pension plans where funding is not permitted
      under current tax regulations. In these cases the Lessee has recorded book
      reserves to meet the obligations. Trust assets totaling approximately
      $23,100,000 have been established to provide for certain of the foregoing
      domestic pension benefits, however, because of restrictions relating to
      bankruptcy or insolvency, such funds are not included in the funded amount
      of plans for purposes of GAAP.

            (l) Information Delivered to Appraiser. All information heretofore
      furnished by the Lessee in writing to the Lessor, the Investors, the
      Arranger and any appraiser of any Property in connection with an Appraisal
      with respect to the intended use and operation of the Properties for
      purposes of or in connection with this Participation Agreement and the
      other Operative Documents or any transaction contemplated hereby or
      thereby is, and all such information hereafter furnished by the Lessee in
      writing to any such Person or to any such appraiser will be, complete and
      correct in all material respects taken as a whole.

            (m) Name, Location, Etc. As of the Documentation Date, the Lessee's
      (i) exact name as such name appears in its certificate of formation is ITT
      Industries, Inc., (ii) jurisdiction of organization is the State of
      Indiana and (iii) chief executive office and principal place of business
      are located at 4 West Red Oak Lane, White Plains, NY 10604.

            (n) Liens. The Lessor Mortgage with respect to the Subject Property
      creates, or upon its execution will create, a valid security interest in
      and mortgage lien on the Subject Property purported to be covered thereby
      in favor of the Lessor, and upon recordation of such Lessor Mortgage and
      the Lessor Financing Statements relating to the Subject Property, such
      security interest and mortgage lien will constitute first priority
      perfected security interests and mortgage liens, prior to all Liens other
      than Permitted Property Liens and no Property shall be encumbered by any
      Liens not identified in Title Abstracts approved in writing by the Lessor.

            (o) Offer of Securities, etc. Neither the Lessee nor any Person
      authorized to act on their behalf has, directly or indirectly, (i) offered
      any interest in the Properties (or, if such sale or

                                     - 15 -

      offer would be integrated with the sale or offer of such interest in the
      Properties, any other interest similar thereto) for sale to any Person or
      (ii) solicited from any Person any offer to acquire any interest in the
      Properties (or any such other interest), in either case in violation of
      the Securities Act.

            (p) Compliance with Law and Insurance Requirements. The contemplated
      use of each Subject Property by the Lessee and its agents, assignees,
      employees, lessees, sublessees, licensees, tenants and subtenants shall be
      in material compliance with all Applicable Law (including all zoning and
      land use laws and Environmental Laws) and Insurance Requirements, except
      for such Applicable Law as it shall be contesting in good faith by
      appropriate proceedings. There is no action, suit or proceeding (including
      any proceeding in condemnation or eminent domain or under any
      Environmental Law) pending or, to Lessee's actual knowledge, threatened
      with respect to it, or the Subject Property that materially adversely
      affects the title to, or the use, operation or value of, the Subject
      Property.

            (q) Utilities, etc. All utilities required to adequately service the
      applicable Improvements for each Subject Property in accordance with its
      intended use will be available pursuant to adequate permits (including any
      that may be required under applicable Environmental Laws). No Casualty has
      had a Material Adverse Effect or a material adverse effect on the rights
      and remedies of the Lessor or any Investor under the Operative Documents,
      the ability of the Lessee to perform its obligations under the Operative
      Documents or the Fair Market Sales Value, utility, condition or residual
      value of any Subject Property. Each Subject Property has available all
      material services of public facilities and other utilities necessary for
      use and operation of such Property for its intended purpose, including
      adequate water and electricity. All utilities serving the Subject Property
      are located in, and access to such Property is provided by, either public
      rights-of-way abutting such Property or Appurtenant Rights. All material
      licenses, approvals, authorizations, consents, permits (including
      building, demolition and Environmental Permits, licenses, approvals,
      authorizations and consents), easements and rights-of-way, including proof
      and dedication, required for (x) the use, treatment, storage, transport,
      disposal or disposition of any Hazardous Material on, at, under or from
      the Subject Property during the construction of the Improvements thereon,
      and (y) construction of Modifications (if any) on each Subject Property
      have been obtained from the appropriate Governmental Authorities having
      jurisdiction or from private parties, as the case may be. The Lessee has
      obtained all appropriate Governmental Action, and has and will keep in
      full force and effect, all material operating permits, in each case to the
      extent necessary to allow for each Subject Property to be operated in
      accordance with its intended use.

            (r) Deed. The Deed for each Subject Property that is or is to be a
      Leased Property is sufficient to convey to the Lessor good and marketable
      title to such Property (subject to any Permitted Property Liens).

            (s) Insurance. The Lessee will, on or before the Acquisition Date,
      have obtained insurance coverage covering the Subject Property that meets
      the requirements set forth in Article XIII of the Master Lease, and such
      coverage shall be in full force and effect.

            (t) Flood Hazard Areas. Except as otherwise identified on the
      applicable survey, plat or map with respect to the Subject Property
      delivered pursuant to Section 6.1(d), no portion of the Subject Property
      will be located within an area identified as a special flood hazardous
      area by the Federal Emergency Management Agency.

      forth in Section 13.5(a) are true and correct.

      Section 8.2. Representations on the Acquisition Date and each Replacement
Date. The Lessee represents and warrants to the other parties hereto as of the

      warranties set forth in Section 8.1 are true and correct on and as of the

      except to the extent such representations or warranties relate solely to
      an earlier date, in which case such representations and warranties shall
      have been true and correct on and as of such earlier date.

            (b) No Lease Default, etc. The Lessee is in compliance with its
      obligations under the Operative Documents and there exists no Lease
      Default or Lease Event of Default. No Lease Default or Lease Event of
      Default will occur as a result of, or after giving effect to, (i) in the
      case of a Subject Property that is a Mortgaged Property, the granting of
      the Liens under the Lessor Mortgages on the Acquisition Date or
      Replacement Date (as applicable) or (ii) in the case of a Subject Property
      that is a Leased Property, the purchase of such Leased Property on the
      Acquisition Date or the replacement of the applicable Property on the
      Replacement Date, as the case may be.

            (c) Liens. The Lessee has not permitted any Liens to be placed
      against any Property other than Permitted Property Liens.

            (d) Advance. The applicable conditions precedent to the closing date
      for the applicable acquisition or replacement of Property set forth in
      Article VI have been satisfied (to the extent required to be satisfied by
      the Lessee).

      Section 8.3. Warranties and Representations of the Lessor. The Lessor
hereby represents and warrants to the Lessee that:

            (a) The Lessor is a limited liability company duly organized,
      validly existing and in good standing under the laws of the State of
      Delaware and has all requisite limited liability company power and
      authority to execute and deliver, and to perform its obligations under,
      the Operative Documents to which it is a party.

            (b) The Operative Documents to which it is, or will be, a party have
      been duly authorized by all requisite limited liability company action,
      have been duly executed and delivered by the Lessor, and constitute, and
      each other Operative Document to which Lessor is a party when executed and
      delivered by Lessor will constitute, the valid and binding obligations of
      the Lessor enforceable against the Lessor in accordance with the
      respective terms thereof, except as such enforceability may be limited by
      (i) applicable bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, moratorium or other
      similar laws affecting the enforcement of creditors' rights generally and
      (ii) general principles of equity (regardless of whether such
      enforceability is considered in a proceeding in equity or at law).

            (c) Neither the execution and delivery of the Operative Documents,
      the consummation of the transactions contemplated thereby nor the
      fulfillment of or compliance with the provisions thereof will require
      consent, approval, authorization, filing, registration or

      applies to the Lessor or any of its property, except as contemplated by
      the Operative Documents.

            (d) The Lessor is not and will not be funding the Property Costs
      hereunder, and is not performing its obligations under the Operative
      Documents, with the assets of an "employee benefit plan" (as defined in
      Section 3(3) of ERISA) which is subject to Title I of ERISA, or "plan" (as
      defined in Section 4975(e)(1) of the Code).

            (e) The Lessor is participating in the Transactions for its own
      account and not with a view toward redistribution; provided that
      disposition of its rights hereunder shall remain in its control and the
      foregoing shall not affect the ability of the Lessor to assign, transfer
      or sell participations in its rights in accordance with the Operative
      Documents.

            (f) Lessor Liens. There are no Lessor Liens on any Property or any
      part thereof, and the execution, delivery and performance by the Lessor of
      the Operative Documents to which it is or will be a party will not subject

      branch or agency of a foreign bank or other similar financial institution.

            (c) Acquisition for Investment. Each Investor is participating in
      the Transactions for its own account and not with a view toward
      redistribution; provided that disposition of its rights hereunder shall
      remain in its control and the foregoing shall not affect the ability of
      any Investor to assign or sell participations in its rights in accordance
      with the Operative Documents.

            (d) Lessor Liens. There are no Lessor Liens attributable to such
      Investor on any Property or any part thereof, and the execution, delivery
      and performance by such Investor of the Operative Documents to which it is
      or will be a party will not subject any Property or any part thereof to
      any Lessor Liens attributable to such Investor.

      including fire and other risks insured against by extended coverage, as is
      customary with companies similarly situated and in the same or similar
      businesses (it being understood that the Lessee and its Subsidiaries may
      self-insure to the extent customary with companies similarly situated and

      taxes, assessments and governmental charges imposed upon it or upon its
      income or profits or in respect of its property, as well as all other
      material liabilities, in each case before the same shall become delinquent
      or in default and before penalties accrue thereon, unless and to the
      extent that the same are being contested in good faith by appropriate
      proceedings and adequate reserves with respect thereto shall, to the
      extent required by GAAP, have been set aside.

            (f) Litigation and Other Notices. Give to the Lessor and each
      Investor prompt written notice of the following:

                  (i) the filing or commencement of, or any written threat or
            written notice of intention of any person to file or commence, any
            action, suit or proceeding which could reasonably be expected to
            result in a Material Adverse Effect; and

                  (ii) any change in any of the Ratings.

            (g) Maintaining Records; Access to Properties and Inspections.
      Maintain financial records in accordance with GAAP and, upon reasonable

            (j) Visitation and Inspection of the Properties. At any reasonable
      time and from time to time, the Lessee shall permit the Lessor, any
      Investor and any agents or representatives thereof to visit and inspect
      the Properties upon reasonable notice to the Lessee (except that no such
      notice will be required to be given during the existence and continuance
      of a Lease Event of Default); provided, however, that (x) no such visit or
      inspection shall include any "cleared areas" that require United States
      government security clearances unless the applicable agent or
      representative conducting the inspection has received such required
      security clearances and (y) any visit or inspection by an individual that
      is not a U.S. citizen or permanent resident will require notification of
      the Lessee's security office and will be limited to plant-approved public
      tour areas (the restrictions described in this proviso, collectively, the
      "DOD Restrictions"). Any visit to a Property pursuant to this Section
      10.1(j) shall be at the sole risk and expense of the visiting party unless
      a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, in which case any
      such visit shall be at the sole expense of the Lessee.

            (k) Compliance with ISRA. If ISRA is applicable, the Lessee shall
      take all actions, at its sole cost and expense, to maintain Compliance
      with ISRA with respect to the Clifton Property. "Compliance with ISRA"
      shall mean performance by the Lessee of any requirements imposed under
      ISRA as a result of the Transactions. The ISRA process shall be deemed
      completed upon the receipt by the Lessee of an NFA Letter, as defined by
      N.J.S.A. 13:I K-9(e); with respect to the ISRA proceeding related to the
      Transactions, and full satisfaction of any and all conditions or
      requirements established by NJDEP in such NFA Letter.

            (l) Title Abstract for Clifton Property; Title Insurance for
      Properties.

                  (i) The Lessee will furnish to the Lessor, not later than
            ninety (90) days after the Closing Date, a new Title Abstract for
            the Clifton Property, which Title Abstract shall be dated down to a
            date after the Closing Date and shall identify no Liens (including
            any easements, covenants, leases, agreements or other items), claims
            or lawsuits affecting the Clifton Property other than Permitted
            Property Liens.

                  (ii) If the Lessee's senior unsecured debt rating falls below
            "BBB - " (in the case of S&P) or below "Baa3" (in the case of
            Moody's), or if either Moody's or S&P shall cease to provide a
            rating for the Lessee's senior unsecured debt, then, in any such
            case, the Lessee shall (x) notify the Lessor of such downgrade or
            such cessation immediately and in any event no later than five (5)
            Business Days after the occurrence thereof and (y) upon the request
            of the Lessor, obtain a Title Insurance Policy within fifteen (15)
            Business Days after such request with respect to each Property
            specified by the Lessor that is then subject to the Master Lease (as
            a Leased Property or as a Mortgaged Property) and had a Go Dark
            Value in excess of $7,000,000. Each Title Insurance Policy required
            under this Section 10.1(l)(ii) shall be in an amount not less than
            the then outstanding Termination Base Amount of each applicable
            Property.

      Section 10.2. Negative Covenants. The Lessee covenants and agrees with the
Lessor and each Investor that so long as this Participation Agreement shall
remain in effect or any portion of the Lease Balance or any other amounts
payable hereunder or under the other Operative Documents shall be unpaid, unless
the Lessor shall otherwise consent in writing, it will not, and will not cause
or permit any of the Lessee Subsidiaries to:

      (a) Consolidations, Mergers, and Sales of Assets. Consolidate or merge
with or into any other person or sell, lease or transfer all or substantially
all of its property and assets, or agree to do any of the foregoing, unless (i)

case of a consolidation or merger involving the Lessee and in which the Lessee
is not the surviving corporation or, in the case where the Lessee sells, leases
or transfers all or substantially all of its property and assets, the surviving
corporation or person purchasing, leasing or receiving such property and assets
is organized in the United States of America or a state thereof and agrees to be
bound by the terms and provisions applicable to the Lessee hereunder.

      (b) Limitations on Liens. Without limitation of the Lessee's agreements
set forth in Section 11.1 of the Master Lease, create, suffer to be created, or
assume (directly or indirectly) any mortgage, pledge or other lien upon any
Principal Property, or permit any Restricted Subsidiary to create, suffer to be
created, or assume (directly or indirectly) any mortgage, pledge or other lien
upon any Principal Property; provided, however, that this covenant shall not
apply to any of the following:

            (i) any mortgage, pledge or other lien on any Principal Property
      hereafter acquired, constructed or improved by the Lessee or any

      of such construction or improvement, or any mortgage, pledge or other lien
      on any Principal Property existing at the time of acquisition thereof;
      provided, however, that the mortgage, pledge or other lien shall not
      extend to any Principal Property theretofore owned by the Lessee or any
      Restricted Subsidiary;

      acquired by, the Lessee or a Restricted Subsidiary, at the time of such
      merger, consolidation or acquisition; provided that such mortgage, pledge
      or other lien does not extend to any other Principal Property, other than
      improvements to the property subject to such mortgage, pledge or other
      lien;

            (iv) any pledge or deposit to secure payment of workers'
      compensation or insurance premiums, or in connection with tenders, bids,

            (v) any pledge of, or other lien upon, any assets as security for
      the payment of any tax, assessment or other similar charge by any
      Governmental Authority or public body, or as security required by law or
      governmental regulation as a condition to the transaction of any business

      States of America or a department or agency thereof at an aggregate
      rental, payable during that portion of the initial term of such lease
      (without giving effect to any options of renewal or extension) which shall
      be unexpired at the date of the creation of such indebtedness, sufficient
      (taken together with any amounts required to be paid by the lessee to the
      lessor upon any termination of such lease) to pay in full at the stated
      maturity date or dates thereof the principal of and the interest on such
      indebtedness;

            (x) any mortgage, pledge or other lien securing indebtedness of a

      in the case of any sale or other disposition of such indebtedness by the

      lien not permitted by this clause (x);

            (xi) any mortgage, pledge or other lien affecting property of the
      Lessee or any Restricted Subsidiary securing indebtedness of the United

      entire unexpired terms of all leases entered into in connection with sale
      and lease-back transactions which would have been precluded by the
      provisions of Section 10.2(c) but for the satisfaction of the condition
      set forth in clause (ii) thereof, shall not exceed an amount equal to 5%
      of Consolidated Net Tangible Assets; or

lease-back of properties and whether or not in accordance with GAAP such
property is carried as an asset and such rental obligations are carried as
indebtedness on the Lessee's or a Restricted Subsidiary's balance sheet) shall

Lessee or any Restricted Subsidiary, enter into any arrangement with any person
providing for the leasing by the Lessee or any Restricted Subsidiary of any

      (d) Consolidated EBITDA to Consolidated Interest Expense. Permit the ratio
of (i) Consolidated EBITDA to (ii) Consolidated Interest Expense, each as
calculated for any period of the four prior consecutive fiscal quarters, to be
less than 3.75 to 1.0.

      Section 10.3. Covenants of the Lessor. Each of the Lessor and each
Investor hereby severally agrees that, until payment in full of the Lease
Balance or such other time as the Master Lease shall have terminated with
respect to all of the Properties:

its Lessor Interest to one or more transferees in accordance with Article X of
the Lessor LLC Agreement; provided that the name and address of the transferee

assigning Investor shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder to the extent
of the Lessor Interest being assigned or otherwise transferred.

      (b) The Lessor may, with the prior written consent of the Lessee (which

and obligations hereunder to any Person pursuant to an assignment agreement in

effective date of the applicable assignment agreement. The Lessor shall make
such filings and give such notices as shall be necessary to evidence such
assignment in all public offices where filings have been made under the
Operative Documents, and the Lessee shall cooperate with the Lessor in effecting
such filings and notices. Upon the effectiveness of any such assignment, the
assignee shall become the "Lessor" for all purposes of the Operative Documents
and the assignor shall be relieved of its obligations hereunder. The Lessee
shall not be responsible for any costs or expenses incurred in connection with
an assignment of all or any of the Lessor's rights and obligations pursuant to
this Section 12.1, and the Lessor (or its assignee) shall pay all such costs and
expenses, including (x) any and all Taxes and fees incurred in recording,
registering or filing any document or instrument, or giving any notices in
connection with any such assignment and (y) all reasonable costs and expenses
(including legal expenses) incurred by the Lessee in connection with such
assignment. In connection with any assignment pursuant to this Section 12.1(b),
the Lessee will, promptly upon the request of the Lessor, execute and deliver an
acknowledgment of such assignment and the succession of the transferee to all
rights and obligations of the transferor Lessor under the Operative Documents in
such form as the transferee may reasonably request.

      Section 12.2. Participations. Each Investor may sell, transfer, grant or
assign participations in all or any part of such Investor's interests and
obligations hereunder; provided that (i) such selling Investor shall remain an
"Investor", for all purposes under the Operative Documents (such selling
Investor's obligations under the Operative Documents remaining unchanged) and
the sub-participant shall not constitute an Investor, (ii) no such
sub-participant shall have, or be granted, rights to approve any amendment or
waiver relating to the Operative Documents except to the extent any such
amendment or waiver would (A) reduce the principal of or rate of interest on or
fees in respect of any investment in which the sub-participant is participating,
(B) postpone the date fixed for any payment of principal (including extension of
the Expiration Date or the date of any mandatory prepayment), interest or fees
in which the sub-participant is participating, or (C) release all or
substantially all of the collateral or guarantees (except as expressly provided
in the Operative Documents) supporting any of the investment in which the
sub-participant is participating, (iii) sub-sub-participations by the
sub-participant (except to an Affiliate, parent company or Affiliate of a parent
company of the sub-participant) shall be prohibited and (iv) written notice of
each such participation is given to the Lessee and the name and address of the
sub-participant shall be provided to the Lessee at the time of the participation
for recordation in its books and records. In the case of any such participation,
the sub-participant shall not have any rights under the Operative Documents (the
sub-participant's rights against the selling Investor in respect of such
participation to be those set forth in the participation agreement with such
Investor creating such participation) and all amounts payable by the Lessee
hereunder shall be determined as if such Investor had not sold such
participation; provided, however, that such sub-participant shall be entitled to
receive additional amounts under Sections 13.7, 13.8 and 13.9 on the same basis
as if it were an Investor (but only to the extent that the Investor would have
been entitled to receive such additional amounts with respect to the interest
participated had it not sold such participation). The Lessee shall not be
responsible for any costs or expenses incurred by any Investor in connection
with a sale, transfer, grant or assignment of participations pursuant to this
Section 12.2.

      Section 12.3. Withholding Taxes; Pledge Under Regulation A. (a)If the
assignee of any Investor pursuant to Section 12.1 or the subparticipant of any
Investor pursuant to Section 12.2 is (i) not a citizen or resident of the United
States of America, (ii) not a corporation, partnership or other entity created
or organized in or under the laws of the United States of America (or any
jurisdiction thereof), or (iii) not an estate or trust that is subject to
federal income taxation regardless of the source of its income (each, a
"Non-U.S. Transferee"), then such Non-U.S. Transferee shall deliver upon the
request of the Lessee (or cause to be delivered) to each of the Lessor and the
Lessee one of the following properly completed and signed U.S. tax forms: (i) an
IRS form W-8ECI (or successor applicable form) or (ii) an IRS form W-8BEN (or
successor applicable form) certifying its foreign status and, if applicable,
claiming

an exemption under a U.S. tax treaty for all income payable to such Non-U.S.
Transferee under the Operative Documents. If a Non-U.S. Transferee fails, upon
request by the Lessee, to deliver one of the above valid forms, the Lessee may
(notwithstanding Section 13.6) withhold the applicable amount of U.S. income tax
on payments it makes to (or to the Lessor on behalf of) the Non-U.S. Transferee,
and the Non-U.S. Transferee shall not be entitled to indemnification under
Section 13.4 for the U.S. withholding taxes so imposed. If the assignee of any
Investor pursuant to Section 12.1 or the subparticipant of any Investor pursuant
to Section 12.2 is not a Non-U.S. Transferee (each, a "U.S. Transferee"), then
such U.S. Transferee shall deliver (or cause to be delivered) to each of the
Lessor and the Lessee a properly completed and signed U.S. tax form W-9.

      (a) The Lessor and each Investor may, in connection with any assignment or
participation or proposed assignment or participation pursuant to this Article
XII, disclose to such assignee or participant or proposed assignee or
participant, any information relating to the Lessee or the transactions under
the Operative Documents, subject to appropriate confidentiality requirements
relating to such information.

      (b) Anything in this Article XII to the contrary notwithstanding, any
Investor may without the consent of Lessee or the Lessor, assign and pledge all
or any portion of its investment in the transactions contemplated hereby to any
Federal Reserve Bank, the United States Treasury or to any other financial
institution as collateral security pursuant to Regulation A of the F.R.S. Board
and any operating circular issued by the Federal Reserve System and/or the
Federal Reserve Bank or otherwise; provided, any payment by the Lessee for the
benefit of the assigning or pledging Investor shall be deemed to satisfy the
Lessee's obligations with respect thereto.

of action or omission by such Indemnitee or otherwise, except as set forth in
Section 13.1(b) below), whether or not such Indemnitee shall also be indemnified
as to any such Claim by any other Person and whether or not such Claim arises or
accrues prior to the Documentation Date or after the Expiration Date, in any way
relating to or arising out of the transactions contemplated by this
Participation Agreement and the other Operative Documents, including:

            (i) any of the Operative Documents and any amendment, modification
      or waiver in respect thereof;

      Section 16.2(e) or 16.2(g) of the Master Lease or any sale, purchase or
      termination pursuant to Article XV, XVIII or XIX of the Master Lease),
      return or other disposition of all or any part or any interest in the
      Properties or the imposition of any Lien thereon, including: (1) Claims or
      penalties arising from any violation of law or in tort (on the basis of
      strict liability or otherwise), (2) latent or other defects, whether or
      not discoverable, (3)

      any Claim based upon a violation or alleged violation of the terms of any
      restriction, easement, condition or covenant or other matter affecting
      title to any Property, (4) the making of any Modifications in violation of
      any standards imposed by any insurance policies required to be maintained

      fees;

            (iv) the breach or, to the extent a Claim actually arises as a
      result thereof, the alleged breach, by the Lessee of any covenant,
      representation or warranty made by it in any Operative Document or any
      certificate required to be delivered by it by any Operative Document;

            (v) the retaining or employment of any broker, finder or financial
      advisor (other than the Arranger) by the Lessee to act on its behalf in
      connection with this Participation Agreement or any other Operative
      Document;

            (vi) the existence of any Lien on or with respect to any Property,
      any Improvements, any Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent, title thereto, or
      any interest therein including any Liens which arise out of the
      possession, use, occupancy, construction, repair or rebuilding of any
      Property or by reason of labor or materials furnished or claimed to have
      been furnished to the Lessee, or any of its contractors or agents or by
      reason of the financing of any personalty or equipment purchased or leased
      by the Lessee or Modifications constructed by the Lessee;

            (vii) any ground lease, sublease or any other lease or arrangement
      (including any structure involving a local tax abatement structure or
      acquisition of equity interests in entities which directly or indirectly
      own a Property) pursuant to which the Lessor acquires its interest in any
      Property; and

            (viii) any failure by the Lessee to pay all amounts of Rent as and
      when the same become due, including any Claims incurred by the Lessor in
      connection with any draw made by it on an overdraft facility for the
      purpose of paying amounts owing to any other Person.

      (b) Notwithstanding the terms of clause (a) of this Section 13.1, the
Lessee shall not be required to indemnify any Indemnitee under this Section 13.1
for any Claim to the extent arising or resulting from (1) the willful misconduct
or gross negligence of such Indemnitee (it being understood that the Lessee
shall be required to indemnify an Indemnitee even if the ordinary (but not
gross) negligence of such Indemnitee caused or contributed to such Claim), (2) a
breach by such Indemnitee of any agreement entered into in connection with the
assignment or participation of any interest of such Indemnitee under the
Operative Documents, (3) acts or events occurring in respect of any Property in
the period after the Lessee shall have returned such Property to the Lessor in
full compliance with all requirements of the Master Lease to the extent not
resulting from any act or event otherwise covered by this indemnity that
occurred during the period that the Lessee leased such Property, (4) the failure
of such Indemnitee to comply with laws applicable to banks or their affiliates
generally or the failure of such Indemnitee to file any notice, report, filing
or other document required by any Governmental Authority regulating banks or
their affiliates in connection with such Indemnitee's execution of, and
participation in the transactions contemplated by, the Operative Documents, (5)
Taxes or Impositions (it being understood and agreed by the parties hereto that
all Claims relating to Taxes or Impositions shall be governed solely by the

to distribute in accordance with this Participation Agreement and the Lessor LLC
Agreement (as applicable) any amounts received

and distributable by it thereunder so long as such amounts were received in
accordance with the Operative Documents. It is expressly understood and agreed
that the indemnity provided for herein shall survive the expiration or
termination of and shall be separate and independent from any remedy under the
Lease or any other Operative Document.

      Section 13.2. Environmental Indemnity. Without limitation of the other
provisions of this Article XIII, the Lessee hereby agrees (at all times, whether
or not the Lease Term shall have commenced) to indemnify, hold harmless and
defend each Indemnitee from and against any and all Claims (including
Governmental Authority Claims and third party Claims for personal injury or real
or personal property damage), losses (including, to the extent the Termination
Base Amount therefor has not been fully paid, any loss of value of the Property
related thereto), damages (including any consequential damages), liabilities,
fines, penalties, charges, administrative and judicial proceedings (including
informal proceedings) and orders, judgments, Remedial Action, requirements,
enforcement actions of any kind, and all reasonable and documented costs and
expenses incurred in connection therewith (including reasonable and documented
attorneys' and/or paralegals' fees and expenses), including all costs incurred
in connection with any investigation or monitoring of site conditions or any
clean-up, remedial, removal or restoration work by any federal, state or local
Governmental Authority, in any way relating to or arising in whole or in part,
out of (or alleged to in any way relate to or arise in whole or in part out of):

            (a) the presence on or under any Property of any Hazardous
      Materials, or any Releases of any Hazardous Materials on, under, from or
      onto any Property;

            (b) any activity, including construction, carried on or undertaken
      on or off any Property, and whether by the Lessee or any predecessor in
      title or any employees, agents, contractors or subcontractors of the
      Lessee or any predecessor in title, or any other Persons (including such
      Indemnitee), in connection with the handling, treatment, removal, storage,
      decontamination, clean-up, transport or disposal of any Hazardous
      Materials that at any time are located or present on or under or that at
      any time migrate, flow, percolate, diffuse or in any way move onto or
      under any Property;

            (c) loss of or damage to any property or the environment (including
      clean-up costs, response costs, remediation and removal costs, costs of
      corrective action, costs of financial assurance, fines and penalties and
      natural resource damages), or death or injury to any Person, and all
      expenses associated with the protection of wildlife, aquatic species,
      vegetation, flora and fauna, and any mitigative action required by or
      under Environmental Laws arising from any Property or related thereto;

            (d) any Claim concerning lack of compliance with Environmental Laws
      at any Property, or any act or omission causing an Environmental Violation
      that requires remediation or would allow any Governmental Authority to
      record a Lien on the land records of any Property; or

            (e) any residual contamination on or under any Land, or affecting
      any natural resources, and to any contamination of any property or natural
      resources arising in connection with the generation, use, handling,
      storage, transport or disposal of any such Hazardous Materials on or
      relating to any Land, and irrespective of whether any of such activities
      were or will be undertaken in accordance with applicable laws,
      regulations, codes and ordinances,

provided, however, that the Lessee shall not be required to indemnify any
Indemnitee under this Section 13.2 for (i) any Claim to the extent resulting
from the willful misconduct or gross negligence of such Indemnitee (it being
understood that the Lessee shall be required to indemnify an Indemnitee even if
the ordinary (but not gross) negligence of such Indemnitee caused or contributed
to such Claim) or

                                                         Participation Agreement

(ii) any Claim to the extent attributable solely to acts, circumstances or
events occurring in the period after the Lessee shall have returned all of the
Leased Properties to the Lessor in full compliance with the provisions of the
Operative Documents to the extent not resulting from any act or event otherwise
covered by this indemnity that occurred during the period that the Lessee leased
the Leased Properties. It is expressly understood and agreed that the indemnity
provided for herein shall survive the expiration or termination of and shall be
separate and independent from any remedy under the Lease or any other Operative
Document.

      Section 13.3. Proceedings in Respect of Claims. In case any action, suit
or proceeding shall be brought against any Indemnitee in respect of Claims
indemnifiable under Sections 13.1 or 13.2, such Indemnitee shall promptly notify
the Lessee of the commencement thereof, and the Lessee shall be entitled, at the
Lessee's expense, to participate in, and, to the extent that the Lessee desires
to, assume and control the defense thereof; provided, however, that if the
Lessee shall have exercised its rights to control the defense of such Claim to
the exclusion of the applicable Indemnitee, the Lessee shall have acknowledged
in writing its obligation to fully indemnify such Indemnitee in respect of such
action, suit or proceeding, and the Lessee shall keep such Indemnitee fully
apprised of the status of such action, suit or proceeding and shall provide such
Indemnitee with all information with respect to such action, suit or proceeding
as such Indemnitee shall reasonably request, and provided, further, that the
Lessee shall not be entitled to assume and control the defense of any such
action, suit or proceeding if and to the extent that, (A) in the reasonable
opinion of such Indemnitee's counsel, (x) such action, suit or proceeding
involves any risk of imposition of criminal liability or will involve a material
risk of the sale, forfeiture or loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than
a Permitted Property Lien) on the Properties or any part thereof or any
interference with the payment of Rent unless, in the case of civil liability
only, the Lessee shall have posted a bond or other security reasonably
satisfactory to the relevant Indemnitees in respect of such risk or (y) the
control of such action, suit or proceeding would involve an actual or potential
conflict of interest, (B) such proceeding involves Claims not fully indemnified
by the Lessee that the Lessee and the Indemnitee have been unable to sever from
the indemnified claim(s), or (C) a Lease Event of Default has occurred and is
continuing. The Indemnitee will join in the Lessee's efforts to sever such
action. In the event that an Indemnitee has assumed control of any such
proceeding, it shall keep the Lessee fully apprised of the status of such
action, suit or proceeding and shall provide the Lessee with all information
with respect to such action, suit or proceeding as the Lessee may reasonably
request. The Indemnitee may participate at its own expense and with its own
counsel in any proceeding conducted by the Lessee in accordance with the
foregoing. The Lessee shall not enter into any settlement or other compromise
with respect to any Claim which is entitled to be indemnified under Section 13.1
or 13.2 without prior written consent of the Indemnitee, which consent shall not
be unreasonably withheld in the case of a money settlement not involving an
admission of liability of such Indemnitee.

      Each Indemnitee shall at the expense of the Lessee supply the Lessee with
such information and documents reasonably requested by the Lessee as are
necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or
proceeding to the extent permitted by Section 13.1 or 13.2. Unless a Lease Event
of Default shall have occurred and be continuing, no Indemnitee shall enter into
any settlement or other compromise with respect to any Claim that is entitled to
be indemnified under Section 13.1 or 13.2 without the prior written consent of
the Lessee, unless such Indemnitee waives its rights to be indemnified under
Section 13.1 or 13.2, as the case may be, with respect to such Claim.

      Upon payment in full of any Claim by the Lessee pursuant to Section 13.1
or 13.2 to or on behalf of an Indemnitee, the Lessee, without any further
action, shall be subrogated to any and all claims that such Indemnitee may have
relating thereto (other than claims in respect of insurance policies maintained
by such Indemnitee at its own expense), and such Indemnitee shall execute such
instruments of assignment and conveyance, evidence of claims and payment and
such other documents, instruments and agreements as may be necessary to preserve
any such claims and otherwise cooperate with the Lessee and

give such further assurances as are necessary or advisable to enable the Lessee
vigorously to pursue such claims.

      Any amount payable to an Indemnitee pursuant to Section 13.1 or 13.2 shall
be paid to such Indemnitee promptly upon receipt of a written demand therefor
from such Indemnitee, accompanied by a written statement describing in
reasonable detail the basis for such indemnity and the computation of the amount
so payable.

      Section 13.4. General Tax Indemnity.

      (a) Indemnification. Without limitation of the rights of any Tax
Indemnitee under any other indemnification provision of this Article XIII, the
Lessee shall pay and assume liability for, and does hereby agree to indemnify,
protect and defend each Property and all Tax Indemnitees, and hold them harmless
against, all Impositions on an After Tax Basis. The determination of all
Impositions to be paid or indemnified against by the Lessee on an After Tax
Basis shall be made (in good faith) by the Tax Indemnitee. Such determination
shall state with reasonable clarity and detail the basis for such determination
and shall, absent manifest error, be final and conclusive and binding on the
Lessee.

      (b) Contests. If any claim shall be made against any Tax Indemnitee or if
any proceeding shall be commenced against any Tax Indemnitee (including a
written notice of such proceeding) for any Imposition as to which the Lessee may
have an indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.4, or if any Tax
Indemnitee shall determine that any Imposition to which the Lessee may have an
indemnity obligation pursuant to this Section 13.4 may be payable, such Tax
Indemnitee shall promptly (and in any event, within thirty (30) days) notify the
Lessee in writing (provided that failure to so notify the Lessee within thirty
(30) days shall not alter such Tax Indemnitee's rights under this Section 13.4
except to the extent such failure precludes the ability to conduct a contest of
the applicable Impositions) and, so long as no Lease Default or Lease Event of
Default has occurred and is continuing, shall not take any action with respect
to such claim, proceeding or Imposition without the written consent of the
Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed)
for thirty (30) days after the receipt of such notice by the Lessee; provided,
however, that in the case of any such claim or proceeding, if such Tax
Indemnitee shall be required by Applicable Law to take action prior to the end
of such thirty (30) day period, such Tax Indemnitee shall, in such notice to the
Lessee, so inform the Lessee and such Tax Indemnitee shall not take any action
with respect to such claim, proceeding or Imposition without the consent of the
Lessee (such consent not to be unreasonably withheld or unreasonably delayed)
for 10 days after the receipt of such notice by the Lessee unless such Tax
Indemnitee shall be required by Applicable Law to take action prior to the end
of such ten (10) day period, provided, further, however, that the failure of the
Tax Indemnitee to give notice referred to in this sentence shall not diminish
Lessee's obligations hereunder except to the extent that such failure precludes
Lessee from contesting such claim.

      The Lessee shall be entitled for a period of thirty (30) days from receipt
of such notice from such Tax Indemnitee (or such shorter period as such Tax
Indemnitee has notified the Lessee is required by Applicable Law for such Tax
Indemnitee to commence such contest), to request in writing that such Tax
Indemnitee contest the Imposition, at the Lessee's sole expense. If (x) such
contest can be pursued in the name of the Lessee and independently from any
other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee for which the
Lessee has not agreed to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee, (y) such contest must be
pursued in the name of such Tax Indemnitee, but can be pursued independently
from any other proceeding involving a Tax liability of such Tax Indemnitee for
which the Lessee has not agreed to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee or (z) such Tax
Indemnitee so requests, then the Lessee shall be permitted to control the
contest of such claim, provided that in the case of any such contest, if such
Tax Indemnitee reasonably determines that such contest by the Lessee could have
an adverse impact on the business or operations of such Tax Indemnitee and
provides a written explanation to the Lessee of such

                                     - 32 -
<PAGE>

                                                         Participation Agreement

determination, such Tax Indemnitee may elect to control or reassert control of
the contest. In all other claims relating to Impositions requested to be
contested by the Lessee, such Tax Indemnitee shall control the contest of such
claim, acting through counsel reasonably acceptable to the Lessee.
Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, in no event shall the
Lessee be permitted to pursue or continue any contest (or such Tax Indemnitee be
required to pursue or continue any contest) of any Imposition or claim thereof
through any action, suit or proceeding (A) if such Tax Indemnitee provides the
Lessee with a legal opinion of independent counsel reasonably acceptable to the
Lessee that such action, suit or proceeding involves a risk of imposition of
criminal liability or could involve a material risk of the sale, forfeiture or
loss of, or the creation of any Lien (other than a Permitted Property Lien) on
any Property or any part thereof or any interference with the payment of Rent
unless, with respect to civil liability only, the Lessee shall have posted a
bond or other security reasonably satisfactory to the relevant Tax Indemnitee in
respect of such risk, (B) if any Lease Default or Lease Event of Default has
occurred and is continuing, (C) unless the Lessee shall have agreed to pay and
shall pay to such Tax Indemnitee on demand and on an After-Tax Basis all
reasonable out-of-pocket costs, losses and expenses that such Tax Indemnitee may
incur in connection with contesting such Imposition or claim thereof, including
all reasonable legal, accounting and investigatory fees and disbursements as
well as the Impositions which are the subject of such contest to the extent the
contest is unsuccessful, or (D) if such contest shall involve the payment of a
Tax prior to the contest, unless the Lessee shall provide to such Tax Indemnitee
an interest-free advance in an amount equal to, on an After Tax Basis, the
Imposition that the Tax Indemnitee is so required to pay or (E) unless prior to
commencing any contest the Lessee shall have acknowledged its liability for the
Imposition (if and to the extent that the Tax Indemnitee or Lessee, as the case
may be, shall not prevail in the contest in respect of the Imposition). In
addition, for Tax Indemnitee controlled contests and claims contested in the
name of a Tax Indemnitee, no contest of any Imposition shall be required unless:
(A) the amount of the potential indemnity (taking into account all similar or
logically related claims that have been or are likely to be raised in any audit
involving any or all of such Tax Indemnitees for which the Lessee may be liable
to pay an indemnity under this Section 13.4(b)) exceeds $100,000 and (B) if
requested by such Tax Indemnitee, the Lessee shall have provided to such Tax
Indemnitee at the Lessee's sole expense, an opinion of independent counsel
selected by the Lessee and reasonably acceptable to the Tax Indemnitee that a
reasonable basis exists to contest such Imposition (or, in the case of an appeal
from an adverse judicial determination, that there is substantial authority for
a reversal or favorable modification of such decision of such appeal). In no
event shall a Tax Indemnitee be required to appeal an adverse judicial
determination to the United States Supreme Court. In addition, a Tax Indemnitee
shall not be required to contest any claim in its name (or that of an Affiliate)
if the subject matter thereof shall be of a continuing nature and shall have
previously been decided adversely by a court of competent jurisdiction pursuant
to the contest provisions of this Section 13.4(b), unless there shall have been
a change in law and the Tax Indemnitee shall have received, at the Lessee's
expense, an opinion of independent tax counsel selected by the Lessee and
reasonably acceptable to the Tax Indemnitee stating that, as a result of such
change in law, it is more likely than not that the Tax Indemnitee will prevail
in such contest.

      The party conducting the contest of an Imposition shall consult in good
faith with the other party and its counsel with respect to such contest (or
claim for refund) but the decisions regarding what actions are to be taken with
respect to such contest shall be made by the controlling party in its sole
judgment. In addition, the party controlling the contest shall keep the
non-controlling party reasonably informed as to the progress of the contest, and
shall provide the noncontrolling party with a copy of (or appropriate excerpts
from) any reports or claims issued by the relevant Governmental Authority to the
controlling party thereof, relating to such contest.

      Each Tax Indemnitee shall, at the Lessee's sole expense, supply the Lessee
with such information and documents reasonably requested by the Lessee as are
necessary or advisable for the Lessee to participate in any action, suit or
proceeding to the extent permitted by this Section 13.4(b), provided,

                                                         Participation Agreement

however, that such Tax Indemnitee shall not be required to provide to the Lessee
copies of (i) any information, documentation or materials that it reasonably
deems to be confidential or proprietary or (ii) its tax returns or any other
information, documentation or materials in respect of such Tax Indemnitee's
financial position. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 13.4(b) to the
contrary, so long as no Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, no Tax Indemnitee shall enter into any settlement or other
compromise or fail to appeal an adverse determination with respect to any claim
for which it is entitled to be indemnified under this Section 13.4 (and with
respect to which contest is required under this Section 13.4(b)) without the
prior written consent of the Lessee (which shall not be unreasonably withheld or
delayed), unless such Tax Indemnitee waives its right to be indemnified under
this Section 13.4 with respect to such claim pursuant to the next paragraph.

      Notwithstanding anything contained herein to the contrary, a Tax
Indemnitee will not be required to contest or continue to contest (and the
Lessee shall not be permitted to contest or continue to contest) a claim with
respect to any Imposition and shall be permitted to settle or commence any such
claim without the consent of Lessee if such Tax Indemnitee shall waive its right
to indemnification under this Section 13.4 with respect to such claim (and any
claim with respect to such year or any other taxable year the contest of which
is materially adversely affected as a result of such waiver).

      (c) Payments. Any Imposition indemnifiable under this Section 13.4 shall
be paid when due directly to the applicable taxing authority if such direct
payment is practicable and permitted. If direct payment to the applicable taxing
authority is not permitted or is otherwise not made, any amount payable to a Tax
Indemnitee pursuant to this Section 13.4 shall be paid to the relevant Tax
Indemnitee within twenty (20) days after receipt of a written demand therefor
from such Tax Indemnitee, which demand shall be accompanied by a written
statement describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable, but in no event
shall the Lessee be required to pay such reimbursement prior to fifteen (15)
days before the date that the relevant Taxes are due. Any payments made pursuant
to this Section 13.4 shall be made directly to such Tax Indemnitee entitled
thereto or the Lessee, as the case may be, in immediately available funds at
such bank or to such account as specified by the payee in written directions to
the payor, or, if no such direction shall have been given, by check of the payor
payable to the order of the payee by certified mail, postage prepaid at its
address as set forth in Schedule II hereto. Upon the request of any Tax
Indemnitee with respect to Imposition that the Lessee is required to pay, the
Lessee shall furnish to such Tax Indemnitee the original or a certified copy of
a receipt for the Lessee's payment of such Tax or such other evidence of payment
as is reasonably acceptable to such Tax Indemnitee.

      (d) Reports. In the case of any report, return or statement required to be
filed by the Lessor with respect to any Impositions that are subject to
indemnification under this Section 13.4, the Lessee shall promptly notify the
Lessor of such requirement and, at the Lessee's sole expense (i) if the Lessee
is permitted by Applicable Law, timely file such report, return or statement in
its own name and send a copy of such report, return or statement to the Lessor,
or (ii) if such report, return or statement is required to be in the name of or
filed by the Lessor, or the Lessor otherwise requests that such report, return
or statement be filed in the name of or by the Lessor, the Lessee shall prepare
and finish such report, return or statement in such manner as shall be
satisfactory to the Lessor and shall send the same to the Lessor for filing no
later than fifteen (15) days prior to the due date therefor. In any case in
which any Tax Indemnitee will file any such report, return or statement with
respect to any Impositions that are subject to indemnification under this
Section 13.4, the Lessee shall, upon written request of such Tax Indemnitee,
provide such Tax Indemnitee with such information as is reasonably necessary to
allow such Tax Indemnitee to file such report, return or statement.

      Section 13.5. Title Representation and Indemnity.

      (a) The Lessee represents and warrants to the Lessor, each Investor and
the Arranger that: (i) the Seller of each Leased Property is the sole fee owner
thereof and the Lessee is the sole fee owner of each Mortgaged Property, (ii)
none of the Properties are encumbered or affected by any Liens, including any
mortgages or encumbrances, or any easements, covenants, leases, agreements,
restrictions, purchase options, rights of first offer (other than the right of
first offer with respect to the Clifton Property that is described on Schedule
10.2(b) hereto), reversionary rights or other interests, other than Permitted
Property Liens, (iii) all appurtenances to each Property, including any and all
easements, access and other rights appropriate for use and occupancy of such
Property for commercial and other purposes are also owned by the Seller thereof
free and clear of any third-party rights or claims, (iv) there are no mechanics,
tax, judgment or other Liens affecting any of the Properties and all real estate
and other Taxes with regard to each Property are current and fully paid and (v)
there has not been any work performed or materials supplied to any Property
prior to the date hereof which has not been fully paid for and which could give
rise to the filing of any mechanic's liens against any Property. With regard to
third-party leases, the Lessee also represents and warrants to the Lessor that
any leases still appearing in the public records relative to any of the
Properties have expired or been terminated and that the tenants named therein
have no further rights with respect to the applicable Property or Properties.

      (b) In furtherance of the representations and warranties set forth in
clause (a) above and in lieu of title insurance, the Lessee hereby indemnifies
and holds the Lessor, the Investors and the Arranger harmless from any and all
losses, costs and expenses and any diminution in the value of the Lessor's
interest in the Properties that might result from (x) any of the foregoing
representations and warranties being incorrect or inaccurate, either now or in
the future, or (y) any of the following: (i) the invalidity or unenforceability
of the lien of any Lessor Mortgage, (ii) any lack of priority of the Lien of any
Lessor Mortgage over any other Lien encumbering any Property, (iii) any
violation, variation, encroachment or adverse circumstance that would have been
disclosed by an accurate Survey, including any discrepancy which would have been
disclosed with respect to the legal description of any Leased Property attached
to Exhibit A of the Lease Supplement therefor, or (iv) the existence of any Lien
on any Property, including any Permitted Property Lien (other than a Permitted
Property Lien of the type described in clause (i), clause (vii) or clause (viii)
of the definition thereof), it being understood that the Lessee's liability with
respect to the indemnification set forth in this Section 13.5(b) is absolute,
joint and several and shall include both intentional and unintentional
misrepresentations and breaches. In addition to the foregoing, the Lessee agrees
that the representations embodied in Section 13.5(a) are continuing in nature,
and the Lessee covenants and agrees that it shall not cause, permit or allow any
act to occur or any document to be executed which is or may be at variance with
the representations and warranties set forth in Section 13.5(a). In addition,
the Lessee agrees that the indemnification embodied in this Section 13.5(b)
shall also apply to any breach of the foregoing covenant.

      Section 13.6. Withholding Taxes, etc.

      (a) Payments Free of Taxes.

            (i) All payments made by the Lessee under this Participation
      Agreement, the Master Lease and the other Operative Documents shall be
      made free and clear of, and without deduction or withholding for or on
      account of, any present or future income (but excluding those Taxes
      described in clauses (i) and (ii) of the definition of Impositions),
      excise, stamp, transfer or franchise taxes and other taxes, fees, duties,
      withholdings or other charges of any nature whatsoever (including interest
      and penalties) now or hereafter imposed (the "Withholding Taxes") by any
      Governmental Authority or taxing authority domestic or foreign (the
      "Taxing Authority"), whether or not such Withholding Taxes were correctly
      or legally asserted. If any

                                                         Participation Agreement

      Withholding Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any amounts
      payable to, or for the benefit of, any Tax Indemnitee or any Affiliate
      thereof under this Participation Agreement or the other Operative
      Documents, the amounts so payable to such Tax Indemnitee shall be
      increased to the extent necessary to yield on an After Tax Basis such
      amounts payable under this Participation Agreement and the other Operative
      Documents at the rates or in the amounts specified in this Participation
      Agreement and the other Operative Documents. Whenever any Withholding
      Taxes are payable by the Lessee with respect to any payment to or for the
      account of a particular Tax Indemnitee, as promptly as possible
      thereafter, the Lessee shall send to such Tax Indemnitee a certified copy
      of an original official receipt received by the Lessee showing payment
      thereof. If the Lessee fails to pay any Withholding Taxes when due to the
      appropriate taxing authority or fails to remit to the Tax Indemnitee
      required receipts or other required documentary evidence, the Lessee shall
      indemnify the Tax Indemnitee for any obligations that may become payable
      by the Tax Indemnitee as a result of any such failure.

            (ii) All payments made by the Lessor under this Participation
      Agreement and the other Operative Documents to any other Tax Indemnitee
      shall be made net of any deduction or withholding for Withholding Taxes.
      If any Withholding Taxes are required to be withheld or deducted from any
      amounts payable by the Lessor to, or for the benefit of, any other Tax
      Indemnitee under this Participation Agreement or any other Operative
      Document, then the Lessee shall indemnify and pay such Tax Indemnitee on
      an After Tax Basis an amount necessary to yield such Tax Indemnitee (after
      payment of all Withholding Taxes) such amounts payable under this
      Participation Agreement and the other Operative Documents at the rates or
      in the amounts specified in this Participation Agreement and the other
      Operative Documents.

            (iii) Moreover, if any Taxes (the "Indirect Withholding Taxes") in
      the nature of Withholding Taxes are directly asserted by any Taxing
      Authority against any of the Lessor or any Investor with respect to any
      payment received by such Person, such Person may pay such Taxes and the
      Lessee will pay directly to such Person (which payment shall constitute
      Supplemental Rent hereunder), within fifteen (15) Business Days after
      receipt of a written demand therefor accompanied by a written statement
      describing in reasonable detail the amount so payable from the Lessor or
      such Investor (as applicable) such additional amounts (including any
      interest, reasonable costs or expenses and any penalties incurred in
      connection therewith) as are necessary in order that on a fully After Tax
      Basis the net amount received by such Person after the payment of such
      Indirect Withholding Taxes (including any Taxes on such additional amount)
      shall equal the amount such Person would have received had such Indirect
      Withholding Taxes not been asserted plus interest on such additional
      amounts at a rate per annum of Overnight LIBOR plus 77 basis points (or,
      in the case of any such additional amounts outstanding after the
      expiration of such fifteen (15) Business Day period, a rate per annum
      equal to the Overdue Rate), calculated (on the basis of actual days
      elapsed in a year of 360 days) from the date of payment of such Indirect
      Withholding Taxes by the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable) to the
      date of payment of such additional amounts by the Lessee. If the Lessee
      fails to pay any such Indirect Withholding Taxes as and when due to the
      appropriate Taxing Authority or fails to remit to the Lessor for the
      benefit of the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable), the required
      receipts or other required documentary evidence, then the Lessee shall
      indemnify the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable), on an After Tax
      Basis, for any incremental Taxes (whether or not constituting Withholding
      Taxes), interest, penalties and reasonable expenses that may become
      payable by the Lessor or such Investor (as applicable) as a result of any
      such failure.

            (iv) Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this Section
      13.6(a), if the applicable Tax Indemnitee is a direct or indirect
      transferee or assignee of an original Tax Indemnitee, then Lessee shall be
      obligated to indemnify such Tax Indemnitee for Withholding

      Taxes and Indirect Withholding Taxes only to the extent that based on the
      Applicable Law in effect on the date such Withholding Tax or Indirect
      Withholding Tax is imposed or becomes payable, the amount of such Tax does
      not exceed the amount of such Tax that would have been imposed against or
      payable by such original Tax Indemnitee.

            (v) The obligations of the Lessee under this Section 13.6(a) shall
      survive the termination of this Participation Agreement and the other
      Operative Documents and the payment of the Lease Balance and all other
      amounts payable under the Operative Documents.

      (b) Withholding Exemption Certificates. On or prior to the Acquisition
Date, or if such date does not occur within thirty (30) days after the date of
this Participation Agreement, by the end of such 30-day period, each Investor
that is not organized under the laws of the United States of America or a state
or political subdivision thereof shall deliver to the Lessor and the Lessee two
duly completed copies of (i) an IRS form W-8ECI (or successor applicable form)
or (ii) an IRS form W-8BEN(or successor applicable form) certifying its foreign
status and, if applicable, claiming an exemption under a U.S. tax treaty. Each
such Investor further agrees (i) promptly to notify the Lessee and the Lessor of
any change of circumstances that would prevent such Investor from receiving
payments hereunder without any deduction or withholding or with reduced
deduction or withholding of such taxes as indicated on the most recent such
certificate or other form previously delivered by such Investor and (ii) if such
Investor has not so notified the Lessee and the Lessor of any change of
circumstances which would prevent such Investor from receiving payments
hereunder without any deduction or withholding or with reduced deduction or
withholding of taxes as indicated on the most recent such certificate or other
form previously delivered by such Investor, then on or before the date that any
certificate or other form delivered by such Investor under this Section 13.6(b)
expires or becomes obsolete or after the occurrence of any event requiring a
change in the most recent such certificate or form previously delivered by such
Investor, to deliver to the Lessee and the Lessor a new certificate or form,
certifying that such Investor is entitled to receive payments under the
Operative Documents without deduction or withholding or with reduced deduction
or withholding of such taxes. If any Investor fails to provide to the Lessee or
the Lessor pursuant to this Section 13.6(b) (or, in the case of any Person that
becomes an Investor through an assignment by another Investor, pursuant to
Section 12.1) any certificates or other evidence required by such provision to
establish that such Investor is, at the time it becomes an Investor hereunder,
entitled to receive payments under the Operative Documents without deduction or
withholding or with reduced deduction or withholding of any United States
federal income taxes, such Investor shall not be entitled to any indemnification
under Section 13.6(a) for any withholding taxes to the extent imposed on such
Investor primarily as a result of such failure.

      (c) Tax Returns. Nothing contained in this Section 13.6 shall require the
Lessor or any Investor (or any other Person) to make available any of its Tax
returns (or any other information relating to its Taxes, which it deems to be
confidential).

      Section 13.7. Increased Costs, etc. If the adoption of or any change in
any Applicable Law or in the interpretation or application thereof applicable to
any Affected Party, or compliance by any Affected Party with any request or
directive (whether or not having the force of law) from any central bank or
other Governmental Authority, in each case made subsequent to the Documentation
Date (or, if later, the date on which such Affected Party becomes an Affected
Party):

            (i) shall impose, modify or hold applicable any reserve, special
      deposit, compulsory loan or similar requirement against assets held by, or
      deposits or other liabilities in or for the account of loans or other
      extensions of credit by, or any other acquisition of funds by, any office
      of such Affected Party; or

            (ii) shall impose on such Affected Party any other condition
      (excluding any Tax of any kind) whatsoever in connection with the
      Operative Documents;

and the result of any of the foregoing is to increase the cost to such Affected
Party of making, continuing or maintaining its investment in the Transactions,
or to reduce any amount receivable hereunder in respect thereof, then, in any
such case, upon notice to the Lessee from such Affected Party, through the
Lessor in accordance herewith, the Lessee shall pay such Affected Party any
additional amounts necessary to compensate such Affected Party for such
increased cost or reduced amount receivable; provided, however, that the Lessee
shall not be obligated to pay any Affected Party that is a direct or indirect
transferee or assignee of an original Affected Party any such additional amounts
in excess of the amounts, if any, that would have been payable to the original
Affected Party after giving effect to such adoption, change or compliance. All
payments required by this Section 13.7 shall be made by the Lessee within five
(5) Business Days after demand by the applicable Affected Party. If any Affected
Party becomes entitled to claim any additional amounts pursuant to this
subsection, it shall provide prompt notice thereof to the Lessee, through the
Lessor, certifying (x) that one of the events described in this Section 13.7 has
occurred and describing in reasonable detail the nature of such event, (y) as to
the increased cost or reduced amount resulting from such event and (z) as to the
additional amount demanded by such Affected Party and a reasonably detailed
explanation of the calculation thereof (including the method by which such
Affected Party allocated such amounts to the Lessee). Such a certificate as to
any additional amounts payable pursuant to this clause submitted by such
Affected Party, through the Lessor, to the Lessee shall be conclusive and
binding for all purposes, absent manifest error.

      Section 13.8. Funding Losses; Break Costs. (a) The Lessee agrees to
indemnify each Indemnitee and to hold each Indemnitee harmless from any Break
Costs that such Indemnitee may sustain or incur (other than through such
Person's own gross negligence or willful misconduct) as a consequence of (i)
failure by the Lessor to pay the Property Cost for any Property on the date
specified in the Acquisition Date Notice as the Acquisition Date therefor, (ii)
default by the Lessee in paying any Property Cost or Aggregate Property Cost
after the Lessee has given a notice thereof in accordance with the provisions of
the Master Lease, (iii) the Lessee paying Basic Rent on a day that is not a
Scheduled Payment Date or (iv) the Lessee paying any Property Cost, Aggregate
Property Cost, Termination Base Amount or Termination Price.

      (b) The Lessee shall, upon receipt from the Lessor or any Investor of a
statement of the amount of any loss, cost or expense constituting Break Costs
prepared in good faith and in reasonable detail (which statement shall be
binding absent manifest error), pay the amount of such Break Costs to the
requesting Person.

      Section 13.9. Capital Adequacy. If the adoption of any applicable law,
rule or regulation regarding capital adequacy, or any change therein, or any
change in the interpretation or administration thereof by any Governmental
Authority, central bank or comparable agency charged with the interpretation or
administration thereof, or compliance by any Affected Party with any request or
directive regarding capital adequacy (whether or not having the force of law) of
any such authority, central bank or comparable agency, in each case made
subsequent to the Documentation Date has or will have the effect of reducing the
rate of return on any Affected Party's or its parent company's capital, as a
consequence of its commitments or obligations hereunder to a level below that
which such Affected Party or its parent company could have achieved but for such
adoption, effectiveness, change or compliance (taking into consideration such
Affected Party's or its parent company's policies with respect to capital
adequacy), then, upon notice from such Affected Party, the Lessee shall pay to
such Affected Party such additional amount or amounts as will compensate such
Affected Party and its parent company for such reduction (it being understood
that such parent company shall not be reimbursed to the extent its subsidiary
Affected Party is reimbursed by the Lessee in connection with the same or a
similar law, rule, regulation, change,

request or directive applicable to such Affected Party). All payments required
by this Section 13.9 shall be made by the Lessee within five (5) Business Days
after demand by the Affected Party. If any Affected Party becomes entitled to
claim any additional amounts pursuant to this Section 13.9, it shall provide
prompt written notice thereof to the Lessee certifying (x) that one of the
events described in this Section 13.9 has occurred and describing in reasonable
detail the nature of such event, (y) as to the increased cost or reduced amount
resulting from such event and (z) as to the additional amount demanded by such
Affected Party and a reasonably detailed explanation of the calculation thereof.
Such a certificate as to any additional amounts payable pursuant to this Section
13.9 submitted by such Affected Party, through the Lessor, to the Lessee shall
be conclusive in the absence of manifest error.

      Section 13.10. Indemnity Payments in Addition to Lease Obligations. The
Lessee acknowledges and agrees that the Lessee's obligations to make indemnity
payments under this Article XIII are separate from, in addition to, and do not
reduce, the Lessee's obligations to pay any amounts owing from time to time
under the Lease.

      Section 13.11. Payment of Amounts Due under this Article XIII. All amounts
payable by the Lessee pursuant to this Article XIII shall be paid by the Lessee
directly to the Lessor, the Lessor Administrator, the applicable Investor or the
Arranger (as applicable), upon demand from such Person therefor, in immediately
available funds consisting of lawful currency of the United States of America
together with interest on such amounts at a rate per annum of Overnight LIBOR
plus 77 basis points from the date of demand until the same shall be paid (or,
in the case of any such amounts outstanding ten (10) Business Days after the
date of such demand, a rate per annum equal to the Overdue Rate).

      Section 13.12. Survival. The obligations of the Lessee under this Article
XIII shall survive the termination of this Participation Agreement and the other
Operative Documents and the payment of the Lease Balance and all other amounts
payable under the Operative Documents, and shall be separate and independent
from any remedy under the Lease or any other Operative Document.

representations and warranties made by the Lessee in the Operative Documents and
in the certificates or other instruments prepared or delivered in connection
therewith shall be considered to have been relied upon by the Lessor, the
Investors and the Arranger and shall survive the execution and delivery of this
Participation Agreement, the payment by the Lessor of the Property Costs and the
transfer of the Leased Properties to the Lessor regardless of any investigation
made by any Indemnitee or on its behalf, and shall continue in full force and
effect as long as any portion of the Lease Balance is outstanding and unpaid.
The provisions of Article IX and Article XIII shall remain operative and in full
force and effect regardless of the occurrence of the Expiration Date, the
consummation of the transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents, the
payment of the Lease Balance, the invalidity or unenforceability of any term or
provision of any Operative Document or any investigation made by or on behalf of
any Indemnitee.

      Section 14.2. No Broker, Etc. Each of the parties hereto represents to the
others that it has not retained or employed any broker, finder or financial
adviser (other than the Arranger) to act on its behalf in connection with this
Participation Agreement or the transactions contemplated herein or in the other
Operative Documents nor has it authorized any broker, finder or financial
adviser retained or employed by any other Person so to act. In the event that
any party retains any other broker, finder or financial advisor, such party will
promptly notify the other parties in writing of such broker, finder or financial

Lease with respect to all of the Properties.

negligence, (b) breach of any of its representations or warranties under the
Operative Documents, (c) any Lessor Liens attributable to it, or (d) breach of
its obligations under Section 3.2 after the satisfaction of all conditions to
such obligations. It is understood and agreed that, except as provided in the
preceding sentence: (i) the Lessor shall have no personal liability under any of
the Operative Documents; (ii) all obligations of the Lessor to the Investors are
solely nonrecourse obligations except to the extent that the Lessor has received
payment from others; and (iii) all such personal liability of the Lessor is
expressly waived and released as a condition of, and as consideration for, the
execution and delivery of the Operative Documents by the Lessor.

      (b) No Investor shall have any obligation to any other Investor or to the
Lessee with respect to transactions contemplated by the Operative Documents
except those obligations of such Investor expressly set forth in the Operative
Documents or except as set forth in the instruments delivered in connection
therewith, and no Investor shall be liable for performance by any other party
hereto of such other party's obligations under the Operative Documents except as
otherwise so set forth.

      Section 14.11. Further Assurances. The parties hereto shall promptly cause
to be taken, executed, acknowledged or delivered, at the sole expense of the
Lessee, all such further acts, conveyances, documents and assurances as the
other parties may from time to time reasonably request in order to carry out and
preserve the security interests and liens (and the priority thereof) intended to
be created pursuant to this Participation Agreement, the other Operative
Documents, and the transactions thereunder (including the preparation, execution
and filing of any and all Uniform Commercial Code financing statements and other
filings or registrations which the parties hereto may from time to time request
to be filed or effected). The Lessee, at its own expense and upon prior request
from any other party, shall take such action as specified in such request, to
the extent such action is reasonably necessary (including any action specified
in the preceding sentence) in order to maintain and protect all security
interests provided for hereunder or under any other Operative Document.

      Section 14.12. SUBMISSION TO JURISDICTION. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY
SUBMITS TO THE NONEXCLUSIVE JURISDICTION OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR
THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK FOR PURPOSES OF ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARISING
OUT OF OR RELATING TO THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT OR ANY OF THE OTHER OPERATIVE
DOCUMENTS OR THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED HEREBY. EACH PARTY HERETO IRREVOCABLY
WAIVES, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT

PERMITTED BY LAW, ANY OBJECTION WHICH IT MAY NOW OR HEREAFTER HAVE TO THE LAYING
OF THE VENUE OF ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT AND ANY CLAIM THAT
ANY SUCH PROCEEDING BROUGHT IN SUCH A COURT HAS BEEN BROUGHT IN AN INCONVENIENT
FORUM.

      Section 14.13. Setoff. Each Investor and the Lessor shall, upon the
occurrence of any Lease Event of Default, have the right to appropriate and,
subject to Section 7.4, apply to the payment of the Obligations as security for
the payment of such Obligations, any and all balances, credits, deposits,
accounts or moneys of the Lessee then or thereafter maintained with any Investor
or the Lessor. The rights of the Investors and the Lessor under this Section are
in addition to other rights and remedies (including other rights of setoff under
applicable law or otherwise) which such Person may have.

      Section 14.14. Successors and Assigns. All the terms and provisions of
this Participation Agreement shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and their respective successors and permitted assigns; provided, that the Lessee
may not assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations hereunder
without the prior written consent of the Lessor and each Investor, and any
attempted assignment or transfer by the Lessee without such consents shall be
null and void.

      Section 14.15. WAIVER OF JURY TRIAL. EACH PARTY HERETO VOLUNTARILY AND
INTENTIONALLY WAIVES ANY RIGHTS IT MAY HAVE TO A TRIAL BY JURY IN RESPECT OF ANY
LITIGATION BASED ON, OR ARISING OUT OF, UNDER, OR IN CONNECTION WITH, THIS
PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT, OR ANY COURSE OF
CONDUCT, COURSE OF DEALING, STATEMENTS (WHETHER VERBAL OR WRITTEN) OR ACTIONS OF
ANY OF THE PARTIES HERETO. EACH PARTY HERETO HEREBY AGREES THAT IT WILL NOT SEEK
TO CONSOLIDATE ANY SUCH LITIGATION WITH ANY OTHER LITIGATION IN WHICH A JURY
TRIAL HAS NOT OR CANNOT BE WAIVED. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS SECTION 14.14 HAVE
BEEN FULLY NEGOTIATED BY THE PARTIES HERETO AND SHALL BE SUBJECT TO NO
EXCEPTIONS. THE LESSEE ACKNOWLEDGES AND AGREES THAT IT HAS RECEIVED FULL AND
SUFFICIENT CONSIDERATION FOR THIS PROVISION (AND EACH OTHER PROVISION OF EACH
OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT TO WHICH IT IS A PARTY) AND THAT THIS PROVISION IS A
MATERIAL INDUCEMENT FOR EACH OF THE LESSOR AND THE INVESTORS ENTERING INTO THIS
PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT AND EACH SUCH OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENT.

      Section 14.16. NO ORAL AGREEMENTS. THIS PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT AND THE
OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS EMBODY THE ENTIRE AGREEMENT AND UNDERSTANDING AMONG
THE PARTIES HERETO AND SUPERSEDE ALL OTHER AGREEMENTS AND UNDERSTANDINGS BETWEEN
SUCH PARTIES RELATING TO THE SUBJECT MATTER HEREOF AND THEREOF. THIS
PARTICIPATION AGREEMENT AND THE OTHER OPERATIVE DOCUMENTS REPRESENT THE FINAL
AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE PARTIES AND MAY NOT BE CONTRADICTED BY EVIDENCE OF PRIOR,
CONTEMPORANEOUS OR SUBSEQUENT ORAL AGREEMENTS OF THE PARTIES. THERE ARE NO
UNWRITTEN ORAL AGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTIES.

      Section 14.17. No Investor Responsible for Other Investors. The
obligations of each of the Lessor and each Investor under this Participation
Agreement and the other Operative Documents are several and not joint; and, in
the event of a failure by any such Person to perform any of its obligations
hereunder or under any other Operative Document, neither the Lessor nor any
Investor (other than such defaulting Lessor or Investor, as the case may be)
shall have any liability as a consequence thereof.

                                                                    Master Lease

                                   ARTICLE II

                                  MASTER LEASE

      Section 2.1. Acceptance and Lease of Leased Properties. Subject to the
conditions set forth in the Participation Agreement, including the satisfaction
or waiver of the conditions set forth in Article VI thereof, the Lessor hereby
agrees to accept, pursuant to the terms of the Participation Agreement, (a)
delivery on the Acquisition Date of each real property described on Schedule III
to the Participation Agreement under the heading "Leased Properties" and all
Improvements located thereon and (b) delivery on each Replacement Date of each
Replacement Property and all Improvements thereon, and simultaneously to demise
and lease to the Lessee hereunder and under the Lease Supplements for the Lease
Term, the Lessor's interest in such Property or Properties (including any
Improvements which thereafter may be constructed on such Property in accordance
with this Master Lease), and the Lessee hereby agrees, expressly for the direct
benefit of the Lessor, to lease from the Lessor for the Lease Term the interest
of the Lessor in such Leased Properties together with any Improvements which
thereafter may be constructed on such Leased Properties in accordance with this
Master Lease.

      Section 2.2. Acceptance Procedure. The Lessee hereby agrees that the
execution and delivery by it of a Lease Supplement on or as of the Acquisition
Date or a Replacement Date shall, without further act, constitute the
irrevocable acceptance by the Lessee of the Leased Property described in such
Lease Supplement for all purposes of this Master Lease and the other Operative
Documents on the terms set forth herein and therein, and that such Leased
Property, together with any Improvements constructed on the Property pursuant to
this Master Lease, shall be deemed to be included in the leasehold estate of
this Master Lease and shall be subject to the terms and conditions of this
Master Lease as of the Acquisition Date or such Replacement Date, as the case
may be.

      Section 2.3. Lease Term. The Lease Term of this Master Lease for each
Leased Property shall commence on (and include) the Acquisition Date of such
Property (or, in the case of a Replacement Property, the Replacement Date for
such Property) and end on (but exclude) the Expiration Date.

      Section 2.4. Title. Each Leased Property is leased to the Lessee without
any representation or warranty, express or implied, by the Lessor and subject to
the rights of parties in possession, the existing state of title (including all
Liens other than Lessor Liens) and all Applicable Law. The Lessee shall not in
any event have any recourse against the Lessor for any defect in or exception to
title to any Property or leasehold interest therein other than resulting from
Lessor Liens attributable to the Lessor.

      Section 2.5. Mortgaged Properties Also Subject to this Master Lease. Each
of the Lessee and the Lessor hereby agrees that each Mortgaged Property shall be
subject to the terms of this Master Lease for the period commencing on (and
including) the Acquisition Date or Replacement Date for such Property and ending
on (but excluding) the date on which such Property is released from the Lien of
the applicable Lessor Mortgage in accordance with the terms of the Operative
Documents.

                                  ARTICLE III

                                 PAYMENT OF RENT

      Section 3.1. Rent. (a) Accrual Rent shall accrue each day during the Lease
Term on the Aggregate Property Cost outstanding on such day. During the Lease
Term, the Lessee shall pay Basic Rent to the Lessor on each Scheduled Payment
Date, on any other date required under Section 20.1 in connection with the
Lessee's exercise of the Return Option, on any other date on which this Master
Lease or any other Operative Document requires such payment and, with respect to
any Leased Property, on any

                                      -2-
<PAGE>

                                                                    Master Lease

other date on which this Master Lease shall terminate with respect to such
Leased Property or with respect to any Mortgaged Property.

      (b) Neither the Lessee's inability or failure to take possession of all or
any portion of any Leased Property when delivered by the Lessor, nor the
inability or failure of the Lessor to deliver all or any portion of any Leased
Property to the Lessee on or before the Acquisition Date, whether or not
attributable to any act or omission of the Lessee or any act or omission of the
Lessor, or for any other reason whatsoever, shall delay or otherwise affect such
Lessee's obligation to pay Rent for such Leased Property in accordance with the
terms of this Master Lease.

      Section 3.2. Payment of Rent. Rent shall be paid absolutely net to each
Person entitled thereto, so that this Master Lease shall yield to such Person
the full amount thereof, without setoff, deduction or reduction.

      Section 3.3. Supplemental Rent. The Lessee shall pay (x) to the Lessor or
(y) in the case of any Supplemental Rent owing to any other Person, directly to
the Person entitled thereto, any and all Supplemental Rent promptly as the same
shall become due and payable, and if the Lessee fails to pay any Supplemental
Rent, the Lessor and such other Persons shall have all rights, powers and
remedies provided for herein or by law or equity or otherwise in the case of
nonpayment of Basic Rent. The Lessee shall pay to the Lessor, as Supplemental
Rent, among other things, on demand, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law,
interest at the applicable Overdue Rate on any Basic Rent or Supplemental Rent
not paid when due for the period from the due date thereof until the same shall
be paid (provided, that any amounts payable by the Lessee pursuant to Article
XIII of the Participation Agreement shall accrue interest as set forth in
Section 13.11 of the Participation Agreement). The expiration or other
termination of the Lessee's obligations to pay Basic Rent hereunder shall not
limit or modify the obligations of the Lessee with respect to Supplemental Rent.
Unless expressly provided otherwise in this Master Lease or in the Participation
Agreement, in the event of any failure on the part of the Lessee to pay and
discharge any Supplemental Rent as and when due, the Lessee shall also promptly
pay and discharge, to the extent incurred as a result of such failure on the
part of the Lessee, any fine, penalty, interest or cost which may be assessed or
added against the Lessor or any Investor by a third party for nonpayment or late
payment of such Supplemental Rent, all of which shall also constitute
Supplemental Rent. Notwithstanding anything in this Section 3.3 to the contrary,
if the Lessee incurs any fine, penalty, interest or cost for nonpayment or late
payment of any tax assessment, levy, duty, or other bill received in connection
with any of the Leased Properties as a result of the Lessor's failure to provide
notice to the Lessee of such tax assessment, levy, duty or other bill within the
time period required by Section 17.2, an amount equal to such fine, penalty,
interest or cost shall be deducted first from any Supplemental Rent then due and
owing and second from any Accrual Rent then due and owing.

      Section 3.4. Method of Payment. Each payment of Rent payable by the Lessee
to the Lessor under this Lease or any other Operative Document shall be made by
the Lessee to the Lessor prior to 10:00 a.m., New York City time to the Account
in immediately available funds consisting of lawful currency of the United
States of America on the date when such payment shall be due. Payments received
after 10:00 a.m., New York City time on the date due shall for the purpose of
Section 16.1 hereof be deemed received on such day; provided, however, that for
the purposes of the second sentence of Section 3.3, such payments shall be
deemed received on the next succeeding Business Day and shall accrue interest at
the Overdue Rate as provided in such Section 3.3.

      Section 3.5. Calculation of Accrual Rent. The "Accrual Rent" payable on
any Scheduled Payment Date means an amount equal to (w) the Aggregate Property
Cost outstanding on the immediately preceding Scheduled Payment Date, after
giving effect to all payments made on such preceding Scheduled Payment Date (or,
in the case of the initial Scheduled Payment Date, the Aggregate Property

                                      -3-

                                                                    Master Lease

Cost outstanding on the Acquisition Date) minus all payments of Termination Base
Amount made during the Rent Period ending on such Scheduled Payment Date
multiplied by (x) the Applicable Rate multiplied by (y) the number of days then
elapsed since the Scheduled Payment Date immediately preceding such date
multiplied by (z) 1/360.

                                   ARTICLE IV

                        QUIET ENJOYMENT; RIGHT TO INSPECT

      Section 4.1. Quiet Enjoyment. Subject to the terms of each of the
Operative Documents, the Lessee shall peaceably and quietly have, hold and enjoy
each Property for the Lease Term, free of any claim or other action by the
Lessor or anyone claiming by, through or under the Lessor with respect to any
matters arising from and after the Acquisition Date. Such right of quiet
enjoyment is independent of, and shall not affect the rights of the Lessor or
any assignee thereof otherwise to initiate legal action to enforce, the
obligations of the Lessee under this Master Lease.

      Section 4.2. Right to Inspect. During the Lease Term, the Lessee shall
permit the Lessor, the Investors and their agent and representatives to inspect
the Properties in accordance with Section 10.1(j) of the Participation
Agreement.

                                   ARTICLE V

                                 NET LEASE, ETC.

      Section 5.1. Net Lease. This Master Lease shall constitute a net lease.
Any present or future law to the contrary notwithstanding, this Master Lease
shall not terminate, nor shall the Lessee be entitled to any abatement,
suspension, deferment, reduction, setoff, counterclaim, or defense with respect
to the Rent, nor shall the obligations of the Lessee hereunder be affected
(except as expressly herein permitted and by performance of the obligations in
connection therewith) by reason of: (i) any defect in the condition,
merchantability, design, construction, quality or fitness for use of any
Property or any part thereof, or the failure of any Property to comply with all
Applicable Law, including any inability to occupy or use any Property by reason
of such non-compliance; (ii) any damage to, removal, abandonment, salvage, loss,
contamination of or Release from, scrapping or destruction of or any requisition
or taking of any Property or any part thereof; (iii) any restriction, prevention
or curtailment of or interference with the construction on or any use of any
Property or any part thereof including eviction; (iv) any defect in title of or
rights to any Property or any Lien on such title or rights or on any Property
(other than Lessor Liens); (v) any change, waiver, extension, indulgence or
other action or omission or breach in respect of any obligation or liability of
or by the Lessor, any Investor or the Arranger; (vi) any bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, composition, adjustment, dissolution, liquidation or other like
proceedings relating to the Lessee, any Lessee Subsidiary, the Lessor, any
Investor, the Arranger or any other Person, or any action taken with respect to
this Master Lease by any trustee or receiver of the Lessee, any Lessee
Subsidiary, the Lessor, any Investor, the Arranger or any other Person, or by
any court in any such proceeding; (vii) any claim that the Lessee has or might
have against any Person, including the Lessor, any Investor, the Arranger or any
Seller, vendor, manufacturer, contractor of or for any Property; (viii) any
failure on the part of the Lessor to perform or comply with any of the terms of
this Master Lease (other than performance by the Lessor of its obligations set
forth in Section 2.1 hereof), of any other Operative Document or of any other
agreement; (ix) any invalidity or unenforceability or illegality or
disaffirmance of this Master Lease against or by the Lessee or any provision
hereof or any of the other Operative Documents or any provision of any thereof;
(x) the impossibility or illegality of performance by the Lessee, the Lessor or
both of them; (xi) any action by any court, administrative agency or other
Governmental Authority; or (xii) any other cause or circumstances whether
similar or

                                                                    Master Lease

dissimilar to the foregoing and whether or not the Lessee shall have notice or
knowledge of any of the foregoing. The Lessee's agreement in this Section 5.1
shall not affect any claim, action or right the Lessee may have against the
Lessor or any Investor. The parties intend that the obligations of the Lessee
hereunder shall be covenants and agreements that are separate and independent
from any obligations of the Lessor hereunder or under any other Operative
Documents, and the obligations of the Lessee shall continue unaffected unless
such obligations shall have been modified or terminated in accordance with an
express provision of this Master Lease.

      Section 5.2. No Termination or Abatement. The Lessee shall remain
obligated under this Master Lease in accordance with its terms and shall not
take any action to terminate, rescind or avoid this Master Lease (except as
provided herein), notwithstanding any action for bankruptcy, insolvency,
reorganization, liquidation, dissolution, or other proceeding affecting the
Lessor or any Investor, or any action with respect to this Master Lease which
may be taken by any trustee, receiver or liquidator of the Lessor or any
Investor or by any court with respect to the Lessor or any Investor. The Lessee
hereby waives, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, all right (i) to
terminate or surrender this Master Lease (except as provided herein) or (ii) to
avail itself of any abatement, suspension, deferment, reduction, setoff,
counterclaim or defense with respect to any Rent except as otherwise provided in
the last sentence of Section 3.3. The Lessee shall remain obligated under this
Master Lease in accordance with its terms and the Lessee hereby waives, to the
extent permitted by Applicable Law, any and all rights now or hereafter
conferred by statute or otherwise to modify or to avoid strict compliance with
its obligations under this Master Lease. Notwithstanding any such statute or
otherwise, the Lessee shall be bound by all of the terms and conditions
contained in this Master Lease, each Lease Supplement and each Lessor Mortgage.

                                   ARTICLE VI

                            SUBLEASES AND ASSIGNMENTS

      Section 6.1. General. THE LESSEE SHALL NOT, WITHOUT THE PRIOR WRITTEN
CONSENT OF THE LESSOR (SUCH CONSENT TO BE GIVEN OR WITHHELD IN THE SOLE
DISCRETION OF THE LESSOR), TRANSFER, ASSIGN OR ENCUMBER THIS MASTER LEASE OR ANY
LEASE SUPPLEMENT OR ANY OF ITS RIGHTS OR OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER OR THEREUNDER,

            (v) the insurance in favor of the Lessor and the Investors and their
      respective rights under and interests in such policies shall not be
      invalidated or reduced by any act or omission (including breach of
      warranty) or negligence of the Lessee or any other Person having any
      interest in the Property; and

            (vi) such insurance shall be primary and noncontributable and shall

                                                                    Master Lease

destruction, confiscation, requisition or commandeering, partial or complete, of
or to such Property or any part thereof, however caused or occasioned. The
Lessee agrees that no occurrence specified in the preceding sentence shall
affect, in whole or in part, any obligation of the Lessee under this Master
Lease, including the obligation to pay Rent. Without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, in the event that during the Lease Term the use of any Property
is requisitioned or taken by any Governmental Authority under the power of
eminent domain or otherwise for a period which does not constitute an Event of
Loss, all of Lessee's obligations under the Operative Documents, including the
Lessee's obligation to pay all installments of Basic Rent, shall continue for
the duration of such requisitioning or taking.

      (b) If any Event of Loss occurs and such Event of Loss does not constitute
a Lease Event of Default under Section 16.1(p), then the Lessee shall exercise
its Replacement Option or its Termination Option, in each case with respect to
the affected Property, and shall consummate such replacement or termination no
later than sixty (60) days following the occurrence of such Event of Loss.

      Section 14.2. Casualty and Condemnation. (a) Insurance Proceeds and
Condemnation Awards. Subject to the provisions of this Article XIV, (x) if all
or a portion of any Property is damaged or destroyed in whole or in part by a
Casualty while such Property is subject to the provisions of this Master Lease,
any insurance proceeds payable with respect to such Casualty shall be paid
directly to the Lessee, or if received by the Lessor, shall be paid over to the
Lessee for the reconstruction, refurbishment and repair of the affected
Property, and (y) if the use, access, occupancy, easement rights or title to any
Property or any part thereof is the subject of a Condemnation while such
Property is subject to the provisions of this Master Lease, then any award or
compensation relating thereto shall be paid to the Lessee; provided, however,
that, in each case, if (A) any Lease Default or Lease Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing or (B) the Lessee shall not have Ratings of
"BBB-" or better by S&P and "Baa3" or better by Moody's, then such award,
compensation or insurance proceeds shall be paid directly to the Lessor or, if
received by the Lessee, shall be held in trust for the Lessor and shall be paid
over by the Lessee to the Lessor, and the Lessor shall hold such amounts in a
segregated account and, upon presentation by the Lessee of paid invoices or
other evidence reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor as to the Lessee's prior
payment of reasonable costs required for repair of the applicable Property, the
Lessor shall pay such amounts over to the Lessee to reimburse the Lessee for the
reasonable cost of repair and restoration of the applicable Property (provided
that, so long as no Lease Default or Lease Event of Default shall have occurred
and be continuing, any such insurance proceeds, awards or compensation shall be
paid to the Lessee in an amount, in the aggregate with all such proceeds, awards
and compensation relating to the applicable Property, not to exceed the lesser
of $5,000,000 and 25% of the Termination Base Amount of the affected Property
(with any excess over such lesser amount to be paid over to the Lessor in
accordance with the foregoing proviso); provided, further, however, that in the
case of (x) a Lease Default or Lease Event of Default, (y) the delivery by the
Lessor of a Partial Termination Notice with respect to such Property or (z) the
Lessee's election (if applicable) of its Termination Option with respect to such
Property, then such amounts shall, in the Lessor's discretion, be applied toward
the payment of the Termination Price or Termination Base Amount (as applicable)
of the affected Property and related amounts in accordance with Section 16.2,
15.1 or 19.1 (as applicable).

      (b) Participation in Proceedings. The Lessee may appear in any proceeding
or action to negotiate, prosecute, adjust or appeal any claim for any award,
compensation or insurance payment on account of any Casualty or Condemnation
with respect to any Property and shall pay all expenses thereof. At the Lessee's
reasonable request, and at the Lessee's sole cost and expense, the Lessor shall
participate in any such proceeding, action, negotiation, prosecution or
adjustment. The Lessor and the Lessee agree that this Master Lease shall control
the rights of the Lessor and the Lessee in and to any such award, compensation
or insurance payment.

      (c) Notices of Casualty or Condemnation. The Lessee shall, within fifteen
(15) Business Days after obtaining knowledge of the occurrence of (x) any
Casualty with respect to any Property for which the reasonable anticipated cost
of restoration equals or exceeds $2,000,000, (y) an actual, pending or
threatened Condemnation of any Property or any material interest therein or (z)
any Casualty or Condemnation affecting a Property that could reasonably be
expected to result in a Termination Event, notify the Lessor in writing of such
occurrence. If the Lessor receives any notice of a Condemnation affecting any
Property directly from any Governmental Authority, the Lessor will promptly (and
in no event later than fifteen (15) Business Days) forward such notice to the
Lessee.

      (d) Repair. If this Master Lease shall continue in full force and effect
with respect to any Property following a Casualty or Condemnation affecting such
Property, then the Lessee shall, at its sole cost and expense, promptly and
diligently repair any damage to such Property caused by such Casualty or
Condemnation in conformity with the requirements of Sections 8.2, 8.3, 9.1, 10.1
and 11.1 so as to restore such Property to at least the same or substantially
similar (assuming no Lease Default or Lease Event of Default was then
continuing) condition, operation, function and value as existed immediately
prior to such Casualty or Condemnation with such Modifications as the Lessee may
elect in accordance with Section 10.1. In such event, title to any such Property
that is a Leased Property shall remain with the Lessor subject to the terms of
this Master Lease. Upon completion of such restoration, the Lessee shall furnish
to the Lessor a Responsible Officer's Certificate of the Lessee confirming that
such restoration has been completed pursuant to this Master Lease.

      (e) Obligations Continue. In no event shall a Casualty or Condemnation
affect the Lessee's obligations to pay Rent pursuant to Section 3.1 hereof or to
perform its obligations and pay any amounts due on the Expiration Date or
pursuant to Articles XVIII and XX hereof.

      (f) Excess Casualty/Condemnation Proceeds. Upon the earliest of (x) the
date on which all damage to a Property caused by a Casualty or Condemnation
shall have been repaired in accordance with Section 14.2(d), (y) the date on
which the Termination Base Amount or Termination Price (as applicable) of the
affected Property and all other amounts due and payable under Section 15.1 or
19.1, as applicable, shall have been paid to the Lessor, and (z) the date on
which the affected Property shall have been replaced with a Replacement Property
under Section 19.2, any Net Proceeds received by the Lessor or any Investor in
respect of such Casualty or Condemnation, to the extent remaining after any
application of such Net Proceeds to the repair or restoration of the applicable
Property or to the payment of the Termination Base Amount or Termination Price
(as applicable) for such Property and such other amounts, as the case may be
(any such Net Proceeds remaining after such application, "Excess
Casualty/Condemnation Proceeds"), shall be promptly paid to the Lessee.

      Section 14.3. Remediation of Environmental Violations. If any
Environmental Violation exists or occurs with respect to any Property and either
(x) such Environmental Violation shall not constitute a Termination Event or (y)
such Environmental Violation shall constitute a Termination Event but the Lessee
shall not have exercised its Termination Option or Replacement Option within the
thirty (30)-day period following the date on which the Lessee shall have
knowledge of the occurrence of such Environmental Violation (or, if the Lessee
shall have so exercised its Termination Option or Replacement Option but shall
not have consummated such Termination Option or Replacement Option in accordance
with the terms of this Master Lease), then the Lessee shall, at the Lessee's
sole cost and expense, diligently commence and prosecute to completion with all
deliberate speed any response, clean up, Remedial Action or other action
necessary to remove, clean up or remediate any such Environmental Violation in
accordance with the terms of Section 8.3. The Lessee shall, upon completion of
Remedial Action by the Lessee, cause to be prepared by a reputable environmental
consultant of the sort typically hired by sophisticated parties, a report
describing the Environmental Violation and the actions taken by the Lessee (or
its agents) in response to such Environmental Violation, and a statement by the
consultant

that the Environmental Violation has been remedied in compliance in all material
respects with applicable Environmental Laws. Nothing in this Article XIV shall
reduce or limit the Lessee's obligations under Article XIII of the Participation
Agreement.

      Section 14.4. Notice of Environmental Violations. (a) The Lessee shall,
within twenty (20) Business Days after obtaining knowledge of the existence of
an Environmental Violation with respect to any Property, notify the Lessor in
writing of such Environmental Violation.

      (a) Promptly, but in any event within twenty (20) Business Days from the
date the Lessee has actual knowledge thereof, the Lessee shall provide to the
Lessor written notice of any notice of any pending or threatened claim, action
or proceeding involving any Environmental Laws, any Release or Remedial Action
on or in connection with any Property. All such notices shall describe in
reasonable detail the nature of the claim, action or proceeding and the Lessee's
proposed response thereto. In addition, the Lessee shall provide to the Lessor,
within twenty (20) Business Days of receipt, copies of all written
communications with the Governmental Authority relating to any Environmental
Violation in connection with any Property. The Lessee shall also promptly
provide such detailed reports of any such material environmental claims as may
reasonably be requested by the Lessor or any Investor. In the event that the
Lessor receives written notice of any pending or threatened claim, action or
proceeding involving any Environmental Laws, any Release or Remedial Action on
or in connection with any Property, the Lessor shall promptly give notice
thereof to the Lessee.

any Property: (a) an Event of Loss occurs or (b) an Environmental Violation
occurs or is discovered and the cost of remediation of which the Lessee
determines in its reasonable good faith judgment could reasonably be expected to
exceed the lesser of $5,000,000 and twenty percent (20%) of the Termination Base
Amount of such Property; and the Lessor shall have given prior written notice (a
"Partial Termination Notice") to the Lessee that, as a consequence of such

Property from the Lien of the Lessor Mortgage applicable thereto and pay to the
Lessor, in exchange for such release, an amount equal to the sum of (x) the
Termination Base Amount of the affected Property on such date plus (y) all
accrued and unpaid Accrual Rent allocable to an amount of Property Cost equal to
such Termination Base Amount, plus (z) without duplication all Basic Rent and
Supplemental Rent, including Break Costs, due and owing on such date (after

15.2, on such date of payment transfer to the Lessee all of the interest of the
Lessor in the affected Property (in the case of a Leased Property) and release
any Lessor Mortgage encumbering Property; provided, however, that the Lessee
shall not be obligated to purchase the affected Property if the Lessee delivers
a Replacement Notice within ten (10) days after receiving the Partial
Termination Notice and completes the replacement in accordance with Section 19.2
within sixty (60) days after receiving the Partial Termination Notice.

      Section 15.2. Partial Termination Procedures. On the date of the payment

      described in clause (g) or (h) of Section 16.1, (A) the obligation of the
      Lessor to acquire any Leased Property on the Acquisition Date shall
      automatically terminate and (B) the Lease Balance shall automatically
      become and be due and payable, without presentment, demand, protest or any
      notice of any kind, all of which are hereby expressly waived by the
      Lessee;

            (b) The Lessor may make demand upon the Lessee for the amounts due
      under the Operative Documents;

            (c) The Lessor may, by notice to the Lessee, rescind or terminate
      this Master Lease as of the date specified in such notice; however, (i) no
      reletting, reentry or taking of possession of any Leased Property (or any
      portion thereof) by the Lessor (or its agents) will be construed as an
      election on the Lessor's part to terminate this Master Lease unless a
      written notice of such intention is given to the Lessee, (ii)
      notwithstanding any reletting, reentry or taking of possession, the Lessor
      may at any time thereafter elect to terminate this Master Lease for a
      continuing Lease Event of Default, and (iii) no act or thing done by the
      Lessor or any of its agents, representatives or employees and no agreement
      accepting a surrender of any Leased Property shall be valid unless the
      same be made in writing and executed by the Lessor;

            (d) The Lessor may (i) demand that the Lessee, and the Lessee shall
      upon the written demand of the Lessor, return all of the Leased Properties
      promptly to the Lessor in the manner and condition required by, and
      otherwise in accordance with all of the provisions of this Lease
      (including Sections 8.2, 8.3, 9.1, 10.1 and 11.1 hereof) as if the
      Properties were being returned on the Scheduled Lease Termination Date,
      and the Lessor shall not be liable for the reimbursement of the Lessee for
      any costs and expenses incurred by the Lessee in connection therewith, and
      (ii) without prejudice to any other remedy that the Lessor may have for
      possession of the Properties, and to the extent and in the manner
      permitted by Applicable Law and any applicable DOD Restrictions, enter
      upon any Leased Property and take immediate possession of (to the
      exclusion of the Lessee) the Leased Properties or any part thereof and
      expel or remove the Lessee and any other Person who may be occupying any
      Leased Property, by summary proceedings or otherwise, all without
      liability to the Lessor for or by reason of such entry or taking of
      possession, whether for the restoration of damage to any property caused
      by such taking or otherwise and, in addition to the other damages of the
      Lessor, the Lessee shall be responsible for all costs and expenses
      incurred by the Lessor, the Investors and/or the Arranger in connection
      with any reletting, including reasonable brokers' fees and all costs of
      any alterations or repairs required to be made by the Lessor so that the
      Properties achieve the standard of condition required by this Master
      Lease;

            (e) As more fully set forth in Section 16.4 hereof, in each Lease
      Supplement (and consistent with the intent of the parties as detailed in
      Article XXV hereof) and in each Lessor Mortgage, the Lessor may exercise
      all remedies available to a mortgagee, secured party, beneficiary or
      trustee under law or equity, including, to the extent permitted by law,
      the right to sell all or any part of the Properties at public or private
      sale, as the Lessor may determine;

            (f) The Lessor may, at its option, elect not to terminate this
      Master Lease and continue to collect all Basic Rent, Supplemental Rent,
      and all other amounts due to the Lessor (together with all costs of
      collection) and enforce the Lessee's obligations under this Master Lease
      as and when the same become due, or are to be performed, and at the option
      of the Lessor, upon any abandonment of any Leased Property by the Lessee
      or re-entry of same by the Lessor, the Lessor may, in its sole and
      absolute discretion, elect not to terminate this Master Lease and may make
      the necessary repairs in order to relet any Leased Property, and relet
      such Leased Property or any part thereof for such term or terms (which may
      be for a long term extending beyond the Lease Term of this Master Lease)
      and at such rental or rentals and upon such other terms and conditions as
      the Lessor in its reasonable discretion may deem advisable; and upon each
      such reletting, all rentals actually received by the Lessor from such
      reletting shall be applied to the Lessee's Obligations in the manner
      provided in Section 7.4 of the Participation Agreement. If such rentals
      received from such reletting during any period are less than the Rent to
      be paid during that period by the Lessee hereunder, the Lessee shall pay
      any deficiency, as calculated by the Lessor, to the Lessor on the next
      Scheduled Payment Date;

            (g) Unless all of the Leased Properties have been sold in their
      entirety, the Lessor may, whether or not the Lessor shall have exercised
      or shall thereafter at any time exercise any of its rights under clause
      (d), (e) or (f) of this Section 16.2 with respect to any or all of the
      Properties or any portions thereof, demand, by written notice to the
      Lessee specifying a date not earlier than twenty (20) days after the date
      of such notice, that the Lessee purchase, on the date specified in such
      notice, all of the unsold Properties in accordance with the provisions of
      Article XXI and Section 18.2 for an amount equal to the then outstanding
      Lease Balance;

            (h) The Lessor may exercise any other right or remedy that may be
      available to it under Applicable Law, or proceed by appropriate court
      action (legal or equitable) to enforce the terms hereof or to recover
      damages for the breach hereof. Separate suits may be brought to collect
      any such damages for any period(s), and such suits shall not in any manner
      prejudice the Lessor's rights to collect any such damages for any
      subsequent period(s), or the Lessor may defer any such suit until after
      the Expiration Date, in which event such suit shall be deemed not to have
      accrued until the Expiration Date;

            (i) The Lessor may retain and apply against the Lease Balance all
      sums which the Lessor would, absent such Lease Event of Default, be
      required to pay to, or turn over to, the Lessee pursuant to the terms of
      this Master Lease (including any amounts held by the Lessor pursuant to
      Section 14.2); or

            (j) The Lessor, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, as a
      matter of right and with notice to the Lessee, shall have the right to
      apply to any court having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers
      of any part of each Property, and the Lessee hereby irrevocably consents
      to any such appointment. Any such receivers shall have all of the usual
      powers and duties of receivers in like or similar cases and all of the
      powers and duties of the Lessor in case of entry, and shall continue as
      such and exercise such powers until the date of confirmation of the sale
      of the applicable Property unless such receivership is sooner terminated.

      The Lessor shall be entitled to enforce payment of the indebtedness and
performance of the Obligations secured hereby and to exercise all rights and
powers under this instrument or under any of the other Operative Documents or
other agreement or any laws now or hereafter in force, notwithstanding some or
all of the Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise secured,
whether by mortgage, security agreement, pledge, lien, assignment or otherwise.
Neither the acceptance of this instrument nor its enforcement shall prejudice or
in any manner affect the Lessor's right to realize upon or

                                      -20-

                                                                    Master Lease

enforce any other security now or hereafter held by the Lessor, it being agreed
that the Lessor shall be entitled to enforce this instrument and any other
security now or hereafter held by the Lessor in such order and manner as the
Lessor may determine in its absolute discretion. No remedy herein conferred upon
or reserved to the Lessor is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy herein
or by law provided or permitted, but each shall be cumulative and shall be in
addition to every other remedy given hereunder or now or hereafter existing at
law or in equity or by statute. Every power or remedy given by any of the
Operative Documents to the Lessor or to which the Lessor may otherwise be
entitled, may be exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time and
as often as may be deemed expedient by the Lessor. In no event shall the Lessor,
in the exercise of the remedies provided in this instrument (including in
connection with the assignment of rents to the Lessor, or the appointment of a
receiver and the entry of such receiver onto all or any part of the Properties),
be deemed a "mortgagee in possession," and the Lessor shall not in any way be
made liable for any act, either of commission or omission, in connection with
the exercise of such remedies.

      If, pursuant to the exercise by the Lessor of its remedies pursuant to
this Section 16.2, the Lease Balance and all other amounts due and owing from
the Lessee under this Master Lease and the other Operative Documents have been
paid in full, then the Lessor shall remit to the Lessee any excess amounts
received by the Lessor.

      If requested by the Lessor in connection with the exercise of its remedies
pursuant to this Section 16.2, subject to the good faith mutual agreement of the
Lessor and the Lessee, the Lessee hereby agrees to enter into an operating
agreement with respect to the Properties having a term no longer than one year
and in connection therewith to serve as the operator of the Properties; provided
that such agreement shall be on market terms established in good faith and
reasonably acceptable to the Lessor and the Lessee.

      Section 16.3. Waiver of Certain Rights. (a) To the maximum extent
permitted by law, the Lessee hereby waives the benefit of any appraisement,
valuation, stay, extension, reinstatement and redemption laws now or hereafter
in force and all rights of marshalling in the event of any sale of any Property
or any interest therein, (b) if this Master Lease shall be terminated pursuant
to Section 16.2, the Lessee waives, to the fullest extent permitted by law, (i)
any notice of re-entry or the institution of legal proceedings to obtain
re-entry or possession; (ii) any right of redemption, re-entry or repossession;
(iii) the benefit of any laws now or hereafter in force exempting property from
liability for rent or for debt or limiting the Lessor with respect to the
election of remedies; and (iv) any other rights that might otherwise limit or
modify any of the Lessor's rights or remedies under this Article XVI.

      Section 16.4. Mortgage/Deed of Trust Remedies. Without limiting any other
remedies set forth in this Master Lease, and also, without limiting the
generality of Article XXV hereof, the Lessor may proceed by a suit or suits in
equity or at law, whether for a foreclosure hereunder or under the Lease
Supplements, or (to the extent permitted by law) for the sale of each Property,
pursuant to a power of sale, or against the Lessee on a recourse basis for the
Lease Balance, or for the specific performance of any covenant or agreement
contained herein or in aid of the execution of any power granted herein, or for
the appointment of a receiver pending any foreclosure hereunder (or under the
Lease Supplements) or the sale of any Property, or for the enforcement of any
other appropriate legal or equitable remedy. The Lessor shall have all rights
available to a mortgagee (or of a beneficiary under a deed of trust) or a
secured party under the laws of the state where the relevant Property is
located, including all rights granted under the specific statutes referenced in
each Lease Supplement, if any (each such statute, as amended, is hereinafter
referred to as a "Mortgage Foreclosure Act"). In the event that any provisions
of this Master Lease shall be inconsistent with any Mortgage Foreclosure Act,
the provisions of such Mortgage Foreclosure Act shall take precedence over such
provision of this Master Lease, but shall not invalidate or render unenforceable
any other provision of this Master Lease that can be construed in a manner

                                                                    Master Lease

consistent with such Mortgage Foreclosure Act. If any provision of this Master
Lease shall grant the Lessor any rights or remedies upon default of the Lessee
that are more limited than the rights that would otherwise be vested in the
Lessor under such Mortgage Foreclosure Act in the absence of such provision, the
Lessor shall be vested with the broader rights granted in such Mortgage
Foreclosure Act to the full extent permitted by law. The Lessee agrees that the
agreements of Lessee herein contained shall be specifically enforceable by
injunction or any other appropriate equitable remedy and that for the purpose of
any suit brought pursuant hereto, the Lessee hereby waives, to the fullest
extent permitted by law, the defense of laches and any applicable statute of
limitations. In the event of foreclosure, the Lessee authorizes and empowers the
Lessor to effect insurance upon the Properties in amounts aforesaid for a period
covering the time of redemption from foreclosure sale provided by law, and if
necessary therefor, to cancel any or all existing insurance policies required to
be maintained under this Master Lease.

         LESSOR'S RIGHT TO CURE; LESSOR'S OBLIGATION TO FORWARD NOTICES

      Section 17.1. The Lessor's Right to Cure the Lessee's Lease Defaults. The
Lessor, without waiving or releasing any obligation or Lease Event of Default,
may (but shall be under no obligation to) remedy any Lease Event of Default for
the account and at the sole cost and expense of the Lessee, including the
failure by the Lessee to maintain the insurance required by Article XIII, and
may, to the fullest extent permitted by law, and notwithstanding any right of
quiet enjoyment in favor of the Lessee (but subject to any applicable DOD
Restrictions), enter upon any Property for such purpose and take all such action
thereon as may be necessary or appropriate therefor. No such entry shall be
deemed an eviction of the Lessee. All reasonable out-of-pocket costs and
expenses so incurred (including fees and expenses of counsel), together with
interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date on which such sums or
expenses are paid by the Lessor, shall be paid by the Lessee to the Lessor as
Supplemental Rent.

      Section 17.2. Lessor's Obligation to Forward Notices. The Lessor shall
deliver to the Lessee copies of all notices received by the Lessor from any
Governmental Authority (including all notices of any tax assessment, levy, duty
or other bill from any Governmental Authority) with respect to the Lessee or any
Property promptly but in any event within ten (10) Business Days after the
Lessor's receipt thereof.

                                 ARTICLE XVIII

                               PURCHASE BY LESSEE

      Section 18.1. Purchase Option on Expiration Date. The Lessee shall have
the right at its option to purchase the Lessor's interest in all (but not less
than all) of the Leased Properties on the Scheduled Lease Termination Date in
accordance with this Section 18.1 (the "Purchase Option") by delivering prior
written notice thereof not later than one hundred eighty (180) days prior to the
Scheduled Lease Termination Date to the Lessor and, unless the Lessee shall have
properly exercised the Return Option and shall have fulfilled all of the
requirements of Article XX, the Lessee shall be deemed to have elected to
purchase the Lessor's interest in all of the Leased Properties pursuant to this
Section 18.1. Any such notice or deemed election shall be irrevocable. If the
Lessee shall have elected (or shall have been deemed to have elected) to
purchase all of the Leased Properties under this Section, then, subject to the
terms, conditions and provisions set forth in this Section, and in accordance
with the procedures set forth in Section 21.1, the Lessee (or its designee)
shall purchase from the Lessor, and the Lessor shall convey to the Lessee (or
its designee), on the Scheduled Lease Termination Date all of the interest of
the Lessor in all of the Leased Properties for an amount equal to one dollar
($1); provided that the Lessee shall have paid all accrued and unpaid Basic Rent
and all Supplemental Rent owing on the Scheduled Lease

Termination Date (including the final payment of Fixed Rent) after giving effect
to such purchase. The Lessee may designate, in a notice given to the Lessor not
less than ten (10) Business Days prior to the closing of such purchase, the
transferee or transferees to whom the conveyance shall be made (if other than to
the Lessee), in which case such conveyance shall (subject to the terms and
conditions set forth herein) be made to such designee; provided, however, that
such designation of a transferee or transferees shall not cause the Lessee to be
released, fully or partially, from any of its obligations under this Master
Lease, including the obligation to pay the Lessor the final Basic Rent payment
on the Scheduled Lease Termination Date.

      Section 18.2. Acceleration of Purchase Obligation. The Lessee shall be
obligated to purchase for an amount equal to the Lease Balance all of the
interest of the Lessor in all of the Leased Properties automatically and without
notice upon the occurrence of any Lease Event of Default described in clause (g)
or (h) of Section 16.1. Any purchase under this Section 18.2 shall be in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 21.1.

                                  ARTICLE XIX

        TERMINATION OR REPLACEMENT FOR OBSOLESCENCE, EVENT OF LOSS, ETC.

      Section 19.1. Right of Termination.

      (a) Termination Option. The Lessee shall have the right at its option (the
"Termination Option") to terminate the Lease with respect to one or more
Properties (including any Mortgaged Property) if: (i) such Property or
Properties are no longer being used by the Lessee or any of its Affiliates in
its business as a result of such Property or Properties (x) becoming obsolete or
surplus to the Lessee's or such Affiliate's requirements, (y) suffering a
Casualty or Condemnation or (z) suffering a title defect or Environmental
Violation or (ii) the Indemnitees shall have demanded payment from the Lessee of
amounts owing under Article XIII of the Participation Agreement as a result of
events outside of the control of the Lessee, the payment of which, in the
aggregate, cause the implicit rate of return on the Aggregate Property Cost to
increase by more than 0.20% above the implicit rate of return anticipated on the
Acquisition Date or (iii) such Property or Properties are intended to be held
for sale (any event described in clause (iii), a "Sale Termination Event" and
any event described in clause (i), (ii) or (iii), a "Termination Event," and the
applicable Property to which the Termination Event relates, the "Terminated
Property"). To exercise this option the Lessee shall deliver a written notice (a
"Termination Notice") to the Lessor and each Investor specifying a proposed date
of termination for such Property that is no earlier than thirty (30) days after
the date such Termination Notice is delivered (the "Termination Date"). Any such
termination shall be effective on the Termination Date upon the Lessee's
compliance with this Section 19.1; provided that:

            (A) in the case of a Termination Event described in clause (i), (1)
      the Lessee shall not have the right to exercise its Termination Option at
      any time prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Acquisition Date
      (except in the case of a Termination Option exercised pursuant to clause
      (y) of such clause (i), which may be exercised at any time), (2) the
      determination that the applicable Property qualifies for termination
      pursuant to clause (i) shall be made by the Lessee in good faith, and (3)
      the Termination Notice shall contain a certificate executed by the Chief
      Financial Officer of the Lessee certifying that the applicable Property
      qualifies for termination pursuant to clause (i) of this Section 19.1(a);

            (B) in the case of a Termination Event described in clause (ii), (1)
      the Lessee shall exercise its Termination Option with respect to all and
      not less than all of the Properties

                                      -23-

                                                                    Master Lease

      and (2) the determination that the Properties qualify for termination
      pursuant to clause (ii) shall be made jointly by the Lessor and Lessee in
      good faith; and

            (C) in the case of a Termination Event described in clause (iii),
      (1) the Lessee shall not have the right to exercise its Termination Option
      prior to the third (3rd) anniversary of the Acquisition Date and (2) the
      Termination Notice shall contain a certificate executed by the Chief
      Financial Officer of the Lessee certifying that such Property is intended
      to be held for sale.

The Lessee will reimburse the Lessor and each Investor for all Break Costs and
all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including reasonable legal fees
and expenses) incurred by any thereof in connection with such termination or
proposed termination. On the Termination Date, the Lessee shall pay or cause to
be paid to the Lessor (or in the case of Supplemental Rent, to the Persons
entitled thereto) in funds of the type specified in Section 3.4, an amount equal
to the sum of (x) the Termination Price of the Terminated Property (or, if the
applicable Termination Event is a Sale Termination Event, an amount equal to the
unamortized Termination Base Amount of the Terminated Property plus the
Termination Indemnity Amount for such Property on the applicable Termination
Date) plus (y) all accrued and unpaid Accrual Rent allocable to an amount of
Property Cost equal to the Termination Base Amount to be paid on such
Termination Date plus (z) without duplication, all Basic Rent and Supplemental
Rent (including Break Costs) then due and owing after giving effect to such
termination (including all Supplemental Rent that shall have been demanded
pursuant to Article XIII of the Participation Agreement), in each case
calculated as of the Termination Date, it being understood that until such sums
are paid, there shall be no abatement or reduction of Basic Rent on account of
the applicable Termination Event or otherwise. All payments received by the
Lessor from the Lessee pursuant to this Section 19.1 will be distributed and
applied by the Lessor in accordance with Article VII of the Participation
Agreement.

      (b) Transfer of Property. Upon the payment of all sums required to be paid
pursuant to Section 19.1(a) in respect of any Terminated Property or Terminated
Properties, the Lessor shall (x) in the case of Terminated Properties that are
Leased Properties, transfer the applicable Terminated Property or Terminated
Properties to the Lessee or its designee in accordance with the procedures set
forth in Section 21.1 or (y) in the case of any Terminated Property that is a
Mortgaged Property, comply with the procedures set forth in clause s(c) and (e)
of Section 21.1.

      (c) Termination of Lease. In the event of any such sale and receipt by the
Lessor of all of the amounts provided in Section 19.1(a) in respect of a
Terminated Property that is a Leased Property and upon compliance by the Lessee
with the other provisions of this Section 19.1, the obligation of Lessee to pay
Basic Rent hereunder for such Terminated Property shall cease and the Lease Term
for the Terminated Property shall end.

      Section 19.2. Replacement. Following the occurrence of any Termination
Event described in clause (i) or (iii) of Section 19.1(a), the Lessee shall have
the right at its option (the "Replacement Option") to replace the applicable
Terminated Property in accordance with this Section 19.2.

      (a) Requirements. To exercise the Replacement Option the Lessee shall
deliver a written notice (a "Replacement Notice") to the Lessor and each
Investor specifying a proposed date of replacement for such Property that is no
earlier than thirty (30) days after the date such Termination Notice is
delivered (the date of such replacement in accordance with Section 19.2(b)
below, the "Replacement Date"). The Lessee shall comply with the provisions of
clause (b) below applicable to such replacement and shall either (x) if the
applicable Terminated Property is a Leased Property, convey or cause to be
conveyed to the Lessor on the Replacement Date one or more replacement
Properties (each such Property, a "Replacement Property") for the applicable
Terminated Property or Terminated

Properties, with such Replacement Properties to be leased to the Lessee
hereunder from and after the Replacement Date or (y) if the applicable
Terminated Property is a Mortgaged Property, grant to the Lessor a Lien on a
Replacement Property pursuant to a Lessor Mortgage in form and substance
reasonably satisfactory to the Lessor; provided that, in each case, (1) the
determination that the applicable Property qualifies for replacement as a result
of satisfying the requirements of clause (i) or (iii) of Section 19.1(a) shall
be made by the Lessee in good faith and (2) the Replacement Notice shall contain
a certificate executed by the Chief Financial Officer of the Lessee certifying
that the applicable Property qualifies for replacement as a result of satisfying
the requirements of clause (i) or (iii) of Section 19.1(a); and provided,
further, that the following conditions are satisfied:

            (i) each Replacement Property shall be located in the continental
      United States,

            (ii) each Replacement Property shall be free and clear of all Liens
      (other than Permitted Property Liens);

            (iii) such Replacement Property or Replacement Properties shall have
      a Fair Market Sales Value, in the aggregate, at least equal to unamortized
      Termination Base Amount of the applicable Terminated Property;

            (iv) in no event shall such Replacement Property or Replacement
      Properties have a remaining economic useful life of less than fifteen (15)
      years;

            (v) there shall be no fewer than three (3) Properties subject to
      this Master Lease after giving effect to such replacement;

            (vi) each of the conditions set forth in Section 6.1 of the
      Participation Agreement shall have been satisfied (except that each
      reference to a Subject Property shall be deemed to refer to the
      Replacement Property and each reference to the Acquisition Date shall be
      deemed to refer to the applicable Replacement Date); and

            (vii) the representations and warranties of the Lessee set forth in
      Section 8.2 of the Participation Agreement shall be true and correct with
      respect to the Lessee and such Replacement Property on and as of the
      applicable Replacement Date.

      (b) Items to be delivered. Prior to any replacement of any Property and as
a condition to such replacement, the Lessee, at its own expense, will:

            (i) furnish to the Lessor each of the items set forth in Section 6.1
      of the Participation Agreement in each case with respect to the proposed

      hereto and dated as of the Replacement Date, subjecting such Replacement
      Property to this Lease and duly executed by the Lessee, to be delivered to

      Property, cause a Lessor Mortgage covering such Replacement Property and
      dated as of the Replacement Date and duly executed by the Lessee to be
      delivered to the Lessor),

            (iii) upon execution of the Lease Supplement described in clause
      (ii) by the Lessee and the Lessor (or, if the applicable Terminated
      Property is a Mortgaged Property, upon execution of the Lessor Mortgage
      described in clause (ii) by the Lessee), cause such Lease Supplement (or
      Lessor Mortgage) to be filed for recordation in the same manner as

      the original Lease Supplement (or original Lessor Mortgage, as the case
      may be) in the Participation Agreement,

            (iv) furnish to the Lessor a Responsible Officer's Certificate of
      the Lessee certifying that the Replacement Property is free and clear of
      all Liens (other than Permitted Property Liens), and

            (v) furnish such other documents and evidence as the Lessor, any
      Investor or their respective counsel may reasonably request in order to
      establish the consummation of the transactions contemplated by this
      Section 19.2.

For all purposes hereof, (i) the Replacement Date shall be deemed to occur on
the earliest date on which the Lessee shall have complied with all of the
requirements of this clause (b) with respect to a replacement made in accordance
with clause (a) above, (ii) title to each Replacement Property conveyed in
connection with a Terminated Property that is a Leased Property shall be deemed
to have been transferred to the Lessor as of the Replacement Date and (iii) (x)
in the case of a Terminated Property that is a Leased Property, upon such
passage of title thereto to the Lessor, and (y) in the case of a Terminated
Property that is a Mortgaged Property, upon the recordation of the applicable
Lessor Mortgage as required under Section 6.1(n) of the Participation Agreement,
the Replacement Property shall be deemed a "Property" for all purposes of the
Operative Documents and the original Property shall no longer be deemed to be a
"Property" for purposes of the Operative Documents and, in the case of a
Replacement Property for a Leased Property, the Replacement Property shall be
deemed part of the Properties leased hereunder.

      (c) Transfer or Release of Replaced Property. Upon (i) the passage of
title with respect to a Leased Property described in clause (b) above, the
Lessor will transfer to the Lessee all Lessor's right, title and interest in and
to the replaced Property or (ii) the recordation of a Lessor Mortgage with
respect to a Mortgaged Property described in clause (b) above, the Lessor will
release the Lessor Mortgage encumbering the replaced Property, in each case in
accordance with the procedures set forth in Section 21.1. The Lessee shall
promptly pay all reasonable out-of-pocket costs and expenses (including
reasonable legal fees and expenses) incurred by the Lessor, the Lessor
Administrator or any Investor in connection with any replacement pursuant to
this Section 19.2, provided that the Lessee shall be responsible for the legal
fees and expenses of only one set of lawyers for the Investors (in addition to
any local counsel reasonably required by the Lessor or any Investor) unless the
Investors and/or such counsel reasonably determines that such representation
could create a conflict of interest. The Lessee further agrees that, upon
receipt of fully signed counterparts of the Lease Supplement referred to in
clause (ii) of Section 19.2(b), it will, at its sole cost and expense, cause
such documents to be filed or recorded in the manner contemplated by Section
6.1(n) of the Participation Agreement.

      and (ix) of the definition thereof) shall have been removed.

            (d) Not later than sixty (60) days prior to the Expiration Date, the
      Lessee shall have cured or caused to be cured all Environmental Violations
      affecting any Property and if ISRA is applicable, provide proof that it is

                                  ARTICLE XXV

                              INTENT OF THE PARTIES

      Section 25.1. Ownership of the Property. (a) The parties hereto intend
that for (i) financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, (ii)
United States federal and all United States state and local income tax purposes
and (iii) United States state real estate and commercial law and bankruptcy
purposes,

            (A) the Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement,

            (B) the Lessor will be deemed a lender making a loan to the Lessee
      in an aggregate amount equal to the Aggregate Original Property Cost which
      loan is secured by the Properties, and

            (C) the Lessee will be treated as the owner of the Leased Properties
      described in the Lease Supplements and will be entitled to all tax
      benefits ordinarily available to an owner of properties similar to the
      Properties for such tax purposes.

Specifically, without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the parties
hereto intend and agree that in the event of any insolvency or receivership
proceedings or a petition under the United States bankruptcy laws or any other
applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United States of America or any
state or commonwealth thereof affecting the Lessee, the Lessor or the Investors
or any collection actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative Documents
shall be regarded as loans made to the Lessee by the Lessor and the Investors as
unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee. Nevertheless, the Lessee
acknowledges and agrees that none of the Lessor, the Arranger or any Investor
has made any representations or warranties to the Lessee concerning the tax,
accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative Documents and that the
Lessee has obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting and legal advice
concerning the Operative Documents as it deems appropriate. The parties hereto
will not take any position inconsistent with the intentions expressed herein.

      (b) It is the intent of the parties hereto that this Lease grants a
security interest and mortgage or deed to secure debt or deed of trust, as the
case may be, in and on each Property to the Lessor for the benefit of the Lessor
to secure the performance of the Lessee under and payment of all amounts under
this Master Lease and the other Operative Documents all as more specifically set
forth in each Lease Supplement.

      (c) Tax Ownership. The Lessor represents and warrants to the Lessee that
it will not, prior to the termination of the Lease with respect to a Property,
claim ownership of (or any tax benefits, including depreciation, with respect
to) such Property for any United States income tax purposes (unless required to
do so by a Governmental Authority), it being understood that the Lessee is and
will remain the owner of such Property for such United States income tax
purposes until the termination of the Lease with respect thereto.

Lessee to insist upon the strict performance of any term hereof or to exercise

or partial payment of Rent during the continuance of any such default, shall
constitute a waiver of any such default or of any such term. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, no waiver of any default shall affect or alter this
Master Lease, and this Master Lease shall continue in full force and effect with
respect to any other then existing or subsequent default.

      Section 26.4. Notices. All notices, demands, requests, consents, approvals
and other communications hereunder shall be in writing and directed to the
address described in, and deemed received in accordance with the provisions of,

      Section 26.5. Successors and Assigns. All the terms and provisions of this
Master Lease shall inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and their

the prior written consent of the Lessor (and any attempted assignment or
transfer by the Lessee without such consent shall be null and void).

contents in this Master Lease are for convenience of reference only and shall
not limit or otherwise affect the meaning hereof.

CONSTRUED AND INTERPRETED IN ACCORDANCE WITH, THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK

Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction, no security interest in this
Master Lease may be created through the transfer or possession of any

obligations under this Master Lease, time is of the essence, and the Lessee
hereby acknowledges and confirms the foregoing.

Agreement.

                  the Land more particularly described on Schedule I attached
                  hereto.

            (e)   The Lessor/Mortgagee acquired title to the Land by deed dated
                  on or about the date hereof and about to be recorded or filed

            (f)   The term of the Master Lease shall commence on the date hereof
                  and shall expire on December 17, 2014 unless earlier

                                     - 2 -

      B.    Ownership of the Subject Property. The parties hereto intend that
for (i) financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee/Mortgagor, (ii)
United States federal and all United States state and local income tax purposes
and (iii) United States state real estate and commercial law and bankruptcy
purposes, (1) the Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement, (2) the
Lessor/Mortgagee will be deemed a lender making a loan to the Lessee/Mortgagor
in an aggregate amount equal to the Original Aggregate Property Cost which loan
is secured by the Properties, and (3) the Lessee/Mortgagor will be treated as
the owner of the Properties described in the Lease Supplements and will be
entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of properties
similar to the Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the
Lessee/Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that none of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
Arranger or any Investor has made any representations or warranties to the
Lessee/Mortgagor concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the
Operative Documents and that the Lessee/Mortgagor has obtained and relied upon
such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it
deems appropriate. The parties hereto will not take any position inconsistent
with the intentions expressed herein. It is the intent of the parties hereto
that this Lease grants a security interest and mortgage or deed to secure debt
or deed of trust, as the case may be, in and on each Property to the
Lessor/Mortgagee for the benefit of the Lessor/Mortgagee to secure the
performance of the Lessee/Mortgagor under and payment of all amounts under this
Master Lease and the other Operative Documents all as more specifically set
forth in each Lease Supplement. Specifically, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the event of any
insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the
Lessee/Mortgagor, the Lessor/Mortgagee or the Investors or any collection
actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative Documents shall be regarded
as loans made to the Lessee/Mortgagor by the Lessor/Mortgagee and the Investors
as unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee/Mortgagor.

      C.    Grant of Mortgage Lien and Security Interest: Assignment of Rents.
To secure to the Lessor/Mortgagee the payment and performance of all
Obligations:

            (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder), the Lessee/Mortgagor has caused the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to hold title to the Subject Property and
                  Lessee/Mortgagor does hereby mortgage, grant, bargain, sell,
                  convey, assign, transfer and set over to the Lessor/Mortgagee,
                  with power of sale, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
                  (i) all of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest

                  interest under the Master Lease; all condemnation and
                  insurance proceeds relative to the Subject Property and all
                  Profits as defined below; and (ii) all of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to all
                  proceeds of the conversion, whether voluntary or involuntary,
                  of any of the above-described property into cash or other
                  liquid claims, including, without limitation, all awards,
                  payments or proceeds, including interest thereon, and the
                  right to receive the same,

                  right of eminent domain or deed in lieu thereof, the
                  alteration of the grade of any street and any injury to or

                  successors and assigns forever.

                  (i)   Protective Advances. The Lessor/Mortgagee shall have the
                        right, but not the obligation, to make protective

                        payment of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums or
                        costs incurred for the protection of the Security
                        Property, and such protective advances, together with
                        interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date of
                        each such advance until it is repaid in full, shall be
                        secured by this Supplement to the fullest extent and
                        with the highest priority contemplated by applicable
                        law.

                  (ii)  Mortgage. The Lessee/Mortgagor and the Lessor/Mortgagee
                        intend that this Supplement shall secure
                        Lessee/Mortgagor's obligation to repay the unpaid
                        balance of advances made by the Lessor/Mortgagee and/or
                        the holder hereof under the Master Lease and other

                        all of which are also secured by this Supplement, which

            (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder so long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred
                  and is continuing), the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby grants to the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee a security interest in the Lessee/Mortgagor's
                  interest in that portion of the Security Property (the "UCC
                  Property") subject to the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
                  of Indiana (the "UCC"). The Master Lease, as supplemented by
                  this Supplement, shall also be deemed to be a security
                  agreement and shall support any financing statement

                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

                  showing the Lessor/Mortgagee's interest as a secured party
                  with respect to any portion of the UCC Property described in
                  such financing statement. The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees, at its
                  sole cost and expense, to execute, deliver and file from time
                  to time such further instruments as may be requested by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the lien of the
                  security interest in the collateral described in this
                  Supplement.

            (c)   The Lessee/Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys,
                  transfers and sets over unto the Lessor/Mortgagee (subject,
                  however, to the Master Lease and the rights of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor thereunder and hereunder) any and all
                  subleases or other occupancy agreements now existing, or that
                  may hereafter come into existence with respect to the Subject
                  Property or any part thereof, including any guaranties of such
                  sublease or occupancy agreements (collectively, the
                  "Subleases") and all and every part of the rents, issues and
                  profits (collectively, the "Profits") that may from time to
                  time become due and payable on account of the Subleases,
                  provided, that, unless a Lease Event of Default is continuing,
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor shall have the right to collect and
                  retain such Profits. Upon request of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be recorded, at
                  its expense, supplemental or additional assignments of any
                  Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and empowered in
                  its discretion (in addition to all other powers and rights
                  herein granted), to apply for and collect and receive all such
                  Profits and enforce such guaranty or guaranties, and all money
                  so received under and by virtue of this assignment shall be
                  applied as further security for the payment and performance of
                  the Obligations secured hereby.

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Supplement is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Lessor/Mortgagee grants to
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
                  receive the Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits.
                  Such license shall be automatically revoked upon the
                  occurrence and during the continuance of any Lease Event of
                  Default.

                  one or more of the following rights and remedies as it, in its

                        Lessor/Mortgagee may determine. The entering upon and
                        taking possession of the Security Property, and the
                        collection of such Profits and the application thereof

                        Lessee/Mortgagor or anyone under the Lessee/Mortgagor
                        and without regard to the adequacy of its security or

                        of the Lessee/Mortgagor therein, apply to any court
                        having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers
                        of the Security Property and the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby
                        irrevocably consents to such appointment and, to the
                        extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives notice of any
                        application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers
                        shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers
                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee provided for above, and shall continue
                        as a receiver and exercise all such powers until the
                        date of confirmation of sale of the Security Property
                        unless such receivership is sooner terminated by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee in its sole discretion.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled to
                  enforce payment and performance of any Obligations secured
                  hereby and to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any
                  laws now or hereafter in force notwithstanding that some or
                  all of said Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be
                  otherwise secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge,
                  lien, assignment or otherwise. Neither the acceptance nor the
                  enforcement hereof, whether by court action or pursuant to the
                  power of sale or other powers herein contained, shall
                  prejudice or in any manner affect the Lessor/Mortgagee's right
                  to realize upon or enforce any other security now or hereafter
                  held by the Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee shall
                  be entitled to enforce the rights and remedies provided for
                  herein and any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in its
                  absolute discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or
                  reserved to the Lessor/Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive
                  of any other remedy, but each shall be cumulative and shall be
                  in addition to every other remedy given hereby or now or
                  hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Every
                  power or remedy given hereby to the Lessor/Mortgagee or to
                  which the Lessor/Mortgagee may be otherwise entitled, may be
                  exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time
                  and as often as may be deemed expedient by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee may pursue
                  inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee, in addition to and not
                  in lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies
                  provided above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a
                  secured party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

            (c)   It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease
                  be treated as a secured borrowing as provided in Section 3B
                  above, and that, upon the occurrence and during the
                  continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee
                  shall have remedies provided for herein. In the event that,
                  notwithstanding the intention of the parties, a court of
                  competent jurisdiction determines that, for the purpose of
                  remedies, the transaction contemplated by the Master Lease
                  constitutes a leasing arrangement, the parties hereto
                  acknowledge and agree that the Lessor/Mortgagee shall have, as
                  a result of such determination, in addition to the remedies
                  set forth in this Section 3D(a) above, all of the rights and
                  remedies of a landlord provided for in Article XVI of the
                  Master Lease, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and
                  agree that it is their intent that the Master Lease be
                  construed as provided in Section 3B above.

      SECTION 4. Lessor/Mortgagee Grant. (a) The Lessor/Mortgagee hereby
unconditionally grants a security interest in and a Lien to the Lessee/Mortgagor
against all of the Lessor/Mortgagee's right, title and interest in and to the
Security Property, which Lien shall be effective only if the Lessor/Mortgagee
shall become the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding and
such proceeding shall result in the rejection of the Master Lease. Such Lien
shall secure the satisfaction of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right to damages and
other claims arising out of the rejection of the Master Lease to the extent and
in the manner provided for pursuant to the Operative Documents.

      (b) The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees that the conditional Lien created in
paragraph (a) of this Section 4 will terminate upon the termination of the
Master Lease with respect to the Subject Property for any reason other than a
rejection of the Master Lease in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceeding with respect to the Lessor/Mortgagee. Lessee/Mortgagor
covenants to promptly deliver any releases or reconveyances reasonably required
by Lessor/Mortgagee to evidence such termination of Lien.

      (c) The Lien created in paragraph (a) of this Section 4 is junior and
subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted by the Lessee/Mortgagor in
favor of the Lessor/Mortgagee pursuant to this Supplement and the other
Operative Documents.

      SECTION 5. Ratification; Incorporation. Except as specifically modified
hereby, the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are hereby ratified and
confirmed and remain in full force and effect. The terms of the Master Lease (as
amended by this Supplement) are by this reference incorporated herein and made a
part hereof.

      SECTION 6. Original Supplement. The single executed original of this
Supplement marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the
signature page thereof and containing the receipt of the Lessor/Mortgagee
therefor on or following the signature page thereof shall be the original
executed counterpart of this Supplement (the "Original Executed Counterpart").
To the extent that this Supplement constitutes chattel paper, as such term is
defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable
jurisdiction, no security interest in this Supplement may be created through the
transfer or possession of any counterpart other than the Original Executed
Counterpart.

      SECTION 7. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Supplement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdictions identified in this Section 7 (the "Applicable Law") which shall
for most purposes be the laws of the State of New York; provided, however, that
the provisions of this Supplement relating to the creation, perfection and
enforcement of the lien and security interest created by this Supplement in
respect of the Subject Property and the exercise of each remedy provided hereby,
including the power of foreclosure or power of sale procedures set forth in this
Supplement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
law of the State of Indiana, and each of the Lessor/Mortgagee and the
Lessee/Mortgagor agree to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any
suit on this Supplement in the State of Indiana. The terms and provisions set
forth in Schedule III attached hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as
though fully set forth herein. In the event of any conflict between the terms
and provisions contained in the body of the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) and the terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III, the terms
and provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 8. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master
Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or of the leasehold estate created thereby
by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, (a) the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) or the leasehold estate created thereby or any interest in the
Master Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or such leasehold estate, (b) the
fee estate or ground leasehold estate in the Subject Property, except as may
expressly be stated in a written instrument duly executed and delivered by the
Lessor/Mortgagee.

      SECTION 9. Satisfaction of the Mortgage, Security Interest and Assignment
of Rents and Subleases. If the Lessee/Mortgagor complies with the provisions of
this Supplement and irrevocably pays and performs (to the reasonable
satisfaction of Lessor/Mortgagee) all of the Obligations secured hereby, in
accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease, as supplemented by this
Supplement and the other Operative Documents and in the manner and at the times
set forth therein, without deduction, fraud or delay, then and from thenceforth
this Supplement and the estate hereby granted and created in favor of the
Lessor/Mortgagee, shall cease and become void, anything hereinbefore contained
to the contrary notwithstanding.

      SECTION 10. Maximum Interest Rate. No provision of this Supplement or any
transaction related thereto shall require the payment or permit the collection
of interest or any other amount in excess of the maximum permitted by Applicable
Law. If any excess of interest or any other amount in such respect is herein or
any other Operative Document provided for, the Lessee/Mortgagor shall not be
obligated to pay such excess interest or any other amounts in excess of the
amount permitted by applicable law, and the right to demand the payment of any
such excess shall be and hereby is waived, and this provision shall control any
other provision of this Supplement and the other Operative Documents.

      SECTION 11. Security Agreement and Fixture Financing Statement. This
Supplement is both a real property mortgage and a "security agreement" within
the meaning of the UCC. The Subject Property includes both real and personal
property and all other rights and interests, whether tangible or intangible in
nature, of Lessee/Mortgagor in the Subject Property. In Section 3.C (b) above,
Lessee/Mortgagor has granted to Lessor/Mortgagee, as security for the
Obligations, a security interest in the UCC Property to the full extent that the
UCC Property may

                                     - 9 -
<PAGE>

be subject to the UCC. The information contained in this Section 11 is provided
in order that this Supplement shall comply with the requirements of the UCC for
mortgages to be effective as financing statement filed as a fixture filing. The
name of the "debtor" is ITT INDUSTRIES, INC.; the name of the "secured party" is
REXUS L.L.C.; the mailing address of the "secured party" from which information
concerning the security interest may be obtained and the mailing address of the
"debtor" are as set forth in Section 12 of this Supplement. The types, or the
items, of collateral covered hereby consist of the UCC Property identified in
Section 3.C which constitute fixtures or personal property. The Lessor/Mortgagee
is the record owner of the Land.

      SECTION 12. Notices. For purposes of this instrument all notices shall be
in writing and must be given in the manner provided in Section 14.3 of the
Participation Agreement to the addresses set forth in Schedule V hereto.

      SECTION 13. Counterpart Execution. This Supplement may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, all such counterparts together constituting but one and the same
instrument.

                        Master Lease. The maximum amount of the Obligations
                        secured by this Mortgage, exclusive of interest thereon
                        (whether or not identified as interest and including

                        DOLLARS ($5,000,000).

            (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease, as
                  supplemented by the Related Lease Supplement (including,
                  without limitation, the Mortgagor's rights thereunder so long
                  as no Lease Event of Default has occurred and is continuing),
                  the Mortgagor hereby grants to the Mortgagee a security
                  interest in the Mortgagor's interest in that portion of the
                  Security Property (the "UCC Property") subject to the Uniform
                  Commercial Code of the State of New York (the "UCC"). This
                  Mortgage shall also be deemed to be a security agreement and
                  shall support any financing statement showing the Mortgagee's
                  interest as a secured party with respect to any portion of the
                  UCC Property described in such financing statement. The
                  Mortgagor agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to execute,
                  deliver and file from time to time such further instruments as
                  may be requested by the Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the
                  lien of the security interest in the collateral described in
                  this Mortgage.

            (c)   The Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys, transfers
                  and sets over unto the Mortgagee (subject, however, to the
                  Master Lease, as supplemented by the Related Lease Supplement,
                  and the rights of the Mortgagor thereunder) all and every part
                  of the rents, issues and profits (collectively, the "Profits")
                  that may from time to time become due and payable on account
                  of any and all subleases or other occupancy agreements now
                  existing, or that may hereafter come into existence with
                  respect to the Subject Property or any part thereof, including
                  any guaranties of such sublease or occupancy agreements
                  (collectively, the "Subleases") provided, that, unless a Lease
                  Event of Default is continuing, the Mortgagor shall have the
                  right to collect and retain such Profits. Upon request of the
                  Mortgagee, the Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be
                  recorded, at its expense, supplemental or additional
                  assignments of any Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the
                  occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease Event of
                  Default, the Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and
                  empowered in its discretion (in addition to all other powers
                  and rights herein granted), to apply for and collect and
                  receive all such Profits and enforce such guaranty or
                  guaranties, and all money so received under and by virtue of
                  this assignment shall be applied as further security for the
                  payment and performance of the Obligations secured hereby.

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Mortgage is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in,
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Mortgagee grants to the
                  Mortgagor a revocable license to enforce all of its rights and
                  remedies under the Subleases, to collect and receive the
                  Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits. Such
                  license shall be automatically revoked upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of any Lease Event of Default.

      SECTION 2. Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of

                        any action or proceeding, or by a receiver appointed by
                        a court, and without regard to the adequacy of security,
                        enter upon and take possession of the Security Property,
                        or any part thereof, in its own name, and do any acts
                        which it deems necessary or desirable to preserve the
                        value, marketability or rentability of the Security
                        Property, or any part thereof or interest therein, to
                        increase the income therefrom or to protect the security
                        hereof and, with or without taking possession of the
                        Security Property, to sue for or otherwise to collect
                        the Profits thereof, including, without limitation,
                        those past due and unpaid, and to apply the same, less
                        costs and expenses of operation and collection,
                        including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys'
                        fees, upon any Obligations secured hereby, all in such
                        order as the Mortgagee may determine. The entering upon
                        and taking possession of the Security Property, and the
                        collection of such Profits and the application thereof
                        as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Lease Event of
                        Default or notice of a Lease Event of Default hereunder
                        or invalidate any act done in response to such Lease
                        Event of Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in
                        possession of the Mortgagee or the collection, receipt
                        and application of Profits by the Mortgagee, the
                        Mortgagee shall be entitled to exercise every right
                        provided for herein or by law upon the occurrence and
                        during the continuance of any Lease Event of Default,
                        including, without limitation, to the extent permitted
                        by Applicable Law, the right to exercise the power of
                        sale;

                  (iii) to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, utilize the
                        procedures set forth in Article 14 of the New York Real

                        non-judicial foreclosure by power of sale. To the extent
                        permitted by Applicable Law, Mortgagor waives any right
                        granted pursuant to Section 1421 or

                        Applicable Law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real

                  (v)   declare immediately due and payable without notice or
                        demand, except as otherwise required hereunder or under
                        Applicable Law, all amounts payable by the Mortgagor
                        hereunder or under the other Operative Documents which
                        are then unpaid, with all interest and sums accrued and
                        accelerate payment thereof notwithstanding contrary
                        terms of payment stated therein and exercise all other
                        rights and remedies available hereunder, under
                        Applicable Law, in equity or otherwise;

                  (vi)  in any action to foreclose this Mortgage, and upon
                        notice to the Mortgagor or anyone under the Mortgagor
                        and without regard to the adequacy of its security or
                        the then value of the Security Property or the interest
                        of the Mortgagor therein, apply to any court having
                        jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers of the
                        Security Property and the Mortgagor hereby irrevocably
                        consents to such appointment and, to the extent
                        permitted by Applicable Law, waives notice of any
                        application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers
                        shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers
                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Mortgagee provided for in Section D(a)(ii) above, to the
                        extent permitted by Applicable Law, and shall continue
                        as a receiver and exercise all such powers until the
                        date of confirmation of sale of the Security Property
                        unless such receivership is sooner terminated by the
                        Mortgagee in its sole discretion or as a court of
                        competent jurisdiction shall direct.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall be entitled to enforce
                  payment and performance of any Obligations secured hereby and
                  to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any laws now or
                  hereafter in force notwithstanding that some or all of said
                  Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise
                  secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien,
                  assignment or otherwise. To the extent permitted by Applicable
                  Law, neither the acceptance nor the enforcement hereof,
                  whether by court action or pursuant to the power of sale or
                  other powers herein contained, shall prejudice or in any
                  manner affect the Mortgagee's right to realize upon or enforce
                  any other security now or hereafter held by the Mortgagee;
                  and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the Mortgagee
                  shall be entitled to enforce the rights and remedies provided
                  for

                                     - 5 -
<PAGE>

                  herein and any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in its absolute
                  discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or reserved to
                  the Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive of any other remedy,
                  but each shall be cumulative and shall be in addition to every
                  other remedy given hereby or now or hereafter existing at law
                  or in equity or by statute. To the extent permitted by
                  Applicable Law, every power or remedy given hereby to the
                  Mortgagee or to which the Mortgagee may be otherwise entitled,
                  may be exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to
                  time and as often as may be deemed expedient by the Mortgagee,
                  and the Mortgagee may pursue inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Mortgagee, in addition to and not in
                  lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies provided
                  above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured
                  party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

            (c)   It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease
                  be treated as a secured borrowing as provided in Section 1,
                  and that, upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a
                  Lease Event of Default, the Mortgagee shall have remedies
                  provided for herein. In the event that, notwithstanding the
                  intention of the parties, a court of competent jurisdiction
                  determines that, for the purpose of remedies, the transaction
                  contemplated by the Master Lease constitutes a leasing
                  arrangement, the parties hereto acknowledge and agree that the
                  Mortgagee shall have, as a result of such determination, in
                  addition to the remedies set forth in this Section 2, all of
                  the rights and remedies of a landlord provided for in Article
                  XVI of the Master Lease, provided that the parties hereto
                  acknowledge and agree that it is their intent that the Master
                  Lease be construed as provided in Section 1.

      SECTION 3. Mortgagee Grant. (a) The Mortgagee hereby conditionally grants
a Lien to the Mortgagor against all of the Mortgagee's right, title and interest
in and to the Security Property, which Lien shall be effective only if the
Mortgagee shall become the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar
proceeding and such proceeding shall result in the rejection of the Master
Lease. Such Lien shall secure the satisfaction of the Mortgagor's right to
damages and other claims arising out of the rejection of the Master Lease to the
extent and in the manner provided for pursuant to the Operative Documents.

      (b) The Mortgagor agrees that the conditional Lien created in paragraph
(a) of this Section will terminate upon the termination of the Master Lease with
respect to the Subject Property for any reason other than a rejection of the
Master Lease in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding
with respect to the Mortgagee. Mortgagor covenants to promptly deliver any
releases or reconveyances reasonably required by Mortgagee to evidence such
termination of Lien.

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

      (c) The Lien created in paragraph (a) of this Section is junior and
subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted by the Mortgagor in favor of
the Mortgagee pursuant to this Mortgage and the other Operative Documents.

      SECTION 4. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Mortgage
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York ("Applicable Law"); and each of the Mortgagee and the Mortgagor agree
to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any suit on this Mortgage
in such state. The terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III attached
hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. In
the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions contained in this
Mortgage and the terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III, the terms and
provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 5. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master
Lease (as amended by the Related Lease Supplement) or of the leasehold estate
created thereby by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or
hold, directly or indirectly, in whole or in part, (a) the Master Lease (as
amended by the Related Lease Supplement) or the leasehold estate created thereby
or any interest in the Master Lease (as amended by the Related Lease Supplement)
or such leasehold estate, or (b) the fee estate or ground leasehold estate in
the Subject Property, except as may expressly be stated in a written instrument
duly executed and delivered by the Mortgagee.

      SECTION 6. Satisfaction of the Mortgage, Security Interest and Assignment
of Rents and Subleases. If the Mortgagor complies with the provisions of this
Mortgage and irrevocably pays and performs all of the Obligations secured
hereby, in accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease, as supplemented
by the Related Lease Supplement, and the other Operative Documents and in the
manner and at the times set forth therein, without deduction, fraud or delay,
then and from thenceforth this Mortgage and the estate hereby granted and
created in favor of the Mortgagee, shall cease and become void, anything
hereinbefore contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

      SECTION 7. Maximum Interest Rate. No provision of this Mortgage or any
transaction related thereto shall require the payment or permit the collection
of interest or any other amount in excess of the maximum permitted by Applicable
Law. If any excess of interest or any other amount in such respect is herein or
any other Operative Document provided for, the Mortgagor shall not be obligated
to pay such excess interest or any other amounts in excess of the amount
permitted by applicable law, and the right to demand the payment of any such
excess shall be and hereby is waived, and this provision shall control any other
provision of this Mortgage and the other Operative Documents.

      SECTION 8. Security Agreement and Fixture Financing Statement. This
Mortgage is both a real property mortgage and a "security agreement" within the
meaning of the UCC. The Subject Property includes both real and personal
property and all other rights and interests, whether tangible or intangible in
nature, of Mortgagee in the Subject Property. In Section 1(b), Mortgagor has
granted to Mortgagee, as security for the Obligations, a security interest in
the UCC Property to the full extent that the UCC Property may be subject to the
UCC. The information contained in this Section 9 is provided in order that this
Mortgage shall comply with

                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>

the requirements of the UCC for mortgages to be effective as financing statement
filed as a fixture filing. The name of the "debtor" is ITT INDUSTRIES, INC.; the
name of the "secured party" is REXUS L.L.C.; the mailing address of the "secured
party" from which information concerning the security interest may be obtained
and the mailing address of the "debtor" are as set forth in the first paragraph
herein. The types, or the items, of collateral covered hereby consist of the UCC
Property identified in Section 1 which constitute fixtures or personal property.
The Mortgagee is the record owner of the Land.

      SECTION 9. Notices. For purposes of this instrument as a fixture filing,
and for all other purposes, unless otherwise specifically provided herein, all
notices, offers, acceptances, rejections, consents, requests, demands or other
communications to or upon the respective parties hereto shall be in writing and
shall be deemed to have been given as set forth in Section 26.4 of the Master
Lease.

      SECTION 10. Counterpart Execution. This Mortgage may be executed in any
number of counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, all such counterparts together constituting but one and the same
instrument.

            (f)   The term of the Master Lease shall commence on the date hereof
                  and shall expire on December 17, 2014 unless earlier

                  during the Lease Term pursuant to which the Lessee or its

            (h)   In addition to those terms referred to herein, the Master
                  Lease contains numerous other terms, covenants and conditions

                  that reference should be had to the Master Lease with respect
                  to the details of such terms, covenants and conditions. A copy
                  of the Master Lease or of the other agreements referenced
                  herein or therein may be obtained from any of the parties

      B. Ownership of the Subject Property. The parties hereto intend that for
(i) financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee, (ii) United States
federal and all United States state and local income tax purposes and (iii)
United States state real estate and commercial law and bankruptcy purposes, (1)
the Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement, (2) the Lessor will be
deemed a lender making a loan to the Lessee in an aggregate amount equal to the
Original Aggregate Property Cost which loan is secured by the Properties, and
(3) the Lessee will be treated as the owner of the Properties described in the
Lease Supplements and will be entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available
to an owner of properties similar to the Properties for such tax purposes.
Nevertheless, the Lessee acknowledges and agrees that none of the Lessor, the
Arranger or any Investor has made any representations or warranties to the
Lessee concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the Operative
Documents and that the Lessee has obtained and relied upon such tax, accounting
and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it deems appropriate. The
parties hereto will not take any position inconsistent with the intentions
expressed herein. It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease,
as supplemented by the Lease Supplements, grants a security interest and
mortgage or deed to secure debt or deed of trust, as the case may be, in and on
each Property to the Lessor for the benefit of the Lessor to secure the
performance of the Lessee under and payment of all amounts under this Master
Lease and the other Operative Documents all as more specifically set forth in
each Lease Supplement. Specifically, without limiting the generality of the
foregoing, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the event of any
insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the Lessee, the
Lessor or the Investors or any collection actions, the transactions evidenced by
the Operative Documents shall be regarded as loans made to the Lessee by the
Lessor and the Investors as unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee.

      SECTION 4. Ratification; Incorporation. Except as specifically modified
hereby, the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are hereby ratified and
confirmed and remain in full force and effect. The terms of the Master Lease (as
amended by this Supplement) are by this reference incorporated herein and made a
part hereof.

Supplement marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the
signature page thereof and containing the receipt of the Lessor therefor on or
following the signature page thereof shall be the original executed counterpart
of this Supplement (the "Original Executed Counterpart"). To the extent that
this Supplement constitutes chattel paper, as such term is defined in the
Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable jurisdiction, no security
interest in this Supplement may be created through the transfer or possession of
any counterpart other than the Original Executed Counterpart.

      SECTION 6. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Supplement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New York.

      SECTION 7. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master
Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or of the leasehold estate created thereby
by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, (a) the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) or the leasehold estate created thereby or any interest in the
Master Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or such leasehold estate, (b) the
fee estate or ground leasehold estate in the Subject Property, except as may
expressly be stated in a written instrument duly executed and delivered by the
Lessor.

consents, requests, demands or other communications to or upon the respective
parties hereto shall be in writing and shall be deemed to have been given as set
forth in Section 26.4 of the Master Lease.

insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the
Lessee/Mortgagor, the Lessor/Mortgagee or the Investors or any collection
actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative Documents shall be regarded

                  (i)   Protective Advances. The Lessor/Mortgagee shall have the
                        right, but not the obligation, to make protective
                        advances with respect to the Security Property for the
                        payment of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums or
                        costs incurred for the protection of the Security
                        Property, and such protective advances, together with
                        interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date of
                        each such advance until it is repaid in full, shall be
                        secured by this Supplement to the fullest extent and
                        with the highest priority contemplated by applicable
                        law.

                  (ii)  Mortgage. The Lessee/Mortgagor and the Lessor/Mortgagee
                        intend that this Supplement shall secure
                        Lessee/Mortgagor's obligation to repay the unpaid
                        balance of advances made by the Lessor/Mortgagee and/or
                        the holder hereof under the Master Lease and other
                        Operative Documents to the fullest extent and with the
                        highest priority contemplated by applicable law. The
                        obligations secured hereby shall include, without
                        limitation, all Basic Rent, Accrual Rent and Fixed Rent
                        as well as all Supplemental Rent due from

                        all of which are also secured by this Supplement, which
                        may be outstanding at any time is One Hundred Twenty
                        Million and 00/100 Dollars ($120,000,000.00).

            (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder so long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred
                  and is continuing), the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby grants to the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee a security interest in the Lessee/Mortgagor's
                  interest in that portion of the Security Property (the "UCC
                  Property") subject to the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
                  of Colorado (the "UCC"). The Master Lease, as supplemented by
                  this Supplement, shall also be deemed to be a security
                  agreement and shall support any financing statement showing
                  the Lessor/Mortgagee's interest as a secured party with
                  respect to any portion of the UCC Property described in such
                  financing statement. The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees, at its sole
                  cost and expense, to execute, deliver and file from time to
                  time such further instruments as may be requested by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the lien of the
                  security interest in the collateral described in this
                  Supplement.

            (c)   The Lessee/Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys,
                  transfers and sets over unto the Lessor/Mortgagee (subject,
                  however, to the Master Lease and the rights of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor thereunder and hereunder) any and all
                  subleases or other occupancy agreements now existing, or that
                  may hereafter come into existence with respect to the Subject
                  Property or any part thereof, including any guaranties of such
                  sublease or occupancy agreements (collectively, the
                  "Subleases") and all and every part of the rents, issues and
                  profits (collectively, the "Profits") that may from time to
                  time become due and payable on account of the Subleases,
                  provided, that, unless a Lease Event of Default is continuing,
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor shall have the right to collect and
                  retain such Profits. Upon request of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be recorded, at
                  its expense, supplemental or additional assignments of any
                  Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and empowered in
                  its discretion (in addition to all other powers and rights
                  herein granted), to apply for and collect and receive all such
                  Profits and enforce such guaranty or guaranties, and all money
                  so received under and by virtue of this assignment shall be
                  applied as further security for the payment and performance of
                  the Obligations secured hereby.

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Supplement is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Lessor/Mortgagee grants to
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
                  receive the Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits.
                  Such license shall be automatically revoked upon the
                  occurrence and during the continuance of any Lease Event of
                  Default.

D.    Remedies.

            (a)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, each of which are also events of default
                  under this Supplement, the Lessor/Mortgagee may exercise any
                  one or more of the following rights and remedies as it, in its
                  sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate:

                  (i)   collect interest on all past due sums at the Overdue
                        Rate;

                  (ii)  terminate the Master Lease and, either in person or by
                        agent, with or without bringing any action or
                        proceeding, or by a receiver appointed by a court, and
                        without regard to the adequacy of security, enter upon
                        and take possession of the Security Property, or any
                        part thereof, in its own name, and do any acts which it
                        deems necessary or desirable to preserve the value,
                        marketability or rentability of the Security Property,
                        or any part thereof or interest therein, to increase the
                        income therefrom or to protect the security hereof and,
                        with or without taking possession of the Security
                        Property, to sue for or otherwise to collect the Profits
                        thereof, including, without limitation, those past due
                        and unpaid, and to apply the same, less costs and
                        expenses of operation and collection, including, without
                        limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, upon any
                        Obligations secured hereby, all in such order as the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee may determine. The entering upon and
                        taking possession of the Security Property, and the
                        collection of such Profits and the application thereof
                        as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Lease Event of
                        Default or notice of a Lease Event of Default hereunder
                        or invalidate any act done in response to such Lease
                        Event of Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in
                        possession of the Lessor/Mortgagee or the collection,
                        receipt and application of Profits by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled
                        to exercise every right provided for herein or by law
                        upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
                        Lease Event of Default, including, without limitation,
                        the right to exercise the power of sale;

                  (iii) declare all sums secured hereby immediately due and
                        payable by delivery to the Lessee/Mortgagor a written
                        declaration of the occurrence and continuance of a Lease
                        Event of Default and deliver a notice of non-judicial
                        foreclosure by power of sale of the Subject Property,
                        and proceed with such non-judicial foreclosure in
                        accordance with Applicable Law;

                  (iv)  in lieu of sale pursuant to the power of sale conferred
                        hereby, foreclose in the manner provided by Applicable
                        Law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property;

<PAGE>

                  (v)   whether or not a non-judicial or judicial foreclosure
                        proceeding as described above has been commenced,
                        declare immediately due and payable without notice or
                        demand, as otherwise required hereunder or under
                        Applicable Law, all amounts payable by the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor hereunder or under the other Operative
                        Documents which are then unpaid, with all interest and
                        sums accrued and accelerate payment thereof
                        notwithstanding contrary terms of payment stated therein

                        hereunder, at law, in equity or otherwise;

                  (vi)  as a matter of right, and upon notice to the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor or anyone under the Lessee/Mortgagor
                        and without regard to the adequacy of its security or
                        the then value of the Security Property or the interest
                        of the Lessee/Mortgagor therein, apply to any court
                        having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers
                        of the Security Property and the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby
                        irrevocably consents to such appointment and, to the
                        extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives notice of any
                        application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers
                        shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers
                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee provided for above, and shall continue
                        as a receiver and exercise all such powers until the
                        date of confirmation of sale of the Security Property
                        unless such receivership is sooner terminated by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee in its sole discretion.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled to
                  enforce payment and performance of any Obligations secured
                  hereby and to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any
                  laws now or hereafter in force notwithstanding that some or
                  all of said Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be
                  otherwise secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge,
                  lien, assignment or otherwise. Neither the acceptance nor the
                  enforcement hereof, whether by court action or pursuant to the
                  power of sale or other powers herein contained, shall
                  prejudice or in any manner affect the Lessor/Mortgagee's right
                  to realize upon or enforce any other security now or hereafter
                  held by the Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee shall
                  be entitled to enforce the rights and remedies provided for
                  herein and any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in its
                  absolute discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or
                  reserved to the Lessor/Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive
                  of any other remedy, but each shall be cumulative and shall be
                  in addition to every other remedy given hereby or now or
                  hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Every
                  power or remedy given hereby to the Lessor/Mortgagee or to
                  which the Lessor/Mortgagee may be otherwise entitled, may be
                  exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time
                  and as often as may be

                                     - 7 -
<PAGE>

                  deemed expedient by the Lessor/Mortgagee, and the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee may pursue inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee, in addition to and not
                  in lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies
                  provided above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a
                  secured party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

            (c)   It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease
                  be treated as a secured borrowing as provided in Section 3B
                  above, and that, upon the occurrence and during the
                  continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee
                  shall have remedies provided for herein. In the event that,
                  notwithstanding the intention of the parties, a court of
                  competent jurisdiction determines that, for the purpose of
                  remedies, the transaction contemplated by the Master Lease
                  constitutes a leasing arrangement, the parties hereto
                  acknowledge and agree that the Lessor/Mortgagee shall have, as
                  a result of such determination, in addition to the remedies
                  set forth in this Section 3D(a) above, all of the rights and
                  remedies of a landlord provided for in Article XVI of the
                  Master Lease, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and
                  agree that it is their intent that the Master Lease be
                  construed as provided in Section 3B above.

      SECTION 4. Lessor/Mortgagee Grant. (a) The Lessor/Mortgagee hereby
unconditionally grants a security interest in and a Lien to the Lessee/Mortgagor
against all of the Lessor/Mortgagee's right, title and interest in and to the
Security Property, which Lien shall be effective only if the Lessor/Mortgagee
shall become the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding and
such proceeding shall result in the rejection of the Master Lease. Such Lien
shall secure the satisfaction of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right to damages and
other claims arising out of the rejection of the Master Lease to the extent and
in the manner provided for pursuant to the Operative Documents.

      (b) The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees that the conditional Lien created in
paragraph (a) of this Section 4 will terminate upon the termination of the
Master Lease with respect to the Subject Property for any reason other than a
rejection of the Master Lease in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceeding with respect to the Lessor/Mortgagee. Lessee/Mortgagor
covenants to promptly deliver any releases or reconveyances reasonably required
by Lessor/Mortgagee to evidence such termination of Lien.

      (c) The Lien created in paragraph (a) of this Section 4 is junior and
subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted by the Lessee/Mortgagor in
favor of the Lessor/Mortgagee pursuant to this Supplement and the other
Operative Documents.

      SECTION 5. Ratification; Incorporation. Except as specifically modified
hereby, the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are hereby ratified and
confirmed and remain in full force and effect. The terms of the Master Lease (as
amended by this Supplement) are by this reference incorporated herein and made a
part hereof.

      SECTION 6. Original Supplement. The single executed original of this
Supplement marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the
signature page thereof and containing the receipt of the Lessor/Mortgagee
therefor on or following the signature page thereof shall be the original
executed counterpart of this Supplement (the "Original Executed Counterpart").
To the extent that this Supplement constitutes chattel paper, as such term is
defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable
jurisdiction, no security interest in this Supplement may be created through the
transfer or possession of any counterpart other than the Original Executed
Counterpart.

      SECTION 7. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Supplement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdictions identified in this Section 7 (the "Applicable Law") which shall
for most purposes be the laws of the State of New York; provided, however, that
the provisions of this Supplement relating to the creation, perfection and
enforcement of the lien and security interest created by this Supplement in
respect of the Subject Property and the exercise of each remedy provided hereby,
including the power of foreclosure or power of sale procedures set forth in this
Supplement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
law of the State of Colorado, and each of the Lessor/Mortgagee and the
Lessee/Mortgagor agree to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any
suit on this Supplement in the State of Colorado. The terms and provisions set
forth in Schedule III attached hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as
though fully set forth herein. In the event of any conflict between the terms
and provisions contained in the body of the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) and the terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III, the terms
and provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 8. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master
Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or of the leasehold estate created thereby
by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, (a) the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) or the leasehold estate created thereby or any interest in the
Master Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or such leasehold estate, (b) the
fee estate or ground leasehold estate in the Subject Property, except as may
expressly be stated in a written instrument duly executed and delivered by the
Lessor/Mortgagee.

this Supplement and irrevocably pays and performs (to the reasonable
satisfaction of Lessor/Mortgagee) all of the Obligations secured hereby, in

      SECTION 10. Maximum Interest Rate. No provision of this Supplement or any
transaction related thereto shall require the payment or permit the collection
of interest or any other amount in excess of the maximum permitted by Applicable
Law. If any excess of interest or any other amount in such respect is herein or
any other Operative Document provided for, the Lessee/Mortgagor shall not be
obligated to pay such excess interest or any other amounts in excess of the
amount permitted by applicable law, and the right to demand the payment of any

property and all other rights and interests, whether tangible or intangible in
nature, of Lessee/Mortgagor in the Subject Property. In Section 3.C (b) above,

Obligations, a security interest in the UCC Property to the full extent that the
UCC Property may be subject to the UCC. The information contained in this

requirements of the UCC for mortgages to be effective as financing statement
filed as a fixture filing. The name of the "debtor" is ITT INDUSTRIES, INC.; the
name of the "secured party" is REXUS L.L.C.; the mailing address of the "secured
party" from which information concerning the security interest may be obtained
and the mailing address of the "debtor" are as set forth in Section 12 of this
Supplement. The types, or the items, of collateral covered hereby consist of the
UCC Property identified in Section 3.C which constitute fixtures or personal
property. The Lessor/Mortgagee is the record owner of the Land.

      SECTION 12. Notices. For purposes of this instrument all notices shall be
in writing and must be given in the manner provided in Section 14.3 of the
Participation Agreement to the addresses set forth in Schedule V hereto.

      SECTION 13. Counterpart Execution. This Supplement may be executed in any

instrument.

            (h)   In addition to those terms referred to herein, the Master
                  Lease contains numerous other terms, covenants and conditions
                  that affect the Subject Property, and notice is hereby given
                  that reference should be had to the Master Lease with respect
                  to the details of such terms, covenants and conditions. A copy
                  of the Master Lease or of the other agreements referenced
                  herein or therein may be obtained from any of the parties
                  hereto at the addresses set forth herein.

      Lessor/Mortgagee and Lessee/Mortgagor agree to execute and record a
separate document containing information set forth above.

      B. Ownership of the Subject Property. The parties hereto intend that for
(i) financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee/Mortgagor, (ii)
United States federal and all United States state and local income tax purposes
and (iii) United States state real estate and commercial law and bankruptcy
purposes, (1) the Master Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement, (2)
the Lessor/Mortgagee will be deemed a lender making a loan to the
Lessee/Mortgagor in an aggregate amount equal to the Original Aggregate Property
Cost which loan is secured by the Properties, and (3) the Lessee/Mortgagor will
be treated as the owner of the Properties described in the Lease Supplements and
will be entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of
properties similar to the Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the
Lessee/Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that none of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
Arranger or any Investor has made any representations or warranties to the
Lessee/Mortgagor concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the
Operative Documents and that the Lessee/Mortgagor has obtained and relied upon
such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it
deems appropriate. The parties hereto will not take any position inconsistent
with the intentions expressed herein. It is the intent of the parties hereto
that the Master Lease grants a security interest and mortgage or deed to secure
debt or deed of trust, as the case may be, in and on each Property to the
Lessor/Mortgagee for the benefit of the Lessor/Mortgagee to secure the
performance of the Lessee/Mortgagor under and payment of all amounts under this
Master Lease and the other Operative Documents all as more specifically set
forth in each Lease Supplement. Specifically, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the event of any
insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the
Lessee/Mortgagor, the Lessor/Mortgagee or the Investors or any collection
actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative Documents shall be regarded
as loans made to the Lessee/Mortgagor by the Lessor/Mortgagee and the Investors
as unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee/Mortgagor.

      C. Grant of Mortgage Lien and Security Interest: Assignment of Rents. To
secure to the Lessor/Mortgagee the payment and performance of all Obligations:

            (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder), the Lessee/Mortgagor has caused the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to hold title to the Subject Property and
                  Lessee/Mortgagor does hereby mortgage, grant, bargain, sell,
                  convey,

                  assign, transfer and set over to the Lessor/Mortgagee, with
                  power of sale, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law: (i)
                  all of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest from
                  time to time in the Subject Property of whatever nature
                  including, without limitation, Lessee/Mortgagor's leasehold
                  interest under the Master Lease; all condemnation and
                  insurance proceeds relative to the Subject Property and all
                  Profits as defined below; and (ii) all of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to all
                  proceeds of the conversion, whether voluntary or involuntary,
                  of any of the above-described property into cash or other
                  liquid claims, including, without limitation, all awards,
                  payments or proceeds, including interest thereon, and the
                  right to receive the same, which may be made as a result of
                  casualty, any exercise of the right of eminent domain or deed
                  in lieu thereof, the alteration of the grade of any street and
                  any injury to or decrease in the value thereof, the foregoing
                  being referred to hereinafter as the "Security Property".

                  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Security Property, subject however to
                  Permitted Property Liens (which shall include the items set
                  forth on Schedule II), unto the Lessor/Mortgagee, its
                  successors and assigns forever.

                  (i)   Protective Advances. The Lessor/Mortgagee shall have the
                        right, but not the obligation, to make protective
                        advances with respect to the Security Property for the
                        payment of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums or
                        costs incurred for the protection of the Security
                        Property, and such protective advances, together with
                        interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date of
                        each such advance until it is repaid in full, shall be
                        secured by this Supplement to the fullest extent and
                        with the highest priority contemplated by applicable
                        law.

                  (ii)  Mortgage. The Lessee/Mortgagor and the Lessor/Mortgagee
                        intend that this Supplement shall secure
                        Lessee/Mortgagor's obligation to repay the unpaid
                        balance of advances made by the Lessor/Mortgagee and/or
                        the holder hereof under the Master Lease and other
                        Operative Documents to the fullest extent and with the
                        highest priority contemplated by applicable law. The
                        obligations secured hereby shall include, without
                        limitation, all Basic Rent, Accrual Rent and Fixed Rent
                        as well as all Supplemental Rent due from
                        Lessee/Mortgagor under the Master Lease. The maximum
                        amount of advances, exclusive of interest thereon
                        (whether or not identified as interest and including
                        specifically all Accrual Rent under the Master Lease),
                        and exclusive of advances made for the payment of real
                        estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and costs
                        incurred for the protection of the Security Property,
                        all of which are also secured by this Supplement, which
                        may be

                        outstanding at any time is One Hundred Twenty Million
                        and 00/100 Dollars ($120,000,000.00).

            (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder so long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred
                  and is continuing), the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby grants to the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee a security interest in the Lessee/Mortgagor's
                  interest in that portion of the Security Property (the "UCC
                  Property") subject to the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
                  of Ohio (the "UCC"). The Master Lease, as supplemented by this
                  Supplement, shall also be deemed to be a security agreement
                  and shall support any financing statement showing the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee's interest as a secured party with respect to
                  any portion of the UCC Property described in such financing
                  statement. The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees, at its sole cost and
                  expense, to execute, deliver and file from time to time such
                  further instruments as may be requested by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the lien of the
                  security interest in the collateral described in this
                  Supplement.

            (c)   The Lessee/Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys,
                  transfers and sets over unto the Lessor/Mortgagee (subject,
                  however, to the Master Lease and the rights of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor thereunder and hereunder) any and all
                  subleases or other occupancy agreements now existing, or that
                  may hereafter come into existence with respect to the Subject
                  Property or any part thereof, including any guaranties of such
                  sublease or occupancy agreements (collectively, the
                  "Subleases") and all and every part of the rents, issues and
                  profits (collectively, the "Profits") that may from time to
                  time become due and payable on account of the Subleases,
                  provided, that, unless a Lease Event of Default is continuing,
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor shall have the right to collect and
                  retain such Profits. Upon request of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be recorded, at
                  its expense, supplemental or additional assignments of any
                  Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and empowered in
                  its discretion (in addition to all other powers and rights
                  herein granted), to apply for and collect and receive all such
                  Profits and enforce such guaranty or guaranties, and all money
                  so received under and by virtue of this assignment shall be
                  applied as further security for the payment and performance of
                  the Obligations secured hereby.

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Supplement is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Lessor/Mortgagee grants to
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
                  receive the Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits.

                  Such license shall be automatically revoked upon the
                  occurrence and during the continuance of any Lease Event of
                  Default.

      D.    Remedies.

            (a)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, each of which are also events of default
                  under this Supplement, the Lessor/Mortgagee may exercise any
                  one or more of the following rights and remedies as it, in its
                  sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate:

                  (i)   collect interest on all past due sums at the Overdue
                        Rate;

                  (ii)  terminate the Master Lease and, either in person or by
                        agent, with or without bringing any action or
                        proceeding, or by a receiver appointed by a court, and
                        without regard to the adequacy of security, enter upon
                        and take possession of the Security Property, or any
                        part thereof, in its own name, and do any acts which it
                        deems necessary or desirable to preserve the value,
                        marketability or rentability of the Security Property,
                        or any part thereof or interest therein, to increase the
                        income therefrom or to protect the security hereof and,
                        with or without taking possession of the Security
                        Property, to sue for or otherwise to collect the Profits
                        thereof, including, without limitation, those past due
                        and unpaid, and to apply the same, less costs and
                        expenses of operation and collection, including, without
                        limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, upon any
                        Obligations secured hereby, all in such order as the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee may determine. The entering upon and
                        taking possession of the Security Property, and the
                        collection of such Profits and the application thereof
                        as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Lease Event of
                        Default or notice of a Lease Event of Default hereunder
                        or invalidate any act done in response to such Lease
                        Event of Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in
                        possession of the Lessor/Mortgagee or the collection,
                        receipt and application of Profits by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled
                        to exercise every right provided for herein or by law
                        upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
                        Lease Event of Default, including, without limitation,
                        the right to exercise the power of sale;

                  (iii) declare all sums secured hereby immediately due and
                        payable by delivery to the Lessee/Mortgagor a written
                        declaration of the occurrence and continuance of a Lease
                        Event of Default and deliver a notice of non-judicial
                        foreclosure by power of sale of the Subject Property,
                        and proceed with such non-judicial foreclosure in
                        accordance with Applicable Law;

                  (iv)  whether or not a non-judicial or judicial foreclosure
                        proceeding as described above has been commenced,
                        declare immediately due and payable without notice or
                        demand, as otherwise required hereunder or under
                        Applicable Law, all amounts payable by the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor hereunder or under the other Operative
                        Documents which are then unpaid, with all interest and
                        sums accrued and accelerate payment thereof
                        notwithstanding contrary terms of payment stated therein
                        and foreclose against the Security Property in the
                        manner provided by Applicable Law, and exercise all
                        other rights and remedies available hereunder, at law,
                        in equity or otherwise;

                  (v)   as a matter of right, and upon notice to the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor or anyone under the Lessee/Mortgagor
                        and without regard to the adequacy of its security or
                        the then value of the Security Property or the interest
                        of the Lessee/Mortgagor therein, apply to any court
                        having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers
                        of the Security Property and the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby
                        irrevocably consents to such appointment and, to the
                        extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives notice of any
                        application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers
                        shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers
                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee provided for above, and shall continue
                        as a receiver and exercise all such powers until the
                        date of confirmation of sale of the Security Property
                        unless such receivership is sooner terminated by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee in its sole discretion.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled to
                  enforce payment and performance of any Obligations secured
                  hereby and to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any
                  laws now or hereafter in force notwithstanding that some or
                  all of said Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be
                  otherwise secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge,
                  lien, assignment or otherwise. Neither the acceptance nor the
                  enforcement hereof, whether by court action or pursuant to the
                  power of sale or other powers herein contained, shall
                  prejudice or in any manner affect the Lessor/Mortgagee's right
                  to realize upon or enforce any other security now or hereafter
                  held by the Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee shall
                  be entitled to enforce the rights and remedies provided for
                  herein and any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in its
                  absolute discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or
                  reserved to the Lessor/Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive
                  of any other remedy, but each shall be cumulative and shall be
                  in addition to every other remedy given hereby or now or
                  hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Every
                  power or remedy given hereby to the Lessor/Mortgagee or to
                  which the Lessor/Mortgagee may be otherwise entitled, may be
                  exercised,

                  concurrently or independently, from time to time and as often
                  as may be deemed expedient by the Lessor/Mortgagee, and the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee may pursue inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee, in addition to and not
                  in lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies
                  provided above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a
                  secured party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

            (c)   It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease
                  be treated as a secured borrowing as provided in Section 3B
                  above, and that, upon the occurrence and during the
                  continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee
                  shall have remedies provided for herein. In the event that,
                  notwithstanding the intention of the parties, a court of
                  competent jurisdiction determines that, for the purpose of
                  remedies, the transaction contemplated by the Master Lease
                  constitutes a leasing arrangement, the parties hereto
                  acknowledge and agree that the Lessor/Mortgagee shall have, as
                  a result of such determination, in addition to the remedies
                  set forth in this Section 3D(a) above, all of the rights and
                  remedies of a landlord provided for in Article XVI of the
                  Master Lease, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and
                  agree that it is their intent that the Master Lease be
                  construed as provided in Section 3B above.

      SECTION 4. Lessor/Mortgagee Grant. (a) The Lessor/Mortgagee hereby
unconditionally grants a security interest in and a Lien to the Lessee/Mortgagor
against all of the Lessor/Mortgagee's right, title and interest in and to the
Security Property, which Lien shall be effective only if the Lessor/Mortgagee
shall become the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding and
such proceeding shall result in the rejection of the Master Lease. Such Lien
shall secure the satisfaction of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right to damages and
other claims arising out of the rejection of the Master Lease to the extent and
in the manner provided for pursuant to the Operative Documents.

      (b) The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees that the conditional Lien created in
paragraph (a) of this Section 4 will terminate upon the termination of the
Master Lease with respect to the Subject Property for any reason other than a
rejection of the Master Lease in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceeding with respect to the Lessor/Mortgagee. Lessee/Mortgagor
covenants to promptly deliver any releases or reconveyances reasonably required
by Lessor/Mortgagee to evidence such termination of Lien.

      (c) The Lien created in paragraph (a) of this Section 4 is junior and
subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted by the Lessee/Mortgagor in
favor of the Lessor/Mortgagee pursuant to this Supplement and the other
Operative Documents.

      SECTION 5. Ratification; Incorporation. Except as specifically modified
hereby, the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are hereby ratified and
confirmed and remain in full

                                     - 8 -

force and effect. The terms of the Master Lease (as amended by this Supplement)
are by this reference incorporated herein and made a part hereof.

      SECTION 6. Original Supplement. The single executed original of this
Supplement marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the
signature page thereof and containing the receipt of the Lessor/Mortgagee
therefor on or following the signature page thereof shall be the original
executed counterpart of this Supplement (the "Original Executed Counterpart").
To the extent that this Supplement constitutes chattel paper, as such term is
defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable
jurisdiction, no security interest in this Supplement may be created through the
transfer or possession of any counterpart other than the Original Executed
Counterpart.

      SECTION 7. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Supplement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdictions identified in this Section 7 (the "Applicable Law") which shall
for most purposes be the laws of the State of New York; provided, however, that
the provisions of this Supplement relating to the creation, perfection and
enforcement of the lien and security interest created by this Supplement in
respect of the Subject Property and the exercise of each remedy provided hereby,
including the power of foreclosure or power of sale procedures set forth in this
Supplement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
law of the State of Ohio, and each of the Lessor/Mortgagee and the
Lessee/Mortgagor agree to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any
suit on this Supplement in the State of Ohio. The terms and provisions set forth
in Schedule III attached hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as though
fully set forth herein. In the event of any conflict between the terms and
provisions contained in the body of the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) and the terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III, the terms
and provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 8. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master
Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or of the leasehold estate created thereby
by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, (a) the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) or the leasehold estate created thereby or any interest in the
Master Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or such leasehold estate, (b) the
fee estate or ground leasehold estate in the Subject Property, except as may
expressly be stated in a written instrument duly executed and delivered by the
Lessor/Mortgagee.

      SECTION 9. Satisfaction of the Mortgage, Security Interest and Assignment

satisfaction of Lessor/Mortgagee) all of the Obligations secured hereby, in
accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease, as supplemented by this
Supplement and the other Operative Documents and in the manner and at the times

provided for, the Lessee/Mortgagor shall not be obligated to pay such excess
interest or any other amounts in excess of the amount permitted by applicable

Obligations, a security interest in the UCC Property to the full extent that the
UCC Property may be subject to the UCC. The information contained in this

requirements of the UCC for mortgages to be effective as financing statement
filed as a fixture filing. The name of the "debtor" is ITT INDUSTRIES, INC.; the
name of the "secured party" is REXUS L.L.C.; the mailing address of the "secured
party" from which information concerning the security interest may be obtained
and the mailing address of the "debtor" are as set forth in Section 12 of this
Supplement. The types, or the items, of collateral covered hereby consist of the
UCC Property identified in Section 3.C which constitute fixtures or personal
property. The Lessor/Mortgagee is the record owner of the Land.

      SECTION 12. Notices. For purposes of this instrument all notices shall be
in writing and must be given in the manner provided in Section 14.3 of the
Participation Agreement to the addresses set forth in Schedule V hereto.

number of counterparts and by each of the parties hereto in separate
counterparts, all such counterparts together constituting but one and the same
instrument.

            (c)   The lease to which this memorandum of lease pertains is the

                  Supplements.

            (g)   The Master Lease contains certain purchase rights and options
                  during the Lease Term pursuant to which the Lessee/Mortgagor
                  or its designee may acquire the Subject Property.

            (h)   In addition to those terms referred to herein, the Master
                  Lease contains numerous other terms, covenants and conditions
                  that affect the Subject Property, and notice is hereby given
                  that reference should be had to the Master Lease with respect
                  to the details of such terms, covenants and conditions. A copy
                  of the Master Lease or of the other agreements referenced
                  herein or therein may be obtained from any of the parties
                  hereto at the addresses set forth herein.

      B. Ownership of the Subject Property. The parties hereto intend that for
(i) financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee/Mortgagor, (ii)
United States federal and all United States state and local income tax purposes
and (iii) United States state real estate and commercial law and bankruptcy
purposes, (1) the Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement, (2) the
Lessor/Mortgagee will be deemed a lender making a loan to the Lessee/Mortgagor
in an aggregate amount equal to the Original Aggregate Property Cost which loan
is secured by the Properties, and (3) the Lessee/Mortgagor will be treated as
the owner of the Properties described in the Lease Supplements and will be
entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of properties
similar to the Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the
Lessee/Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that none of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
Arranger or any Investor has made any representations or warranties to the
Lessee/Mortgagor concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the
Operative Documents and that the Lessee/Mortgagor has obtained and relied upon
such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it
deems appropriate. The parties hereto will not take any position inconsistent
with the intentions expressed herein. It is the intent of the parties hereto
that this Lease grants a security interest and mortgage or deed to secure debt
or deed of trust, as the case may be, in and on each Property to the
Lessor/Mortgagee for the benefit of the Lessor/Mortgagee to secure the
performance of the Lessee/Mortgagor under and payment of all amounts under this
Master Lease and the other Operative Documents all as more specifically set
forth in each Lease Supplement. Specifically, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the event of any
insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the
Lessee/Mortgagor, the Lessor/Mortgagee or the Investors or any collection
actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative Documents shall be regarded
as loans made to the Lessee/Mortgagor by the Lessor/Mortgagee and the Investors
as unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee/Mortgagor.

      C. Grant of Mortgage Lien and Security Interest: Assignment of Rents. To
secure to the Lessor/Mortgagee the payment and performance of all Obligations:

            (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder), the Lessee/Mortgagor has caused the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to hold title to the Subject Property and

                  Lessee/Mortgagor does hereby mortgage, grant, bargain, sell,
                  convey, assign, transfer and set over to the Lessor/Mortgagee,
                  with power of sale, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
                  (i) all of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest
                  from time to time in the Subject Property of whatever nature
                  including, without limitation, Lessee/Mortgagor's leasehold
                  interest under the Master Lease; all condemnation and
                  insurance proceeds relative to the Subject Property and all
                  Profits as defined below; and (ii) all of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to all
                  proceeds of the conversion, whether voluntary or involuntary,
                  of any of the above-described property into cash or other
                  liquid claims, including, without limitation, all awards,
                  payments or proceeds, including interest thereon, and the
                  right to receive the same, which may be made as a result of
                  casualty, any exercise of the right of eminent domain or deed
                  in lieu thereof, the alteration of the grade of any street and
                  any injury to or decrease in the value thereof, the foregoing
                  being referred to hereinafter as the "Security Property".

                  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Security Property, subject however to
                  Permitted Property Liens (which shall include the items set
                  forth on Schedule II), unto the Lessor/Mortgagee, its
                  successors and assigns forever.

                  (i)   Protective Advances. The Lessor/Mortgagee shall have the
                        right, but not the obligation, to make protective
                        advances with respect to the Security Property for the
                        payment of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums or
                        costs incurred for the protection of the Security
                        Property, and such protective advances, together with
                        interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date of
                        each such advance until it is repaid in full, shall be
                        secured by this Supplement to the fullest extent and
                        with the highest priority contemplated by applicable
                        law.

                  (ii)  Mortgage. The Lessee/Mortgagor and the Lessor/Mortgagee
                        intend that this Supplement shall secure
                        Lessee/Mortgagor's obligation to repay the unpaid
                        balance of advances made by the Lessor/Mortgagee and/or
                        the holder hereof under the Master Lease and other
                        Operative Documents to the fullest extent and with the
                        highest priority contemplated by applicable law. The
                        obligations secured hereby shall include, without
                        limitation, all Basic Rent, Accrual Rent and Fixed Rent
                        as well as all Supplemental Rent due from
                        Lessee/Mortgagor under the Master Lease. The maximum
                        amount of advances, exclusive of interest thereon
                        (whether or not identified as interest and including
                        specifically all Accrual Rent under the Master Lease),
                        and exclusive of advances made for the payment of real
                        estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and costs
                        incurred for the protection of the Security Property,
                        all of which are also secured by this Supplement, which
                        may be

                                     - 4 -

                        outstanding at any time is One Hundred Twenty Million
                        and 00/100 Dollars ($120,000,000.00).

            (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder so long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred
                  and is continuing), the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby grants to the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee a security interest in the Lessee/Mortgagor's
                  interest in that portion of the Security Property (the "UCC
                  Property") subject to the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
                  of Illinois (the "UCC"). The Master Lease, as supplemented by
                  this Supplement, shall also be deemed to be a security
                  agreement and shall support any financing statement showing
                  the Lessor/Mortgagee's interest as a secured party with
                  respect to any portion of the UCC Property described in such
                  financing statement. The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees, at its sole
                  cost and expense, to execute, deliver and file from time to
                  time such further instruments as may be requested by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the lien of the
                  security interest in the collateral described in this
                  Supplement.

            (c)   The Lessee/Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys,
                  transfers and sets over unto the Lessor/Mortgagee (subject,
                  however, to the Master Lease and the rights of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor thereunder and hereunder) any and all
                  subleases or other occupancy agreements now existing, or that
                  may hereafter come into existence with respect to the Subject
                  Property or any part thereof, including any guaranties of such
                  sublease or occupancy agreements (collectively, the
                  "Subleases") and all and every part of the rents, issues and
                  profits (collectively, the "Profits") that may from time to
                  time become due and payable on account of the Subleases,
                  provided, that, unless a Lease Event of Default is continuing,
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor shall have the right to collect and
                  retain such Profits. Upon request of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be recorded, at
                  its expense, supplemental or additional assignments of any
                  Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and empowered in
                  its discretion (in addition to all other powers and rights
                  herein granted), to apply for and collect and receive all such
                  Profits and enforce such guaranty or guaranties, and all money
                  so received under and by virtue of this assignment shall be
                  applied as further security for the payment and performance of
                  the Obligations secured hereby.

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Supplement is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Lessor/Mortgagee grants to
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
                  receive the Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits.

                  Such license shall be automatically revoked upon the
                  occurrence and during the continuance of any Lease Event of
                  Default.

      D. Remedies.

            (a)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, each of which are also events of default
                  under this Supplement, the Lessor/Mortgagee may exercise any
                  one or more of the following rights and remedies as it, in its
                  sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate:

                  (i)   collect interest on all past due sums at the Overdue
                        Rate;

                  (ii)  terminate the Master Lease and, either in person or by
                        agent, with or without bringing any action or
                        proceeding, or by a receiver appointed by a court, and
                        without regard to the adequacy of security, enter upon
                        and take possession of the Security Property, or any
                        part thereof, in its own name, and do any acts which it
                        deems necessary or desirable to preserve the value,
                        marketability or rentability of the Security Property,
                        or any part thereof or interest therein, to increase the
                        income therefrom or to protect the security hereof and,
                        with or without taking possession of the Security
                        Property, to sue for or otherwise to collect the Profits
                        thereof, including, without limitation, those past due
                        and unpaid, and to apply the same, less costs and
                        expenses of operation and collection, including, without
                        limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, upon any
                        Obligations secured hereby, all in such order as the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee may determine. The entering upon and
                        taking possession of the Security Property, and the
                        collection of such Profits and the application thereof
                        as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Lease Event of
                        Default or notice of a Lease Event of Default hereunder
                        or invalidate any act done in response to such Lease
                        Event of Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in
                        possession of the Lessor/Mortgagee or the collection,
                        receipt and application of Profits by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled
                        to exercise every right provided for herein or by law
                        upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
                        Lease Event of Default, including, without limitation,
                        the right to exercise the power of sale;

                  (iii) declare all sums secured hereby immediately due and
                        payable by delivery to the Lessee/Mortgagor a written
                        declaration of the occurrence and continuance of a Lease
                        Event of Default and deliver a notice of non-judicial
                        foreclosure by power of sale of the Subject Property,
                        and proceed with such non-judicial foreclosure in
                        accordance with Applicable Law;

                  (iv)  in lieu of sale pursuant to the power of sale conferred
                        hereby, foreclose in the manner provided by Applicable
                        Law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property;

                  (v)   whether or not a non-judicial or judicial foreclosure
                        proceeding as described above has been commenced,
                        declare immediately due and payable without notice or
                        demand, as otherwise required hereunder or under
                        Applicable Law, all amounts payable by the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor hereunder or under the other Operative
                        Documents which are then unpaid, with all interest and
                        sums accrued and accelerate payment thereof
                        notwithstanding contrary terms of payment stated therein
                        and exercise all rights and remedies available
                        hereunder, at law, in equity or otherwise;

                  (vi)  as a matter of right, and upon notice to the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor or anyone under the Lessee/Mortgagor
                        and without regard to the adequacy of its security or
                        the then value of the Security Property or the interest
                        of the Lessee/Mortgagor therein, apply to any court
                        having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers
                        of the Security Property and the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby
                        irrevocably consents to such appointment and, to the
                        extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives notice of any
                        application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers
                        shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers
                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee provided for above, and shall continue
                        as a receiver and exercise all such powers until the
                        date of confirmation of sale of the Security Property
                        unless such receivership is sooner terminated by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee in its sole discretion.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled to
                  enforce payment and performance of any Obligations secured
                  hereby and to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any
                  laws now or hereafter in force notwithstanding that some or
                  all of said Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be
                  otherwise secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge,
                  lien, assignment or otherwise. Neither the acceptance nor the
                  enforcement hereof, whether by court action or pursuant to the
                  power of sale or other powers herein contained, shall
                  prejudice or in any manner affect the Lessor/Mortgagee's right
                  to realize upon or enforce any other security now or hereafter
                  held by the Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee shall
                  be entitled to enforce the rights and remedies provided for
                  herein and any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in its
                  absolute discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or
                  reserved to the Lessor/Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive
                  of any other remedy, but each shall be cumulative and shall be
                  in addition to every other remedy given hereby or now or
                  hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute.

                  Every power or remedy given hereby to the Lessor/Mortgagee or
                  to which the Lessor/Mortgagee may be otherwise entitled, may
                  be exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time
                  and as often as may be deemed expedient by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee may pursue
                  inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee, in addition to and not
                  in lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies
                  provided above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a
                  secured party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

            (c)   It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease
                  be treated as a secured borrowing as provided in Section 3B
                  above, and that, upon the occurrence and during the
                  continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee
                  shall have remedies provided for herein. In the event that,
                  notwithstanding the intention of the parties, a court of
                  competent jurisdiction determines that, for the purpose of
                  remedies, the transaction contemplated by the Master Lease
                  constitutes a leasing arrangement, the parties hereto
                  acknowledge and agree that the Lessor/Mortgagee shall have, as
                  a result of such determination, in addition to the remedies
                  set forth in this Section 3D(a) above, all of the rights and
                  remedies of a landlord provided for in Article XVI of the
                  Master Lease, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and
                  agree that it is their intent that the Master Lease be
                  construed as provided in Section 3B above.

      SECTION 4. Lessor/Mortgagee Grant. (a) The Lessor/Mortgagee hereby
unconditionally grants a security interest in and a Lien to the Lessee/Mortgagor
against all of the Lessor/Mortgagee's right, title and interest in and to the
Security Property, which Lien shall be effective only if the Lessor/Mortgagee
shall become the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding and
such proceeding shall result in the rejection of the Master Lease. Such Lien
shall secure the satisfaction of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right to damages and
other claims arising out of the rejection of the Master Lease to the extent and
in the manner provided for pursuant to the Operative Documents.

      (b) The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees that the conditional Lien created in
paragraph (a) of this Section 4 will terminate upon the termination of the
Master Lease with respect to the Subject Property for any reason other than a
rejection of the Master Lease in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceeding with respect to the Lessor/Mortgagee. Lessee/Mortgagor
covenants to promptly deliver any releases or reconveyances reasonably required
by Lessor/Mortgagee to evidence such termination of Lien.

      (c) The Lien created in paragraph (a) of this Section 4 is junior and
subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted by the Lessee/Mortgagor in
favor of the Lessor/Mortgagee pursuant to this Supplement and the other
Operative Documents.

      SECTION 5. Ratification; Incorporation. Except as specifically modified
hereby, the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are hereby ratified and
confirmed and remain in full force and effect. The terms of the Master Lease (as
amended by this Supplement) are by this reference incorporated herein and made a
part hereof.

      SECTION 6. Original Supplement. The single executed original of this
Supplement marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the
signature page thereof and containing the receipt of the Lessor/Mortgagee
therefor on or following the signature page thereof shall be the original
executed counterpart of this Supplement (the "Original Executed Counterpart").
To the extent that this Supplement constitutes chattel paper, as such term is
defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable
jurisdiction, no security interest in this Supplement may be created through the
transfer or possession of any counterpart other than the Original Executed
Counterpart.

      SECTION 7. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Supplement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdictions identified in this Section 7 (the "Applicable Law") which shall
for most purposes be the laws of the State of New York; provided, however, that
the provisions of this Supplement relating to the creation, perfection and
enforcement of the lien and security interest created by this Supplement in
respect of the Subject Property and the exercise of each remedy provided hereby,
including the power of foreclosure or power of sale procedures set forth in this
Supplement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
law of the State of Illinois, and each of the Lessor/Mortgagee and the
Lessee/Mortgagor agree to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any
suit on this Supplement in the State of Illinois. The terms and provisions set
forth in Schedule III attached hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as
though fully set forth herein. In the event of any conflict between the terms
and provisions contained in the body of the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) and the terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III, the terms
and provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 8. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master
Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or of the leasehold estate created thereby
by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or
indirectly, in whole or in part, (a) the Master Lease (as amended by this
Supplement) or the leasehold estate created thereby or any interest in the
Master Lease (as amended by this Supplement) or such leasehold estate, (b) the
fee estate or ground leasehold estate in the Subject Property, except as may
expressly be stated in a written instrument duly executed and delivered by the
Lessor/Mortgagee.

      SECTION 9. Satisfaction of the Mortgage, Security Interest and Assignment
of Rents and Subleases. If the Lessee/Mortgagor complies with the provisions of
this Supplement and irrevocably pays and performs (to the reasonable
satisfaction of Lessor/Mortgagee) all of the Obligations secured hereby, in
accordance with the provisions of the Master Lease, as supplemented by this
Supplement and the other Operative Documents and in the manner and at the times
set forth therein, without deduction, fraud or delay, then and from thenceforth
this Supplement and the estate hereby granted and created in favor of the
Lessor/Mortgagee, shall cease and become void, anything hereinbefore contained
to the contrary notwithstanding.

                                     - 9 -

      SECTION 10. Maximum Interest Rate. No provision of this Supplement or any
transaction related thereto shall require the payment or permit the collection
of interest or any other amount in excess of the maximum permitted by Applicable
Law. If any excess of interest or any other amount in such respect is herein or
any other Operative Document provided for, the Lessee/Mortgagor shall not be
obligated to pay such excess interest or any other amounts in excess of the
amount permitted by applicable law, and the right to demand the payment of any
such excess shall be and hereby is waived, and this provision shall control any
other provision of this Supplement and the other Operative Documents.

                  hereto.

            (e)   The Lessor/Mortgagee acquired title to the Land by deed dated
                  on or about the date hereof and about to be recorded or filed

      B. Ownership of the Subject Property. The parties hereto intend that for
(i) financial accounting purposes with respect to the Lessee/Mortgagor, (ii)
United States federal and all United States state and local income tax purposes
and (iii) United States state real estate and commercial law and bankruptcy
purposes, (1) the Lease will be treated as a financing arrangement, (2) the
Lessor/Mortgagee will be deemed a lender making a loan to the Lessee/Mortgagor
in an aggregate amount equal to the Original Aggregate Property Cost which loan
is secured by the Properties, and (3) the Lessee/Mortgagor will be treated as
the owner of the Properties described in the Lease Supplements and will be
entitled to all tax benefits ordinarily available to an owner of properties
similar to the Properties for such tax purposes. Nevertheless, the
Lessee/Mortgagor acknowledges and agrees that none of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
Arranger or any Investor has made any representations or warranties to the
Lessee/Mortgagor concerning the tax, accounting or legal characteristics of the
Operative Documents and that the Lessee/Mortgagor has obtained and relied upon
such tax, accounting and legal advice concerning the Operative Documents as it
deems appropriate. The parties hereto will not take any position inconsistent
with the intentions expressed herein. It is the intent of the parties hereto
that this Lease grants a security interest and mortgage or deed to secure debt
or deed of trust, as the case may be, in and on each Property to the
Lessor/Mortgagee for the benefit of the Lessor/Mortgagee to secure the
performance of the Lessee/Mortgagor under and payment of all amounts under this
Master Lease and the other Operative Documents all as more specifically set
forth in each Lease Supplement. Specifically, without limiting the generality of
the foregoing, the parties hereto intend and agree that in the event of any
insolvency or receivership proceedings or a petition under the United States
bankruptcy laws or any other applicable insolvency laws or statute of the United
States of America or any state or commonwealth thereof affecting the
Lessee/Mortgagor, the Lessor/Mortgagee or the Investors or any collection
actions, the transactions evidenced by the Operative Documents shall be regarded
as loans made to the Lessee/Mortgagor by the Lessor/Mortgagee and the Investors
as unrelated third party lenders of the Lessee/Mortgagor.

      C. Grant of Mortgage Lien and Security Interest: Assignment of Rents. To
secure to the Lessor/Mortgagee the payment and performance of all Obligations:

            (a)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder), the Lessee/Mortgagor has caused the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to hold title to the Subject Property and
                  Lessee/Mortgagor does hereby mortgage, grant, bargain, sell,
                  convey, assign, transfer and set over to the Lessor/Mortgagee,
                  with power of sale, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law:
                  (i) all of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest
                  from time to time in the Subject Property of whatever nature
                  including, without limitation, Lessee/Mortgagor's leasehold
                  interest under the Master Lease; all condemnation and
                  insurance proceeds relative to the Subject Property and all
                  Profits as defined below; and (ii) all of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor's right, title and interest in and to all
                  proceeds of the conversion, whether voluntary or involuntary,
                  of any of the above-described property into cash or other
                  liquid claims, including, without limitation, all awards,
                  payments or proceeds, including interest thereon, and the
                  right to receive the same,

                  right of eminent domain or deed in lieu thereof, the
                  alteration of the grade of any street and any injury to or
                  decrease in the value thereof, the foregoing being referred to
                  hereinafter as the "Security Property".

                  TO HAVE AND TO HOLD the Security Property, subject however to
                  Permitted Property Liens (which shall include the items set
                  forth on Schedule II), unto the Lessor/Mortgagee, its
                  successors and assigns forever.

                  (i)   Protective Advances. The Lessor/Mortgagee shall have the
                        right, but not the obligation, to make protective
                        advances with respect to the Security Property for the
                        payment of taxes, assessments, insurance premiums or
                        costs incurred for the protection of the Security
                        Property, and such protective advances, together with
                        interest thereon at the Overdue Rate from the date of
                        each such advance until it is repaid in full, shall be
                        secured by this Supplement to the fullest extent and
                        with the highest priority contemplated by applicable
                        law.

                  (ii)  Mortgage. The Lessee/Mortgagor and the Lessor/Mortgagee
                        intend that this Supplement shall secure
                        Lessee/Mortgagor's obligation to repay the unpaid
                        balance of advances made by the Lessor/Mortgagee and/or
                        the holder hereof under the Master Lease and other
                        Operative Documents to the fullest extent and with the
                        highest priority contemplated by applicable law. The
                        obligations secured hereby shall include, without
                        limitation, all Basic Rent, Accrual Rent and Fixed Rent
                        as well as all Supplemental Rent due from
                        Lessee/Mortgagor under the Master Lease. The maximum
                        amount of advances, exclusive of interest thereon
                        (whether or not identified as interest and including
                        specifically all Accrual Rent under the Master Lease),
                        and exclusive of advances made for the payment of real
                        estate taxes, assessments, insurance premiums and costs
                        incurred for the protection of the Security Property,
                        all of which are also secured by this Supplement, which
                        may be outstanding at any time is One Hundred Twenty
                        Million and 00/100 Dollars ($120,000,000.00).

            (b)   Subject to the terms and conditions of the Master Lease as
                  supplemented by this Supplement (including, without
                  limitation, the Lessee/Mortgagor's rights hereunder and
                  thereunder so long as no Lease Event of Default has occurred
                  and is continuing), the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby grants to the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee a security interest in the Lessee/Mortgagor's
                  interest in that portion of the Security Property (the "UCC
                  Property") subject to the Uniform Commercial Code of the State
                  of Illinois (the "UCC"). The Master Lease, as supplemented by
                  this Supplement, shall also be deemed to be a security
                  agreement and shall support any financing statement

                                     - 4 -
<PAGE>

                  showing the Lessor/Mortgagee's interest as a secured party
                  with respect to any portion of the UCC Property described in
                  such financing statement. The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees, at its
                  sole cost and expense, to execute, deliver and file from time
                  to time such further instruments as may be requested by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the lien of the
                  security interest in the collateral described in this
                  Supplement.

            (c)   The Lessee/Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys,
                  transfers and sets over unto the Lessor/Mortgagee (subject,
                  however, to the Master Lease and the rights of the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor thereunder and hereunder) any and all
                  subleases or other occupancy agreements now existing, or that
                  may hereafter come into existence with respect to the Subject
                  Property or any part thereof, including any guaranties of such
                  sublease or occupancy agreements (collectively, the
                  "Subleases") and all and every part of the rents, issues and
                  profits (collectively, the "Profits") that may from time to
                  time become due and payable on account of the Subleases,
                  provided, that, unless a Lease Event of Default is continuing,
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor shall have the right to collect and
                  retain such Profits. Upon request of the Lessor/Mortgagee, the
                  Lessee/Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be recorded, at
                  its expense, supplemental or additional assignments of any
                  Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and empowered in
                  its discretion (in addition to all other powers and rights
                  herein granted), to apply for and collect and receive all such
                  Profits and enforce such guaranty or guaranties, and all money
                  so received under and by virtue of this assignment shall be
                  applied as further security for the payment and performance of
                  the Obligations secured hereby.

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Supplement is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Lessor/Mortgagee grants to
                  the Lessee/Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and
                  receive the Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits.
                  Such license shall be automatically revoked upon the
                  occurrence and during the continuance of any Lease Event of
                  Default.

      D. Remedies.

            (a)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, each of which are also events of default
                  under this Supplement, the Lessor/Mortgagee may exercise any
                  one or more of the following rights and remedies as it, in its
                  sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate:

                  (i)   collect interest on all past due sums at the Overdue
                        Rate;

                  (ii)  terminate the Master Lease and, either in person or by
                        agent, with or without bringing any action or
                        proceeding, or by a receiver appointed by a court, and
                        without regard to the adequacy of security, enter upon
                        and take possession of the Security Property, or any
                        part thereof, in its own name, and do any acts which it
                        deems necessary or desirable to preserve the value,
                        marketability or rentability of the Security Property,
                        or any part thereof or interest therein, to increase the
                        income therefrom or to protect the security hereof and,
                        with or without taking possession of the Security
                        Property, to sue for or otherwise to collect the Profits
                        thereof, including, without limitation, those past due
                        and unpaid, and to apply the same, less costs and
                        expenses of operation and collection, including, without
                        limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees, upon any
                        Obligations secured hereby, all in such order as the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee may determine. The entering upon and
                        taking possession of the Security Property, and the
                        collection of such Profits and the application thereof
                        as aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Lease Event of
                        Default or notice of a Lease Event of Default hereunder
                        or invalidate any act done in response to such Lease
                        Event of Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in
                        possession of the Lessor/Mortgagee or the collection,
                        receipt and application of Profits by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled
                        to exercise every right provided for herein or by law
                        upon the occurrence and during the continuance of any
                        Lease Event of Default, including, without limitation,
                        the right to exercise the power of sale;

                  (iii) declare all sums secured hereby immediately due and
                        payable by delivery to the Lessee/Mortgagor a written
                        declaration of the occurrence and continuance of a Lease
                        Event of Default and deliver a notice of non-judicial
                        foreclosure by power of sale of the Subject Property,
                        and proceed with such non-judicial foreclosure in
                        accordance with Applicable Law;

                  (iv)  in lieu of sale pursuant to the power of sale conferred
                        hereby, foreclose in the manner provided by Applicable
                        Law for the foreclosure of mortgages on real property;

                  (v)   whether or not a non-judicial or judicial foreclosure

                        declare immediately due and payable without notice or
                        demand, as otherwise required hereunder or under
                        Applicable Law, all amounts payable by the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor hereunder or under the other Operative
                        Documents which are then unpaid, with all interest and
                        sums accrued and accelerate payment thereof

                  (vi)  as a matter of right, and upon notice to the
                        Lessee/Mortgagor or anyone under the Lessee/Mortgagor
                        and without regard to the adequacy of its security or
                        the then value of the Security Property or the interest
                        of the Lessee/Mortgagor therein, apply to any court
                        having jurisdiction to appoint a receiver or receivers
                        of the Security Property and the Lessee/Mortgagor hereby
                        irrevocably consents to such appointment and, to the
                        extent permitted by Applicable Law, waives notice of any
                        application therefor. Any such receiver or receivers
                        shall have all the usual powers and duties of receivers
                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee provided for above, and shall continue
                        as a receiver and exercise all such powers until the
                        date of confirmation of sale of the Security Property
                        unless such receivership is sooner terminated by the
                        Lessor/Mortgagee in its sole discretion.

                  Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee shall be entitled to
                  enforce payment and performance of any Obligations secured
                  hereby and to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any
                  laws now or hereafter in force notwithstanding that some or
                  all of said Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be
                  otherwise secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge,
                  lien, assignment or otherwise. Neither the acceptance nor the
                  enforcement hereof, whether by court action or pursuant to the
                  power of sale or other powers herein contained, shall
                  prejudice or in any manner affect the Lessor/Mortgagee's right
                  to realize upon or enforce any other security now or hereafter
                  held by the Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee shall
                  be entitled to enforce the rights and remedies provided for
                  herein and any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in its
                  absolute discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or
                  reserved to the Lessor/Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive
                  of any other remedy, but each shall be cumulative and shall be
                  in addition to every other remedy given hereby or now or
                  hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. Every
                  power or remedy given hereby to the Lessor/Mortgagee or to
                  which the Lessor/Mortgagee may be otherwise entitled, may be
                  exercised, concurrently or independently, from time to time
                  and as often as may be deemed expedient by the
                  Lessor/Mortgagee, and the Lessor/Mortgagee may pursue
                  inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee, in addition to and not
                  in lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies
                  provided above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a
                  secured party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

            (c)   It is the intent of the parties hereto that the Master Lease
                  be treated as a secured borrowing as provided in Section 3B
                  above, and that, upon the occurrence and during the
                  continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the Lessor/Mortgagee
                  shall have remedies provided for herein. In the event that,
                  notwithstanding the intention of the parties, a court of
                  competent jurisdiction determines that, for the purpose of
                  remedies, the transaction contemplated by the Master Lease
                  constitutes a leasing arrangement, the parties hereto
                  acknowledge and agree that the Lessor/Mortgagee shall have, as
                  a result of such determination, in addition to the remedies
                  set forth in this Section 3D(a) above, all of the rights and
                  remedies of a landlord provided for in Article XVI of the
                  Master Lease, provided that the parties hereto acknowledge and
                  agree that it is their intent that the Master Lease be
                  construed as provided in Section 3B above.

      SECTION 4. Lessor/Mortgagee Grant. (a) The Lessor/Mortgagee hereby
unconditionally grants a security interest in and a Lien to the Lessee/Mortgagor
against all of the Lessor/Mortgagee's right, title and interest in and to the
Security Property, which Lien shall be effective only if the Lessor/Mortgagee
shall become the subject of any bankruptcy, insolvency or similar proceeding and
such proceeding shall result in the rejection of the Master Lease. Such Lien
shall secure the satisfaction of the Lessee/Mortgagor's right to damages and
other claims arising out of the rejection of the Master Lease to the extent and
in the manner provided for pursuant to the Operative Documents.

      (b) The Lessee/Mortgagor agrees that the conditional Lien created in
paragraph (a) of this Section 4 will terminate upon the termination of the
Master Lease with respect to the Subject Property for any reason other than a
rejection of the Master Lease in connection with a bankruptcy, insolvency or
similar proceeding with respect to the Lessor/Mortgagee. Lessee/Mortgagor
covenants to promptly deliver any releases or reconveyances reasonably required
by Lessor/Mortgagee to evidence such termination of Lien.

      (c) The Lien created in paragraph (a) of this Section 4 is junior and
subordinate in all respects to the Liens granted by the Lessee/Mortgagor in
favor of the Lessor/Mortgagee pursuant to this Supplement and the other
Operative Documents.

      SECTION 5. Ratification; Incorporation. Except as specifically modified
hereby, the terms and provisions of the Master Lease are hereby ratified and
confirmed and remain in full force and effect. The terms of the Master Lease (as
amended by this Supplement) are by this reference incorporated herein and made a
part hereof.

      SECTION 6. Original Supplement. The single executed original of this
Supplement marked "THIS COUNTERPART IS THE ORIGINAL EXECUTED COUNTERPART" on the
signature page thereof and containing the receipt of the Lessor/Mortgagee
therefor on or following the signature page thereof shall be the original
executed counterpart of this Supplement (the "Original Executed Counterpart").
To the extent that this Supplement constitutes chattel paper, as such term is
defined in the Uniform Commercial Code as in effect in any applicable
jurisdiction, no security interest in this Supplement may be created through the
transfer or possession of any counterpart other than the Original Executed
Counterpart.

      SECTION 7. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Supplement
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the
jurisdictions identified in this Section 7 (the "Applicable Law") which shall
for most purposes be the laws of the State of New York; provided, however, that
the provisions of this Supplement relating to the creation, perfection and
enforcement of the lien and security interest created by this Supplement in
respect of the Subject Property and the exercise of each remedy provided hereby,
including the power of foreclosure or power of sale procedures set forth in this
Supplement, shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the internal
law of the State of Illinois, and each of the Lessor/Mortgagee and the
Lessee/Mortgagor agree to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any
suit on this Supplement in the State of Illinois. The terms and provisions set

and provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 8. No Merger of Title. There shall be no merger of the Master

by reason of the fact that the same Person may acquire, own or hold, directly or

satisfaction of Lessor/Mortgagee) all of the Obligations secured hereby, in

                        fullest extent and with the highest priority
                        contemplated by Applicable Law.

                  (ii)  Mortgage. The Mortgagor and the Mortgagee intend that
                        this Mortgage shall secure Mortgagor's obligation to
                        repay the unpaid balance of advances made by the
                        Mortgagee and/or the holder hereof under the Master
                        Lease and other Operative Documents to the fullest
                        extent and with the highest priority contemplated by
                        applicable law. The obligations secured hereby shall

                        all of which are also secured by this Supplement, which
                        may be outstanding at any time is One Hundred Sixty Five
                        Million and 00/100 Dollars ($165,000,000.00).

            (b)   The Mortgagor hereby grants to the Mortgagee a security
                  interest in the Mortgagor's interest in that portion of the
                  Security Property (the "UCC Property") subject to the Uniform
                  Commercial Code of the State of New Jersey (the "UCC"). This
                  Mortgage shall also be deemed to be a security agreement and
                  shall support any financing statement showing the Mortgagee's
                  interest as a secured party with respect to any portion of the
                  UCC Property described in such financing statement. The
                  Mortgagor agrees, at its sole cost and expense, to execute,
                  deliver and file from time to time such further instruments as
                  may be requested by the Mortgagee to confirm and perfect the
                  lien of the security interest in the collateral described in
                  this Mortgage.

            (c)   The Mortgagor hereby irrevocably assigns, conveys, transfers
                  and sets over unto the Mortgagee all and every part of the
                  rents, issues and profits (collectively, the "Profits") that
                  may from time to time become due and payable on account of any
                  and all subleases or other occupancy agreements now existing,
                  or that may hereafter come into existence with respect to the
                  Subject Property or any part thereof, including any guaranties
                  of such sublease or occupancy agreements (collectively, the
                  "Subleases") provided, that, unless a Lease Event of Default
                  is continuing, the Mortgagor shall have the right to collect
                  and retain such Profits. Upon request of the Mortgagee, the
                  Mortgagor shall execute and cause to be recorded, at its
                  expense, supplemental or additional assignments of any
                  Subleases of the Subject Property. Upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of a Lease Event of Default, the
                  Mortgagee is hereby fully authorized and empowered in its
                  discretion (in addition to all other powers and rights herein
                  granted), to apply for and collect and receive all such

                                     - 3 -
<PAGE>

                  Profits and enforce such guaranty or guaranties, and all money
                  so received under and by virtue of this assignment shall be
                  applied as further security for the payment and performance of
                  the Obligations secured hereby.

            (d)   Notwithstanding that this Mortgage is an absolute assignment
                  of the Profits and the Subleases and not merely the collateral
                  assignment of, or the grant of a lien or security interest in,
                  the Profits and the Subleases, the Mortgagee grants to the
                  Mortgagor a revocable license to collect and receive the
                  Profits and to retain, use and enjoy such Profits. Such
                  license shall be automatically revoked upon the occurrence and
                  during the continuance of any Lease Event of Default.

            (e)   It is intended that this Mortgage shall be a Lessor Mortgage
                  and that the Subject Property be a Security Property and a
                  Property as those terms are defined in the Participation
                  Agreement and the other Operative Documents and that all terms
                  covenants conditions and requirements of said Operative
                  Documents applicable thereto shall apply to the Subject
                  Property including without limitation those relating to sale,
                  lease or further encumbrance of any Property.

      SECTION 2. Remedies. (a) Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of
a Lease Event of Default each of which is also a default under this Mortgage,
the Mortgagee may exercise any one or more of the following rights and remedies
as it, in its sole discretion, may deem necessary or appropriate:

                        part thereof, in its own name, and do any acts which it
                        deems necessary or desirable to preserve the value,
                        marketability or rentability of the Security Property,
                        or any part thereof or interest therein, to increase the
                        income therefrom or to protect the security hereof and,
                        with or without taking possession of the Security
                        Property, to sue for or otherwise to collect the Profits
                        thereof, including, without limitation, those past due
                        and unpaid, and to apply the same, less costs and
                        expenses of operation and collection, including, without

                        Obligations secured hereby, all in such order as the

                        possession of the Security Property, and the collection
                        of such Profits and the application thereof as
                        aforesaid, shall not cure or waive any Lease Event of
                        Default or notice of a Lease Event of Default hereunder
                        or invalidate any act done in response to such Lease
                        Event of Default and, notwithstanding the continuance in

                        and application of Profits by the Mortgagee, the
                        Mortgagee shall be entitled to exercise every right
                        provided for herein or by law upon the occurrence and
                        during the continuance of any Lease Event of Default,

                        in like or similar cases and all the powers of the
                        Mortgagee provided for herein, and shall continue as a

                  to exercise all rights and powers hereunder or any laws now or

                  Obligations secured hereby may now or hereafter be otherwise
                  secured, whether by mortgage, deed of trust, pledge, lien,
                  assignment or otherwise. To the extent permitted by

                  Applicable Law, neither the acceptance nor the enforcement
                  hereof, whether by court action or pursuant to the power of
                  sale or other powers herein contained, shall prejudice or in
                  any manner affect the Mortgagee's right to realize upon or
                  enforce any other security now or hereafter held by the
                  Mortgagee and, to the extent permitted by Applicable Law, the
                  Mortgagee shall be entitled to enforce the rights and remedies
                  provided for herein and any other security now or hereafter
                  held by the Mortgagee in such order and manner as it may in
                  its absolute discretion determine. No remedy conferred upon or
                  reserved to the Mortgagee is intended to be exclusive of any
                  other remedy, but each shall be cumulative and shall be in
                  addition to every other remedy given hereby or now or
                  hereafter existing at law or in equity or by statute. To the
                  extent permitted by Applicable Law, every power or remedy
                  given hereby to the Mortgagee or to which the Mortgagee may be
                  otherwise entitled, may be exercised, concurrently or
                  independently, from time to time and as often as may be deemed
                  expedient by the Mortgagee, and the Mortgagee may pursue
                  inconsistent remedies.

            (b)   Upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease
                  Event of Default, the Mortgagee, in addition to and not in
                  lieu of or in diminution of the rights and remedies provided
                  above shall have all of the rights and remedies of a secured
                  party under the UCC, which rights and remedies may be
                  exercised without application to any court to the extent
                  permitted by the UCC.

      SECTION 3. Applicable Law; Certain Particular Provisions. This Mortgage
shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of
New Jersey ("Applicable Law") and each of the Mortgagee and the Mortgagor agree
to submit to jurisdiction and the laying of venue for any suit on this Mortgage

hereto are hereby incorporated by reference as though fully set forth herein. In
the event of any conflict between the terms and provisions contained in the body
of this Mortgage and the terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III, the
terms and provisions set forth in Schedule III shall govern and control.

      SECTION 4. Satisfaction of the Mortgage, Security Interest and Assignment
of Rents and Subleases. If the Mortgagor complies with the provisions of this
Mortgage and irrevocably pays and performs (to the reasonable satisfaction of
Mortgagor) all of the Obligations secured hereby, in accordance with the
provisions of the Master Lease, and the other Operative Documents and in the
manner and at the times set forth therein, without deduction, fraud or delay,
then and from thenceforth this Mortgage and the estate hereby granted and
created in favor of the Mortgagee, shall cease and become void, anything
hereinbefore contained to the contrary notwithstanding.

      SECTION 5. Maximum Interest Rate. No provision of this Mortgage or any
transaction related thereto shall require the payment or permit the collection
of interest or any other amount in excess of the maximum permitted by Applicable
Law. If any excess of interest or any other amount in such respect is herein or
any other Operative Document provided for, the Mortgagor

                                     - 6 -
<PAGE>

shall not be obligated to pay such excess interest or any other amounts in
excess of the amount permitted by applicable law, and the right to demand the
payment of any such excess shall be and hereby is waived, and this provision
shall control any other provision of this Mortgage and the other Operative
Documents.

Mortgage is both a real property mortgage and a "security agreement" within the
meaning of the UCC. The Subject Property includes both real and personal
property and all other rights and interests, whether tangible or intangible in

                       Additional Permitted Property Liens

                                      None

                                  Schedule III

                              Local Law Provisions

      1. Warranty of Title. At the time of the recordation of this Mortgage,
Mortgagor is well seized of an indefeasible estate in fee simple in the portion
of the Security Property which constitutes real property and owns good title to
the portion of the Security Property which constitutes personal property, and
Mortgagor has good right, full power and lawful authority to convey, mortgage
and grant a security interest therein and to assign any Rents due Mortgagor
relative to the Security Property. Said title of Mortgagor in the Security
Property is free and clear of all liens, charges, easements, covenants,
conditions, restrictions and encumbrances whatsoever, other than liens expressly
permitted under the Loan Agreement, including, as to the personal property and
fixtures, security agreements, conditional sales contracts and anything of a
similar nature. Mortgagor shall and will forever defend the title to the
Security Property against the claims of all persons whomsoever.

      2. Mortgage Taxes. In the event of the passage of any federal, state or
local governmental law, order, rule or regulation subsequent to the date hereof
which changes or modifies in any manner the laws now in force governing the
taxation of mortgages or debts secured by mortgages or the manner of collecting
taxes so as to materially and adversely affect Mortgagee, all sums secured by
this Mortgage and all interest accrued thereon shall become due forthwith at the
option of Mortgagee and be payable 60 days after notice to Mortgagor.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, instead of paying all the sums secured by this
Mortgage and all interest accrued thereon as provided above, Mortgagor shall
have the right to pay to Mortgagee an amount which will place Mortgagee in
exactly the same position Mortgagee would have been in had the events outlined
above not occurred, provided, however, if such payment may, in Mortgagee's
judgment, be considered unlawful by a court of competent jurisdiction, then such
payment may not be made and all sums secured by this Mortgage and all interest
accrued thereon shall become due forthwith at the option of Mortgagee and
payable 60 days after notice to Mortgagor as aforesaid.

      3. No Tax Credits. Mortgagor shall not claim or demand or be entitled to
receive any credit or credits on any principal or interest payable with respect
to any Obligations, for so much of the taxes, assessments or similar charges
assessed against the Security Property, or any part thereof, as are applicable
to the Obligations or to Mortgagee's interest in the Security Property. No
deduction shall be claimed from the taxable value of the Security Property or
any part thereof by reason of the Obligations or this Mortgage.

      4. Further Assurances; After Acquired Property. At any time and from time
to time, upon request from Mortgagee, Mortgagor shall make, execute and deliver,
or cause to be made, executed and delivered, to Mortgagee and, where
appropriate, to cause to be recorded or filed, or both, and from time to time
thereafter to be re-recorded or refiled, or both, at such time and in such
offices and places as shall be deemed desirable by Mortgagee, any and all such
other and further mortgages, security agreements, financing statements,
continuation statements, instruments of further assurances, certificates and
other documents as may, in the opinion of

<PAGE>

Mortgagee, be necessary or desirable in order to effectuate, complete or
perfect, or to continue and preserve (i) the obligations of the Mortgagor under
this Mortgage and the other Operative Documents, and (ii) the lien and security
interest of this Mortgage as a first and prior lien and security interest upon
all of the Security Property, whether now or hereafter acquired by Mortgagor.
Upon any failure by Mortgagor to so make, execute and deliver each of such
documents after written demand, Mortgagee may make, execute, record, file,
re-record and refile, as appropriate, any and all such mortgages, security
agreements, financing statements, continuation statements, instruments,
certificates and documents for and in the name of Mortgagor, and Mortgagor
hereby irrevocably appoints Mortgagee as its agent and attorney-in-fact in
connection therewith. The lien and security interest hereof will automatically
attach, without further act, to all after-acquired property owned by Mortgagor
attached to or used in connection with the operation of the Security Property or
any part thereof.

      5. Receiver. If a Lease Event of Default shall have occurred and be
continuing, Mortgagee, upon application to a court of competent jurisdiction,
shall be entitled as a matter of strict right without notice and without regard
to the occupancy or value of any security for the Obligations or the insolvency
of any party bound for its payment to the appointment of a receiver to take
possession of and to operate the Security Property and to collect and apply the
rents, issues, profits, revenues, awards and other benefits thereof. The
receiver shall have all of the rights and powers to the fullest extent permitted
by law. Mortgagor shall pay to Mortgagee upon demand all of Mortgagee's costs
and expenses, including, without limitation, receiver's fees and expenses and
attorneys' fees and expenses, incurred pursuant to this Section plus interest
thereon accruing at the Default Rate, and all such amounts shall be additional
indebtedness comprising Obligations.

      6. Mortgagee's Power of Enforcement. If a Lease Event of Default shall
have occurred and be continuing, Mortgagee may, either with or without entry or
taking possession as herein provided or otherwise, proceed by suit or suits at
law or in equity or by any other appropriate proceeding or remedy (i) to enforce
payment of the Obligations or the performance of any term, covenant, condition
or agreement of this Mortgage or any other right, (ii) to foreclose this
Mortgage and to sell the Security Property as an entirety or otherwise, as
Mortgagee may determine, and (iii) to pursue any other remedy available to it,
including, without limitation, any remedy available to it under any of the
Operative Documents, all as Mortgagee shall deem most effectual for such
purposes. Mortgagee may take action either by such proceedings or by the
exercise of its powers with respect to entry or taking possession, as Mortgagee
may determine. Mortgagee may elect to pursue any one or more or all of the
foregoing.

      7. Purchase by Mortgagee. Upon any foreclosure sale, Mortgagee may bid for
and purchase the Security Property and shall be entitled to apply all or any
part of any indebtedness or obligation secured hereby as a credit to the
purchase price.

      8. Fees and Expenses; Application of Proceeds of Sale. In any suit to
foreclose the lien hereof, there shall be allowed and included as additional
indebtedness secured hereby (and part of the Obligations) in the decree for
sale, to the extent permitted by law, all costs and expenses which may be paid
or incurred by or on behalf of Mortgagee or the holder of the Notes

<PAGE>

for attorneys' fees and expenses, appraiser's fees and expenses, receiver's fees
and expenses, insurance, taxes, outlays for documentary and expert evidence,
costs for preservation of the Security Property, stenographer's charges,
publication cost and costs of procuring all abstracts of title, title searches
and examinations, and similar data and assurances with respect to title as
Mortgagee may deem to be necessary either to prosecute such suit or to evidence
to bidders at any sale which may be had pursuant to such decree the true
condition of the title to or value of the Security Property, or for any other
reasonable purpose. The amount of any such costs and expenses which may be paid
or incurred after the decree for sale is entered may be estimated and the amount
of such estimate may be allowed and included as additional indebtedness secured
hereby (and part of the Obligations) in the decree for sale. In the event of a
foreclosure sale of the Security Property, the proceeds of said sale shall be
applied first to the expenses of such sale and of all proceedings in connection
therewith, including, without limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses, then to
insurance premiums, liens, assessments, taxes and charges, including, without
limitation, utility charges, then to payment of the outstanding principal
balance of any Obligations secured hereby, then to the Remaining Obligations.

      9. Waiver of Appraisement, Valuation, Stay, Extension and Redemption Laws.
Mortgagor agrees, to the fullest extent permitted by law, that if a Lease Event
of Default occurs hereunder, neither Mortgagor nor anyone claiming through or
under Mortgagor shall or will set up, claim or seek to take advantage of any
appraisement, valuation, stay, extension, homestead or redemption laws now or
hereafter in force, in order to prevent or hinder the enforcement or foreclosure
of this Mortgage, or the absolute sale of the Security Property hereby conveyed,
or the final and absolute putting into possession thereof, immediately after
such sale, of the purchasers thereat, and Mortgagor, for itself and all who may
at any time claim by, through or under it, hereby waives and releases, to the
fullest extent permitted by law, the benefit of all such laws and any and all
rights to have the assets comprised in the security intended to be created
hereby marshalled upon any foreclosure of the lien hereof.

      10. Leases. Mortgagee, at its option, is authorized to foreclose this
Mortgage subject to the rights of any tenants of the Security Property, or to
name said tenants in the foreclosure, and the failure to make such tenants
parties to any such foreclosure proceedings and to foreclose their rights will
not be, nor be asserted to be by Mortgagor, a defense to any proceedings
instituted by Mortgagee to collect the sums secured hereby, or any deficiency
remaining unpaid after the foreclosure sale of the Security Property.

      11. Discontinuance of Proceedings and Restoration of the Parties. In case
Mortgagee shall have proceeded to enforce any right, power or remedy under this
Mortgage by foreclosure, entry or otherwise, and such proceedings shall have
been discontinued or abandoned for any reason, or shall have been determined
adversely to Mortgagee, then and in every such case, Mortgagor and Mortgagee
shall be restored to their former positions and rights hereunder, and all
rights, powers and remedies of Mortgagee shall continue as if no such proceeding
had been taken.

      12. Suits to Protect the Security Property. Upon the occurrence of a Lease
Event of Default hereunder, Mortgagee shall have the power (i) to institute and
maintain such suits and proceedings as it may deem expedient to prevent any
impairment of the Security Property by any

<PAGE>

acts which may be unlawful or in violation of this Mortgage; (ii) to preserve or
protect its interest in the Security Property and in the rents, issues, profits,
revenues, awards and other benefits arising therefrom; and (iii) to restrain the
enforcement of or compliance with any legislation or other governmental
enactment, regulation, rule, order or other requirement that may be
unconstitutional or otherwise invalid, if the enforcement of or compliance with
such enactment, regulation, rule, order or other requirement would impair the
security hereunder or be prejudicial to the interest of Mortgagee, and all costs
and expenses incurred by Mortgagee in connection therewith (including, without
limitation, attorneys' fees and expenses) shall be paid by Mortgagor to
Mortgagee on demand with interest at the Default Rate, and all such amounts
shall be additional indebtedness secured hereby (and part of the Obligations).

      13. Mortgagee May File Proofs of Claim. In the case of any receivership,
insolvency, bankruptcy, reorganization, arrangement, adjustment, composition or
other proceedings affecting Mortgagor, its creditors or its property, Mortgagee,
to the extent permitted by law, shall be entitled to file such proofs of claim
and other documents as may be necessary or advisable in order to have the claims
of Mortgagee allowed in such proceedings for the entire amount due and payable
by Mortgagor under this Mortgage at the date of the institution of such
proceedings and for any additional amount which may become due and payable by
Mortgagor hereunder after such date.

      14. Assignment. For $10.00 and other good and valuable consideration,
including the indebtedness evidenced by the Operative Documents, the receipt and
sufficiency of which are hereby acknowledged, Mortgagor has granted, bargained,
sold and conveyed, and by these presents does grant, bargain, sell and convey
absolutely unto Mortgagee any leases and the rents payable to Mortgagor relative
to the Security Property, subject only to the hereinafter referenced License, to
have and to hold the Leases and the Rents unto Mortgagee, forever, and Mortgagor
does hereby bind itself, its successors and assigns to warrant and forever
defend the title to the leases and the rents unto Mortgagee against every person
whomsoever lawfully claiming or to claim the same or any part thereof by or
through Mortgagor; provided, however, if Mortgagor shall pay or cause to be paid
and shall perform and discharge or cause to be performed and discharged, the
Obligations on or before the date same is to be paid, performed and discharged,
then this assignment shall terminate and be of no further force and effect, and
all rights, titles and interests conveyed pursuant to this assignment shall
become revested in Mortgagor without the necessity of any further act or
requirement by Mortgagor or Mortgagee. Notwithstanding any provisions herein,
Mortgagor may only lease the Security Property to third parties in accordance
with the Operative Documents.

      15. Limited License. Mortgagee hereby grants to Mortgagor a limited
license (the "License"), nonexclusive with the rights of Mortgagee reserved in
this Mortgage, to exercise and enjoy all incidences of ownership of the Leases
and the Rents, including specifically but without limitation the right to
collect, demand, sue for, attach, levy, recover and receive the Rents, and to
give proper receipts, releases and acquittances therefor. Mortgagor hereby
agrees to receive all Rents and hold the same as a trust fund to be applied, and
to apply the Rent so collected, to the payment, satisfaction and discharge of
the indebtedness described in the Operative Documents as and when the same shall
become due and payable. Thereafter, Mortgagor may use the balance of the Rent
collected in any manner not inconsistent with the Operative Documents.

<PAGE>

      16. Enforcement of Leases. Subject to and in accordance with the terms and
conditions of Section 1.16 of this Mortgage, Mortgagor shall (a) duly and
punctually perform and comply with any and all representations, warranties,
covenants and agreements expressed as binding upon the landlord under any Lease,
(b) maintain each of the Leases in full force and effect during the term
thereof, (c) to the extent commercially reasonable, appear in and defend any
action or proceeding in any manner connected with any of the Leases, (d) deliver
to Mortgagee copies of executed counterparts of all Leases and (e) deliver to
Mortgagee such further information, and execute and deliver to Mortgagee such
further assurances and assignments, with respect to the Leases as Mortgagee may
from time to time reasonably request. Without Mortgagee's prior written consent,
Mortgagor shall not materially discount any future accruing Rent, or assign or
grant a security interest in or to the License or any of the Leases.

      17. Suits; Attornment. Subject to the License and the provisions of
Section 2.1.2 of this Mortgage, Mortgagee hereby reserves and may exercise the
right and Mortgagor hereby acknowledges that Mortgagee has the right (but not
the obligation), upon the occurrence and during the continuance of a Lease Event
of Default, to collect, demand, sue for, attach, levy, recover and receive any
Rent, to give proper receipts, releases and acquittances therefor and, after
deducting the expenses of collection, to apply the net proceeds thereof as a
credit upon any portion of any indebtedness secured hereby selected by
Mortgagee, notwithstanding that such portion selected may not then be due and
payable or that such portion is otherwise adequately secured. Mortgagor hereby
authorizes and directs any lessee of the Security Property to deliver any such
payment to, and otherwise to attorn all other obligations under the Leases
direct to, Mortgagee. Mortgagor hereby ratifies and confirms all that Mortgagee
shall do or cause to be done by virtue and in compliance with the terms of this
assignment. No lessee shall be required to inquire into the authority of
Mortgagee to collect any Rent, and any lessee's obligation to Mortgagor shall be
absolutely discharged to the extent of its payment to Mortgagee.

      18. Remedies. Upon or at any time after the occurrence of a Lease Event of
Default, Mortgagee, at its option and in addition to the remedies provided in
this Mortgage, shall have the complete, continuing and absolute right, power and
authority to terminate the License solely by the giving of written notice of
termination to Mortgagor. Upon Mortgagee's giving of such notice, the License
shall immediately terminate without any further action being required of
Mortgagee. Thereafter, as long as any Event of Default shall exist, Mortgagee
shall have the exclusive right, power and authority to take any and all action
as described above, regardless of whether a foreclosure sale of the remainder of
the Security Property has occurred under this Mortgage, or whether Mortgagee has
taken possession of the remainder of the Security Property or attempted to do
any of the same. No action referred to above or in this Section taken by
Mortgagee shall constitute an election of remedy. Notwithstanding any term to
the contrary herein, in the event of such a termination of Mortgagor's License,
such License shall be reinstated when and if the applicable Event of Default
shall have been cured or waived.

      19. No Obligation of Mortgagee. Neither the acceptance by Mortgagee of the
assignment granted in this Mortgage, nor the granting of any other right, power,
privilege or authority in this Mortgage, nor the exercise of any of the
aforesaid, shall (a) prior to the actual taking of physical possession and
operational control of the Security Property by Mortgagee, be deemed to
constitute Mortgagee as a "mortgagee in possession" or (b) at any time
thereafter,

<PAGE>

obligate Mortgagee (i) to appear in or defend any action or proceeding relating
to the Leases, the Rents or the remainder of the Security Property, (ii) to take
any action hereunder, (iii) to expend any money or incur any expenses or perform
or discharge any obligation, duty or liability with respect to any Lease, (iv)
to assume any obligation or responsibility for any deposits which are not
physically delivered to Mortgagee or (v) for any injury or damage to person or
property sustained in or about the Security Property.

      20. Mortgagor's Indemnities. So long as the License is in effect,
Mortgagor shall indemnify and hold Mortgagee harmless from and against any and
all liability, loss, cost, damage or expense which Mortgagee incurs under or by
reason of this assignment, or for any action taken by Mortgagee hereunder in
accordance with the terms hereof, or by reason of or in defense of any and all
claims and demands whatsoever which are asserted against Mortgagee arising out
of the Leases. In the event Mortgagee incurs any such liability, loss, cost,
damage or expense, the amount thereof together with all reasonable attorneys'
fees and interest thereon at the Default Rate shall be payable by Mortgagor to
Mortgagee, within 10 days after demand by Mortgagee, and shall be secured by
this Mortgage, provided that Mortgagor shall have no duty or liability hereunder
to indemnify and hold Mortgagee harmless from matters resulting from the willful
misconduct or gross negligence of Mortgagee.
