&#147;<u>Loan Documents</u>&#148;).</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The principal of this Note prior to any Default, as defined hereunder, shall bear interest on the unpaid balance thereof at a fixed rate per annum of 8.0%.&#160; All interest on this Note shall be computed daily on the basis of the actual number of days elapsed over a year assumed to consist of three hundred sixty (360) days (having 12 months of 30 days each).</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Principal of this Note shall be paid in a single payment on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of June, 2006.&#160; All accrued and unpaid interest shall be paid quarterly commencing on the 17<sup>th</sup> day of March, 2005, and on June 17, 2005, September 17, 2005, December 17, 2005 and March 17, 2006 thereafter, and on the Final Maturity Date and any and each other date that the principal balance of this Note is paid in full.</font></p>

The actual amount of principal due hereunder shall be the sum of all advances less the aggregate repayments thereof.&#160; Lender&#146;s records with respect to advances and repayments shall be presumed correct unless manifest error is shown.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All payments of principal and interest and any other sums due under this Note shall be made to Lender at the address first set forth above for the Lender in this Note or to such other person or at such other address as may be designated in writing by the Lender.&#160; All payments on this Note shall be applied first to the payment of any expenses or charges payable hereunder, and next to accrued interest, and then to the principal balance hereof, or in such other order as Lender may elect in its sole discretion.</font></p>

<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Note, the other Loan Documents, and all other agreements between the Borrower and the Lender, whether now existing or whether hereafter arising and whether written or oral, are hereby expressly limited so that in no contingency or event whatsoever, whether by reason of acceleration of the maturity hereof, or otherwise, shall the amount paid or agreed to be paid to the Lender for the use, forbearance or retention of money loaned hereunder, or advanced for the performance or payment of any covenant or obligation contained herein, in any other Loan Document, or in any other document evidencing, securing or pertaining to the indebtedness evidenced hereby, exceed the maximum amount permissible under applicable law.&#160; If from any circumstances whatsoever, fulfillment of any provision of this Note, the other Loan Documents, or of any such other document, at the time performance of such provisions shall
be due, shall involve transcending the limit of validity prescribed by law, then <u>ipso facto</u> the obligation to be fulfilled shall be reduced to the limit of such validity, and if from such circumstance the Lender shall ever receive anything of value deemed by applicable law to be interest in any amount that would exceed the highest lawful rate payable hereunder, an amount equal to any excessive interest shall be applied to the reduction of the principal amount owing hereunder and not to the payment of the interest, and if the amount that would be excessive interest exceeds the principal balance then owing, such excess shall be refunded to the party paying the same.</font></p>

<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Failure of the Lender to exercise any of its rights and remedies shall not constitute a waiver of the right to exercise the same at that or any other time.&#160; All rights and remedies of the Lender for Default under this Note shall be cumulative to the greatest extent permitted by law.&#160; Time shall be of the essence in the payment of all installments of interest and principal on this Note and the performance of Borrower&#146;s other obligations under this Note.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If there is any Default under this Note, and this Note is placed in the hands of an attorney for collection or is collected through any court, including any bankruptcy court, Borrower promises to pay to the Lender hereof its reasonable attorneys&#146; fees and court costs incurred in collecting or attempting to collect or securing or attempting to secure this Note or enforcing the Lender&#146;s rights in any collateral securing this Note, provided the same is legally allowed by the laws of the Commonwealth of Kentucky or any state where the collateral or part thereof is situated.</font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Without restricting any of the rights or remedies available to Lender, Lender shall have the right to set off, at any time after a Default by Borrower under this Note, without notice to Borrower or any guarantor of, or person or entity that has granted security for this Note, any and all deposits or other sums at any time or times credited by or due from Lender to Borrower, whether or not held by Lender in a special account or other account or represented by a certificate of deposit (whether or not matured), which deposits and other sums shall at all times constitute additional security for the obligations of the Borrower arising under this Note and under any of the other Loan Documents.&#160; Borrower hereby grants to Lender a lien on and a continuing security interest in all instruments, documents, securities, cash, chattel paper, general intangibles, deposits, certificates of deposit, other property,
and the cash and noncash proceeds of any of the foregoing, owned by Borrower or in which Borrower has an interest, which now or hereafter are at any time in possession or control of Lender, or in transit by mail or carrier to or from Lender or in the possession of any third party on behalf of Lender, without regard to whether Lender received the same in pledge, for safekeeping, as an agent for collection or transmission or otherwise, or whether Lender had conditionally released the same, all of which shall at all times constitute additional security for the obligations of Borrower hereunder and under the Loan&#160; Documents, and all of which may be applied at any time after Default by Borrower with respect to any of said obligations, without notice to Borrower or any guarantor of, or person or entity that has granted security for this Note, in such order as Lender may determine.</font></p>

estimation shall be necessary to cover the cost of restoration shall at the option of Mortgagee be retained by Mortgagee, without application as aforesaid, and be applied and paid over toward the restoration of the Property, or any part thereof, to its former condition in substantially the same manner and subject to the same conditions as those provided in <u>Paragraph 17</u> hereof with respect to insurance and other monies.
