<font size="2" face="Times New Roman"><b>University of Kentucky Expands Collaborative Program with Large Scale Biology Corporation for Developing Pharmaceuticals from Tobacco</b></font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">VACAVILLE, CALIFORNIA, December 23, 2004.&#160;&#160; Large Scale Biology Corporation (Nasdaq: LSBC) today announced the filing of an SEC Form 8-K statement covering additional financing for the Company from Kentucky Technology, Inc., a for-profit economic development company formed by the University of Kentucky.&#160; The $2.9 million loan will be used for further development and commercialization of LSBC&#146;s technologies for plant-made pharmaceuticals and enhancement of collaborative programs between the University of Kentucky (UK) and LSBC. </font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">LSBC&#146;s biomanufacturing facility is located in Owensboro, Kentucky.&#160; The Company develops and manufactures therapeutic proteins and vaccines using tobacco-related varieties as its host plants.&#160; LSBC is already working with UK&#146;s Tobacco Research and Development Center scientists to develop varieties of tobacco and agricultural practices that enhance the production yield and efficiency of plant-made pharmaceuticals to maximize the value of LSBC&#146;s proprietary technologies.&#160; The new support will help focus the UK/LSBC collaboration on LSBC&#146;s and third-party product targets with commercial potential.&#160; </font></p>
<p>
<font size="2" face="Times New Roman">&#147;The University of Kentucky&#146;s unique agronomic programs complement LSBC&#146;s protein manufacturing technologies very well, and we look forward to expanding what is already a successful collaboration,&#148; said Ronald J. Artale, LSBC&#146;s Chief Operating Officer.&#160;&#160; &#147;The new financing creates a vehicle for UK scientists to work with our bioprocessing experts at our Owensboro bioprocessing campus on projects of mutual interest.&#160; We are very pleased with the University&#146;s support of this program,&#148; Mr. Artale concluded.</font></p>
