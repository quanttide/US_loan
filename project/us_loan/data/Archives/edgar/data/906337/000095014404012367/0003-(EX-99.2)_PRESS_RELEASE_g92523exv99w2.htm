<P align="center" style="font-size: 12pt"><B>PROXYMED SEPARATES CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER ROLE</B>


<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>Kevin McNamara to become Chairman; Michael Hoover to continue as Chief Executive Officer</I></DIV>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;ATLANTA, GA, December&nbsp;22, 2004 &#150; ProxyMed, Inc. (Nasdaq: PILL) (the &#147;Company&#148;), a leading
provider of healthcare transaction processing and medical cost containment services, announced
today that in keeping with good corporate governance practices it will separate the roles of the
Company&#146;s Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Kevin McNamara, who previously served as the
Chairman of the Audit Committee of the Board, will serve as the new Chairman of the Board. Michael
Hoover will continue to serve as the Chief Executive Officer of the Company. In addition to serving
as the Chairman of the Board, Mr.&nbsp;McNamara has entered into a consulting arrangement with Company
reflecting his increased level of activity at the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;The Board of Directors and I have determined that the separation of the offices of Chairman
and CEO can be a beneficial component of an effective corporate governance system,&#148; said Mr.
Hoover. Mr.&nbsp;Hoover noted that a number of Fortune 500 companies have taken similar action in the
recent past.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;McNamara has been an influential member of ProxyMed&#146;s Board of Directors since joining in
September&nbsp;2002. Prior to today&#146;s appointment, Mr.&nbsp;McNamara served as head of the Company&#146;s Audit
Committee. &#147;I am very pleased to have Kevin expand his role from Board member to Chairman,&#148; said
Mike Hoover. &#147;His background in healthcare and EDI, and his financial expertise have already been
invaluable to the Company in his role as Audit Committee Chair. With his expanded role, we look
forward to his additional contributions.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to his role with ProxyMed, Mr.&nbsp;McNamara currently serves as Chief Financial
Officer of HCCA International, Inc., a healthcare management and recruitment company, and is a
Director for Comsys IT Partners, Inc. where he also serves as the Chair of the Audit Committee.
From November&nbsp;1999 until February&nbsp;2001, Mr.&nbsp;McNamara served as Chief Executive Officer and a
director of Private Business, Inc., a provider of electronic commerce solutions that help community
banks provide accounts receivable financing to their small business customers. From 1996 to 1999,
Mr.&nbsp;McNamara served as Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer of Envoy Corporation.
Before joining Envoy, he served as president of NaBanco Merchant Services Corporation, then
