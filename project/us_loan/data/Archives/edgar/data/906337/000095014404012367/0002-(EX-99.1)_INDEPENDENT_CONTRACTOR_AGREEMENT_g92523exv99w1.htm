<P align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><U>INDEPENDENT CONTRACTOR AGREEMENT</U>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This Independent Contractor Agreement (&#147;Agreement&#148;) is entered into and effective as of the
21st day of December, 2004, between ProxyMed, Inc., 1854 Shackleford Ct., Ste. 200, Norcross, GA
30093 (the &#147;Company&#148;), and Kevin McNamara (&#147;Contractor&#148;), 5015 Fountainhead Drive, Brentwood TN
37027, with reference to the following facts:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company is engaged in the business of providing connectivity, medical cost containment
services, business process outsourcing solutions and related value-added products to physicians,
payers, pharmacies, medical laboratories, and other healthcare providers and suppliers.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">The Company desires to engage the services of Contractor as a consultant to the Company and its
Chief Executive Officer, which services shall be in addition to the duties of Contractor in
connection with his chairing the activities of the Board of Directors.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Contractor desires to perform services for the Company in this connection.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NOW, THEREFORE, the parties agree:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;1.&nbsp;SERVICES TO BE RENDERED.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractor shall provide to the Company such services as are reasonably requested by the Board
of Directors and the Company&#146;s Chief Executive Officer to assist the Chief Executive Officer in the
management of the Company. Contractor shall work diligently and use his best efforts to perform
such job responsibilities, and will devote a minimum of three business days per week (including
travel) to such endeavors. Contractor also agrees to make himself available by telephone when
additional communication relating to the provision of his services to the Company may so require.
Contractor shall have absolute discretion in deciding how to perform any services the Company may
require, subject to the direction of the Board of Directors. At Contractor&#146;s request, the Company
agrees to furnish such advice, information, and full cooperation as Contractor may reasonably
require. Contractor shall at all times comply with all applicable laws, rules, regulations, and
orders of any applicable government authority, and the Company&#146;s ethics policies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractor understands and acknowledges that he will, in connection with the provision of his
services to the Company, frequently be required to advise and/or consult with Company counsel (both
in-house and/or outside) to assist Company counsel in providing legal advice/services to Company
management. Contractor and the Company acknowledge that such communications are necessary to allow
Company counsel to accomplish the purposes for which they have been, or will be, engaged. Moreover,
Contractor, while not an employee of the Company, will be acting as an agent of the Company in
making and receiving such communications. Contractor further understands and acknowledges that such
communications are strictly confidential, protected by the attorney-client privilege and/or
attorney work product doctrine, and are not to be disclosed to any third party without the express
written consent of the Company&#146;s General Counsel.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Except as provided in the second sentence of this paragraph, this Agreement shall be on a
month-to-month basis, and shall automatically renew unless either party gives thirty days written
notice of non-renewal to the other; provided, however, that neither party shall give notice of
non-renewal with respect to the first six months from the date of execution by both parties.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, (i)&nbsp;this Agreement may be terminated by the Company immediately upon
written notice to Contractor for any breach of this Agreement by Contractor and no unvested Options
as of such date shall vest upon such termination or thereafter, and (ii)&nbsp;this Agreement may be
terminated by the Company prior to the end of such six month period for any other reason and the
Company shall not be obligated to make any further payments to Contractor under paragraph 3 of this
Agreement after the effective date of such termination provided that all of the Options (as defined
below) shall immediately vest upon the effective date of such termination.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;3.&nbsp;FEES &#038; EXPENSES.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Contractor shall be paid at the rate of $30,000.00 per month. Contractor will also be granted
options (the &#147;Options&#148;) on 75,000 shares of the Company&#146;s common stock with an exercise price equal
to the closing price of the Company&#146;s stock on the 8<SUP>th</SUP> of December&nbsp;2004 and with a term
of 10&nbsp;years. The Options shall vest at a rate of 6,250 shares on each monthly anniversary of the
date of this Agreement so long as it continues in effect; provided that all of such Options shall
be become fully vested as provided in paragraph 2 of this Agreement or in the event of a change of
control (as such term will be defined in the agreement governing the Options) of the Company
occurring prior to the one year anniversary of the date of this Agreement regardless of whether
this Agreement has been terminated (other than as a result of a breach by Contractor). Contractor
shall also be reimbursed for all reasonable out-of-pocket expenses incurred in the performance of
its obligations hereunder, upon submission of reasonable documentation of such expenses.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;4.&nbsp;STATUS OF CONTRACTOR.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In performing under this Agreement, Contractor is and shall at all times be acting and
performing as an independent contractor to the Company, performing his duties in accordance with
his own judgment. The Company shall neither have nor exercise any control or direction over the
methods by which Contractor performs his work and function nor shall the Company have the right to
interfere with such freedom of action or prescribe rules or otherwise control or direct the manner
in which such services are performed, subject, in each case, to the reasonable oversight and
direction of the Board of Directors. The sole interest of the Company in the services performed by
Contractor is that such services be performed by Contractor in a legal, competent, efficient, and
satisfactory manner. Consistent with the foregoing, the Company shall not make any deduction with
respect to Contractor for any payroll taxes, contributions for unemployment or workers&#146;
compensation insurance, social security premiums, or other benefits which are customarily measured
by wages, salaries or other compensation paid to an employee. Contractor shall indemnify and hold
harmless the Company from and against any and all taxes, fees, or penalties assessed against the
Company as a result of the Company&#146;s failure to make such deductions. Nothing contained herein
shall cause the relationship between the parties to be that of employer and employee. Except to the
limited extent, if any, necessary to preserve the integrity of the attorney-client privilege
applicable to communications described in paragraph 1
