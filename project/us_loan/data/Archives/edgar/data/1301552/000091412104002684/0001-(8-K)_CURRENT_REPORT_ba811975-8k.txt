ITEM 8.01. Other Events

            On August 26, 2004, Banc of America Mortgage Securities, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), sold Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2004-H, Class 1-A-1, Class 1-A-2, Class 1-A-R, Class
1-A-LR, Class 2-A-1, Class 2-A-2, Class B-1, Class B-2 and Class B-3 (the
"Offered Certificates"), having an aggregate original principal balance of
$595,929,100. The Offered Certificates were issued pursuant to a Pooling and
Servicing Agreement, dated August 26, 2004, among the Registrant, Bank of
America, N.A., as servicer ("BANA") and Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as trustee (the
"Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as an exhibit hereto. Mortgage
Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-H, Class 1-IO, Class 2-IO, Class B-4,
Class B-5 and Class B-6 Certificates, having an aggregate initial principal
balance of $4,201,749.44 (the "Private Certificates" and, together with the
Offered Certificates, the "Certificates"), were also issued pursuant to the
Agreement.

            As of the date of initial issuance, the Offered Certificates
evidenced an approximate 99.30% undivided interest in a trust (the "Trust"),
consisting principally of two pools of adjustable interest rate, monthly pay,
fully-amortizing, one- to four-family residential first mortgage loans. The
remaining undivided interests in the Trust are evidenced by the Private
Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement. Distributions of interest and in reduction of principal balance on
any Distribution Date will be made to the extent that the Pool Distribution
Amount (as defined in the Agreement) is sufficient therefor.

            Elections will be made to treat the Trust as two separate REMICs for
federal income tax purposes (the "Upper-Tier REMIC" and the "Lower-Tier REMIC"
and each a "REMIC"). The Class 1-A-1, Class 1-A-2, Class 2-A-1, Class 2-A-2,
Class 1-IO, Class 2-IO, Class B-1, Class B-2, Class B-3, Class B-4, Class B-5
and Class B-6 Certificates will be treated as "regular interests" in the REMIC
and the Class 1-A-R and Class 1-A-LR Certificates will be treated as the
"residual interest" in the Upper-Tier REMIC and the Lower-Tier REMIC,
respectively.
