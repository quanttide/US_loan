           Standard; Transfer of Listing.

On July 13, 2004, AirNet Communications Corporation (the "Company") reported in
a Current Report filed on Form 8-K that the Nasdaq Stock Market, Inc. (the
"Nasdaq") had informed the Company that as of June 30, 2004 the Company's common
stock had closed below the minimum $1.00 per share requirement for continued
inclusion under Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5) and that the Company had until
December 27, 2004, to regain compliance with the $1 bid price.

On December 23, 2004, the Nasdaq informed the Company that it had regained
