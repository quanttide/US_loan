   AirNet Communications Regains Compliance With Nasdaq National Market Rules

    MELBOURNE, Fla.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 28, 2004--AirNet
Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:ANCCD) announced that it has
received notification from the Nasdaq Listing Qualifications
Department that AirNet has regained compliance with the minimum bid
price requirements for continued listing on the Nasdaq National Market
under Marketplace Rule 4450(a)(5).
    On June 30, 2004, AirNet was notified that its common stock had
closed below the minimum bid price of $1.00 for a period of 30
consecutive business days, creating a condition of non-compliance with
the Marketplace Rules of The NASDAQ Stock Market. Since then, the
closing bid price of AirNet's common stock has been at $1.00 per share
or greater for at least 10 consecutive business days. On December 23,
2004, Nasdaq advised AirNet that it has regained compliance and the
matter is now closed.
    On December 28, 2004, SCP Private Equity Partners II, L.P.
converted $2 million in principal amount of its senior secured
convertible note into 1,910,689 shares of AirNet's common stock. In
addition, on December 28, 2004, TECORE, Inc. converted $1 million in
accrued interest on its senior secured convertible note into 955,345
shares of AirNet's common stock. Both of these conversions were
voluntary and will assist AirNet in complying with the stockholders'
equity requirement set forth in continued listing standard #1
described in Nasdaq Marketplace Rule 4450(a).
