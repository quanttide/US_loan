<DIV align="center" style="font-size: 10pt"><I>- 2005 EPS Expected to Increase 11% to 15% Over Comparable 2004 Level -</I></DIV>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>MIAMI, December&nbsp;20, 2004 </B>&#150; Ryder System, Inc. (NYSE:R), a global leader in transportation
management and supply chain solutions, today announced it forecasts full-year 2005 earnings to be
in the range of $3.20 to $3.30 per diluted share. This represents an earnings per diluted share
(EPS)&nbsp;increase of 11% to 15% over the midpoint of Ryder&#146;s most recent comparable full-year 2004
forecast.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder&#146;s current full-year 2004 EPS forecast of $3.08 to $3.11 includes $0.23 in gains from the
sale of the Company&#146;s headquarters complex. Excluding those gains for comparison purposes, the
midpoint of the Company&#146;s full-year 2004 EPS forecast is $2.87.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&#147;We are forecasting Ryder&#146;s 2005 revenue to grow by 4%,&#148; said Ryder Chairman, President and
Chief Executive Officer Greg Swienton. &#147;Our team is committed to executing its sales plan,
assuming only moderate economic growth conditions. This includes attracting, retaining and
expanding customers across all product lines. Transactional business, such as commercial rental and
used vehicle sales, should remain strong and we expect to drive additional growth from long-term
contractual business, including Full Service Lease, Dedicated Contract Carriage and our full range
of Supply Chain Solutions.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Commenting on the Company&#146;s financial objectives for 2005, Ryder Executive Vice President and
Chief Financial Officer Tracy Leinbach said, &#147;We will maintain our strong balance sheet as we
replenish our fleet and invest in operational capabilities and other initiatives to enable growth.
Targeted opportunities in cost management and process improvements should further enhance our
earnings leverage as we work to grow the business in 2005.&#148;


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ryder has also filed a Form 8-K with the Securities and Exchange Commission providing an
update on the IRS audit of its federal income tax returns for 1998 through 2000. A copy of the
Form 8-K can be found in the investors area of Ryder&#146;s website at <U>www.ryder.com</U>.
