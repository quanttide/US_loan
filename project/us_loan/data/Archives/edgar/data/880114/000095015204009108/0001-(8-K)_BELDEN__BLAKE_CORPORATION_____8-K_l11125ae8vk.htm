<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On
December&nbsp;20, 2004, the
Company agreed with Capital C Energy Operations, LP, the Company&#146;s sole stockholder, to terminate the Management Services Agreement between the Company and Capital C Energy Operations, LP. Pursuant to the Management Services Agreement, the Company paid a quarterly fee of $250,000 to Capital C Energy Operations, LP for management services provided to the Company by certain officers of Capital C Energy Operations, LP. The parties determined that the
agreement was no longer necessary. The Company will incur no early termination penalties in connection with the termination of the Management Services Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;5.02 &nbsp;&nbsp; Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of Principal Officers</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;16, 2004, (i)&nbsp;the Company accepted the resignations of Frost W. Cochran,
President, Chief Executive Officer and director, David M. Carmichael, Chairman of the Board of
Directors and director, B. Dee Davis, Jr., Senior Vice President, and W. Mac Jensen, Senior Vice

of Legend Natural Gas, LP and Legend Natural Gas II, LP (collectively, &#147;Legend&#148;), each a privately

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Preliminary Reserve Evaluation</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have begun the process of gathering and evaluating information relating to our proved
reserves estimate as of December&nbsp;31, 2004. Based on this preliminary evaluation, we believe that
the December&nbsp;31, 2004 proved reserves estimate is likely to be less than the December&nbsp;31, 2003
proved reserves estimate included in our 2003 Form 10-K.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During 2004, our drilling focused on proved undeveloped locations. We expect to report that a
substantial portion of this drilling did not add new proved reserves, but rather, converted proved
undeveloped reserves into proved developed reserves. As a result of this drilling, coupled with
our production in 2004, we expect our total proved reserves to decrease by approximately 18 Bcfe.
We believe this decrease will be primarily in the proved undeveloped reserves category.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition, based on our preliminary evaluation, we believe that it is reasonably possible
that the December&nbsp;31, 2004 proved reserves estimate could reflect a further decrease of 25 to 50
Bcfe from the December&nbsp;31, 2003 proved reserves estimate. We believe this reduction also will be
primarily in the proved undeveloped reserves category. This decrease is expected to result from
several factors including, but not limited to, the following:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">- recent production and drilling results;<BR>
- - reevaluation of our inventory of proved undeveloped well sites; and<BR>
- - reevaluation of our estimated future development, completion and operating costs


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our evaluation is based on the preliminary information we have available. The reserve
estimates at December&nbsp;31, 2004 could be significantly different than the estimates provided above.
The results of our evaluation could change after taking into account the impact of additional
information we will gather subsequent to our preliminary review, the effect of the changes in
prices for oil and natural gas which have occurred during the year, and other factors that will be
considered in preparing the reserves estimates.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We expect to review this information with Wright &#038; Company, Inc., independent petroleum
consultants, in conjunction with the preparation of the reserves estimate as of December
31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reserves estimates are based upon various assumptions, including assumptions required by the
Securities and Exchange Commission relating to oil and natural gas prices, drilling and operating
expenses, capital expenditures, taxes and availability of funds. The process of estimating reserves
is complex. This process requires significant decisions and assumptions in the evaluation of
available geological, geophysical, engineering and economic data for each reservoir. Furthermore,
different reserve engineers may make different estimates of reserves and cash flow based on the
same available data and these differences may be significant. Therefore, these estimates are not
precise. Actual future production, oil and natural gas prices, revenues, taxes, development expenditures, operating expenses and quantities of recoverable oil and natural gas reserves will most likely vary from those estimated. In addition, we may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history,
results of exploration and development, prevailing oil and natural gas prices and other factors,
many of which are beyond our control.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a result of the amount of our consolidated excess cash flow (as defined in our credit
agreement) for the second half of 2004, we anticipate having a mandatory prepayment requirement
under our credit facility. This payment would be required to be made on or before April&nbsp;15, 2005.
We elected to prepay $10&nbsp;million on December&nbsp;16, 2004. As of December&nbsp;17, 2004 the outstanding
balance on our term credit facility was approximately $90&nbsp;million and our cash balance was
approximately $12&nbsp;million.
