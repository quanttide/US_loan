RELEASE</b></p>





<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-autospace:none'><b>SYS TECHNOLOGIES TO TRADE ITS STOCK ON
AMERICAN STOCK EXCHANGE&nbsp;</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;text-autospace:none'><b>First Day on AMEX Set for January 3, 2005</b></p>

<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'><b>SAN DIEGO, CA - December 29, 2004</b> - SYS Technologies, (OTC BB: SYYS), a provider of engineering, management and information technology
consulting services and solutions to commercial and U.S. government customers, announced today that its stock will begin trading on the
American Stock Exchange effective January 3, 2005 under the ticker symbol SYS.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>Cliff Cooke, president and CEO of SYS
Technologies, said, &quot;We are very pleased to be able to start 2005 with a
listing on the American Stock Exchange.&nbsp; We believe that our current and future
shareholders will benefit from the specialist system in place there, from the
heightened profile that the listing gives our stock and from the greater
liquidity we expect from trading on the Amex.&quot;</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>The Company was approved for listing on the American
Stock Exchange based upon a review by an Exchange Listing Qualifications Panel
which authorized approval of the listing pursuant to Section 1203(c) of the
American Stock Exchange Company Guide;
notwithstanding the fact that the Company does not fully satisfy the Exchange
regular initial listing standards with respect to Standard 1, i.e., price per
share requirement. The Panel's decision was based upon its determination that
the Company satisfies the minimum Alternative Listing Standards and its
affirmative finding that mitigating factors warrant listing pursuant to the
Alternative Listing Standards.</p>



<p class=MsoNormal style='text-align:justify;text-autospace:none'>Specifically, the Panel noted the Company's consistent
earnings performance, its strong and conservative management, and the fact that
it significantly exceeded certain of the initial listing standards in Sections
101 and 1203 (c) of the AMEX Company Guide (e.g., stockholders equity,
operating history, market value of public float, and pre-tax income).&nbsp; The
panel was also impressed with the potential for the Company's business.</p>
