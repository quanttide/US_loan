		--Expands Markets Outside of the DOD--
		<p>--Offers Intellectual Property and Systems Capabilities to Existing
		Customers-- </p>
		<p>SAN DIEGO, CA, December 16, 2004 - SYS Technologies, Inc. (&quot;SYS&quot;) (OTCBB:
		SYYS), a provider of engineering, management and information technology
		consulting services and solutions, today announced that it has acquired
		the assets of Xsilogy, Inc. (&quot;Xsilogy&quot;), a provider of wireless sensor
		network technologies and applications. Xsilogy, a privately held, San
		Diego-based company, develops and markets low-cost wireless sensor
		modules, infrastructure products and software for creating, deploying
		and managing large machine-to-machine (&quot;M2M&quot;) networks in industrial
		applications. Xsilogy's customers and partners include Ashland, Motorola
		and Royal Dutch/Shell among others. Terms of the acquisition were not
		disclosed. </p>
		<p>Cliff Cooke, Chief Executive Officer of SYS said, &quot;The acquisition of
		Xsilogy's wireless sensor technology is an important part of our growth
		strategy, representing our first expansion into the products-oriented
		business and to customers outside of the Department of Defense (DoD).
		Xsilogy provides us with the ability to expand our markets to the
		industrial arenas where the company has a proven domain expertise, while
		offering existing customers, such as the US Military, Homeland Security
		and state and local governments, these new capabilities. Our goal is to
		integrate products and services so that we can provide complete systems
		solutions to the unique problems within these markets.&quot; </p>
		<p>&quot;The combination of this technology together with our expertise in
		systems design and integration positions SYS for the next great wave of
		the digital era where virtually all high-value capital intensive assets
		and electronic devices will become networked and accessible via
		Internet-based communications, referred to as smart devices,&quot; said Cliff
		Cooke, CEO of SYS. &quot;Applications include remote asset location and
		tracking; diagnostics and predictive maintenance; and control and
		automation all of which are focused on asset optimization and management
		for a broad set of markets including industrial, transportation and
		government customers,&quot; added Mr. Cooke. </p>
		<p>SYS will create a new division, Xsilogy Sensor Networking to be lead
		by Rick Kriss, Xsilogy Founder and CEO, that will focus on this asset
		optimization and management market. Harbor Research, an independent
		market research firm, estimates that asset optimization savings
		potential is in excess of $30 billion per year. Xsilogy's wireless
		monitoring systems empower customers to continuously watch over any
		critical process at anytime from anywhere, delivering real time graphs,
		trends, alarms, and analysis to customers. Xsilogy networks also enable
		industrial users to gain real time access to remote sensor points, re
		deploy labor, streamline logistics, and avoid costly process upset
		conditions. </p>
		<p>Mr. Cooke continued, &quot;The acquisition of Xsilogy completes Phase I of
		our five-year corporate growth plan. Our goals were to profitably grow
		the business, both organically and through acquisitions, build-up our
		infrastructure in terms of people and processes, add product based
		technologies to our service capabilities, and target compatible
		technology business markets outside of the DoD.&quot; </p>
		<p>&quot;We have accomplished a five-fold increase in revenues over the last
		five years and have significantly enhanced our infrastructure for
		business management, corporate oversight, business development, and
		engineering process enhancement. While most of the growth to date has
		been organic, our successful acquisition and integration of Polexis has
		also enhanced our growth. Our focus now is to continue our growth in the
		military marketplace while expanding into industrial and homeland
		security markets,&quot; concluded Mr. Cooke. </p>
