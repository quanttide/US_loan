ITEM 8.01.    Other Events
              ------------

            On August 26, 2004, Banc of America Mortgage Securities, Inc., a
Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), sold Banc of America Alternative Loan
Trust 2004-8 Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-8, Class 1-CB-1,
Class 1-CB-R, Class 2-CB-1, Class CB-IO, Class 3-A-1, Class 15-IO, Class 15-PO,
Class X-PO, Class 30-B-1, Class 30-B-2, Class 30-B-3, Class 15-B-1, Class 15-B-2
and Class 15-B-3 (the "Offered Certificates"), having an aggregate original
principal balance of $271,583,967. The Offered Certificates were issued pursuant
to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated August 26, 2004, among the
Registrant, Bank of America, N.A., as servicer ("BANA"), and Wells Fargo Bank,
N.A., as trustee (the "Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as an exhibit
hereto. Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-8, Class 30-B-4, Class
30-B-5 Class 30-B-6, Class 15-B-4, Class 15-B-5 and Class 15-B-6 Certificates,
having an aggregate initial principal balance of $3,034,542 (the "Private
Certificates" and, together with the Offered Certificates, the "Certificates"),
were also issued pursuant to the Agreement.

            As of the date of initial issuance, the Offered Certificates
evidenced an approximate 98.90% undivided interest in a trust (the "Trust"),
consisting principally of three pools of fixed interest rate, conventional,
monthly pay, fully-amortizing, one- to four-family residential first mortgage
loans. The remaining undivided interests in the Trust are evidenced by the
Private Certificates distributions on which are subordinated to distributions on
the Offered Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement. Distributions of interest and in reduction of principal balance on
any Distribution Date will be made to the extent that the related Pool
Distribution Amount is sufficient therefor.

            Elections will be made to treat the Trust as a REMIC for federal
income tax purposes (the "REMIC"). The Class 1-CB-1, Class 2-CB-1, Class CB-IO,
Class 3-A-1, Class 15-IO, Class 15-PO, Class X-PO, Class 30-B-1, Class 30-B-2,
Class 30-B-3, Class 30-B-4, Class 30-B-5, Class 30-B-6, Class 15-B-1, Class
15-B-2, Class 15-B-3, Class 15-B-4, Class 15-B-5 and Class 15-B-6 Certificates
and each Class IO and Class PO Component will be treated as "regular interests"
in the REMIC and the Class 1-CB-R Certificate will be treated as the "residual
interest" in the REMIC.
