                      HAUPPAUGE DIGITAL REPORTS FISCAL 2004
                           YEAR END FINANCIAL RESULTS
        ----------------------------------------------------------------

 Fiscal year sales increase 28%, net income of $0.19 per share versus loss of
                          $.09 per share in prior year
        ----------------------------------------------------------------


HAUPPAUGE,  NY - December 21, 2004 - Hauppauge Digital,  Inc. (NASDAQ:  HAUP), a
leading  developer of digital video TV and data broadcast  receiver products for
personal  computers,  today  reported  financial  results for the fiscal  fourth
quarter and fiscal year ended September 30, 2004.

FOURTH QUARTER RESULTS
- ----------------------

Net sales were $16.5  million for the fourth  quarter  compared to $11.5 million
for the  previous  year's  fourth  quarter,  an increase of  approximately  43%.
Increases in sales of our retail  personal  video  recorder  products,  personal
video  recorder  products for Windows XP Media Center sold to the OEM market and
European  digital TV receiver  products  coupled  with the  increase in the Euro
exchange rate were the primary reasons for the sales increase.

Gross profit  percentage  increased to 25.58% for the fourth  quarter,  compared
with a gross  profit of 23.43% for the  previous  year's  fourth  quarter.  Cost
reductions,  a  favorable  sales mix of higher  gross  margin  products  and the
increase in the Euro  exchange  rate were  primarily  responsible  for the gross
profit increase.

Selling,   General  and   Administrative   costs  increased  by  $574,246.   The
strengthening of the value of the Euro to the U.S. dollar increased  expenses in
our European  division.  In addition,  increases  in sales  related  promotional
expenses and marketing  programs and higher costs  attributable  to professional
services contributed to the increase in SGA expenses.  Spending for research and
development  increased  $180,882,  mainly due to the  addition of  research  and
development  personnel and the opening of a research and development facility in
Taiwan.

Net income for the fourth fiscal quarter increased to $119,261 compared to a net
loss of $875,554 for the fourth quarter ended September 30, 2003. Net income per
share was $0.01 on a basic and diluted basis compared to net a loss per share of
$0.10 on a basic and diluted basis for the prior year's fourth quarter.

FISCAL YEAR RESULTS
- -------------------

Net sales were $65.3  million for the year ended  September 30, 2004 compared to
$51.0 million for the previous  fiscal year, an increase of  approximately  28%.
Increases in sales of our retail  personal  video  recorder  products,  personal
video  recorder  products  for  Windows XP Media  Center sold to the OEM market,
European  digital TV  receiver  products,  TV tuners for laptop  computers,  the
introduction of the MediaMVP and the increase in the Euro exchange rate were the
primary reasons for the sales increase.

Gross profit percentage  increased to 26.47% for the fiscal year ended September
30, 2004,  compared  with a gross profit of 24.02% for the previous  year.  Cost
reductions,  a  favorable  sales mix of higher  gross  margin  products  and the
increase in the Euro  exchange  rate were  primarily  responsible  for the gross
profit increase.

Selling,  General and Administrative costs,  including legal expenses related to
litigation  and  arbitration  proceedings,  increased by $1,777,744 for the year
ended September 30, 2004. The strengthening of the value of the Euro to the U.S.
dollar increased  expenses in our European division.  In addition,  increases in
sales related promotional expenses and marketing programs, increased legal costs
and fees  attributable  to  professional  services  contributed to the remaining
increase in SGA  expenses.  Spending  for  research  and  development  increased
$118,981,  mainly due to the addition of research and development  personnel and
the opening of a research and development facility in Taiwan.

Net income for the fiscal year ended  September 30, 2004 increased to $1,825,148
compared  to a loss of $814,032  for the prior year.  Basic net income per share
was $0.20 and  diluted  net income per share was $0.19,  compared  to a loss per
share of $0.09 on a basic and diluted  basis for the prior year.  The  financial
results  for the fiscal  year ended  September  30,  2004  included  $987,300 in
arbitration and litigation  charges and legal fees,  which reduced net income by
$0.10 per share on a diluted basis.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS
- ---------------------

Ken Plotkin,  Hauppauge's Chief Executive Officer stated "Worldwide sales growth
in our targeted  product  areas in fiscal  2004,  especially  in North  America,
combined with a favorable Euro to dollar  exchange rate  contributed to our year
over year sales increase. Our gross profit margins were helped by an increase in
sales of our high end products plus the increase in the Euro to dollar  exchange
rate, but this increase was offset somewhat by the increase in our OEM business,
which is a low margin  business.  If the Euro to dollar exchange rate stabilizes
in fiscal  2005,  and if our OEM  business  becomes a larger  percentage  of our
sales, our gross profit margins will tend to decline.

Hauppauge  introduced several new products late in fiscal 2004, and we hope that
these  new  products  will  increase  their  contributions  to  both  sales  and
profitability in fiscal 2005.

Lastly,  in  fiscal  2004,  we  are  happy  to  have  concluded  litigation  and
arbitration proceedings which cost the company approximately $1 million."
