<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif"><b>NEWARK, Del., December 16, 2004 - </b>Strategic Diagnostics Inc. (Nasdaq: SDIX)<b> - </b> a leading provider of antibody products and analytical test kits for the food-safety and water-quality markets, has been awarded a contract to supply the United Nations Environmental Programme (UNEP) with on-site testing systems for site investigations in Iraq.  The $100,000 order is the first for SDI with the UNEP, which provides environmental expertise and guidance throughout the world.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">As discussed in an article in the business section of today&#8217;s Delaware News Journal, (<u>www.delawareonline.com</u>), the UNEP project, being performed in conjunction with the Post-Conflict Assessment Unit (PCAU) and the Iraqi Ministry of Environment, contains five sites selected from a list of ten priority sites for a pilot study.  It has been estimated that there are over 300 such contaminated sites in Iraq.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Matthew Knight, President of Strategic Diagnostics commented, &#8220;The current market for environmental testing is estimated to be more than $1.5 billion.  Through projects such as the UNEP work in Iraq, SDI can further demonstrate how on-site testing can be used to give superior results and lower total overall project cost allowing for a more cost effective solution.  We feel that this can contribute significantly to the profitable growth of the company.  The UN contract included training for Iraqi nationals and UNEP staff performing the analyses, and we think that this training is critical to our overall success.  As more people begin to adapt the application of this technology, it will find a larger market around the world.&#8221;
</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Mr. Knight adds, &#8220;The UNEP project is using test systems across our portfolio of products, from fuel/oil detection kits to PCB kits to our Deltatox<sup>&reg;</sup> systems for a total environmental toxicity screen.  We consider this a further and growing endorsement of rapid, field-based testing systems.  In addition to the humanitarian benefit, this project connects SDI to new opportunities where cost and accessibility to laboratories are a major problem, and SDI can provide the solution.&#8221;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Strategic Diagnostics Inc. is the world-leading provider of the rapid, point-of-use test methods for determining quantitative and specific contamination in soil and water.  SDI technology is used by consultants, engineers, laboratories and environmental regulators to rapidly, reliably and cost-effectively characterize environmental contamination on-site, and conclusively test for effective removal or remediation of contamination.</font></p>
