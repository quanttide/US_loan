<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif"><b>NEWARK, Del., December 22, 2004 - </b>Strategic Diagnostics Inc. (Nasdaq: SDIX)<b> -</b> a leading provider of antibody products and analytical test kits for the food-safety and water-quality markets, today announced the signing of a distribution agreement with MicroBioTests, Inc. (MBT), a European supplier of complementary test kits.  Under the agreement, Strategic Diagnostics becomes the exclusive distributor for the Toxkit&#153; product lines of MBT in the United States and Canada.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">&#8220;We are delighted to enter into this agreement with MicroBioTests,&#8221; commented Matthew Knight, President of SDI.  &#8220;This agreement continues to position SDI as the single source solution for rapid, on-site toxicity and environmental tests.  The product line offers our customers requiring cultural methods an alternative to expensive and labor intensive protocols, allowing users to save both time and money while maintaining quality test results.  SDI recently exhibited the Toxkits&#153; product during the SETAC World Congress with favorable customer response.  Attendees were enthusiastic about the availability of new cultural toxicity testing methods. The addition of several new toxicity models will complement the SDI&#8217;s
Microtox<sup>&reg;</sup> platform, just as our recent addition of the MTI Metals System has expanded our environmental testing offering.&#8221;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Dr. Guido Persoone, President of MicroBioTests, Inc. stated &#8220;Through our agreement with SDI, MicroBioTests will be able to expand its growing customer base in North America.  There has been a tremendous paradigm shift around the world, such that toxicologists believe a &#8216;battery approach&#8217; to toxicity is needed to truly understand the environmental impacts of contamination.  This partnership allows SDI to provide complementary systems to their Microtox<sup>&reg;</sup> line, benefiting the end user, and strengthening both SDI and MBT.&#8221;</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Established in 2001, MicroBioTests, Inc., a Belgium-based company, has commercialized cost-effective, culture/maintenance free toxicity tests.  Toxkits&#153; have been adopted worldwide by toxicology professionals, and thousands of scientific papers have been published on the use of Toxkits&#153;.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="serif">Strategic Diagnostics Inc. is the world-leading provider of the rapid Microtox<sup>&reg;</sup> test methods for determining toxicity in freshwater, marine, and terrestrial environments.  SDI technology is used by industry, regulators and researchers to rapidly and cost-effectively monitor and control manufacturing processes, waste discharge, and guard against environmental impact and the effects of contaminants.</font></p>
