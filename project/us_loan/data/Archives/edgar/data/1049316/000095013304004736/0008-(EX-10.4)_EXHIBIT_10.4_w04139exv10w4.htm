to the amounts credited to his or her Deferred Fee Accounts at the time

shares from a Trustee&#146;s Stock Deferred Fee Account shall be made unless the

rules and regulations, including but not limited to corporate law, securities
law and stock exchange rules. If common shares may not be issued, subject to
compliance with applicable securities laws requirements, the Fair Market Value

time any person or persons, natural or otherwise, as his or her Beneficiary or
Beneficiaries to whom benefits are to be paid if he or she dies while entitled
to benefits. Each Beneficiary designation shall be made either in the Deferred
Fee Agreement or on a form prescribed by the Secretary of the Company and shall
be effective only when filed with the Secretary during the
Trustee&#146;s lifetime. Each Beneficiary designation filed with the Secretary
shall revoke all Beneficiary designations previously made by the Trustee. The
revocation of a Beneficiary designation shall not require the consent of any
designated Beneficiary. If the Trustee&#146;s designated Beneficiary predeceases
the Trustee, or no Beneficiary has been designated, the Trustee&#146;s Beneficiary
shall be deemed to be the Trustee&#146;s spouse or, if none, the Trustee&#146;s estate.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.2 <B>RIGHT TO TERMINATE</B>. The Board of Trustees may amend or terminate the

amendment or termination, or the amount of Interest accrued or number of Shares
credited, as of such date, to his or her account.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;9.3 <B>UNFUNDED OBLIGATION</B>. The obligation of the Company to pay any

Automotive REIT shall have the authority and responsibility to administer and
interpret the Trustee Plan. Benefits due and owing to a Trustee or Beneficiary
under the Trustee Plan shall be paid when due without any requirement that a
claim for benefits be filed. However, any Trustee or Beneficiary who has not
received the benefits to which he or she believes himself or herself entitled
may file a written claim with the President, who shall act on the claim within
thirty days, and such action on any such claim shall be conclusive. If there
is any conflict or inconsistency between the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan
and the Trustee Plan, the terms of the Equity Incentive Plan shall apply.
