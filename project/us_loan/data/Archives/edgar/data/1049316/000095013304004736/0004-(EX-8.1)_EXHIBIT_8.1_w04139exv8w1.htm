<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have requested certain opinions regarding the application of U.S. federal income tax laws
to Capital Automotive REIT (the &#147;Company&#148;) in connection with the purchase of 4,600,000 common
shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share (the &#147;Shares&#148;) of the Company pursuant to
that certain underwriting agreement, dated December&nbsp;21, 2004, among the Company, Capital Automotive
L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and the underwriters named therein, and the filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission of a prospectus supplement (the &#147;Prospectus Supplement&#148;) dated
December&nbsp;21, 2004 to the prospectus (the &#147;Prospectus&#148;) contained in the registration statement on
Form&nbsp;S-3, No.&nbsp;333-116189, which was declared effective on June&nbsp;24, 2004, (collectively, with the
Prospectus and Prospectus Supplement, the &#147;Registration Statement&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In rendering the following opinions, we have examined such statutes, regulations, records,
certificates and other documents as we have considered necessary or appropriate as a basis for such
opinions, including the following: (1)&nbsp;the Registration Statement, (2)&nbsp;the Declaration of Trust of
the Company, as amended, restated or supplemented (the &#147;Declaration of Trust&#148;), (3)&nbsp;certain written
representations of the Company contained in a letter to us dated as of the date hereof, (4)&nbsp;copies
of the leases entered into by the Company as of the date hereof, and (5)&nbsp;such other documents or
information as we have deemed necessary to render the opinions set forth in this letter. In our
review, we have assumed, with your consent, that the documents listed above that we reviewed in
proposed form will be executed in substantially the same form, all of the representations and
statements set forth in such documents are true and correct, and all of the obligations imposed by
any such documents on the parties thereto, including obligations imposed under the Declaration of
Trust have been or will be performed or satisfied in accordance with their terms. We also have
assumed the genuineness of all signatures, the proper execution of all documents, the authenticity
of all documents submitted to us as originals, the conformity to originals of documents submitted
to us as copies, and the authenticity of the originals from which any copies were made.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unless facts material to the opinions expressed herein are specifically stated to have been
independently established or verified by us, we have relied as to such facts solely upon the
representations made by the Company. To the extent that the representations of the Company are
with respect to matters set forth in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended (the &#147;Code&#148;) or
the regulations promulgated thereunder (the &#147;Treasury Regulations&#148;), we have reviewed with the
individuals making such representations the relevant provisions of the Code, the applicable
Treasury Regulations and published administrative interpretations thereof. We assume that each
representation made by the Company is and will be true, correct and complete, and that all
representations that speak in the future, or to the intention, or to the best of belief and
knowledge of any person(s) or party(ies) are and will be true, correct and complete as if made
without such qualification. Nothing has come to our attention which would cause us to believe that
any of such representations are untrue, incorrect or incomplete.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon and subject to the foregoing and to the qualifications below, we are of the opinion
that (i)&nbsp;the Company qualified as a REIT under the Code for its taxable years ending through
December&nbsp;31, 2003, (ii)&nbsp;the Company is organized in conformity with the requirements for
qualification as a REIT under the Code, and its current method of operation and ownership will
enable it to meet the requirements for qualification as a REIT for the current taxable year and for
future taxable years, (iii)&nbsp;the leases entered into by the Company constitute true leases for
federal income tax purposes, and (iv)&nbsp;the statements in the Prospectus set forth under the caption
&#147;Federal Income Tax Considerations,&#148; and in the Prospectus Supplement under the caption &#147;Additional
Federal Income Tax Considerations,&#148; insofar as they purport to describe or summarize certain
provisions of the agreements, statutes or regulations referred to therein, are accurate
descriptions or summaries in all material respects, and the discussion thereunder expresses the
opinion of Shaw Pittman LLP insofar as it relates to matters of United States federal income tax
law and legal conclusions with regard to those matters.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The opinions set forth in this letter are based on existing law as contained in the Code,
Treasury Regulations (including any Temporary and Proposed Regulations), and interpretations of the
foregoing by the Internal Revenue Service (&#147;IRS&#148;) and by the courts in effect (or, in case of
certain Proposed Regulations, proposed) as of the date hereof, all of which are subject to change,
both retroactively or prospectively, and to possibly different interpretations. Moreover, the
Company&#146;s ability to achieve and maintain qualification as a REIT depends upon its ability to
achieve and maintain certain diversity of stock ownership requirements and, through actual annual
operating results, certain requirements under the Code regarding its income, assets and
distribution levels. No assurance can be given as to whether, for any given taxable year, the
actual ownership of the Company&#146;s shares and its actual operating results and distributions satisfy
the tests necessary to achieve and maintain its status as a REIT. We assume no obligation to
update the opinions set forth in this letter. We believe that the conclusions expressed herein, if
challenged by the IRS, would be sustained in court. Because our positions are not binding upon the
IRS or the courts, however, there can be no assurance that contrary positions may not be
successfully asserted by the IRS.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The foregoing opinions are limited to the specific matters covered thereby and should not be
interpreted to imply the undersigned has offered its opinion on any other matter.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We hereby consent to the filing of this opinion as an exhibit to the Registration Statement.
The giving of this consent, however does not constitute an admission that we are &#147;experts,&#148; within
the meaning of Section&nbsp;11 of the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the &#147;Act&#148;), or within the
category of persons whose consent is required by Section&nbsp;7 of the Act.
