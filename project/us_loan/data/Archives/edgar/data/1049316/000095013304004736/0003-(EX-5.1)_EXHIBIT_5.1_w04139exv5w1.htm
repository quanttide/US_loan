<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">Ladies and Gentlemen:


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have acted as counsel to Capital Automotive REIT, a Maryland real estate investment trust
(the &#147;Company&#148;), in connection with the filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission under
the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, of a prospectus supplement to the prospectus contained in
the registration statement on Form&nbsp;S-3, No.&nbsp;333-116189 (collectively, the &#147;Registration
Statement&#148;), which was declared effective on June&nbsp;24, 2004. The prospectus supplement and
prospectus together are herein referred to as the &#147;Prospectus.&#148; The Prospectus relates to the
public offering of 4,600,000 common shares of beneficial interest, par value $.01 per share (the
&#147;Shares&#148;), of the Company, pursuant to the terms of an underwriting agreement, dated December&nbsp;21,
2004, by and among the Company, Capital Automotive L.P., a Delaware limited partnership, and the
underwriters named therein (the &#147;Underwriting Agreement&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the purposes of this opinion, we have examined copies of the following documents:

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In our examination of the aforesaid documents, we have assumed the legal capacity of all
natural persons, the genuineness of all signatures, the completeness and authenticity of all
documents submitted to us as originals, and the conformity to original documents of all documents
submitted to us as certified, telecopied, photostatic or reproduced copies.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In connection with the opinions expressed below, we have assumed that, at and prior to the
time of the sale and delivery of Shares pursuant to the Registration Statement, (i)&nbsp;the Resolutions
have not been amended, modified or rescinded, (ii)&nbsp;no stop order suspending the effectiveness of
the Registration Statement has been issued and no proceedings with respect thereto have been
commenced or threatened, and (iii)&nbsp;there has not occurred any change in law materially adversely
affecting the power of the Company to offer and sell the Shares or the validity of the Shares. We
have also assumed that the offering, sale and delivery of Shares will not, at the time of such
offering, sale and delivery, violate or conflict with (1)&nbsp;the Declaration of Trust, as then
amended, restated and supplemented, or Bylaws, as then amended, restated and supplemented, of the
Company, (2)&nbsp;any provision of any license, indenture, instrument, mortgage, contract, document or
agreement to which the Company is then a party or by which the Company is then bound, or (3)&nbsp;any
law or regulation or any decree, judgment or order then applicable to the Company. We have further
assumed that the number of Shares to be offered and sold pursuant to the Registration Statement
will not at the time of such offering and sale exceed the amount of common shares of beneficial
interest, par value $.01 per share, as at that time are authorized in the Declaration of Trust, as
then amended, restated or supplemented, and unissued (and not otherwise reserved for issuance).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based upon, subject to and limited by the foregoing, we are of the opinion that the Shares,
when sold, issued and delivered by the Company in accordance with the terms of the Underwriting
Agreement, will be validly issued, fully paid and nonassessable.
