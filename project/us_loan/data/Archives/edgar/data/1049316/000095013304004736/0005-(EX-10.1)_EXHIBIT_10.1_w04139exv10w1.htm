PHANTOM SHARE PURCHASE PROGRAM</B>







<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Article&nbsp;1. Introduction</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Capital Automotive REIT, a Maryland real estate investment trust (the
&#147;Company&#148;), has established the Capital Automotive Group Amended 1998 Equity
Incentive Plan (the &#147;EIP&#148;), which is hereby incorporated by reference. The EIP
permits the award of Phantom Shares and other forms of incentive compensation
to eligible employees. To further the objectives of the EIP, the Company
hereby establishes, effective May&nbsp;7, 1999, the Capital Automotive Group Phantom
Share Purchase Program (the &#147;Program&#148;), as set forth in this document. The
Program provides a mechanism for eligible employees to defer the receipt of a
portion of their annual bonuses through mandatory and voluntary purchases of
Phantom Shares authorized under the EIP. Unless otherwise expressly provided
in this Program, terms used in this Program shall have the same meanings given
to those terms under the EIP. If there is any conflict or inconsistency
between the terms of the EIP and the Program, the terms of the EIP shall apply.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Article&nbsp;2. Administration</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Program shall be administered by the Compensation Committee. Except as
limited by law and subject to the provisions herein, the Compensation Committee
shall have full power and discretion to construe and interpret the Program and
any agreement or instrument entered into under the Program, and establish,
amend or waive rules and regulations for the Program&#146;s administration.
Further, the Compensation Committee shall make all other determinations which
may be necessary or advisable for the administration of the Program. The
Compensation Committee may delegate its authority to the extent permitted by
law and consistent with the terms of the EIP. All determinations and decisions
made by the Compensation Committee pursuant to the provisions of the Program
shall be final, conclusive and binding on all persons, including the Company,
its shareholders, the Board, employees and their estates and beneficiaries.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>Article&nbsp;3. Eligibility and Participation</B>


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A common law employee of the Company who is an executive officer or other
highly compensated employee designated by the Compensation Committee (&#147;Eligible
Employee&#148;) shall be eligible to participate in the Program. Participation in
the Program shall be limited to a select group of management or highly
compensated employees of the Company. An Eligible Employee shall become a
participant in the Program (&#147;Participant&#148;) on the date he files a Deferral
Election Form with the Committee under Section&nbsp;4.2.

<P align="left" style="margin-left: 3%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt"><B>4.1 Deferral of Bonus Compensation</B>



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) 20% of any annual bonus payable to an Eligible Employee who is
an executive officer of the Company for services performed in each year
commencing on or after January&nbsp;1, 1999 shall be automatically deferred
under the Program.



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) Subject to the terms and provisions of the Program, an Eligible
Employee who is an executive officer of the Company may elect to defer
the payment of up to an additional 30% of any annual bonus payable to him
for services performed in any year commencing on or after January&nbsp;1,
1999; an Eligible Employee who is not an executive officer of the Company
may elect to defer the payment of up to 20% but not less than 5% of any
such annual bonus.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 3%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The Compensation Committee may, upon prior notice to the Participants,
change the percentages set forth in this Section&nbsp;4.1 from time to time.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.2 Deferral Election Form. </B>An Eligible Employee who elects a voluntary
deferral of bonus compensation pursuant to Section&nbsp;4.1(b) for a given year
shall file with the Company, no later than December&nbsp;15 of such year, a form
(&#147;Deferral Election Form&#148;) that shall specify the amount of deferral for that
year.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>4.3 Phantom Share Accounts</B>. The Company shall establish an account
(&#147;Deferral Account&#148;) for each Participant. A Participant&#146;s Deferral Account
shall be credited, as of the date the Executive Compensation Committee takes
action to approve the annual bonuses for such year, with a number of Phantom
Shares (rounded up to the next whole Share) equal to the bonus amount deferred
under Section&nbsp;4.1 divided by 80% of the Fair Market Value on that date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For purposes of the Program, &#147;Fair Market Value&#148; means the fair market
value of a share of common stock of the Company determined as of a particular
date as follows:



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) if the Shares trade on a national securities exchange, the
closing sale price on that date;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) if the Shares do not trade on any such exchange,
the closing sale price that the National Association of
Securities Dealers, Inc. Automated Quotation System (&#147;Nasdaq&#148;)
reports for such date;

average of the closing bid and asked prices that Nasdaq reports for such
date;



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) if there are no such closing bid and asked prices, the average
of the closing bid and asked prices as reported by any other commercial
service for such date; or



<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(e) for any date that is not a trading day, the Fair Market Value of
a Share for such date shall be determined by using the closing sale price
or the average of the closing bid and asked prices, as appropriate, for
the immediately preceding trading day.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.1 Payment of Dividend Equivalents. </B>Subject to Section&nbsp;5.2, each
Participant whose Deferral Account is credited with Phantom Shares shall
receive on the dividend payment date a payment in cash equal to the amount of
dividends which would be payable to him if such Phantom Shares were Shares held
by him on the dividend record date set by the Board. Unless and until the
Phantom Shares are paid to the Participant in accordance with Article&nbsp;6, the
Participant shall be entitled to such dividend equivalents. Cash dividend
equivalents paid hereunder are considered additional compensation and shall be
subject to income tax in the year paid to the Participant.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B>5.2 Deferral of Dividend Equivalents. </B>A Participant may elect to defer
payment of any dividend equivalents payable with respect to Phantom Shares
credited to his Deferral Account with respect to bonus compensation deferred
for any particular year. The Company expects that deferral of dividend
equivalents under this Section&nbsp;5.2 will defer any income tax until such amounts
are paid to the Participant. An election under this Section&nbsp;5.2 shall be filed
with the Company on the Deferral Election Form no later than December&nbsp;15 of the
year in which the services were performed. The Participant&#146;s Deferral Account
shall be credited as of the date dividend equivalents otherwise would have been
payable with a number of Phantom Shares (rounded up to the next whole Share)
equal to the amount of such dividend equivalents divided by the Fair Market
Value on that date.

<P align="left" style="margin-left:3%; font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) Phantom Shares credited to a Participant&#146;s Deferral Account
under Section&nbsp;4.3 shall be paid to the Participant on the third
anniversary of the date such Phantom Shares were credited to the
Participant&#146;s Phantom Share Account unless the Participant elects a later
payment date under Section&nbsp;6.1(b) or 6.1(c).

third anniversary of the date such Phantom Shares were credited to the
Participant&#146;s Phantom Share Account to either (i)&nbsp;a specified date not
earlier than the third anniversary of the date such Phantom Shares were
credited to his Deferral Account or (ii)&nbsp;the date the Participant
terminates employment with the Company or the first January&nbsp;15 following
termination of employment. Such election shall be filed with the Company
on the Deferral Election Form no later than December&nbsp;15 of the year
during which the services with respect to bonus compensation were
performed.

Participant&#146;s initial Deferral Election to extend the deferred delivery
date he elected under Section&nbsp;6.1(a) or 6.1(b), provided that the Company
receives such election at least one year and one day before the deferred
delivery date elected under Section&nbsp;6.1(a) or 6.1(b).

Committee may defer delivery of any Shares in payment of a Participant&#146;s
Deferral Account if the delivery of such Shares would constitute compensation
to the Participant that is not deductible by the Company due to the application
of Code Section&nbsp;162(m); <U>provided</U>, that any such Shares deferred under
this sentence shall in any event be delivered to the Participant on or before
the January&nbsp;15 of the first year in which the Participant is no longer a

Shares credited to a Participant&#146;s Deferral Account shall be converted to

administratively feasible following the Participant&#146;s request or termination.

with the Company voluntarily, involuntarily, by reason of death, disability, or
for any other reason:

Emergency, he may request the Compensation Committee to accelerate payment of
all or any portion of his Deferral Account. &#147;Unforeseeable Emergency&#148; means an
unanticipated emergency that is caused by an event beyond the control of the
Participant and that would result in severe financial hardship to the
Participant if early withdrawal were not permitted. Any early withdrawal
approved by the Compensation Committee shall be limited to the amount necessary
to meet the emergency.

minimum withholding requirement for supplemental wages, in whole or in part, by
withholding Shares having a Fair Market Value (determined on the date the
Participant recognizes taxable income) equal to the withholding tax required to
be collected on the transaction. The Participant may elect, subject to the
approval of the Compensation Committee, to deliver the necessary funds to
satisfy the withholding obligation to the Company, in which case there will be
no reduction in the Shares otherwise distributable to the Participant.
