statement of a material fact or omit to state any material fact necessary to make the statements
therein, in the light of the circumstances under which they were made, not misleading, or if it is
necessary at any time to amend the Prospectus to comply with the Act, the Company will promptly

any indemnified party and it notifies the indemnifying party of the commencement thereof, the
indemnifying party will be entitled to participate therein and, to the extent that it may wish,
jointly with any other indemnifying party similarly notified, to assume the defense thereof, with
counsel satisfactory to such indemnified party (who shall not, except with the consent of the
indemnified party, be counsel to the indemnifying party), and after notice from the indemnifying
party to such indemnified party of its election so to assume the defense thereof, the indemnifying
party will not be liable to such indemnified party under this Section for any legal or other
expenses subsequently incurred by such indemnified party in connection with the defense thereof
other than reasonable costs of investigation. In no event shall the indemnifying party be liable
for fees and expenses of more than one counsel, in addition to local counsel and counsel for the
indemnifying party, for all indemnified parties in connection with any one action or separate but
similar or related actions in the same jurisdiction, unless there are multiple indemnified parties
in such proceedings and any indemnified party is advised by counsel that representation of multiple
indemnified parties by the same counsel would be inappropriate due to an actual or potential
conflict of interest. No indemnifying party shall, without the prior written consent of the
indemnified party, effect any settlement of any pending or threatened action in respect of which
any indemnified party is or could have been a party and indemnity could have been sought hereunder
by such indemnified party unless such settlement (i)&nbsp;includes an unconditional release of such
indemnified party from all liability on any claims that are the subject matter of such action and
(ii)&nbsp;does not include a statement as to, or an admission of, fault, culpability or a failure to act
by or on behalf of an indemnified party.

contribute to the amount paid or payable by such indemnified party as a result of the losses,
claims, damages or liabilities referred to in subsection (a)&nbsp;or (b)&nbsp;above (i)&nbsp;in such proportion as
is appropriate to reflect the relative benefits received by the Company and the Partnership on the
one hand and the Underwriters on the other from the offering of the Offered Securities or (ii)&nbsp;if
the allocation provided by clause (i)&nbsp;above is not permitted by applicable law, in such proportion
as is appropriate to reflect not only the relative benefits referred to in clause (i)&nbsp;above but
also the relative fault of the Company and the Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on
the other in connection with the statements or omissions which resulted in such losses, claims,
damages or liabilities as well as any other relevant equitable considerations. The relative
benefits received by the Company and the Partnership on the one hand and the Underwriters on the
