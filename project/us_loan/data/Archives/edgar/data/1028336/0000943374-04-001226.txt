Item 1.01.        Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

On December  21, 2004,  the Board of Directors of Fidelity  Federal Bank & Trust
approved  the  adoption  of the  Fidelity  Federal  Bank & Trust 2005  Long-Term
Deferred  Compensation  Plan  effective  as of January 1, 2005 ("2005  Long-Term
Deferred  Compensation  Plan").  The  Fidelity  Federal  Savings Bank of Florida
Long-Term Deferred  Compensation Plan was frozen as to new contributions  and/or
deferrals  earned  following  December  31,  2004.  Accrued  benefits  under the
Fidelity Federal Savings Bank of Florida  Long-Term  Deferred  Compensation Plan
will continue to be governed by the terms of the  predecessor  plan.  All future
benefit  accruals will be governed by the 2005 Long-Term  Deferred  Compensation
Plan, which plan was drafted to comply with the requirements of the new Internal
Revenue Code Section 409A created by the American Jobs  Creation Act,  which was
signed into law on October 22,  2004.  New Section  409A  changes the income tax
treatment of nonqualified  deferred  compensation  plans and imposes a number of
new requirements that such plans must adopt,  both in form and in operation,  in
order to defer income for years beginning after December 31, 2004.

A  brief  description  of  certain  aspects  of  the  2005  Long-Term   Deferred
Compensation Plan follows.

(a)  Eligibility.  Certain  officers  selected  by the  Board of  Directors  may
     participate in the plan.

(b)  Amount of Contributions.  Each plan year a participant may elect,  prior to
     the  beginning of the plan year,  to defer any portion of his  compensation
     otherwise  payable to the participant  during the plan year, with a minimum
     deferral  amount  of not less  than  $2,400  during  the  deferral  period.
     Participants  who enter the plan at mid year must  defer a minimum  of $200
     times the number of months remaining in the deferral period.  Participants'
     accounts shall be credited  monthly with interest.  Fidelity Federal Bank &
     Trust may also make discretionary  contributions to participants'  accounts
     each plan year.

     Fidelity Federal Bank & Trust shall also credit to  participants'  accounts
each  plan  year  an  amount  designed  to  make  up for  the  lower  levels  of
contributions to the Fidelity Federal Savings Bank Savings Plan and the Fidelity
Federal  Employee  Stock  Ownership  Plan due to statutory  restrictions  on the
amount  of  contributions  that can be made  annually  to such  plans  under the
Internal Revenue Code.

(c)  Time and  Method  of  Payment.  All plan  benefits  other  than  in-service
     distributions or hardship withdrawals shall be paid to the participant upon
     termination  of  employment  for any reason  other than death in a lump sum
     payment,  over a period of 60, 120 or 180 months, or in a form equal to the
     actuarial  equivalent of the participant's  account balance, as selected by
     the  participant.  Payments  shall not commence  under the plan any earlier
     than 6 months,  and not later than 8 months,  after the end of the month in
     which the participant terminates employment.

     In the event the  participant  dies after  termination of  employment,  his
remaining unpaid account balance shall be paid to the participant's  beneficiary
over the remaining payout period.  In the event that the participant dies before

termination of employment,  the  participant's  account balance shall be paid to
his beneficiary in the form selected by the participant at the time he completed
his deferral commitment form.

     Participants  may  elect  to  receive  in-service  withdrawals  from  their
accounts  provided that (i) they make such election at the time the enter into a
deferral agreement,  (ii) the maximum amount that may be withdrawn is limited to
100%  of  the  deferred  amount,   less  interest  or   discretionary   employer
contributions,  and (iii) the amount  withdrawn  is paid in  consecutive  annual
installments  commencing no earlier than 7 years following the end of the period
in which the participant selected the early withdrawal option.

     In the event that a participant  suffers a severe  unforeseeable  financial
hardship in the form of a sudden illness of the participant,  his or her spouse,
or a dependent,  a loss of the participant's  property due to casualty, or other
similar   extraordinary,   unforeseeable   events  beyond  the  control  of  the
participant,   the  committee  that  administers  the  plan  may,  at  its  sole
discretion, make distributions to the participant in order to meet the financial
hardship.  Distributions  on account of  financial  hardship  are limited to the
amount necessary to meet the participant's  needs during the financial hardship.
Accelerated  payments are not permissible  under the plan except in the event of
an approved financial hardship of the participant.

(d)  Unsecured  Contractual  Rights. The plan shall at all times be unfunded and
     shall  constitute a mere  promise by Fidelity  Federal Bank & Trust to make
     benefit  payments  in the  future.  Neither a  participant,  nor his or her
     designated beneficiary,  shall have a preferred claim or, or any beneficial
     ownership in, any assets of Fidelity Federal Bank & Trust prior to the time
     benefits are paid,  including any  compensation  deferred by a participant.
     All rights created by the plan shall be unsecured contractual rights of the
     participant against Fidelity Federal Bank & Trust.
