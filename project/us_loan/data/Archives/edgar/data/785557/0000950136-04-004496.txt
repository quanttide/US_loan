                    TEAMSTAFF ANNOUNCES FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER
                     AND FISCAL YEAR 2004 FINANCIAL RESULTS

Somerset, NJ - December 21, 2004 - TeamStaff, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSTF), one of the
nation's leading providers of healthcare staffing and specialty payroll
services, today announced financial results for the quarter and fiscal year
ended September 30, 2004. As a result of TeamStaff's sale of its Professional
Employer Organization (PEO) segment on November 17, 2003, all results reported
in this release have been reclassified to show PEO operations and certain
related corporate expenses as discontinued operations.

TeamStaff's revenues from continuing operations for the three months ended
September 30, 2004 were $9.1 million, which was comprised of $8.0 million from
medical staffing services and $1.1 million from payroll services. This is
compared to $13.3 million in the comparable quarter last year, which was
comprised of $12.2 million from medical staffing services and $1.1 million from
payroll services. Sequentially, quarterly revenues from continuing operations of
$9.1 million decreased from $9.6 million in the third quarter of fiscal 2004,
which was comprised of $8.5 million from medical staffing services and $1.1
million from payroll services.

Commenting on the medical staffing industry, TeamStaff's President and CEO, T.
Kent Smith, stated, "During our fourth fiscal quarter, hospitals and other
facilities continued to offer additional hours to permanent staff. Weakness in
admissions caused many hospitals to continue to rely less on higher-cost
travelers. This increased utilization of permanent staff also slowed the
re-entry of travelers into the market. We have seen that many professionals who
once traveled for temporary positions are more likely to accept a permanent
position until they feel comfortable that they will be offered another
acceptable temporary position at the end of their current assignment. However,
given demographic realities and legislative initiatives, we remain very
optimistic about the business fundamentals and are better positioned than ever
for a rebound in temporary medical staffing."

Gross profit was $2.3 million, or 25.0% of revenues, in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 2004 as compared to $2.6 million or 19.5% of revenues in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2003. Sequentially, this compares with gross profit of $2.3
million or 23.9% of revenues in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The increase
in gross profit percentage relates to the higher-margin payroll processing
division being a larger component of total revenue, as well as to higher margins
realized in the medical staffing division. In the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004,
gross margin in the medical staffing division increased over 4.0 percentage
points over the comparable quarter in fiscal 2003. The increase in medical
staffing gross margins was driven by more prudent expense management and
selective price increases.

Operating expenses of $2.5 million decreased $0.4 million, or 15%, in the fourth
quarter of fiscal 2004 as compared to the corresponding quarter of fiscal 2003,
and decreased $0.5 million, or 17%, as compared to the third quarter of fiscal
2004. The year-over-year decrease in quarterly expenses was driven by lower
employee headcount. The sequential decrease was driven by the absence of SERP
expense related to the former CEO and CFO, the reversal of $0.1 million of
excess bad debt reserves and lower employee headcount. TeamStaff's loss from
continuing operations was $0.1 million, or ($0.01) per share for the quarter
ended September 30, 2004, compared to a loss of $0.2 million, or ($0.01) per
share, in the same quarter of last year and $0.4 million, or ($0.03) cents per
share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. These results were within the
guidance provided by TeamStaff on August 2, 2004, and confirmed on November 8,
2004, and represent the second consecutive quarter of reduced loss from
continuing operations. Net loss, including discontinued operations, was $0.4
million, or ($0.03) per share, compared to a net loss of $0.7 million, or
($0.05) per share, in the fourth quarter of last year and $0.9 million, or
($0.05) per share, in the third quarter of fiscal 2004. The net loss was
affected by a $0.2 million, or ($0.02) per share, loss from discontinued
operations in the fourth quarter of 2004 and a $0.6 million, or ($0.04) per
share, loss from discontinued operations in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2003.
It compares sequentially with a $0.4 million, or ($0.02) per share, loss from
discontinued operations in the third quarter of fiscal 2004.

TeamStaff's revenues from continuing operations for the year ended September 30,
2004 were $37.3 million compared to $62.8 million last year. Fiscal 2004
revenues were comprised of $32.9 million from medical staffing and $4.4 million
from payroll services. Fiscal 2003 revenues were comprised of $58.1 million from
medical staffing and $4.7 million from payroll services. As noted above, the
decrease relates primarily to trends in the medical staffing industry. Operating
expenses for the year ended September 30, 2004 decreased $3.2 million, or 22%,
compared to last year. The decrease, as stated above, was primarily attributable
to lower severance and retirement benefits related to the former CEO and CFO,
approximating $2.0 million, as well as the previously mentioned reduction in
employee headcount. Loss from continuing operations was $1.8 million, or ($0.11)
per share, compared to $1.5 million, or ($0.10) per share, last year. Net loss,
including discontinued operations, was $4.1 million, or ($0.26) per share,
compared to a net loss of $28.9 million, or ($1.84) per share, last year. The
net loss includes a $2.3 million, or ($0.15) per share, loss from discontinued
operations in fiscal 2004 and a $27.4 million, or ($1.74) per share, loss from
discontinued operations in fiscal 2003.

Commenting on TeamStaff's overall 2004 performance, Mr Smith stated, "Fiscal
year 2004 was a year of transition for TeamStaff. We sold our PEO and temporary
technical staffing businesses, restructured our medical staffing sales model,
forged complementary alliances, developed a vendor management offering, and
added significantly to the senior management ranks of our TeamStaff Rx division.
At the same time, we made great strides operationally by reducing annualized
corporate overhead by over 40% and added liquidity to our balance sheet by
freeing up nearly $3 million of workers' compensation overfunding. These
accomplishments throughout fiscal 2004, along with the recent successful private
placement of almost 2.4 million shares of our common stock, will provide a solid
foundation in helping us achieve our 2005 targets. Our recent acquisition of the
nurse staffing business of Nursing Innovations, which helps us meet our target
of acquiring complementary staffing organizations, sets us up well to make
additional strategic acquisitions and capitalize on an industry turnaround."
