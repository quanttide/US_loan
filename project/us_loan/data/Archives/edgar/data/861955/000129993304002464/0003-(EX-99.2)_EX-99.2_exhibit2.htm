    <TD>In addition to any other policies of CIB Marine, the Executive agrees to hold all
Proprietary Information (as defined below) concerning CIB Marine, its subsidiaries and
affiliates, and its customers in confidence and not disclose to any person, firm,
corporation, or other entity for any reason or purpose whatsoever (except pursuant to
subpoena or to any state or federal regulatory body with jurisdiction over CIB Marine,
its subsidiaries and affiliates or Executive) or directly or indirectly, use, copy,
publish, summarize, or remove from CIB Marine&#146;s premises any Proprietary Information (or
remove from the premises any other property of CIB Marine), except: (i)&nbsp;during the period
of employment to the extent necessary to carry out the Executive&#146;s responsibilities under
this Agreement; and (ii)&nbsp;after termination of the period of employment as specifically
authorized in writing by the Board of Directors. For the purposes of the Agreement,
&#147;Proprietary Information&#148; means all information and any idea in whatever form, tangible
or intangible, pertaining in any manner to the business of CIB Marine or any affiliated
company, including without limitation all customer, marketing, financial, business and
personnel information unless: (i)&nbsp;the information is or becomes publicly known through
lawful means; (ii)&nbsp;the information was rightfully in the Executive&#146;s possession or part
of her general knowledge prior to her employment by CIB Marine; or (iii)&nbsp;the information
is disclosed to the Executive without confidential or proprietary restriction by a third
party who rightfully possesses the information (without confidential or proprietary
restriction) and did not learn of it, directly or indirectly from CIB Marine.</TD>

    <TD>The Executive acknowledges that the pursuit of the activities forbidden by this
Section&nbsp;9 would necessarily involve the use or disclosure of Proprietary Information in
breach of this Section, but that proof of such breach would be extremely difficult. To
forestall such disclosure, use and breach, and in consideration of the employment under
this Agreement, the Executive agrees that for a period of one (1)&nbsp;year after termination
of the Executive&#146;s employment, she may not, for himself or any third party, directly or
indirectly, divert or attempt to divert from CIB Marine (or any affiliated company) any
business of any kind in which it is engaged, including, without limitation, the
solicitation of or interference with any of its customers with whom Executive has had
personal contact, suppliers or employees, without the prior written consent of CIB
Marine.</TD>
