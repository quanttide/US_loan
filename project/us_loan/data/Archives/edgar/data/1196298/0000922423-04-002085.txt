Item 4.01. Change in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

   (a) On December 21, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of
Nephros, Inc. (the "Company") dismissed Grant Thornton, LLP ("Grant Thornton")
as the Company's registered independent public accounting firm and approved the
engagement of Deloitte & Touche LLP ("Deloitte & Touche") as the Company's
independent public accountants to audit the financial statements of the Company
for the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004. Pursuant to the Company's Audit
Committee Charter, the Audit Committee of the Company's Board of Directors has
sole authority to terminate and to appoint the Company's independent auditors.
Accordingly, the dismissal of Grant Thornton and the engagement of Deloitte &
Touche were approved solely by the Audit Committee.

   Except as noted in the next sentence, the audit reports of Grant Thornton on
the financial statements of the Company for the fiscal years ended December 31,
2003 and 2002 did not contain any adverse opinion or a disclaimer of opinion,
nor were they qualified or modified as to uncertainty, audit scope or accounting
principles. The report of Grant Thornton on the Company's financial statements
for the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 included an explanatory
paragraph that noted substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue
as a going concern.

   During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through December
21, 2004, the Company had no disagreement with Grant Thornton on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of
Grant Thornton, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter
thereof in connection with its reports. During the years ended December 31, 2003
and 2002 and through December 21, 2004, there have been no events reportable
pursuant to Item 304(a)(1)(iv)(B) of regulation S-B.

   The Company has provided a copy of the above disclosures to Grant Thornton
and has requested that it furnish a letter addressed to the Securities and
Exchange Commission stating whether it agrees with the above statements and, if
not, stating the respects in which it does not agree. A copy of such letter,
dated December 23, 2004, is filed as Exhibit 16.1 to this Form 8-K.

   (b) On December 23, 2004, the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of
the Company engaged the accounting firm of Deloitte & Touche as the Company's
independent public accountants to audit the Company's financial statements for
the fiscal year ending December 31, 2004. Pursuant to the Company's Audit
Committee Charter, the decision to engage Deloitte & Touche was made solely by
the Audit Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company. During the fiscal
years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through December 23, 2004, the
Company did not consult with Deloitte & Touche regarding either the application
of accounting principles to a specific completed or contemplated transaction or
the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the Company's financial
statements, and neither a written report nor oral advice was provided to the
Company that was an important factor considered by the Company in reaching a
decision as to an accounting, auditing or financial reporting issue. During the
Company's fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through December 23,
2004, the Company did not consult with Deloitte & Touche regarding any matter
that was the subject of a disagreement or event identified in response to Item
304(a)(1)(iv) of Regulation S-B.

Item 8.01. Other Events.

   On December 23, 2004, Nephros, Inc. issued a press release announcing it has
retained the services of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent
registered public accountants. A copy of this press release is attached hereto
as Exhibit 99.1.

                                                           FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE


                      Nephros Appoints Deloitte & Touche as
                     Independent Registered Accounting Firm

NEW YORK, December 23, 2004 -- Nephros, Inc. (AMEX: NEP), announced today it has
retained the services of Deloitte & Touche LLP as the Company's independent
registered public accountants. Deloitte & Touche replaces Grant Thornton, LLP,
and will complete the fiscal year 2004 audit.

The Audit Committee of Nephros' Board of Directors dismissed Grant Thornton and
approved the engagement of Deloitte & Touche on December 21, 2004, following an
evaluation of several independent audit firms. Pursuant to Nephros' Audit
Committee Charter, the Audit Committee has sole authority to terminate and to
appoint Nephros' independent auditors. Accordingly, the dismissal of Grant
Thornton and the engagement of Deloitte & Touche were approved solely by the
Audit Committee.

During the fiscal years ended December 31, 2003 and 2002 and through December
21, 2004, the Company had no disagreement with Grant Thornton on any matter of
accounting principles or practices, financial statement disclosure, or auditing
scope or procedure, which disagreement, if not resolved to the satisfaction of
Grant Thornton, would have caused it to make reference to the subject matter
thereof in connection with its reports.

About Nephros
Nephros, Inc., headquartered in New York, is a medical device company developing
and marketing products designed to improve the quality of life for the End Stage
Renal Disease (ESRD) patient, while addressing the critical financial and
clinical needs of the care provider. ESRD is a disease state characterized by
the irreversible loss of kidney function. Nephros believes that its products are
designed to remove a range of harmful substances more effectively, and more
cost-effectively, than existing treatment methods; particularly with respect to
substances known collectively as "middle molecules," due to their molecular
weight, that have been found to contribute to such conditions as carpal tunnel
syndrome, dialysis related amyloidosis and degenerative bone disease in the ESRD
patient.

Except for historical information, this press release includes "forward-looking
statements" within the meaning of the Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.
All statements included in this press release that address activities, events or
developments that Nephros expects, believes or anticipates will or may occur in
the future are forward-looking statements. This includes earnings estimates,
future financial performance

<PAGE>

and other matters. These statements are based on certain assumptions made by
Nephros based on its experience and perception of historical trends, current
conditions, expected future developments and other factors it believes are
appropriate in the circumstances. Such statements are subject to a number of
assumptions, risks and uncertainties, many of which are beyond the control of
Nephros. Actual results may differ materially from the expectations contained in
the forward-looking statements. More detailed information about Nephros and the
risk factors discussed above is set forth in Nephros's filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission, including Nephros's Final Prospectus, dated
September 20, 2004, with respect to the registration of 2,100,000 shares of
common stock for sale to the public. Investors and security holders are urged to
read such document free of charge at the Commission's web site at www.sec.com.
Nephros does not undertake to publicly update or revise its forward-looking
statements as a result of new information, future events or otherwise
