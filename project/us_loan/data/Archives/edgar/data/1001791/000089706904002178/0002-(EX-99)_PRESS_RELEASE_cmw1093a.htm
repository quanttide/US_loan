<H1 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>RIDGESTONE FINANCIAL
SERVICES, INC. ANNOUNCES INTENTION TO DEREGISTER <BR>COMMON STOCK WITH THE SECURITIES
AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION  </FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2><B>Brookfield, Wisconsin, December
22, 2004 </B>&#150; Ridgestone Financial Services, Inc. (OTC: RFSV) today announced that
it intends to file a Form 15 with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the
&#147;SEC&#148;) on or about March 7, 2005 to deregister its Common Stock under the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the &#147;Exchange Act&#148;). The
Company expects that deregistration of its Common Stock will become effective 90 days
after the date of filing of the Form 15 with the SEC. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Upon filing of the Form 15, the
Company&#146;s obligation to file with the SEC certain reports and forms, including Forms
10-KSB, 10-QSB and 8-K, will immediately be suspended. In addition, following the filing
of the Form 15, the Company&#146;s Common Stock will cease to be quoted on the OTC
Bulletin Board. The Company anticipates that its Common Stock will thereafter continue to
be quoted on the Pink Sheets electronic quotation service, but only to the extent that
market makers continue to make a market in the Common Stock. The Company can provide no
assurance that trading on the Pink Sheets will continue. The Pink Sheets is an electronic
quotation service through which participating broker-dealers can make markets, and enter
orders to buy and sell securities. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Paul E. Menzel, Chairman of the
Board, stated, &#147;After careful consideration of a variety of issues and factors, our
Board of Directors has determined that continued registration with the SEC is no longer
cost effective because of the significant increase in costs and administrative burdens
associated with being a public company, particularly in light of the rules and regulations
promulgated under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002. As a small company, we have not enjoyed
many of the benefits traditionally associated with being a public company. Deregistration
will enable management to focus more of its time and resources on implementing the
Company&#146;s business plan and to concentrate its efforts on increasing long-term value
for our shareholders.&#148; Menzel also said, &#147;We have decided to publicly announce
our intention to deregister well in advance of actually doing so, in order to provide our
shareholders with an opportunity to realize liquidity on the OTC Bulletin Board for an
additional period of time. While we intend to take efforts to maintain quotation of our
Common Stock on the Pink Sheets, we cannot be assured that we will be able to do so.&#148; </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Notwithstanding the Company&#146;s
decision to deregister, the Company intends to continue hold annual meetings and to
provide its shareholders and the interested public with unaudited financial information on
a quarterly basis and audited financial statements on an annual basis while its Common
Stock is quoted on the Pink Sheets. The Company also intends to update its shareholders
with information about the Company through mailings and/or press releases. </FONT></P>
