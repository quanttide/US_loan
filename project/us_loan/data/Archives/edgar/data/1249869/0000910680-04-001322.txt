Strategy  International  Insurance Group,  Inc. and RS Group of Companies,  Inc.
Announce Proposed Acquisition of RS Group by Strategy International

Friday December 17, 8:00 am ET
TORONTO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec. 17, 2004--Strategy International Insurance Group,
Inc. (OTCBB:SGYI - News) and RS Group of Companies, Inc. (OTCBB:RSGC - News)
announced today that they intend to enter into an agreement that will result in
RS Group to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Strategy International.

The management teams of both companies have determined that the long-term
objectives of Strategy International and RS Group are converging. Strategy
International and RS Group believe that combining the strengths of both
companies will allow them to pursue new revenue opportunities, while optimizing
administrative economies of scale and investment decisions across the companies.
The move supports Strategy's continuing plan to deliver value to its
risk-management customers across multiple distribution channels while
structuring the transaction to minimize the effect of channel conflict.

The integration of the marketing and investment strength of RS Group into the
underwriting position of Strategy International provides both companies with the
necessary flexibility to provide the best service to their customers and the
efficient marketing of services and enhancement of sustainable customer
relationships. Once the purchase is completed, RS Group will become a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Strategy International. Strategy does not plan to
change RS Group's executive team, strategic direction or branding.

Commenting on this announcement, Stephen Stonhill, CEO and President of Strategy
International Insurance Group, Inc. said "This acquisition provides Strategy
with marketing and management resources that further enhance the Company's
expansion. RS Group's proven product expertise and administrative capabilities
will be an exceptional addition to the Strategy underwriting group."

It is anticipated that Strategy International will offer cash and stock, which
would result in a value to RS Group common stock holders of $1.75 per common
share, to acquire RS Group's outstanding common stock (approximately 65 million
shares), representing a 237 percent premium over the closing price of $0.52 on
December 15, 2004. Strategy International, with input from RS Group, is in the
process of determining the most effective method of achieving this acquisition.
The transaction will not be conditioned upon Strategy International obtaining
any financing.

"This integration represents a natural convergence of two operations, which have
complementary abilities and similar long-term objectives. The combined strength
of underwriting expertise and product knowledge will allow management to fulfill
its operational aspirations," said John Hamilton, CEO of RS Group of Companies,
Inc.

Strategy International expects the transaction to close on or about March 1,
2005, subject to the necessary shareholder and regulatory approvals. Strategy
International estimates that the proposed transaction will be neutral to its
2004 earnings.
