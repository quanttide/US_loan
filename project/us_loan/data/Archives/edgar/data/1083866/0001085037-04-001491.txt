<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Vancouver, British Columbia, Dec 21,
2004 &#150; Eden Energy Corporation (EDNE) is pleased to announce that it has acquired
leases covering 210,000 acres on its Noah Project, located in Eureka and White Pine
counties in eastern Nevada. The Noah project is located in the Cretaceous Sevier thrust
belt, which is part of the North American Cordillera that extends from Alaska to Mexico.
In areas where the thrusting coincides with source rock, the Sevier thrust belt contains
some of North America&#146;s most prolific oil and gas fields. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The commencement of the Noah project
is the culmination of work done by Dr. Alan Chamberlain in a multi-decade analysis of a
$200 million stratigraphic data set. The analysis involved extensive field work, a novel
use of gamma ray logging of outcrop, fossil studies of drill core and outcrop, and
extensive structural modeling. Dr. Chamberlain&#146;s work has identified an area in
eastern Nevada with world-class source rocks and large rollover structures and thrust
fault duplexes. Throughout the world, thrust belt structures are responsible for roughly
one quarter of the world&#146;s proven oil reserves, including the Canadian Foothills,
Wyoming, Iran, Iraq and Alaska&#146;s North Slope. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Noah project is a linear,
undrilled anticline composed of folded Paleozoic rocks, approximately 53 miles long and 7
miles wide. The anticline has been identified by surface geology, gravity and magnetic
surveys and seismic, and has been confirmed by offsetting drilling in down dip positions. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The targeted reservoir is a
well-established 200-400 foot thick band of karsted Devonian dolomite, which is the
producing formation in the prolific Grant Canyon field 60 miles to the south of the Noah
project. Secondary potential exists in the fractured Lower Devonian Sevy dolomite, which
produces in the Blackburn field 15 miles to the north of the Noah project. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Default" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The source rock at the Noah project
is the Mississippian Chainman shale, an exceptionally rich source rock with total organic
content of 2%-8% and thousands of feet of thickness. All oil produced in Nevada has been
typed to the Chainman shale facies. </FONT></P>
