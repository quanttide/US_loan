          Each of the plans, programs, and agreements listed above, including any

          outstanding or that are granted in the future (all such plans, programs,

          &#147;Plans&#148;), shall be operated and administered in accordance with a
          reasonable interpretation of section 409A of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986
          (the &#147;Code&#148;) and section 885 of the American Jobs Creation Act of 2004
          (the &#147;AJCA&#148;), including any regulations or other guidance of general

          To the extent that any provision of the Plans is inconsistent with the
          restrictions imposed by Code section 409A or the AJCA (including, but not
          limited to, restrictions on the timing of elections, the time or form of
          distributions, the acceleration of benefits, or the events that will constitute
          a substantial risk of forfeiture), that provision shall be deemed to be amended
          to the extent necessary to bring it into compliance with Code section 409A and
          the AJCA. Additional restrictions under the Plans are necessary to ensure that
          the systems and procedures used to administer the Plans comply with Code section
          409A. </FONT></P>

          The primary purpose of this amendment is to protect participants in the Plans
          against the substantial unanticipated tax liability that would result from the
          Plans&#146; failure to comply with Code section 409A. Accordingly, to the extent
          that an amendment to any Plan requires the consent of an individual participant,
          each participant shall be deemed to have consented to the amendment unless the
          participant provides written notice of his objection within a reasonable period
          after being notified of the amendment. </FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para (List) Indent Lv 0- TNR" FSL="Workstation" -->

          This amendment shall not affect any amounts that are deferred before January 1,
          2005, within the meaning of Code section 409A and the AJCA, and no change shall
          be made in the administration of the Plans that would constitute a
          &#147;material modification&#148; of the Plans with respect to such amounts.
          Nothing in this amendment shall be construed to prevent Honeywell International
          Inc. (the &#147;Corporation&#148;) from amending any Plan at a later date to
          apply the restrictions set forth in Code section 409A to amounts deferred before
          January 1, 2005, or to prevent the Corporation from amending any Plan in a
          manner that constitutes a &#147;material modification&#148; of the Plan with
          respect to such amounts. </FONT></P>

          Effective with respect to amounts deferred on or after January 1, 2005, if a
          Plan calculates earnings on contributions to a participant&#146;s account by
          reference to a stated interest rate, the Plan is amended to permit the
          Corporation to change the interest rate (either up or down), even if the
          underlying contribution was credited to the participant&#146;s account in a
          prior year. </FONT></P>

          This amendment shall remain in effect until the Plans are further amended in an
          instrument adopted or ratified by the Corporation to reflect the requirements of
          Code section 409A and the AJCA, as interpreted in regulations or other guidance
          issued by the Treasury Department or Internal Revenue Service. </FONT></P>
