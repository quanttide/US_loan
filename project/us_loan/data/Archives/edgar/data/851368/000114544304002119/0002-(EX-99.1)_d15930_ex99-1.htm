  OF 2005 INCENTIVE BONUS PLAN</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  2005 Incentive Bonus Program (the &#147;Bonus Program&#148;) of Cost-U-Less,
  Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) rewards achievement at specified levels of
  financial and individual performance.</font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under
  the Bonus Program, and consistent with the 2004 predecessor program, each of
  the Company&#146;s executive officers (excluding its chief executive officer)
  is eligible to receive a bonus based on a combination of the Company&#146;s
  earnings from operations improvement over the prior fiscal year, as defined
  by the compensation committee of the board of directors of the Company, and
  a percentage of such employee&#146;s salary based on departmental performance
  and the Company&#146;s net income compared to its operating plan. </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Each
  store manager is eligible to receive a bonus based on a combination of store
  profitability, store gross margin return on inventory investment, and the Company&#146;s
  operating income, all compared to the Company&#146;s operating plan. Each corporate
  and depot-based key employee is eligible to receive a bonus based on departmental
  performance and the Company&#146;s net income compared to its operating plan.
  </font></p>
<p><font size="2" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  compensation committee&#146;s approval of the Bonus Program shall not be deemed
  to create an enforceable agreement between the Company and any employee or executive
  officer, and the compensation committee retains discretion to reduce or refuse
  to authorize any awards under the Bonus Program despite attainment of any specific
  objectives. No rights to any awards shall be deemed to exist unless and until
  the compensation committee or, with respect to non-executive officers, management
  authorizes payment of any awards under the Bonus Program following the completion
  of any fiscal year measurement periods. </font></p>
