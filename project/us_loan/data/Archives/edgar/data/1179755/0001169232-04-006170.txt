Item 2.03. Creation of a Direct Financial Obligation or an Obligation under an
Off-Balance Sheet Arrangement of a Registrant.

(a)   On December 22, 2004, Endurance U.S. Holdings Corp., a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Endurance Specialty Holdings Ltd. (the "Company"), borrowed
$143,500,000 (the "Borrowing") under the unsecured revolving portion of the
Credit Agreement, dated as of August 6, 2004, by and among the Company and the
Borrowers (as defined therein), the Lenders from time to time party thereto, and
JPMorgan Chase Bank, as Administrative Agent (the "Credit Agreement"). Pursuant
to the terms of the Credit Agreement, the Borrowing will accrue interest at the
three month London Interbank Offered Rate ("LIBOR") plus 0.40%, currently 2.92%.
The interest rate on the Borrowing can vary from time to time based upon
increases or decreases in either LIBOR or the Company's ratio of total
consolidated indebtedness to total consolidated capital. Interest payments on
the Borrowing are due in arrears every three months. The Borrowing must be
repaid on or before August 6, 2007. The additional material terms of the Credit
Agreement, including covenants, events of default and fees, are as set forth in
the description of the Credit Agreement included in the Company's Form 10-Q for
the three months ended September 30, 2004 and are incorporated by reference
herein.
