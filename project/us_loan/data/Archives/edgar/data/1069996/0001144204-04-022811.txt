ITEM 1.01 ENTRY INTO A MATERIAL DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT.
          -------------------------------------------

      21st Century Holding Company (the "Company") and its wholly owned
subsidiaries, Federated Agency Group, Inc. ("Federated") and Assurance Managing
General Agents, Inc. ("Assurance," and together with Federated, the "Sellers"),
have entered into an Asset Purchase Agreement dated December 21, 2004 (the
"Asset Purchase Agreement") with Fed USA Retail, Inc. and Fed USA Franchising,
Inc. (together, the "Buyers").

      Pursuant to the Asset Purchase Agreement, the Sellers have agreed to sell
to the Buyers certain assets relating to the Sellers' non-standard automobile
insurance agency business located in Florida (the "Agency Business") for a
purchase price of:

      o     $7,000,000 payable at closing and

      o     an additional payment of up to $2,500,000 calculated based on 10% of
            the "Gross Net Written Premiums" (as defined in the Asset Purchase
            Agreement) through the Company's two insurance company subsidiaries
            or through any insurance company affiliated with the Buyers for
            gross net written premiums that exceed $15,000,000 in the aggregate
            and are less than $40,000,000 in the aggregate with respect to
            Agency Business written by the Buyers during the 12-month period
            following the closing. This additional payment, if any, is due and
            payable 45 days after the end of the 12-month period following the
            closing.

      The Buyers have agreed to assume specified liabilities related to the
assets purchased. All other liabilities are being retained by the Sellers. The
parties currently expect that the sale of assets under the Asset Purchase
Agreement will close by the end of 2004.

      The Buyers are affiliates of Affirmative Insurance Holdings, Inc.
("Affirmative"), an insurance holding company based in Addison, Texas.
Affirmative has agreed to guarantee the Buyers' obligations to make the
post-closing payment described above.
