FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
December 21, 2004

                UNITED NATURAL FOODS ANNOUNCES THE ACQUISITION OF
                       SELECT NUTRITION DISTRIBUTORS, INC.

              Strategic Addition Bolsters Company's Position in the
        Health & Beauty Aids and Vitamins, Minerals & Supplements Markets

Dayville, Connecticut - December 21, 2004 -- United Natural Foods, Inc. (Nasdaq:
UNFI) (the "Company") today announced the acquisition of Select Nutrition
Distributors, Inc. ("Select Nutrition"), a privately owned distributor of health
and beauty aids ("HBA") and vitamins, minerals and supplements ("VMS"). Terms of
the acquisition were not disclosed.

Select Nutrition carries and distributes over 14,000 products, representing over
450 manufacturers, to approximately 5,000 customers nationwide from two
warehouse facilities in Philadelphia, PA and Visalia, CA. Founded in 1975,
Select Nutrition distributes branded vitamins, herbs, dietary supplements,
health and beauty aids to health food stores, pharmacies, practitioners, sports
clubs and spas.

"We are very excited about the opportunities this acquisition presents," Steven
Townsend, United Natural Foods' Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said.
"Select Nutrition has been a long-standing partner and its franchise is a
terrific complement to the United Natural Foods organization. We believe the
combined resources of our two organizations will result in enhanced presence and
increased market share and serve to rationalize
distribution for the Company in the HBA and VMS categories."

United Natural Foods expects that the acquisition will be slightly dilutive for
the current quarter, neutral to the full year fiscal 2005 earnings per share and
accretive thereafter.
