Company has agreed to provide Mr.&nbsp;Sorenson with a lump sum payment in the amount of $250,000

benefit under that plan. The Company has agreed to grant Mr.&nbsp;Sorenson an Option for 70,000 shares
of Company common stock at current fair market value under the Company&#146;s Incentive Stock Option
Plan. A portion of those option shares vest immediately, with the remainder of those option shares
eligible to vest as early as December&nbsp;31, 2005.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mr.&nbsp;Sorenson does not have any family relationships with any executive officer or director of
