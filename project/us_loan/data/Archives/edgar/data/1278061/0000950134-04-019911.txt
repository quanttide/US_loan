<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;1.01. Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;22, 2004, Vought Aircraft Industries, Inc. (&#147;the Company&#148;) completed the
syndication of a $650&nbsp;million senior secured credit facility (the &#147;Credit Facility&#148;) pursuant to
the terms and conditions of a Credit Agreement dated December&nbsp;22, 2004 (the &#147;Credit Agreement&#148;)
entered into by and among the Company and Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Administrative Agent,
JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. (the &#147;Lenders&#148;). Some of the
Lenders or their affiliates from time to time have provided in the past (and may provide in the
future) investment banking, commercial lending and financial advisory services to the Company and
its affiliates in the ordinary course of business, for which they receive customary compensation.
The Credit Facility is comprised of a $150&nbsp;million six-year revolving credit facility (including a
$100&nbsp;million letter of credit sub-limit) (the &#147;Revolver&#148;), a $75&nbsp;million synthetic letter of credit
facility (the &#147;Letter of Credit Facility&#148;) and a $425&nbsp;million seven-year term loan B (the &#147;Term
Loan&#148;). As announced previously, the intended use of proceeds of the Credit Facility is to
refinance the Company&#146;s existing credit facility and for general corporate purposes, including
investment in the Boeing 7E7 program and the execution of the ongoing manufacturing facility
consolidation and modernization plan. The Credit Facility will be guaranteed by each of the
Company&#146;s domestic subsidiaries and secured by a first priority security interest in most of the
Company&#146;s assets. The initial pricing of any drawn portion of the Revolver will be LIBOR plus a
spread of 250 basis points, and the pricing of the Term Loan will be LIBOR plus a spread of 250
basis points, in each case subject to a leverage-based pricing grid. The initial pricing for the
Letter of Credit Facility will be 260 basis points on the full deposit amount. The Term Loan will
amortize at $1&nbsp;million per quarter with a bullet payment at maturity. Under the Credit Agreement,
the Company has the option to solicit from existing or new lenders, up to $200&nbsp;million in
additional term loans subject to substantially the same terms and conditions as the outstanding
term loans though pricing may be separately negotiated at that time. Additionally, the Company
also has the option to convert up to $25&nbsp;million of the Letter of Credit Facility to outstanding
term loans which would also be subject to the same terms and conditions as the outstanding term
loans made as of the closing date.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement contains customary affirmative and negative covenants for credit
facilities of this type, including limitations on the Company and its subsidiaries with respect to
indebtedness, liens, investments, distributions, mergers and acquisitions, dispositions of assets,
subordinated debt and transactions with affiliates. The Credit Facility also includes financial
covenants including leverage ratio, interest coverage ratio and capital expenditure limitations.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Agreement provides for customary events of default, including failure to pay
principal or interest when due, failure to comply with covenants, the fact that any representation
or warranty made by the Company is false in any material respect, certain insolvency or
receivership events affecting the Company or its subsidiaries, and a change in control of the
Company (as defined in the Credit Agreement). For certain events of default, the commitments of the
Lenders will be automatically terminated and all outstanding obligations of the Company will become
immediately due and payable.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As of the date of this report, the Company has no borrowings under the Revolver, $425.0
million of borrowings under the Term Loan, $51&nbsp;million outstanding under the Letters of Credit
Facility, and incurs interest charges on the full amount of the Letter of Credit Facility.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Credit Facility replaces the Company&#146;s prior credit facility which consisted of a $150.0
million revolving credit facility and $295.9&nbsp;million of term loans maturing in June&nbsp;2008 (the
&#147;Prior Credit Facility&#148;). The Company was in compliance with all applicable financial covenants
and other restrictions under the Prior Credit Facility as of the effective date of its termination
(December&nbsp;22, 2004).

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Effective December&nbsp;22, 2004, the credit agreement entered into by and among the Company and
Lehman Commercial Paper Inc., as Administrative Agent, and Goldman Sachs Credit Partners L.P. (the
&#147;Prior Credit Agreement&#148;), was terminated. The Prior Credit Agreement was due to expire in June
2008 and was replaced with the Credit Agreement described under Item&nbsp;1.01 above. The Company had
outstanding term loan borrowings of $295.9&nbsp;million, and $51&nbsp;million of letters of credit under the
Prior Credit Agreement and was subject to an interest rate on borrowings based on either LIBOR plus
a spread based on the Company&#146;s leverage ratio or the prime rate, at the Company&#146;s election. A
quarterly facility fee was payable based on the daily aggregate amount of commitments and the
Company&#146;s leverage ratio. The Prior Credit Agreement contained customary financial and other
covenants and events of default.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company did not incur any early termination penalties in connection with the termination
of the Prior Credit Agreement.

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company&#146;s entry into the Credit Agreement described in Item&nbsp;1.01 constitutes the creation
of a direct financial obligation. The disclosure set forth above under Item&nbsp;1.01 is hereby
incorporated by reference into this Item&nbsp;2.03.
