<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;5.01. Changes in Control of Registrant.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;PeopleSoft, Inc., a Delaware corporation (the &#147;Company&#148;), entered into an Agreement and
Plan of Merger (the &#147;Merger Agreement&#148;), dated as of December&nbsp;12, 2004, by and among the Company,
Oracle Corporation, a Delaware corporation (&#147;Oracle&#148;), and Pepper Acquisition Corp., a Delaware
corporation and a wholly owned subsidiary of Oracle (&#147;Merger Subsidiary&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Oracle caused Merger Subsidiary to amend Merger Subsidiary&#146;s
outstanding offer to purchase any and all of the outstanding shares of common stock, par value
$0.01 per share, of the Company, including the rights issued pursuant to the Company&#146;s First
Amended and Restated Preferred Shares Rights Agreement, to reflect the terms and conditions of the
Merger Agreement, including a cash purchase price of $26.50 per share (the &#147;Offer&#148;).


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Offer expired at 12:00 midnight, New York City time, on Tuesday, December&nbsp;28, 2004. At
the expiration of the Offer, 298,834,574 shares of Company common stock were validly tendered and
not withdrawn, representing approximately 75% of the outstanding
Company common stock. On Wednesday, December&nbsp;29, 2004, promptly
following the expiration of the Offer, Merger Subsidiary accepted
for purchase all shares of the Company&#146;s common stock validly tendered and not withdrawn prior to
the expiration of the Offer, and also announced the commencement of a subsequent offering period to
expire at 8:00 p.m., New York City time, on Tuesday, January&nbsp;4, 2005, during which Company
stockholders will be able to tender Company common stock to Merger Subsidiary for purchase at the
$26.50 per share cash price. Oracle has announced that it intends to complete the acquisition of
the Company promptly following the expiration of the subsequent offering period, assuming Merger
Subsidiary has acquired at least 90% of the outstanding Company common stock following the
completion of the subsequent offering period.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant
to the Offer, stockholders of the Company who tendered in the Offer
shall receive consideration of $26.50 in cash for each share of the Company&#146;s common stock. Based on the per
share consideration of $26.50 and the percentage of outstanding shares tendered and accepted for
purchase, the value of the shares purchased by Merger Subsidiary in connection with the Offer is
approximately $7.9&nbsp;billion. The funds used by Merger Subsidiary to purchase the shares pursuant to the Offer were from funds contributed
or advanced by Oracle from borrowings under a 364-Day Term Loan Agreement (the
&#147;Credit Agreement&#148;) dated as of December 28, 2004, among Oracle; the lenders named in the Credit Agreement;
Wachovia Bank, National Association, as Administrative Agent (&#147;Wachovia&#148;);
Credit Suisse First Boston and ABN AMRO Bank N.V., as Syndication Agents; Bank
of America, N.A. and Deutsche Bank Securities, Inc., as Documentation Agents;
and Wachovia Capital Markets, LLC and Credit Suisse First Boston, as Joint Lead
Arrangers and Joint Bookrunners, in the aggregate amount of $9.5&nbsp;billion. Oracle
delivered a notice of borrowing and conversion to Wachovia requesting a
borrowing under the Credit Agreement in the amount of $9.2&nbsp;billion to be funded
on December&nbsp;29, 2004. Oracle filed the Credit Agreement with the SEC as an
exhibit to Amendment 85 of its Tender Offer Statement on Schedule TO filed on
December 29, 2004.



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Merger Agreement also provides that following the consummation of the Offer, including the
subsequent offering period described above, Merger Subsidiary will be merged with and into the
Company (the &#147;Merger&#148;), with the Company as the surviving corporation in the Merger. Oracle
expects to acquire the remaining outstanding shares of the Company&#146;s common stock pursuant to the
Merger promptly following the expiration of the subsequent offering period, assuming Merger
Subsidiary has acquired at least 90% of the outstanding common stock, as described above. All
stockholders who did not tender their shares pursuant to the Offer, including in the subsequent
offering period (other than stockholders who validly perfect appraisal rights under Delaware law),
will receive $26.50 in cash for each share of Company common stock held at the time of the Merger.

<DIV style="font-family: 'Times New Roman',Times,serif">

<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pursuant to the Merger Agreement, Oracle was entitled to designate a number of directors to
the Company&#146;s board of directors reflecting Oracle&#146;s percentage ownership of the outstanding
Company common stock. Therefore, on December&nbsp;29, 2004, Safra Catz, Daniel Cooperman, Charles E.
Phillips, Jr. and Harry L. You were so designated by Oracle and appointed to the Company&#146;s board of
directors to replace David A. Duffield, Aneel Bhusri, Frank J. Fanzilli, Jr., Michael J. Maples and
Cyril J. Yansouni, who had previously tendered their resignations as
PeopleSoft directors. There is one vacancy on the Company&#146;s board of
directors. It is
expected that A. George &#147;Skip&#148; Battle and Steven D. Goldby, the two remaining continuing PeopleSoft
directors, will resign as directors of the Company upon or immediately following the effective time
of the Merger.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the knowledge of the Company, except as set forth herein, there are no arrangements,
including any pledge by any person of securities of the Company, the operation of which may at a
subsequent date result in a further change in control of the Company.


<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt"><B>Item&nbsp;5.02. Departure of Directors or Principal Officers; Election of Directors; Appointment of
Principal Officers.</B>



<P align="left" style="font-size: 10pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On December&nbsp;29, 2004, effective upon the acceptance for payment of at least a majority of the
outstanding shares of Company common stock pursuant to the Offer by Merger Subsidiary, Messrs.
Aneel Bhusri, Frank J. Fanzilli, Jr., Michael J. Maples and Cyril J. Yansouni resigned as directors
of the Company&#146;s board of directors and, pursuant to the Merger Agreement as described in Item&nbsp;1.01
above, Safra Catz, Daniel Cooperman, Charles E. Phillips, Jr. and Harry L. You were appointed to
the Company&#146;s board of directors at Oracle&#146;s request.

Oracle designees), Kevin T. Parker, Co-President and Chief Financial Officer of the Company, and W.
Phillip Wilmington, Co-President of the Company, were terminated from such positions with the
Company and Safra Catz and Charles E. Phillips, Jr. were appointed as
Co-Presidents of the Company, Harry L. You was appointed as Chief Financial Officer of the
Company, and Daniel Cooperman was appointed Senior Vice President, General
Counsel and Secretary of the Company.
