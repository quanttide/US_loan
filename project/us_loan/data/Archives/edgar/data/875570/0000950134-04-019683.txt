Plans.</B>


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">This Current Report discloses an update to the temporary suspension of trading under a
PeopleSoft, Inc. (the &#147;Company&#148;) employee benefit plan. On December&nbsp;13, 2004, Oracle Corporation
(&#147;Oracle&#148;) announced a modification of its tender offer for shares of PeopleSoft, Inc. (&#147;Oracle
tender offer&#148;) to change it to midnight, New York City time, on December&nbsp;28, 2004. On December
21, 2004, the Company sent a notice to its directors and executive officers informing them that
a blackout period will be in effect beginning at 4:00 p.m. New York City time on December&nbsp;22,
2004 until further notice from the Company, restricting them from engaging in certain
transactions involving equity securities of the Company, but not prohibiting the tender of
shares of Company stock to Oracle pursuant to the Oracle tender offer. This notice updated and
superseded a prior notice to the Company&#146;s directors and executive officers given on November
22, 2004, relating to a blackout period beginning December&nbsp;28, 2004 arising from Oracle&#146;s
previous tender offer expiration date of December&nbsp;31, 2004.


<P align="left" style="margin-left: 0%; text-indent: 0%; margin-right: 0%; font-size: 10pt">The effective dates of the blackout period are revised each time Oracle changes the expiration
date of the Oracle tender offer. The blackout results from a benefit plan administrator&#146;s
procedure for processing tenders of shares in an employee benefit plan in connection with the
Oracle tender offer. Although the Company&#146;s notice of December&nbsp;21, 2004 may not have been
required because the blackout period will not last for more than three business days unless the
Oracle tender offer is extended under certain circumstances, it was provided as a cautionary
matter to ensure compliance with Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002.

         NOTICE TO DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF PEOPLESOFT, INC.

                             DATED DECEMBER 21, 2004

SUMMARY

AS YOU KNOW, ORACLE HAS REVISED ITS TENDER OFFER. THEREFORE, YOU WILL BE SUBJECT
TO A NEW BLACKOUT PERIOD COMMENCING AS OF 4:00 P.M., NEW YORK CITY TIME,
DECEMBER 22, 2004 AND ENDING UPON NOTICE TO YOU. THIS BLACKOUT PERIOD IS IN
ADDITION TO ANY OTHER BLACKOUT PERIOD THAT MAY BE IMPOSED BY THE COMPANY FROM
TIME TO TIME.

THIS SARBANES-OXLEY BLACKOUT NOTICE RESCINDS THE PRIOR SARBANES-OXLEY BLACKOUT
NOTICE SENT TO YOU NOVEMBER 22, 2004. PLEASE NOTE, THIS BLACKOUT DOES NOT
PRECLUDE YOU FROM TENDERING SHARES TO ORACLE IN THE TENDER OFFER AND
PARTICIPATING IN CERTAIN OTHER FORMS OF TRANSACTIONS DESCRIBED IN THE NOTICE,
BELOW.

Because employees who have PeopleSoft shares in their J.D. Edwards 401(k)
accounts are eligible to tender those shares to Oracle, the plan administrator
must impose a freeze on J.D. Edwards 401(k) participants from trading the
PeopleSoft shares in their accounts while the tenders are being processed. That
freeze is expected to last three business days, commencing as of 4:00 p.m., New
York City time, on December 22nd, 2004 through December 28, 2004. Any freeze
lasting longer than three business days gives us a legal obligation to subject
our insiders to a blackout period for the same timeframe. If Oracle extends its
tender offer again, the freeze may last more than three business days. Because
we might not know at the outset whether the freeze will last more than three
days, we are imposing the blackout commencing as of 4:00 p.m., New York City
time, December 22nd in the event that the freeze is extended. We will keep you
advised as to any changes to the dates.

The notice below contains the legal requirements of notice to you. Please call
me at 925-694-2789 if you have any questions.

Thank you.



Jim Vidano
PeopleSoft, Inc.
Senior Counsel
Ph. 925.694.2789
Fax 925.694.7184



                                     NOTICE

As a director or executive officer of PeopleSoft, Inc., you are subject to the
restrictions under Section 306(a) of the Sarbanes-Oxley Act of 2002 ("Act"),
which prohibits certain trades during pension plan "blackout" periods. In
connection therewith, please note the following:
<PAGE>

     1. Section 306(a) of the Act requires a prohibition on certain transactions
by you involving the purchase, sale or other acquisition of equity securities of
the Company because participants in the J.D. Edwards & Company Retirement
Savings Plan (the "Plan") are suspended from making trades involving the
PeopleSoft Stock Fund under the Plan for a specified period which could extend
for more than three consecutive business days, as a result of the Oracle tender
offer. This temporary suspension affects the ability of at least 50% of the U.S.
participants in ERISA individual account plans maintained by the Company (and
its controlled group) to acquire or hold issuer equity securities. Accordingly,
a concurrent restriction on trading by Company insiders under Section 306(a) of
the Act will apply because the trading suspension under the Plan may exceed
three consecutive business days.

     2. If the Oracle tender offer is extended beyond its current expiration
date of December 28, 2004, and if, as a result, the Plan administrator must
extend the trading suspension period for the PeopleSoft Stock Fund under the
Plan beyond three consecutive business days in order to process tenders, then
the Act requires a blackout period. BECAUSE SUCH AN EXTENSION IS A POSSIBILITY,
IN ORDER TO ASSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT, THE FOLLOWING BLACKOUT PERIOD WILL
APPLY TO YOU:

     a) Except as noted below, you will be prohibited from purchasing, selling
or otherwise acquiring equity securities of the Company for the period
commencing as of 4:00 p.m., New York City time, on Tuesday, December 22, 2004
and ending on the date specified in a subsequent notice to you from the Company.
You may perform a "sale to cover" option exercise in connection with the
exercise of an option to purchase PeopleSoft common stock granted to you by the
Company. A "sale to cover" is the same-day sale of shares received upon the
exercise, but only to the extent necessary to cover the exercise price of the
option and taxes withheld upon the exercise. You may also exercise options to
purchase PeopleSoft common stock granted to you by the Company by providing cash
to cover the full amount of the aggregate option exercise price. In addition,
you may tender shares to Oracle in the Oracle tender offer.

     b) Except as noted above, you will be prohibited from, directly or
indirectly, purchasing, selling or otherwise acquiring or transferring any
equity securities of the Company (or derivative securities of those equity
securities, such as stock options) during such blackout period for the Plan. The
prohibition on transactions by you applies both to amounts, if any, you may have
invested in the PeopleSoft Stock Fund under the Plan and to Company securities
that you hold outside of the Plan. The prohibition also applies to shares of
Company stock which you may hold that is subject to a repurchase right in favor
of the Company. This prohibition also applies to any direct or indirect
pecuniary interest you may have in such securities, such as Company stock held
by immediate family members living with you, or held in trust, or by controlled
partnerships or corporations. THE PROHIBITION ON PURCHASES, SALES AND OTHER
TRANSACTIONS DOES NOT APPLY TO TRADES MADE PURSUANT TO RULE 10B5-1 TRADING
PLANS, PROVIDED THAT YOU DID NOT ENTER INTO OR MODIFY THE TRADING PLAN DURING
THE BLACKOUT PERIOD, OR WHILE AWARE OF THE ACTUAL OR APPROXIMATE BEGINNING OR
ENDING DATES OF THE BLACKOUT PERIOD. (There also are certain narrow exceptions
for dividend reinvestment plans, certain automatic non-discretionary
transactions within employee benefit plans (but not the Plan), automatic formula
grant programs, and exchanges by operation of law in connection with a merger or
acquisition.)

     c) The prohibition on purchases, sales and other transactions described in
the immediately preceding paragraph above applies only to equity securities of
the Company (and derivatives of such securities) that you have acquired in
connection with your service or employment as a director or executive officer of
the Company (including any affiliate of the Company), however you may be subject
to other restrictions, such as the Company's insider trading policy, which
preclude such transactions. It is important to note that any such security you
sell or otherwise transfer automatically will be presumed to have been acquired
in connection with your service or employment unless you establish that the
securities were acquired from another source and this identification is
consistent with your treatment of the securities for tax purposes and all other
disclosure and reporting requirements.
