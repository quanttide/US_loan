Description of the Mortgage Pool

         Mortgage Asset Securitization Transactions, Inc. (the "Registrant")
plans a series of certificates, entitled MASTR Asset Backed Securities Trust
2004-WMC3, Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-WMC3 (the
"Certificates"), to be issued pursuant to a pooling and servicing agreement,
dated as of December 1, 2004, among the Registrant as depositor, HomEq Servicing
Corporation as servicer (the "Servicer") and U.S. Bank National Association as
trustee (the "Trustee"). The Certificates to be designated as the Series
2004-WMC3 Certificates will represent in the aggregate the entire beneficial
ownership interest in a trust fund (the "Trust Fund") consisting primarily of a
pool (the "Mortgage Pool") of conventional, one- to four-family, first and
second lien adjustable-rate and fixed-rate mortgage loans having original terms
to maturity up to 30 years (the "Mortgage Loans").

Computational Materials

         UBS Securities LLC (the "Underwriter") has advised the Registrant that
it has furnished to certain prospective purchasers of Certificates certain
materials, herein referred to as "Computational Materials", in written form,
which Computational Materials are in the nature of data tables and term sheet
information relating to the Mortgage Loans or other assets of the Trust Fund,
the structure of the Certificates and terms of certain classes of Certificates,
and the hypothetical characteristics and hypothetical performance of certain
classes of Certificates under certain assumptions and scenarios.

         The Computational Materials have been provided by the Underwriter. The
information in the Computational Materials is preliminary and will be superseded
by the Prospectus Supplement relating to the Certificates and by any other
information subsequently filed with the Commission.

         The Computational Materials were prepared by the Underwriter at the
request of certain prospective investors. The Computational Materials may be
based on information that differs from the information set forth in the
Prospectus Supplement.
