Dear Thomas:

As discussed, my upcoming retirement from DCA causes me to submit this
resignation as a Director of Dialysis Corporation of America effective
January 1, 2005.

I appreciate the confidence given me in this position and will miss my
interaction with the other board members of DCA.  I will especially miss my
unsuccessful challenge of trying to beat you at golf each year.

With kindest regards,

/s/ Bart Pelstring

Bart Pelstring
