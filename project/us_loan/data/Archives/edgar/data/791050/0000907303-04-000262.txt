                                  Exhibit 99.1
            Press Release issued by the Company on December 22, 2004

          PhotoWorks, Inc. Announces $6.5 Million Recapitalization Plan

             Receives Commitment for $4 Million Capital Infusion and
                 Renegotiates Current Debt and Equity Structure


   SEATTLE, December 22, 2004 - In a deal valued at approximately $6.5 million,
   PhotoWorks, Inc. (OTCBB: FOTO) announced today that it has successfully
   negotiated a recapitalization plan that, if approved by shareholders, will
   result in a simplified capital structure for the Company and a cash infusion
   to strengthen the Company's balance sheet and expand PhotoWorks' digital
   marketing activities.

         "We have received a commitment from a group of investors for a $4
   million capital investment," said Philippe Sanchez, PhotoWorks' President and
   CEO. "In addition, holders of $2.5 million outstanding subordinated
   debentures have agreed to convert their securities to common stock as have
   holders of Series A Preferred stock. These conversions to common stock are
   contingent upon approval by the Company's shareholders of a recapitalization
   plan to be submitted at the upcoming annual meeting scheduled to be held in
   March 2005."

         "This recapitalization proposal is a major achievement for PhotoWorks
   and its shareholders," continued Sanchez. "Upon shareholder approval, the
   Company will be free of long-term debt, will have a simple common stock
   capital structure devoid of any liquidation preferences, and will have growth
   capital needed to position the Company for rapid growth in the booming
   digital market."

   Terms of the Cash Infusion
         Subject to negotiation of definitive agreements and customary closing
   conditions, Sunra Capital Holdings, Orca Bay Partners and Madrona Venture
   Group will purchase $2 million in subordinated notes, convertible into common
   stock at a conversion price of $.1078 per share and warrants to purchase an
   additional approximately 1.9 million shares of common stock at a price of
   $.21 per share. These subordinated notes will automatically convert into
   common stock at the conversion price upon approval by the Company's
   shareholders of the recapitalization proposal outlined below. In addition,
   upon approval of the recapitalization proposal, the investor group will
   purchase an additional $2 million of common stock at $.1078 per share and
   warrants to purchase an additional 1.9 million shares at $.21 per share.

   Recapitalization Proposal
         Subject to shareholders approval, the holders of the Series A Preferred
   Stock and the holders of the Company's outstanding subordinated debentures
   have agreed with the Company on a recapitalization proposal. Under this
   proposal, Series A Preferred Stock will convert to 20,746,888 shares of
   common stock at a conversion
<PAGE>

   price of $.723 per share. The holders of the subordinated debentures will
   convert the $2.5 million principal balance of the debentures due April 2006
   into common stock at a conversion price of $.11 per share. The current
   conversion price of the Series A Preferred Stock is approximately $4.62 per
   share and the conversion price of the subordinated debentures is
   approximately $.736 per share. The proposed plan also includes an increase of
   approximately 17.5 million shares eligible for grant under the Company's
   stock option plans for management incentives. If shareholders approve the
   above plans, the total outstanding share count, including outstanding
   warrants and options and options available for grant, will be approximately
   128 million shares.



   New   Board Composition and Recapitalization Plan to be Submitted for
         Approval by the Shareholders At the annual meeting, a representative
         from Sunra Capital Holdings and a representative from the
   subordinated debt holders will be nominated as directors of the Company's
   board. In addition, the Company will seek to amend its articles of
   incorporation to eliminate its staggered board and provide for cumulative
   voting in the election of its directors.

         The Company will submit its recapitalization proposal for shareholder
   approval at the upcoming annual meeting. If the recapitalization plan is not
   approved by the shareholders, the investor group will not be required to fund
   the additional $2 million of their commitment and the new $2 million
   subordinated notes will not automatically convert into common stock and will
   remain outstanding with an interest rate of 6% per annum and a maturity date
   of April 30, 2008. In addition, the holders of the Series A Preferred Stock
   will not convert their shares into common stock. Likewise, the holders of the
   current subordinated debentures will not convert into common stock and the
   $2.5 million principal balance will remain due in April 2006.
