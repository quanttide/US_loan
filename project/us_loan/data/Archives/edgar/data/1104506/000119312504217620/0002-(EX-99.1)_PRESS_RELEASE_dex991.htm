been informed that on December 20, 2004 Tercica Inc. brought legal action in the United Kingdom against Insmed Incorporated and its contract manufacturer, Avecia Limited, challenging Insmed&#146;s right to make, use and sell its proprietary IGF-
replacement hormone, SomatoKine(R), in the United Kingdom. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">In addition, Insmed
has received a cease and desist letter from Tercica, dated December 17, 2004, regarding certain activities Insmed is conducting in the Unites States. In response to these events, Insmed&#146;s Chief Executive Officer, Geoffrey Allan, stated today:
&#147;We believe that Tercica&#146;s allegations are without merit and intend to vigorously defend our position and right to make SomatoKine(R)&#148;. The action announced yesterday by Tercica is not expected to delay the filing of Insmed&#146;s NDA
for the treatment of GHIS (growth hormone insensitivity syndrome) with SomatoKine(R). </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman"
