ITEM 8.01.    Other Events
              ------------

            On November 22, 2004, Wells Fargo Asset Securities Corporation, a
Delaware corporation (the "Registrant"), sold Mortgage Pass-Through
Certificates, Series 2004-AA, Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3, Class A-4, Class
A-R, Class B-1, Class B-2 and Class B-3 (the "Offered Certificates"), having an
aggregate original principal balance of $397,946,100.00. The Offered
Certificates were issued pursuant to a Pooling and Servicing Agreement, dated as
of November 22, 2004, among the Registrant, Wells Fargo Bank, N.A., as master
servicer (the "Master Servicer" or "Wells Fargo Bank") and Wachovia Bank,
National Association, as trustee (the "Agreement"), a copy of which is filed as
an exhibit hereto. Mortgage Pass-Through Certificates, Series 2004-AA, Class
B-4, Class B-5 and Class B-6 Certificates, having an aggregate initial principal
balance of $2,402,439.23 (the "Private Class B Certificates" and, together with
the Offered Certificates, the "Certificates"), were also issued pursuant to the
Agreement.

            As of the date of initial issuance, the Offered Certificates
evidenced an approximate 99.40% undivided interest in a trust fund (the "Trust
Estate"), consisting principally of a pool of adjustable interest rate,
conventional, monthly pay, fully-amortizing, one-to four-family residential
first mortgage loans. Some of the Mortgage Loans were made in connection with
the relocation of employees by various corporate employers that participated in
the relocation program of Wells Fargo Bank and of the employees of various
non-participant employers. The remaining undivided interests in the Trust Estate
are evidenced by the Private Class B Certificates. Distributions on the Private
Class B Certificates are subordinated to distributions on the Offered
Certificates.

            Interest on the Offered Certificates will be distributed on each
Distribution Date (as defined in the Agreement). Monthly distributions in
reduction of the principal balance of the Offered Certificates will be allocated
to the Offered Certificates in accordance with the priorities set forth in the
Agreement. Distributions of interest and in reduction of principal balance on
any Distribution Date will be made to the extent that the Pool Distribution
Amount is sufficient therefor.

            An election will be made to treat the Trust Estate as a REMIC for
federal income tax purposes (the "REMIC"). The Class A-1, Class A-2, Class A-3,
Class A-4, Class B-1, Class B-2, Class B-3, Class B-4, Class B-5 and Class B-6
Certificates will be treated as "regular interests" in the REMIC and the Class
A-R Certificate will be treated as the "residual interest" in the REMIC.
