all meetings of stockholders shall be given by the Clerk/Secretary (or by
any other officer who is entitled to call such a meeting) not less than
seven (7) nor more than sixty (60) days before the meeting to each
stockholder who is entitled to such notice, by leaving such notice with him
or at his residence or usual place of business, or by mailing it, postage
prepaid, and addressed to such stockholder at his address as it appears in
the records of the corporation. Notice of a meeting need not be given to a
stockholder if a written waiver of notice, executed before or after the
meeting by such stockholder or his attorney thereunto duly authorized, is
filed with the records of the meeting.

      When a meeting is adjourned to another place, date or time, notice
need not be given of the new place, date or time if the new place, date and
time thereof are announced at the meeting at which the adjournment is
taken; provided, however, that if the date of any adjourned meeting is more

notice of the place, date and time of the adjourned meeting shall be given
in conformity herewith.  At any adjourned meeting, any business may be
transacted which might have been transacted at the original meeting.

      Section 5.  Quorum.  A majority of the outstanding capital stock of
the Corporation entitled to vote thereat, represented in person or by
proxy, shall constitute a quorum for the transaction of business at any

      The act of a majority in interest of those stockholders present at
any meeting at which there is a quorum shall be the act of the corporation.
The stockholders present at a duly constituted meeting may continue to
transact business until adjournment notwithstanding the withdrawal of
enough stockholders to leave less than a quorum.  If a quorum shall fail to
attend any meeting, the Chairman, the President or the holders of a
majority of the shares of stock entitled to vote who are present, in person
or by proxy, may adjourn any meeting from time to time until a quorum is
present.

      Section 6.  Conduct of Meetings.  The Chairman of the Board of
Directors shall preside at all sessions of all meetings of stockholders. In

meeting, the stockholders shall choose a stockholder as temporary Chairman
and the stockholder so chosen shall preside until said session of the
meeting is adjourned.

President, by a majority of the Board of Directors or by stockholders of
record holding, in total, not less than forty percent (40%) of the capital
stock of the Corporation at the time issued and outstanding, by delivering

conducted as shall have been brought before the meeting by or at the
direction of the President, the Board of Directors, or as a result of a
written application for a special meeting brought by stockholders in
accordance with Article II, Section 3 of these By-Laws.

      The Chairman, President or other person presiding over the meeting of
stockholders shall, if the facts so warrant, determine that business was
not properly brought before the meeting in accordance with the provisions
of this Section 6 and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so
declare to the meeting and any such business shall not be transacted.

      Section 7.  Board of Director Nominations.  Only persons who are
nominated in accordance with the procedures set forth in these By-Laws
shall be eligible for election or re-election as Directors.  Nominations of
persons for election to the Board of Directors of the Corporation may be
made only: (i) by or at the direction of the Board of Directors; or (ii) by
any stockholder of the Corporation entitled to vote for the election of
Directors at the meeting who complies with the notice procedures set forth
in this Section 7.

      Stockholder nominations shall be made by notice in writing to the
Clerk/Secretary not less than sixty (60) days in advance of the date of the
Corporation's proxy statement which was released to stockholders in
connection with the previous year's annual meeting of stockholders.  Such
stockholder's notice shall set forth: (i) as to each person whom such
stockholder proposes to nominate for election or re-election as a Director,
all information relating to such person that is required to be disclosed in
solicitations of proxies for the election of Directors, or is otherwise
required, in each case pursuant to Regulation 14A under the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934 (including such person's written consent to being
named in the proxy statement as a nominee and to serving as a Director if
elected); and (ii) as to the stockholder giving notice of (x) the name and
address, as they appear on the Corporation's books, of such stockholder and
(y) the class and number of shares of the Corporation's capital stock that
are beneficially owned by such stockholder.  At the request of the Board of
Directors any person nominated by the Board of Directors for election as a
Director shall furnish to the Clerk/Secretary that information required to
be set forth in a stockholder's notice which pertains to the nominee.

      The Chairman, President or other person presiding over the meeting of
stockholders shall, if the facts so warrant, determine that a nomination
was not made in accordance with the nomination provisions of this Section 7
and, if he or she should so determine, he or she shall so declare to the
meeting and the defective nomination shall be disregarded.


<PAGE>


      Nothing contained in this Section 7 shall require proxy materials
distributed by the management of the Corporation to include any information
with respect to nominations by stockholders.

      Section 8.  Proxies and Voting.  Stockholders, at any meeting, shall
have one (1) vote for each share of stock held and a proportionate vote for
each fractional share.  At any meeting of the stockholders, every
stockholder entitled to vote may vote in person or by proxy authorized by
an instrument in writing or by a transmission permitted by law filed in
accordance with the procedure established for the meeting.  Proxies shall
be in written form and shall be dated not more than six (6) months before
the meeting named therein, unless the proxy is coupled with an interest and
provides otherwise.  Any copy, facsimile telecommunication or other
reliable reproduction of the writing or transmission created pursuant to
this paragraph may be substituted or used in lieu of the original writing
or transmission for any and all purposes for which the original writing or
transmission could be used, provided that such copy, facsimile
telecommunication or other reproduction shall be a complete reproduction of
the entire original writing or transmission.

      Proxies shall be filed with the Clerk/Secretary at the meeting, or of
any adjournment thereof, before being voted.  Except as otherwise limited
therein, proxies shall entitle the persons authorized thereby to vote at
any adjournment of such meeting, but they shall not be valid after final
adjournment of such meeting.  A proxy with respect to stock held in the
name of two or more persons shall be valid if executed by any one of them
unless, at or prior to exercise of the proxy, the Corporation receives a
specific written notice to the contrary from any one of them.  A proxy
purporting to be executed by or on behalf of a stockholder shall be deemed
valid unless challenged at or prior to its exercise and the burden of
proving invalidity shall rest on the challenger.

      Section 9.  Stock Certificates.  Stock certificates shall be signed
by any two of the following officers: The Chairman of the Board of
Directors, the President, the Executive Vice-President, the Senior Vice-
President, and the Treasurer and may bear the seal of the Corporation or a
facsimile thereof.  Such signatures may be facsimile if the certificate is
signed by a transfer agent, or by a registrar, other than a Director,
officer or employee of the Corporation.

      Section 10.  Transfer of Stock.  Transfer of shares of stock of the
Bancorp shall be recorded on its books upon the direction, in writing and
in such form as may be prescribed by the Board of Directors, of the holder
thereof.

      Section 11.  Stock and Transfer Books.  The corporation shall keep in
the Commonwealth of Massachusetts at its principal office (or at an office
of its transfer agent or of its Clerk/Secretary or of its resident agent)
stock and transfer records, which shall contain the names of all
stockholders and the record address and the amount of


<PAGE>


stock held by each. The corporation for all purposes may conclusively
presume that the registered holder of a stock certificate is the absolute
owner of the shares represented thereby and that his record address is his
proper address.

      Section 12.  Record Date.  The directors may fix in advance a time,
which shall not be more than seventy (70) days before:

      (i)    the date of any meeting of stockholders, or

      (ii)   the date for the payment of any dividend or the making of any
             distribution to stockholders, or

      (iii)  the last day on which the consent or dissent of stockholders
             may be effectively expressed for any purpose;

      as the record date for determining the stockholders having the right
to notice of and to vote at such meeting and any adjournment thereof or the
right to receive such dividend or distribution or the right to give such
consent or dissent. In such case, only stockholders of record on such date
shall have such right, notwithstanding any transfer of stock on the books
of the Corporation after the record date; or without fixing such record
date, the directors may for any such purpose close the transfer books for
all or any part of such period.

            Directors may also be enlarged from the size fixed by the
            stockholders but within the limits specified in paragraph (a)
            at any time

special meeting of stockholders increases the number of Directors,
Directors to fill the places thus created may be elected at any special
meeting of stockholders at which the election of such Directors is a matter
of business properly before the meeting and shall hold their respective
offices in accordance with their class designation until the next following
appropriate annual meeting of stockholders, and thereafter until their

necessary to make it effective.

      Vacancies in the Board of Directors, including vacancies created by
enlargement of the Board of Directors by vote of the Directors under
Section 1 above, may be filled by majority vote of the full Board of
Directors. The person chosen to fill any vacancy in the Board of Directors

assigned.

meeting from time to time until a quorum is present, without further notice
or waiver thereof.

Members of the Board of Directors, or of any committee thereof, may
participate in a meeting of such Board or committee by means of conference
telephone or similar communications equipment by means of which all persons

shall constitute presence in person at such meeting.

      Section 6.  Action Without a Meeting.  Any action required or

                                 ----------

          Indemnification of Directors, Officers and Certain Others
          ---------------------------------------------------------


<PAGE>


      The corporation shall indemnify any Director and may as determined by
the Board of Directors, indemnify any officer of the corporation or any
person serving at the Corporation's request as a Trustee or administrator
of any employees benefit plan of the corporation, against all expenses
(including court costs, attorneys' fees and the amount of any judgment or
reasonable settlement) actually and reasonably incurred by him, subsequent
to the adoption hereof, in connection with any claim asserted against him,
or any action, suit or proceeding in which he may be involved as a party,
by reason of his having been such Director, officer, trustee or
administrator or by reason of any action alleged to have been taken or
omitted by him as such Director, officer, trustee or administrator;
provided, however, that the corporation shall indemnify such director,
officer, trustee or administrator against expenses incurred in relation to
any matter with respect to which an allegation is made against him of
willful misconduct, willful default or of gross negligence in the conduct
of his office only if there be no final adjudication that such person is
guilty of or liable for such willful misconduct, willful default or gross
negligence and one of the following three conditions be complied with:

      (a)   There be a final adjudication that such person is not guilty of
            or liable for such willful misconduct, willful default or gross
            negligence;

      (b)   There be a sufficient number of Directors then in office who
            are not involved in such claim, action, suit or proceeding, to
            constitute a majority of the whole Board of Directors, and
            there be a determination that such person is free from such
            willful misconduct, willful default or gross negligence by a
            vote of a majority of the Directors on a ballot in which no
            Director who is involved in such claim, action, suit or
            proceeding shall participate; or

      (c)   There be a determination that such person is free from such
            willful misconduct, willful default, or gross negligence by a
            vote of a majority of a committee of seven stockholders, none
            of whom is involved in such claim, action, suit or proceeding,
            chosen to determine such matter at a regular or special meeting
            of the stockholders of the Corporation.

      Such indemnification may include payment by the corporation of
expenses incurred in defending a civil or criminal action or proceeding in
advance of the final disposition of such action or proceeding, upon receipt
of an undertaking by the person indemnified to repay such payment if he
shall be adjudicated to be not entitled to indemnification under this
Article which undertaking may be accepted without reference to the
financial ability of such person to make repayment. Any such
indemnification may be provided although the person to be indemnified is no
longer an officer, director, trustee or administrator.

      No indemnification shall be provided for any person with respect to
any matter as to which he shall have been adjudicated in any proceeding not
to have acted in good faith


<PAGE>


in the reasonable belief that his action was in the best interest of the
corporation or to the extent that such matter relates to service with
respect to any employee benefit plan, in the best interests of the
participants or beneficiaries of such employee benefit plan.

      The right of indemnification herein provided for shall inure to the
benefit of the executors or administrators of each such Director, officer,
trustee or administrator and shall not be deemed exclusive of any other
rights to which he may be entitled, under any, statute, By-Law, agreement,
vote of stockholders or otherwise, or to which he might have been entitled
were it not for this provision.

which, together with its "Affiliates" and "Associates" (as defined in Rule
12B-2 of the General Rules and Regulations under the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934 as in effect at the date of the adoption of this Article),

Regulations under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 as in effect at the
date of the adoption of this Article) in the aggregate 20 percent or more
of the outstanding Voting Stock of the Corporation, and any Affiliate or
Associate of any such individual, corporation, partnership or other person
or entity. Without limitation, any share of Voting Stock of the Corporation
that any interested Person has the right to acquire at any time
(notwithstanding that Rule 13d-3 deems such shares to be beneficially owned
only if such right may be exercised within 60 days) pursuant to any
agreement, or upon exercise of conversion rights, warrants or options, or
otherwise, shall be deemed to be Beneficially Owned by the Interested

Directors.

to each class and series of capital stock of the Corporation, the amount
determined by two-thirds of the Continuing Directors to be the highest per
share price equivalent of the highest price that can be determined to have
been paid at any time by the Interested Person for any share or shares of
any class or series of capital stock of the Corporation. In determining the
Fair Price, all purchases by the Interested Person shall be taken into
account regardless of whether the shares were purchased before or after the
Interested Person became an Interested Person. Also, the Fair Price shall
include any brokerage commissions, transfer taxes and soliciting dealers'
fees paid by the Interested Person with respect to the shares of capital
stock of the Corporation acquired by the Interested Person. In case of any

than 20 percent of the fair market value as determined by two-thirds of the

stockholders other than Interested Persons or other parties to such
Business Combination in the event of a Business Combination in which the

determinations, the Continuing Directors may engage such persons, including
investment banking firms and the independent accountants who have reported
on the most recent financial statements of the Corporation, and utilize
employees and agents of the Corporation, who will, in the judgment of the
Continuing Directors, be of assistance to the Continuing Directors. Any

      Section 1.  Amendment by Directors.  The Bylaws of the Corporation
may be amended or repealed by the affirmative vote of two-thirds of the
full Board at a duly constituted meeting of the Board of Directors, unless
