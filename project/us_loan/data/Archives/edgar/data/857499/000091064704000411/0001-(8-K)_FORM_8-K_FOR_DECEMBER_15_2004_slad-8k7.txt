Item 5.03   Amendments to Articles of Incorporation or Bylaws; Change in
            Fiscal Year

      Effective December 15, 2004, the Board of Directors of Slade's Ferry
Bancorp. (the "Company") amended and restated the Company's bylaws (the
"Amended Bylaws").  The following is a summary of the changes effected by
adoption of the Amended Bylaws, which is quantified in its entirety by
reference to the Amended Bylaws filed as an Exhibit hereto.

      ARTICLE II - STOCKHOLDERS

      Place of Meetings.  The Amended Bylaws clarify that meetings of
stockholders shall be held at such place as designated by the Board of
Directors.

      Annual Meetings.  The Amended Bylaws eliminate the requirement that
annual meetings of stockholders be held on the second Monday of April in
each year.  Annual meetings of stockholders may be held on any date the
Board of Directors designates, so long as the meeting is held within six
months of the end of the Company's fiscal year.

      The Amended Bylaws also eliminate the requirement that a
Clerk/Secretary be elected at the annual meeting of stockholders.

      Special Meetings.  Consistent with Massachusetts law, the Amended
Bylaws increase, from 10% to 40%, the minimum amount of outstanding shares
of the Company's voting stock that must be owned by stockholders in order
to call a special meeting of stockholders.

      The Amended Bylaws change, from five to a majority, the number of
directors who may call a special meeting of stockholders.

      Notice.  Consistent with Massachusetts law, the Amended Bylaws
provide that notice of stockholders meetings must be no less than seven,
and no more than 60, days prior to the meeting.  A provision was added to
the Amended Bylaws regarding notice requirements and procedures applicable
to adjourned meetings of stockholders.

      Conduct of Meetings.  Consistent with Massachusetts law, the Amended
Bylaws increase, from 10% to 40%, the minimum amount of outstanding shares
of the Company's voting stock that must be owned by stockholders in order
to bring additional business before a meeting of stockholders.  The Amended
Bylaws change, from five to a majority, the number of directors who may
bring additional business before a meeting of stockholders.

      Quorum.  A provision was added to the Amended Bylaws that provides
for procedures in the event of a withdrawal of stockholders from a meeting
that results in there being less than a quorum present.

      Board of Director Nominations.  The Amended Bylaws add a provision
setting forth the requirements for director nominations.  Director
nominations may be made only by the Board of Directors or by a stockholder
who complies with certain procedural requirements.  Nominations

by stockholders must be made by proper notice in writing at least 60 days
in advance of the date the Company's proxy statement was released to
stockholders in connection with the previous year's annual meeting.

      Proxies and Voting.  A standard provision was added to the Amended
Bylaws to allow for voting by proxy at stockholder meetings.  The provision
establishes procedures and requirements for voting by proxy.

      Record Date.  Consistent with Massachusetts law, the Amended Bylaws
provide that a record date may not be more than 70 days in advance of a
stockholder meeting.

      ARTICLE III - BOARD OF DIRECTORS

      Meetings.  The Amended Bylaws provide that special meetings of the
Board of Directors may be called by the Chairman of the Board, the
President, a majority of the members of the Board of Directors or a
majority of the members of the Executive Committee.  Previously, the bylaws
provided that special meetings of the Board of Directors could be called by
the Chairman of the Board, the President, five members of the Board of
Directors or two members of the Executive Committee.

      Participation in Meetings by Teleconference.  A provision was added
to the Amended Bylaws to provide that directors and committee members may
participate in meetings by means of conference telephone or similar
communications equipment by means of which all persons participating in the
meeting can hear each other.  Such attendance constitutes attendance in
person.

      Action Without a Meeting.  A provision was added to the Amended
Bylaws to provide that the Board of Directors may act by unanimous written
consent.

      ARTICLE IV - COMMITTEES

      Committees of the Board of Directors.  A provision was added to the
Amended Bylaws providing the Board of Directors with the general power to
create committees and delegate power to them.

      Conduct of Business.  Provisions were added to the Amended Bylaws to
allow committees to act by unanimous written consent and to determine their
own procedural rules for meetings and conducting business.

      Audit Committee.  Provisions were added to the Amended Bylaws
requiring the Board of Directors to have an Audit Committee that is in
compliance with applicable federal laws and the rules and regulations of
the Securities and Exchange Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market (or
other market or exchange on which the Company's common stock is traded).

      Nominating Committee.  Provisions were added to the Amended Bylaws
requiring the Board of Directors to have a Nominating Committee that is in
compliance with applicable

federal laws and the rules and regulations of the Securities and Exchange
Commission and the Nasdaq Stock Market (or other market or exchange on
which the Company's common stock is traded).

      ARTICLE V - OFFICERS

      References to the Clerk/Secretary as being elected by the
stockholders, rather than the Board of Directors, have been eliminated.

      ARTICLE VII - MISCELLANEOUS

      A "Miscellaneous" Article has been added to the Amended Bylaws to
cover certain items not covered elsewhere.  Such items include:

      *     allowing the President (or any officer authorized by the
            President) to exercise any rights the Company possesses by
            reason of its ownership of securities of other corporations;

      *     allowing for the use of facsimile signatures whenever and as
            authorized by the Board of Directors or a committee thereof;
            and

      *     allowing all instruments and obligations to be entered into by
            the Company in the ordinary course of business to be executed
            on behalf of the Company by the Chairman of the Board,
            President, any Vice President, Treasurer or any other officer,
            employee or agent of the Company as the Board of Directors may
            authorize.
