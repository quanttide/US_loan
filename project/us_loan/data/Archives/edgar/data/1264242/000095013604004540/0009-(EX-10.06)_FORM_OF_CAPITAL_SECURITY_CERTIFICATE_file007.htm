                          [FORM OF REVERSE OF SECURITY]

         Distributions payable on each Capital Security will be payable at a
variable per annum rate of interest, reset quarterly, equal to LIBOR (as defined
in the Declaration) plus 3.85% (the "Coupon Rate"), of the stated liquidation
amount of $1,000 per Capital Security, such Coupon Rate being the rate of
interest payable on the Debentures to be held by the Institutional Trustee.
Distributions in arrears for more than one Distribution Period will bear
interest thereon compounded quarterly at the applicable Coupon Rate for each
such Distribution Period (to the extent permitted by applicable law). The term
"Distributions" as used herein includes cash distributions, any such compounded
distributions and any Additional Interest payable on the Debentures unless
otherwise stated. A Distribution is payable only to the extent that payments are
made in respect of the Debentures held by the Institutional Trustee and to the
extent the Institutional Trustee has funds legally available in the Property
Account therefor. The amount of Distributions payable for any period will be
computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of days elapsed in
the relevant Distribution Period.

         Except as otherwise described below, Distributions on the Capital
Securities will be cumulative, will accrue from the date of original issuance
and will be payable quarterly in arrears on March 15, June 15, September 15 and
December 15 of each year, commencing on March 15, 2005 (each, a "Distribution
Payment Date"). Upon submission of Notice, the Debenture Issuer has the right
under the Indenture to defer payments of interest on the Debentures by extending
the interest payment period for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods (each
such extended interest payment period together with all previous and future
consecutive extensions thereof, is referred to herein as an "Extension Period")
at any time and from time to time on the Debentures, subject to the conditions
described below, and in the Declaration and the Indenture, during which
Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable (except any Additional
Interest that may be due and payable). During any Extension Period, interest
will continue to accrue on the Debentures, and interest on such accrued interest
(such accrued interest and interest thereon referred to herein as "Deferred
Interest") will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Coupon Rate in effect for
each such Extension Period, compounded quarterly from the date such Deferred
Interest would have been payable were it not for the Extension Period, to the
extent permitted by law. No Extension Period may end on a date other than a
Distribution Payment Date. At the end of any such Extension Period, the
Debenture Issuer shall pay all Deferred Interest then accrued and unpaid on the
Debentures; provided, however, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the
Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date. Prior to the
termination of any Extension Period, the Debenture Issuer may further extend
such Extension Period, provided, that such period together with all such
previous and further consecutive extensions thereof shall not exceed 20
consecutive quarterly periods, or extend beyond the Maturity Date. Upon the
termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of all Deferred
Interest, the Debenture Issuer may commence a new Extension Period, subject to
the foregoing requirements. No interest or Deferred Interest (except any
Additional Amounts that may be due and payable) shall be due and payable during
an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but Deferred Interest shall
accrue upon each installment of interest that would otherwise have been due and
payable during such Extension Period until such installment is paid. If
Distributions are deferred, the Distributions due shall be paid on the date that
the related Extension Period terminates to Holders of the Securities as they
appear on the books and records of the Trust on the record date immediately
preceding such date. Distributions on the Securities must be paid on the dates


                                     A-1-5
<PAGE>

payable (after giving effect to any Extension Period) to the extent that the
Trust has funds legally available for the payment of such distributions in the
Property Account of the Trust. The Trust's funds available for Distribution to
the Holders of the Securities will be limited to payments received from the
Debenture Issuer. The payment of Distributions out of moneys held by the Trust
is guaranteed by the Guarantor pursuant to the Guarantee.

         The Capital Securities shall be redeemable as provided in the
Declaration.
