                   Junior Subordinated Debt Security due 2035

                                       of

                          Quanta Capital Holdings Ltd.

         Quanta Capital Holdings Ltd., a company incorporated in Bermuda (the
"Company"), for value received promises to pay to JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A., not
in its individual capacity but solely as Institutional Trustee for Quanta
Capital Statutory Trust I, a Delaware statutory trust (the "Holder"), or
registered assigns, the principal sum of Forty One Million Two Hundred Thirty
Eight Thousand Dollars on March 15, 2035 (or earlier upon any Redemption Date or
the Special Redemption Date, or any earlier date of acceleration of maturity of
this Debt Security and to pay interest on the outstanding principal amount of
this debt security from December 21, 2004, or from the most recent Interest
Payment Date to which interest has been paid or duly provided for, quarterly
(subject to deferral as set forth herein) in arrears on March 15, June 15,
September 15 and December 15 of each year commencing March 15, 2005 (each such
date, an "Interest Payment Date"), at a floating rate per annum equal to LIBOR
(as defined in the Indenture) plus 3.85% (the "Interest Rate") until the
principal hereof shall have become due and payable, and on any overdue principal
and (without duplication and to the extent that payment of such interest is
enforceable under applicable law) on any overdue installment of interest at an
annual rate equal to the Interest Rate in effect for each such Extension Period
compounded quarterly. The amount of interest payable on any Interest Payment
Date shall be computed on the basis of a 360-day year and the actual number of
days elapsed in the relevant interest period.

         The interest installment so payable, and punctually paid or duly
provided for, on any Interest Payment Date will, as provided in the Indenture,
be paid to the Person in whose name this Debt Security (or one or more
Predecessor Securities, as defined in said Indenture) is registered at the close
of business on the "regular record date" for such interest installment, except
that interest and any Deferred Interest payable on the Maturity Date shall be
paid to the Person to whom principal is paid. Any such interest installment not
punctually paid or duly provided for shall forthwith cease to be payable to the
registered holders on such regular record date and may be paid to the Person in
whose name this Debt Security (or one or more Predecessor Debt Securities) is
registered at the close of business on a special record date to be fixed by the
Trustee for the payment of such defaulted interest, notice whereof shall be
given to the registered holders of the Debt Securities not less than 10 days
prior to such special record date, all as more fully provided in the Indenture.

         The principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Debt
Security shall be payable at the office or agency of the Trustee (or other
Paying Agent appointed by the Company) maintained for that purpose in any coin
or currency of the United States of America that at the time of payment is legal
tender for payment of public and private debts; provided, however, that payment
of interest may be made at the option of the Company by check mailed to the
registered holder at such address as shall appear in the Debt Security Register
or by wire transfer of immediately available funds to an account appropriately
designated by the holder hereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, so long as the
holder of this Debt Security is the Institutional Trustee, the payment of the
principal of and premium, if any, and interest on this Debt Security will be
made in immediately available funds at such place and to such account as may be


                                      -3-
<PAGE>

designated by the Institutional Trustee. All payments in respect of this Debt
Security shall be payable in any coin or currency of the United States of
America that at the time of payment is legal tender for payment of public and
private debt.

         Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained herein, if any
Interest Payment Date, other than the Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or the
Special Redemption Date, falls on a day that is not a Business Day, then any
interest payable will be paid on, and such Interest Payment Date will be moved
to, the next succeeding Business Day, and additional interest will accrue for
each day that such payment is delayed as a result thereof. If the Maturity Date,
Redemption Date or the Special Redemption Date falls on a day that is not a
Business Day, then the principal, premium, if any, and/or interest payable on
such date will be paid on the next succeeding Business Day (and no additional
interest will accrue in respect of such payment made on such next succeeding
Business Day), except that, if such Business Day falls in the next succeeding
calendar year, then such payment shall be made on the immediately preceding
Business Day with the same force and effect as if such payment had been made on
such Maturity Date, Redemption Date or Special Redemption Date.

         Upon submission of Notice (as defined in the Indenture) and so long as
no Event of Default has occurred and is continuing, the Company shall have the
right, from time to time and without causing an Event of Default, to defer
payments of interest on the Debt Securities by extending the interest payment
period on the Debt Securities at any time and from time to time during the term
of the Debt Securities, for up to 20 consecutive quarterly periods (each such
extended interest payment period, together with all previous and further
consecutive extensions thereof, is referred to herein as an "Extension Period"),
during which Extension Period no interest shall be due and payable (except any
Additional Interest that may be due and payable). During any Extension Period,
interest will continue to accrue on the Debt Securities, and interest on such
accrued interest (such accrued interest and interest thereon referred to herein
as "Deferred Interest") will accrue at an annual rate equal to the Interest Rate
in effect for each such Extension Period, compounded quarterly from the date
such Deferred Interest would have been payable were it not for the Extension
Period, to the extent permitted by law. No Extension Period may end on a date
other than an Interest Payment Date. At the end of any such Extension Period the
Company shall pay all Deferred Interest then accrued and unpaid on the Debt
Securities; provided, however, that no Extension Period may extend beyond the
Maturity Date, any Redemption Date or the Special Redemption Date and provided,
further, however, during any such Extension Period, the Company may not (i)
declare or pay any dividends or distributions on, or redeem, purchase, acquire,
or make a liquidation payment with respect to, any of the Company's capital
stock, (ii) make any payment on or repay, repurchase or redeem any debt
securities of the Company that rank pari passu in all respects with or junior in
interest to the Debt Securities or (iii) make any payment under any guarantees
of the Company that rank in all respects pari passu with or junior in interest
to the Capital Securities Guarantee (other than (a) repurchases, redemptions or
other acquisitions of shares of capital stock of the Company (A) in connection
with any employment contract, benefit plan or other similar arrangement with or
for the benefit of one or more employees, officers, directors or consultants,
(B) in connection with a dividend reinvestment or stockholder stock purchase
plan or (C) in connection with the issuance of capital stock of the Company (or
securities convertible into or exercisable for such capital stock), as
consideration in an acquisition transaction entered into prior to the applicable
Extension Period, (b) as a result of any exchange, reclassification or
conversion of any class or


                                      -4-
<PAGE>

series of the Company's capital stock (or any capital stock of a subsidiary of
the Company) for any class or series of the Company's capital stock or of any
class or series of the Company's indebtedness for any class or series of the
Company's capital stock, (c) the purchase of fractional interests in shares of
the Company's capital stock pursuant to the conversion or exchange provisions of
such capital stock or the security being converted or exchanged, (d) any
declaration of a dividend in connection with any stockholder's rights plan, or
the issuance of rights, stock or other property under any stockholder's rights
plan, or the redemption or repurchase of rights pursuant thereto, or (e) any
dividend in the form of stock, warrants, options or other rights where the
dividend stock or the stock issuable upon exercise of such warrants, options or
other rights is the same stock as that on which the dividend is being paid or
ranks pari passu with or junior to such stock). Prior to the termination of any
Extension Period, the Company may further extend such Extension Period,
provided, that such period together with all such previous and further
consecutive extensions thereof shall not exceed 20 consecutive quarterly
periods. Upon the termination of any Extension Period and upon the payment of
all Deferred Interest, the Company may commence a new Extension Period, subject
to the foregoing requirements. No interest or Deferred Interest shall be due and
payable during an Extension Period, except at the end thereof, but Deferred
Interest shall accrue upon each installment of interest that would otherwise
have been due and payable during such Extension Period until such installment is
paid. The Company must give the Trustee notice of its election to begin or
extend such Extension Period not later than the related regular record date for
the next succeeding Interest Payment Date.

         The indebtedness evidenced by this Debt Security is, to the extent
provided in the Indenture, subordinate and junior in right of payment to the
prior payment in full of all Senior Indebtedness, and this Debt Security is
issued subject to the provisions of the Indenture with respect thereto. Each
holder of this Debt Security, by accepting the same, (a) agrees to and shall be
bound by such provisions, (b) authorizes and directs the Trustee on such
holder's behalf to take such action as may be necessary or appropriate to
acknowledge or effectuate the subordination so provided and (c) appoints the
Trustee such holder's attorney-in-fact for any and all such purposes. Each
holder hereof, by such holder's acceptance hereof, hereby waives all notice of
the acceptance of the subordination provisions contained herein and in the
Indenture by each holder of Senior Indebtedness, whether now outstanding or
hereafter incurred, and waives reliance by each such holder upon said
provisions.

         The Company waives diligence, demand, presentment for payment, notice
of nonpayment, notice of protest, and all other notices.

         This Debt Security shall not be entitled to any benefit under the
Indenture hereinafter referred to and shall not be valid or become obligatory
for any purpose until the certificate of authentication hereon shall have been
signed by or on behalf of the Trustee.

         The provisions of this Debt Security are continued on the reverse side
hereof and such continued provisions shall for all purposes have the same effect
as though fully set forth at this place.

                              [REVERSE OF SECURITY]

         This Debt Security is one of a duly authorized series of Debt
Securities of the Company, all issued or to be issued pursuant to an Indenture
(the "Indenture"), dated as of December 21, 2004, duly executed and delivered
between the Company and JPMorgan Chase Bank, N.A. as Trustee (the "Trustee"), to
which Indenture and all indentures supplemental thereto reference is hereby made
for a description of the rights, limitations of rights, obligations, duties and
immunities thereunder of the Trustee, the Company and the holders of the Debt
Securities (referred to herein as the "Debt Securities") of which this Debt
Security is a part. The summary of the terms of this Debt Security contained
herein does not purport to be complete and is qualified by reference to the
Indenture.

         Upon the occurrence and continuation of a Tax Event, an Investment
Company Event (each a "Special Event"), this Debt Security may become due and
payable, in whole but not in part, at any time, within 90 days following the
occurrence of such Tax Event or an Investment Company Event (the "Special
Redemption Date"), as the case may be, at the Special Redemption Price. In the
event that the Special Redemption Date falls on a day prior to the LIBOR
Determination Date for any Interest Period, then the Company shall be required
to pay to Securityholders, on the Business Day following such LIBOR
Determination Date, any additional amount of interest that would have been
payable on the Special Redemption Date had the amount of interest determined on
such LIBOR Determination Date been known on the first day of such Interest
Period.

         The Company shall also have the right to redeem this Debt Security at
its option, in whole or (provided that all accrued and unpaid interest has been
paid on all Debt Securities for all Interest Period terminating on or prior to
such date) from time to time in part, on any Interest Payment Date on or after
March 15, 2010 (each, a Redemption Date"), at the Redemption Price (as defined
herein).

         Any redemption pursuant to the preceding two paragraphs will be made,
upon not less than 30 days' nor more than 60 days' prior written notice. If the
Debt Securities are only partially redeemed by the Company, the Debt Securities
will be redeemed pro rata or by lot or by any other method utilized by the
Trustee.

         "Redemption Price" means 100% of the principal amount of the Debt
Securities being redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest on such Debt
Securities to the Redemption Date.

         "Special Redemption Price" means (1) if the Special Redemption Date is
before March 15, 2010, 107.5% of the principal amount to be redeemed plus any
accrued and unpaid interest thereon to the date of such redemption and (2) if
the Special Redemption Date is on or after March 15, 2010, the Redemption Price
for such Special Redemption Date.

         In the event of redemption of this Debt Security in part only, a new
Debt Security or Debt Securities for the unredeemed portion hereof will be
issued in the name of the holder hereof upon the cancellation hereof.

         In case an Event of Default, as defined in the Indenture, shall have
occurred and be continuing, the principal of all of the Debt Securities may be
declared, and, in certain cases, shall


                                      -7-
<PAGE>

ipso facto become, due and payable, and upon any such declaration of
acceleration shall become due and payable, in each case, in the manner, with the
effect and subject to the conditions provided in the Indenture.

         The Indenture contains provisions permitting the Company and the
Trustee, with the consent of the holders of not less than a majority in
aggregate principal amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding
affected thereby, as specified in the Indenture, to execute supplemental
indentures for the purpose of adding any provisions to or changing in any manner
or eliminating any of the provisions of the Indenture or of any supplemental
indenture or of modifying in any manner the rights of the holders of the Debt
Securities; provided, however, that no such supplemental indenture shall, among
other things, without the consent of the holders of each Debt Security then
outstanding and affected thereby (i) change the Maturity Date of the Debt
Securities, or reduce the principal amount thereof or any redemption premium
thereon, or reduce the rate or manner of calculation of the rate or extend the
time of payment of interest thereon, or reduce any amounts payable upon
redemption thereof or make payments due on the Debt Securities payable in any
coin or currency other than United States Dollars, or impair or affect the right
of any holder of Debt Securities to institute suit for the payment thereof, or
(ii) reduce the aforesaid percentage of Debt Securities, the holders of which
are required to consent to any such supplemental indenture. The Indenture also
contains provisions permitting the holders of a majority in aggregate principal
amount of the Debt Securities at the time outstanding, on behalf of all of the
holders of the Debt Securities, to waive any past default in the performance of
any of the covenants contained in the Indenture, or established pursuant to the
Indenture, and its consequences, except (a) a default in payments due in respect
of any of the Debt Securities, (b) in respect of covenants or provisions of the
Indenture which cannot be modified or amended without the consent of the holder
of each Debt Security affected, or (c) in respect of the covenants of the
Company relating to its ownership of Common Securities of the Trust. Any such
consent or waiver by the registered holder of this Debt Security (unless revoked
as provided in the Indenture) shall be conclusive and binding upon such holder
and upon all future holders and owners of this Debt Security and of any Debt
Security issued in exchange herefor or in place hereof (whether by registration
of transfer or otherwise), irrespective of whether or not any notation of such
consent or waiver is made upon this Debt Security.

         No reference herein to the Indenture and no provision of this Debt
Security or of the Indenture shall alter or impair the obligation of the
Company, which is absolute and unconditional, to pay all payments due on this
Debt Security at the time and place and at the rate and in the money herein
prescribed.

         As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations herein
and therein set forth, this Debt Security is transferable by the registered
holder hereof on the Debt Security Register of the Company, upon surrender of
this Debt Security for registration of transfer at the office or agency of the
Trustee in Houston, Texas accompanied by a written instrument or instruments of
transfer in form satisfactory to the Company or the Trustee duly executed by the
registered holder hereof or such holder's attorney duly authorized in writing,
and thereupon one or more new Debt Securities of authorized denominations and
for the same aggregate principal amount will be issued to the designated
transferee or transferees. No service charge will be made for any such
registration of transfer, but the Company may require payment of a sum
sufficient to cover any tax or other governmental charge payable in relation
thereto.


                                      -8-
<PAGE>

         Prior to due presentment for registration of transfer of this Debt
Security, the Company, the Trustee, any Authenticating Agent, any Paying Agent,
any transfer agent and the Debt Security registrar may deem and treat the
registered holder hereof as the absolute owner hereof (whether or not this Debt
Security shall be overdue and notwithstanding any notice of ownership or writing
hereon) for the purpose of receiving payment of or on account of the principal
of and premium, if any, hereof and interest due hereon and for all other
purposes, and neither the Company nor the Trustee nor any Authenticating Agent
nor any Paying Agent nor any transfer agent nor any Debt Security registrar
shall be affected by any notice to the contrary.

         No recourse shall be had for the payment of the principal of or the
interest on this Debt Security, or for any claim based hereon, or otherwise in
respect hereof, or based on or in respect of the Indenture, against any
incorporator, stockholder, officer or director, past, present or future, as
such, of the Company or of any predecessor or successor corporation, whether by
virtue of any constitution, statute or rule of law, or by the enforcement of any
assessment or penalty or otherwise, all such liability being, by the acceptance
hereof and as part of the consideration for the issuance hereof, expressly
waived and released.

         The Debt Securities are issuable only in registered certificated form
without coupons. As provided in the Indenture and subject to certain limitations
herein and therein set forth, Debt Securities are exchangeable for a like
aggregate principal amount of Debt Securities of a different authorized
denomination, as requested by the holder surrendering the same.

         All terms used in this Debt Security that are defined in the Indenture
shall have the meanings assigned to them in the Indenture.

THE INDENTURE AND THE DEBT SECURITIES SHALL BE GOVERNED BY AND CONSTRUED IN
ACCORDANCE WITH THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF NEW YORK WITHOUT REGARD TO CONFLICT OF
LAW PRINCIPLES THEREOF, EXCEPT WITH RESPECT TO AUTHORIZATION AND EXECUTION BY OR
ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE GOVERNED BY THE LAWS OF
BERMUDA.
