                        CALLABLE SECURED CONVERTIBLE NOTE

Del Mar, California
December 17, 2004                                                        $28,000

          FOR VALUE RECEIVED,  PACIFICAP ENTERTAINMENT HOLDINGS,  INC., a Nevada
corporation  (hereinafter called the "Borrower"),  hereby promises to pay to the
order of NEW  MILLENNIUM  CAPITAL  PARTNERS II, LLC or  registered  assigns (the
"Holder") the sum of Twenty-Eight  Thousand Dollars  ($28,000),  on December 17,
2007 (the "Maturity Date"),  and to pay interest on the unpaid principal balance
hereof at the rate of ten percent  (10%) per annum from  December  17, 2004 (the
"Issue  Date") until the same  becomes due and  payable,  whether at maturity or
upon  acceleration  or by prepayment  or  otherwise.  Any amount of principal or
interest on this Note which is not paid when due shall bear interest at the rate
of fifteen  percent  (15%) per annum from the due date thereof until the same is
paid ("Default  Interest").  Interest shall commence accruing on the issue date,
shall be computed on the basis of a 365-day  year and the actual  number of days
elapsed and shall be payable,  quarterly on March 31, June 30,  September 30 and
December 31 of each year  beginning  on December  31,  2004.  All  payments  due
hereunder  (to the extent not converted  into common stock,  $.001 par value per
share, of the Borrower (the "Common Stock") in accordance with the terms hereof)
shall be made in lawful  money of the United  States of  America.  All  payments
shall be made at such address as the Holder shall hereafter give to the Borrower
by written notice made in accordance with the provisions of this Note.  Whenever
any amount expressed to be due by the terms of this Note is due on any day which
is not a business day, the same shall instead be due on the next  succeeding day
which is a business day and, in the case of any  interest  payment date which is
not the date on which this Note is paid in full,  the  extension of the due date
thereof shall not be taken into account for purposes of  determining  the amount
of interest  due on such date.  As used in this Note,  the term  "business  day"
shall mean any day other than a  Saturday,  Sunday or a day on which  commercial
banks in the city of New York,  New York are  authorized  or  required by law or
executive order to remain closed.  Each  capitalized  term used herein,  and not
otherwise  defined,  shall have the  meaning  ascribed  thereto in that  certain
Securities Purchase  Agreement,  dated December 17, 2004, pursuant to which this
Note was originally issued (the "Purchase Agreement").


<PAGE>
          This Note is free from all taxes,  liens, claims and encumbrances with
respect to the issue  thereof and shall not be subject to  preemptive  rights or
other  similar  rights  of  stockholders  of the  Borrower  and will not  impose
personal  liability  upon the holder  thereof.  The  obligations of the Borrower
under this Note shall be secured by that  certain  Security  Agreement  and that
certain Intellectual Property Security Agreement by and between the Borrower and
the Holder, each dated December 17, 2004.

                  The following terms shall apply to this Note:

                          Article I. CONVERSION RIGHTS

          1.1  Conversion  Right.  The Holder  shall have the right from time to
time,  and at any time on or prior to the earlier of (i) the  Maturity  Date and
(ii) the date of  payment of the  Default  Amount  (as  defined in Article  III)
pursuant to Section  1.6(a) or Article III, the Optional  Prepayment  Amount (as
defined in Section 5.1 or any payments  pursuant to Section 1.7, each in respect
of the remaining outstanding principal amount of this Note to convert all or any
part of the outstanding and unpaid principal amount of this Note into fully paid
and  non-assessable  shares of Common Stock,  as such Common Stock exists on the
Issue Date, or any shares of capital  stock or other  securities of the Borrower
into which such Common Stock shall  hereafter be changed or  reclassified at the
conversion  price (the  "Conversion  Price")  determined  as provided  herein (a
"Conversion");  provided, however, that in no event shall the Holder be entitled
to convert any portion of this Note in excess of that  portion of this Note upon
conversion  of  which  the sum of (1) the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock
beneficially owned by the Holder and its affiliates (other than shares of Common
Stock  which may be deemed  beneficially  owned  through  the  ownership  of the
unconverted  portion of the Notes or the  unexercised or unconverted  portion of
any other security of the Borrower (including,  without limitation, the warrants
issued  by  the  Borrower  pursuant  to the  Purchase  Agreement)  subject  to a
limitation  on  conversion or exercise  analogous to the  limitations  contained
herein)  and (2) the  number  of  shares  of  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  the
conversion  of the portion of this Note with respect to which the  determination
of this  proviso is being made,  would  result in  beneficial  ownership  by the
Holder and its affiliates of more than 4.9% of the outstanding  shares of Common
Stock.  For  purposes  of the  proviso to the  immediately  preceding  sentence,
beneficial ownership shall be determined in accordance with Section 13(d) of the
Securities  Exchange Act of 1934, as amended,  and Regulations 13D-G thereunder,
except as otherwise provided in clause (1) of such proviso. The number of shares
of  Common  Stock to be  issued  upon  each  conversion  of this  Note  shall be
determined  by  dividing  the  Conversion  Amount  (as  defined  below)  by  the
applicable  Conversion  Price then in effect on the date specified in the notice
of  conversion,  in the form  attached  hereto  as  Exhibit  A (the  "Notice  of
Conversion"), delivered to the Borrower by the Holder in accordance with Section
1.4 below;  provided that the Notice of Conversion is submitted by facsimile (or
by other means resulting in, or reasonably expected to result in, notice) to the
Borrower  before 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time on such conversion date (the
"Conversion  Date").  The term  "Conversion  Amount" means,  with respect to any
conversion of this Note, the sum of (1) the principal  amount of this Note to be
converted in such  conversion plus (2) accrued and unpaid  interest,  if any, on
such  principal  amount  at the  interest  rates  provided  in this  Note to the
Conversion Date plus (3) Default Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in
the  immediately  preceding  clauses  (1)  and/or  (2) plus (4) at the  Holder's
option,  any amounts  owed to the Holder  pursuant  to  Sections  1.3 and 1.4(g)
hereof  or  pursuant  to  Section  2(c)  of  that  certain  Registration  Rights
Agreement,  dated as of  December  17,  2004,  executed in  connection  with the
initial  issuance of this Note and the other Notes issued on the Issue Date (the
"Registration Rights Agreement").

                                       2

          1.2 Conversion Price.

               (a) Calculation of Conversion  Price.  The Conversion Price shall
be the lesser of (i) the Variable  Conversion Price (as defined herein) and (ii)
the Fixed  Conversion  Price (as  defined  herein)  (subject,  in each case,  to
equitable  adjustments for stock splits,  stock dividends or rights offerings by
the Borrower  relating to the  Borrower's  securities  or the  securities of any
subsidiary of the Borrower, combinations,  recapitalization,  reclassifications,
extraordinary distributions and similar events). The "Variable Conversion Price"
shall mean the  Applicable  Percentage  (as defined  herein)  multiplied  by the
Market Price (as defined herein). "Market Price" means the average of the lowest
three (3) Trading  Prices (as  defined  below) for the Common  Stock  during the
twenty  (20)  Trading  Day period  ending one  Trading Day prior to the date the
Conversion  Notice is sent by the  Holder to the  Borrower  via  facsimile  (the
"Conversion Date").  "Trading Price" means, for any security as of any date, the
intraday trading price on the  Over-the-Counter  Bulletin Board (the "OTCBB") as
reported by a reliable  reporting  service mutually  acceptable to and hereafter
designated  by Holders of a majority in  interest of the Notes and the  Borrower
or, if the OTCBB is not the  principal  trading  market for such  security,  the
intraday trading price of such security on the principal  securities exchange or
trading  market  where  such  security  is listed or traded  or, if no  intraday
trading price of such security is available in any of the foregoing manners, the
average of the intraday  trading  prices of any market  makers for such security
that are listed in the "pink sheets" by the National  Quotation Bureau,  Inc. If
the Trading  Price cannot be  calculated  for such  security on such date in the
manner  provided  above,  the Trading  Price  shall be the fair market  value as
mutually determined by the Borrower and the holders of a majority in interest of
the Notes being  converted  for which the  calculation  of the Trading  Price is
required in order to determine the Conversion Price of such Notes. "Trading Day"
shall  mean any day on which the  Common  Stock is traded  for any period on the
OTCBB, or on the principal  securities  exchange or other  securities  market on
which the Common Stock is then being traded.  "Applicable Percentage" shall mean
60.0%. The "Fixed Conversion Price" shall mean $.02.

               (b) Conversion Price During Major Announcements.  Notwithstanding
anything contained in Section 1.2(a) to the contrary,  in the event the Borrower
(i) makes a public announcement that it intends to consolidate or merge with any
other corporation (other than a merger in which the Borrower is the surviving or
continuing  corporation  and its capital stock is unchanged) or sell or transfer
all or substantially all of the assets of the Borrower or (ii) any person, group
or entity (including the Borrower) publicly announces a tender offer to purchase
50% or more of the Borrower's  Common Stock (or any other takeover  scheme) (the

                                       3
<PAGE>
date of the  announcement  referred  to in  clause  (i) or  (ii) is  hereinafter
referred  to as the  "Announcement  Date"),  then the  Conversion  Price  shall,
effective  upon  the  Announcement  Date and  continuing  through  the  Adjusted
Conversion Price  Termination Date (as defined below),  be equal to the lower of
(x) the  Conversion  Price which  would have been  applicable  for a  Conversion
occurring  on the  Announcement  Date and (y) the  Conversion  Price  that would
otherwise be in effect. From and after the Adjusted Conversion Price Termination
Date,  the  Conversion  Price shall be  determined  as set forth in this Section
1.2(a). For purposes hereof,  "Adjusted Conversion Price Termination Date" shall
mean,  with  respect to any  proposed  transaction  or tender offer (or takeover
scheme) for which a public  announcement  as contemplated by this Section 1.2(b)
has been  made,  the date upon  which the  Borrower  (in the case of clause  (i)
above)  or the  person,  group or  entity  (in the case of  clause  (ii)  above)
consummates or publicly announces the termination or abandonment of the proposed
transaction  or tender  offer (or  takeover  scheme)  which  caused this Section
1.2(b) to become operative.

          1.3  Authorized  Shares.  Subject  to the  Stockholder  Approval,  the
Borrower  covenants  that during the period the  conversion  right  exists,  the
Borrower will reserve from its authorized and unissued Common Stock a sufficient
number of shares,  free from preemptive  rights,  to provide for the issuance of
Common  Stock upon the full  conversion  of this Note and the other Notes issued
pursuant to the  Purchase  Agreement.  The  Borrower is required at all times to
have authorized and reserved two (2) times the number of shares that is actually
issuable upon full conversion of the Notes (based on the Conversion Price of the
Notes or the  Exercise  Price of the  Warrants in effect from time to time) (the
"Reserved Amount").  The Reserved Amount shall be increased from time to time in
accordance  with the  Borrower's  obligations  pursuant  to Section  4(h) of the
Purchase Agreement. The Borrower represents that upon issuance, such shares will
be duly and validly issued, fully paid and non-assessable.  In addition,  if the
Borrower shall issue any securities or make any change to its capital  structure
which  would  change the  number of shares of Common  Stock into which the Notes
shall be convertible at the then current Conversion Price, the Borrower shall at
the  same  time  make  proper  provision  so that  thereafter  there  shall be a
sufficient  number of shares of Common Stock authorized and reserved,  free from
preemptive  rights,  for conversion of the outstanding  Notes.  The Borrower (i)
acknowledges  that it has  irrevocably  instructed  its transfer  agent to issue
certificates  for the Common Stock  issuable upon  conversion of this Note,  and
(ii) agrees that its issuance of this Note shall  constitute  full  authority to
its  officers  and  agents  who are  charged  with the duty of  executing  stock
certificates  to  execute  and issue the  necessary  certificates  for shares of
Common Stock in accordance with the terms and conditions of this Note.

          If, at any time a Holder of this Note submits a Notice of  Conversion,
and the Borrower  does not have  sufficient  authorized  but unissued  shares of
Common  Stock  available  to  effect  such  conversion  in  accordance  with the
provisions of this Article I (a "Conversion  Default"),  subject to Section 4.8,
the  Borrower  shall issue to the Holder all of the shares of Common Stock which
are then available to effect such conversion. The portion of this Note which the
Holder  included in its Conversion  Notice and which exceeds the amount which is
then  convertible  into available  shares of Common Stock (the "Excess  Amount")
shall,  notwithstanding  anything  to  the  contrary  contained  herein,  not be
convertible  into Common Stock in accordance with the terms hereof until (and at
the  Holder's  option at any time  after) the date  additional  shares of Common
Stock are  authorized by the Borrower to permit such  conversion,  at which time
the  Conversion  Price  in  respect  thereof  shall  be the  lesser  of (i)  the
Conversion Price on the Conversion  Default Date (as defined below) and (ii) the
Conversion  Price on the  Conversion  Date  thereafter  elected by the Holder in

                                       4
<PAGE>
respect  thereof.  In addition,  the Borrower  shall pay to the Holder  payments
("Conversion  Default  Payments") for a Conversion  Default in the amount of (x)
the sum of (1) the then  outstanding  principal  amount  of this  Note  plus (2)
accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid  principal amount of this Note through
the Authorization Date (as defined below) plus (3) Default Interest,  if any, on
the  amounts  referred  to in clauses  (1) and/or  (2),  multiplied  by (y) .24,
multiplied by (z) (N/365),  where N = the number of days from the day the holder
submits  a  Notice  of  Conversion  giving  rise to a  Conversion  Default  (the
"Conversion  Default  Date") to the date  (the  "Authorization  Date")  that the
Borrower  authorizes  a  sufficient  number of shares of Common  Stock to effect
conversion of the full outstanding  principal balance of this Note. The Borrower
shall use its best efforts to authorize a sufficient  number of shares of Common
Stock as soon as  practicable  following  the  earlier of (i) such time that the
Holder notifies the Borrower or that the Borrower  otherwise  becomes aware that
there are or likely will be insufficient authorized and unissued shares to allow
full conversion thereof and (ii) a Conversion  Default.  The Borrower shall send
notice to the Holder of the  authorization of additional shares of Common Stock,
the  Authorization  Date and the amount of Holder's accrued  Conversion  Default
Payments.  The accrued Conversion Default Payments for each calendar month shall
be paid in cash or shall be convertible into Common Stock (at such time as there
are sufficient  authorized shares of Common Stock) at the applicable  Conversion
Price, at the Borrower's option, as follows:

               (a) In the event Holder elects to take such payment in cash, cash
payment  shall be made to Holder by the fifth  (5th) day of the month  following
the month in which it has accrued; and

               (b) In the event  Holder  elects to take such  payment  in Common
Stock,  the Holder may convert  such  payment  amount  into Common  Stock at the
Conversion  Price (as in effect at the time of conversion) at any time after the
fifth day of the month following the month in which it has accrued in accordance
with the terms of this Article I (so long as there is then a  sufficient  number
of authorized shares of Common Stock).

          The Holder's  election shall be made in writing to the Borrower at any
time prior to 6:00 p.m.,  New York, New York time, on the third day of the month
following the month in which  Conversion  Default  payments have accrued.  If no
election is made,  the Holder shall be deemed to have  elected to receive  cash.
Nothing  herein shall limit the Holder's  right to pursue actual damages (to the
extent in excess of the Conversion  Default Payments) for the Borrower's failure
to maintain a sufficient  number of authorized  shares of Common Stock, and each
holder shall have the right to pursue all remedies available at law or in equity
(including degree of specific performance and/or injunctive relief).

          1.4 Method of Conversion.

               (a)  Mechanics of  Conversion.  Subject to Section 1.1, this Note
may be converted by the Holder in whole or in part at any time from time to time
after the Issue Date,  by (A)  submitting to the Borrower a Notice of Conversion
(by  facsimile or other  reasonable  means of  communication  dispatched  on the
Conversion  Date prior to 6:00 p.m., New York, New York time) and (B) subject to
Section 1.4(b), surrendering this Note at the principal office of the Borrower.

                                       5
<PAGE>
               (b) Surrender of Note Upon Conversion.  Notwithstanding  anything
to the contrary set forth  herein,  upon  conversion  of this Note in accordance
with the terms hereof, the Holder shall not be required to physically  surrender
this Note to the Borrower unless the entire unpaid principal amount of this Note
is so converted.  The Holder and the Borrower shall maintain records showing the
principal  amount so converted  and the dates of such  conversions  or shall use
such other method, reasonably satisfactory to the Holder and the Borrower, so as
not to require physical surrender of this Note upon each such conversion. In the
event of any  dispute or  discrepancy,  such  records of the  Borrower  shall be
controlling and determinative in the absence of manifest error.  Notwithstanding
the foregoing, if any portion of this Note is converted as aforesaid, the Holder
may not transfer this Note unless the Holder first  physically  surrenders  this
Note to the Borrower,  whereupon the Borrower will  forthwith  issue and deliver
upon the order of the Holder a new Note of like tenor,  registered as the Holder
(upon  payment  by the Holder of any  applicable  transfer  taxes) may  request,
representing  in the  aggregate the remaining  unpaid  principal  amount of this
Note. The Holder and any assignee,  by acceptance of this Note,  acknowledge and
agree that, by reason of the provisions of this paragraph,  following conversion
of a portion of this Note, the unpaid and unconverted  principal  amount of this
Note  represented  by this Note may be less than the  amount  stated on the face
hereof.

               (c) Payment of Taxes.  The Borrower  shall not be required to pay
any tax which may be payable in respect of any  transfer  involved  in the issue
and  delivery  of shares of Common  Stock or other  securities  or  property  on
conversion  of this Note in a name  other  than that of the Holder (or in street
name),  and the  Borrower  shall not be  required  to issue or deliver  any such
shares or other  securities  or property  unless and until the person or persons
(other than the Holder or the  custodian in whose street name such shares are to
be held for the Holder's  account)  requesting  the issuance  thereof shall have
paid to the Borrower the amount of any such tax or shall have established to the
satisfaction of the Borrower that such tax has been paid.

               (d) Delivery of Common Stock Upon Conversion. Upon receipt by the
Borrower from the Holder of a facsimile  transmission (or other reasonable means
of  communication)  of a Notice  of  Conversion  meeting  the  requirements  for
conversion as provided in this Section 1.4, the Borrower shall issue and deliver
or  cause  to be  issued  and  delivered  to or upon  the  order  of the  Holder
certificates  for the Common Stock issuable upon such conversion  within two (2)
business days after such receipt  (and,  solely in the case of conversion of the
entire  unpaid  principal  amount  hereof,  surrender of this Note) (such second
business day being hereinafter referred to as the "Deadline") in accordance with
the terms hereof and the Purchase Agreement (including,  without limitation,  in
accordance with the requirements of Section 2(g) of the Purchase  Agreement that
certificates for shares of Common Stock issued on or after the effective date of
the  Registration  Statement  upon  conversion  of this Note  shall not bear any
restrictive legend).

               (e) Obligation of Borrower to Deliver Common Stock.  Upon receipt
by the Borrower of a Notice of Conversion,  the Holder shall be deemed to be the
holder  of  record of the  Common  Stock  issuable  upon  such  conversion,  the
outstanding  principal  amount and the amount of accrued and unpaid  interest on
this Note shall be reduced to reflect such conversion,  and, unless the Borrower
defaults on its obligations under this Article I, all rights with respect to the
portion of this Note being so converted  shall  forthwith  terminate  except the
right to receive the Common Stock or other securities,  cash or other assets, as
herein provided, on such conversion.  If the Holder shall have given a Notice of
Conversion as provided  herein,  the Borrower's  obligation to issue and deliver
the  certificates  for  Common  Stock  shall  be  absolute  and   unconditional,
irrespective of the absence of any action by the Holder to enforce the same, any
waiver or consent with  respect to any  provision  thereof,  the recovery of any
judgment  against any person or any action to enforce  the same,  any failure or
delay in the  enforcement of any other  obligation of the Borrower to the holder
of record, or any setoff, counterclaim,  recoupment,  limitation or termination,
or any breach or alleged breach by the Holder of any obligation to the Borrower,
and  irrespective  of any other  circumstance  which might  otherwise limit such
obligation of the Borrower to the Holder in connection with such conversion. The
Conversion  Date  specified in the Notice of Conversion  shall be the Conversion
Date so long as the Notice of Conversion is received by the Borrower before 6:00
p.m., New York, New York time, on such date.

                                       6
<PAGE>
               (f) Delivery of Common Stock by Electronic  Transfer.  In lieu of
delivering  physical  certificates  representing  the Common Stock issuable upon
conversion,  provided the  Borrower's  transfer  agent is  participating  in the
Depository  Trust Company ("DTC") Fast Automated  Securities  Transfer  ("FAST")
program,  upon  request  of the Holder and its  compliance  with the  provisions
contained in Section 1.1 and in this  Section  1.4,  the Borrower  shall use its
best efforts to cause its transfer agent to  electronically  transmit the Common
Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  to the  Holder by  crediting  the  account of
Holder's Prime Broker with DTC through its Deposit  Withdrawal  Agent Commission
("DWAC") system.

               (g) Failure to Deliver Common Stock Prior to Deadline. Without in
any way limiting the Holder's right to pursue other remedies,  including  actual
damages  and/or  equitable  relief,  the  parties  agree that if delivery of the
Common Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of this Note is more than two (2) days
after the Deadline (other than a failure due to the  circumstances  described in
Section 1.3 above, which failure shall be governed by such Section) the Borrower
shall pay to the Holder $2,000 per day in cash, for each day beyond the Deadline
that the Borrower fails to deliver such Common Stock.  Such cash amount shall be
paid to Holder by the fifth day of the month following the month in which it has
accrued  or, at the option of the Holder (by written  notice to the  Borrower by
the first day of the month  following the month in which it has accrued),  shall
be added to the  principal  amount of this Note, in which event  interest  shall
accrue  thereon in  accordance  with the terms of this Note and such  additional
principal  amount shall be convertible  into Common Stock in accordance with the
terms of this Note.

          1.5  Concerning  the Shares.  The shares of Common Stock issuable upon
conversion  of this Note may not be sold or  transferred  unless (i) such shares
are sold pursuant to an effective  registration  statement under the Act or (ii)
the Borrower or its transfer  agent shall have been furnished with an opinion of
counsel  (which  opinion  shall be in form,  substance  and scope  customary for
opinions of counsel in comparable transactions) to the effect that the shares to
be sold or transferred may be sold or transferred  pursuant to an exemption from
such registration or (iii) such shares are sold or transferred  pursuant to Rule
144 under the Act (or a  successor  rule)  ("Rule  144") or (iv) such shares are
transferred  to an  "affiliate"  (as  defined in Rule 144) of the  Borrower  who
agrees to sell or  otherwise  transfer the shares only in  accordance  with this
Section  1.5 and who is an  Accredited  Investor  (as  defined  in the  Purchase
Agreement).  Except as otherwise provided in the Purchase Agreement (and subject
to the removal  provisions  set forth  below),  until such time as the shares of
Common Stock issuable upon  conversion of this Note have been  registered  under
the Act as contemplated by the Registration Rights Agreement or otherwise may be
sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any restriction as to the number of securities
as of a particular date that can then be immediately  sold, each certificate for
shares of Common Stock  issuable upon  conversion of this Note that has not been
so included in an  effective  registration  statement  or that has not been sold
pursuant to an effective  registration  statement  or an exemption  that permits
removal of the legend,  shall bear a legend substantially in the following form,
as appropriate:

                                       7
<PAGE>
      "THE  SECURITIES   REPRESENTED  BY  THIS  CERTIFICATE  HAVE  NOT  BEEN
      REGISTERED  UNDER  THE  SECURITIES  ACT  OF  1933,  AS  AMENDED.   THE
      SECURITIES MAY NOT BE SOLD,  TRANSFERRED OR ASSIGNED IN THE ABSENCE OF
      AN EFFECTIVE REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR THE SECURITIES UNDER SAID ACT,
      OR AN OPINION OF COUNSEL IN FORM,  SUBSTANCE  AND SCOPE  CUSTOMARY FOR
      OPINIONS OF COUNSEL IN COMPARABLE  TRANSACTIONS,  THAT REGISTRATION IS
      NOT  REQUIRED  UNDER  SAID ACT  UNLESS  SOLD  PURSUANT  TO RULE 144 OR
      REGULATION S UNDER SAID ACT."

          The legend set forth  above shall be removed  and the  Borrower  shall
issue to the Holder a new  certificate  therefor free of any transfer  legend if
(i) the  Borrower  or its  transfer  agent  shall  have  received  an opinion of
counsel,  in form,  substance  and scope  customary  for  opinions of counsel in
comparable  transactions,  to the effect  that a public sale or transfer of such
Common Stock may be made without  registration  under the Act and the shares are
so sold or  transferred,  (ii) such Holder provides the Borrower or its transfer
agent with reasonable  assurances that the Common Stock issuable upon conversion
of this Note (to the extent such  securities are deemed to have been acquired on
the  same  date)  can be sold  pursuant  to Rule 144 or (iii) in the case of the
Common Stock issuable upon  conversion of this Note, such security is registered
for sale by the Holder under an effective registration statement filed under the
Act or otherwise may be sold pursuant to Rule 144 without any  restriction as to
the number of  securities as of a particular  date that can then be  immediately
sold.  Nothing in this Note shall (i) limit the Borrower's  obligation under the
Registration Rights Agreement or (ii) affect in any way the Holder's obligations
to comply with applicable  prospectus  delivery  requirements upon the resale of
the securities referred to herein.

          1.6 Effect of Certain Events.

               (a) Effect of Merger,  Consolidation,  Etc.  At the option of the
Holder,  the sale,  conveyance or disposition of all or substantially all of the
assets of the Borrower,  the  effectuation  by the Borrower of a transaction  or
series of related transactions in which more than 50% of the voting power of the
Borrower  is  disposed  of,  or the  consolidation,  merger  or  other  business
combination  of the Borrower with or into any other Person (as defined below) or
Persons when the Borrower is not the survivor shall either:  (i) be deemed to be
an Event of Default (as defined in Article  III)  pursuant to which the Borrower
shall  be  required  to pay to the  Holder  upon  the  consummation  of and as a
condition to such  transaction an amount equal to the Default Amount (as defined
in Article III) or (ii) be treated  pursuant to Section 1.6(b) hereof.  "Person"
shall mean any individual,  corporation, limited liability company, partnership,
association, trust or other entity or organization.

                                       8
<PAGE>
               (b) Adjustment Due to Merger, Consolidation, Etc. If, at any time
when this Note is issued and  outstanding  and prior to conversion of all of the
Notes,   there  shall  be  any  merger,   consolidation,   exchange  of  shares,
recapitalization,  reorganization,  or other similar event, as a result of which
shares of  Common  Stock of the  Borrower  shall be  changed  into the same or a
different number of shares of another class or classes of stock or securities of
the Borrower or another  entity,  or in case of any sale or conveyance of all or
substantially  all of the assets of the Borrower other than in connection with a
plan of complete liquidation of the Borrower, then the Holder of this Note shall
thereafter  have the right to receive  upon  conversion  of this Note,  upon the
basis and upon the  terms and  conditions  specified  herein  and in lieu of the
shares of Common Stock immediately  theretofore  issuable upon conversion,  such
stock, securities or assets which the Holder would have been entitled to receive
in such  transaction had this Note been converted in full  immediately  prior to
such  transaction  (without  regard to any  limitations  on conversion set forth
herein), and in any such case appropriate  provisions shall be made with respect
to the  rights  and  interests  of the  Holder  of this Note to the end that the
provisions hereof (including,  without limitation,  provisions for adjustment of
the Conversion Price and of the number of shares issuable upon conversion of the
Note)  shall  thereafter  be  applicable,  as  nearly as may be  practicable  in
relation to any securities or assets thereafter  deliverable upon the conversion
hereof. The Borrower shall not effect any transaction  described in this Section
1.6(b) unless (a) it first gives,  to the extent  practicable,  thirty (30) days
prior written  notice (but in any event at least fifteen (15) days prior written
notice) of the record date of the special meeting of shareholders to approve, or
if  there  is  no  such  record  date,   the   consummation   of,  such  merger,
consolidation,  exchange of shares,  recapitalization,  reorganization  or other
similar event or sale of assets  (during which time the Holder shall be entitled
to convert this Note) and (b) the  resulting  successor or acquiring  entity (if
not the Borrower) assumes by written  instrument the obligations of this Section
1.6(b). The above provisions shall similarly apply to successive consolidations,
mergers, sales, transfers or share exchanges.

               (c) Adjustment Due to Distribution. If the Borrower shall declare
or make any  distribution  of its assets (or  rights to acquire  its  assets) to
holders of Common  Stock as a dividend,  stock  repurchase,  by way of return of
capital or otherwise  (including any dividend or  distribution to the Borrower's
shareholders in cash or shares (or rights to acquire shares) of capital stock of
a subsidiary  (i.e.,  a spin-off)) (a  "Distribution"),  then the Holder of this
Note  shall be  entitled,  upon any  conversion  of this Note  after the date of
record for determining  shareholders  entitled to such Distribution,  to receive
the  amount of such  assets  which  would have been  payable to the Holder  with
respect to the shares of Common Stock  issuable  upon such  conversion  had such
Holder been the holder of such shares of Common Stock on the record date for the
determination of shareholders entitled to such Distribution.

               (d) Adjustment Due to Dilutive Issuance. If, at any time when any
Notes are issued and outstanding, the Borrower issues or sells, or in accordance
with this Section  1.6(d) hereof is deemed to have issued or sold, any shares of
Common  Stock for no  consideration  or for a  consideration  per share  (before
deduction of reasonable  expenses or  commissions or  underwriting  discounts or
allowances  in connection  therewith)  less than the Fixed  Conversion  Price in
effect on the date of such  issuance  (or  deemed  issuance)  of such  shares of
Common  Stock (a  "Dilutive  Issuance"),  then  immediately  upon  the  Dilutive
Issuance,  the Fixed  Conversion  Price  will be  reduced  to the  amount of the
consideration  per share  received by the  Borrower in such  Dilutive  Issuance;
provided that only one adjustment will be made for each Dilutive Issuance.

                                       9
<PAGE>
          The  Borrower  shall be deemed to have issued or sold shares of Common
Stock if the  Borrower in any manner  issues or grants any  warrants,  rights or
options, whether or not immediately exercisable, to subscribe for or to purchase
Common Stock or other  securities  convertible  into or exchangeable  for Common
Stock ("Convertible  Securities") (such warrants, rights and options to purchase
Common Stock or Convertible Securities are hereinafter referred to as "Options")
and the price per share for which Common Stock is issuable  upon the exercise of
such Options is less than the Fixed  Conversion  Price then in effect,  then the
Fixed  Conversion  Price shall be equal to such price per share. For purposes of
the preceding sentence,  the "price per share for which Common Stock is issuable
upon the  exercise of such  Options"  is  determined  by dividing  (i) the total
amount,  if any, received or receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the
issuance or granting of all such Options,  plus the minimum  aggregate amount of
additional  consideration,  if any, payable to the Borrower upon the exercise of
all such Options,  plus, in the case of Convertible Securities issuable upon the
exercise  of  such  Options,   the  minimum   aggregate   amount  of  additional
consideration  payable upon the conversion or exchange  thereof at the time such
Convertible  Securities first become  convertible or  exchangeable,  by (ii) the
maximum total number of shares of Common Stock issuable upon the exercise of all
such  Options   (assuming  full   conversion  of  Convertible   Securities,   if
applicable). No further adjustment to the Conversion Price will be made upon the
actual  issuance of such Common  Stock upon the exercise of such Options or upon
the conversion or exchange of Convertible  Securities  issuable upon exercise of
such Options.

          Additionally,  the  Borrower  shall be deemed  to have  issued or sold
shares  of  Common  Stock if the  Borrower  in any  manner  issues  or sells any
Convertible Securities, whether or not immediately convertible (other than where
the same are issuable upon the exercise of Options), and the price per share for
which Common Stock is issuable upon such conversion or exchange is less than the
Fixed Conversion Price then in effect,  then the Fixed Conversion Price shall be
equal to such price per share. For the purposes of the preceding  sentence,  the
"price per share for which  Common  Stock is issuable  upon such  conversion  or
exchange" is determined by dividing (i) the total  amount,  if any,  received or
receivable by the Borrower as consideration for the issuance or sale of all such
Convertible  Securities,   plus  the  minimum  aggregate  amount  of  additional
consideration,  if any,  payable to the Borrower upon the conversion or exchange
thereof at the time such  Convertible  Securities  first become  convertible  or
exchangeable,  by (ii) the  maximum  total  number of  shares  of  Common  Stock
issuable upon the conversion or exchange of all such Convertible Securities.  No
further  adjustment to the Fixed  Conversion  Price will be made upon the actual
issuance of such Common Stock upon  conversion  or exchange of such  Convertible
Securities.

               (e)  Purchase  Rights.  If, at any time when any Notes are issued
and  outstanding,  the Borrower issues any  convertible  securities or rights to
purchase stock,  warrants,  securities or other property (the "Purchase Rights")
pro rata to the record holders of any class of Common Stock,  then the Holder of
this  Note will be  entitled  to  acquire,  upon the  terms  applicable  to such
Purchase  Rights,  the  aggregate  Purchase  Rights which such Holder could have
acquired if such Holder had held the number of shares of Common Stock acquirable
upon  complete  conversion of this Note (without  regard to any  limitations  on
conversion  contained herein)  immediately  before the date on which a record is
taken for the grant,  issuance  or sale of such  Purchase  Rights or, if no such
record is taken,  the date as of which the record holders of Common Stock are to
be determined for the grant, issue or sale of such Purchase Rights.

               (f) Notice of Adjustments. Upon the occurrence of each adjustment
or readjustment of the Conversion  Price as a result of the events  described in
this Section 1.6, the  Borrower,  at its expense,  shall  promptly  compute such
adjustment  or  readjustment  and  prepare  and  furnish  to  the  Holder  of  a
certificate  setting forth such adjustment or readjustment and showing in detail
the facts upon which such  adjustment  or  readjustment  is based.  The Borrower
shall,  upon the  written  request  at any time of the  Holder,  furnish to such
Holder a like  certificate  setting forth (i) such  adjustment or  readjustment,
(ii) the  Conversion  Price at the time in effect and (iii) the number of shares
of Common Stock and the amount, if any, of other securities or property which at
the time would be received upon conversion of the Note.

          1.7 Trading  Market  Limitations.  Unless  permitted by the applicable
rules and  regulations  of the principal  securities  market on which the Common
Stock is then  listed or  traded,  in no event  shall the  Borrower  issue  upon
conversion  of or  otherwise  pursuant to this Note and the other  Notes  issued
pursuant to the  Purchase  Agreement  more than the maximum  number of shares of
Common Stock that the Borrower can issue  pursuant to any rule of the  principal
United  States  securities  market on which the Common Stock is then traded (the
"Maximum Share Amount"),  which shall be 19.99% of the total shares  outstanding
on the Closing Date (as defined in the Purchase Agreement), subject to equitable
adjustment from time to time for stock splits,  stock  dividends,  combinations,
capital  reorganizations  and  similar  events  relating  to  the  Common  Stock
occurring  after the date hereof.  Once the Maximum Share Amount has been issued
(the date of which is hereinafter referred to as the "Maximum Conversion Date"),
if the Borrower fails to eliminate any prohibitions  under applicable law or the
rules or  regulations of any stock  exchange,  interdealer  quotation  system or
other self-regulatory organization with jurisdiction over the Borrower or any of
its  securities  on the  Borrower's  ability to issue  shares of Common Stock in
excess of the Maximum Share Amount (a "Trading  Market  Prepayment  Event"),  in
lieu of any further right to convert this Note, and in full  satisfaction of the
Borrower's  obligations  under this Note,  the Borrower shall pay to the Holder,
within fifteen (15) business days of the Maximum  Conversion  Date (the "Trading
Market Prepayment  Date"), an amount equal to 130% times the sum of (a) the then
outstanding  principal  amount of this Note  immediately  following  the Maximum
Conversion  Date, plus (b) accrued and unpaid  interest on the unpaid  principal
amount of this Note to the  Trading  Market  Prepayment  Date,  plus (c) Default
Interest,  if any,  on the  amounts  referred to in clause (a) and/or (b) above,
plus  (d)  any  optional  amounts  that  may be  added  thereto  at the  Maximum
Conversion  Date by the Holder in  accordance  with the terms  hereof  (the then
outstanding  principal  amount of this Note  immediately  following  the Maximum
Conversion  Date, plus the amounts referred to in clauses (b), (c) and (d) above
shall collectively be referred to as the "Remaining  Convertible Amount").  With
respect to each Holder of Notes,  the Maximum  Share  Amount shall refer to such
Holder's pro rata share thereof determined in accordance with Section 4.8 below.
In the event that the sum of (x) the aggregate  number of shares of Common Stock
issued upon  conversion of this Note and the other Notes issued  pursuant to the
Purchase  Agreement plus (y) the aggregate number of shares of Common Stock that
remain issuable upon conversion of this Note and the other Notes issued pursuant
to the Purchase Agreement, represents at least one hundred percent (100%) of the
Maximum Share Amount (the  "Triggering  Event"),  the Borrower will use its best
efforts to seek and obtain Shareholder  Approval (or obtain such other relief as
will allow conversions  hereunder in excess of the Maximum Share Amount) as soon
as practicable  following the Triggering Event and before the Maximum Conversion
Date. As used herein,  "Shareholder Approval" means approval by the stockholders
of the Borrower to authorize the issuance of the full number of shares of Common
Stock which would be issuable upon full conversion of the then outstanding Notes
but for the Maximum Share Amount.

                                       11

          1.8 Status as  Stockholder.  Upon submission of a Notice of Conversion
by a Holder,  (i) the shares  covered  thereby  (other than the shares,  if any,
which  cannot be issued  because  their  issuance  would  exceed  such  Holder's
allocated  portion of the  Reserved  Amount or Maximum  Share  Amount)  shall be
deemed  converted into shares of Common Stock and (ii) the Holder's  rights as a
Holder of such  converted  portion  of this  Note  shall  cease  and  terminate,
excepting only the right to receive certificates for such shares of Common Stock
and to any remedies  provided herein or otherwise  available at law or in equity
to such Holder  because of a failure by the Borrower to comply with the terms of
this  Note.  Notwithstanding  the  foregoing,  if  a  Holder  has  not  received
certificates  for all shares of Common Stock prior to the tenth (10th)  business
day after the  expiration  of the Deadline  with respect to a conversion  of any
portion of this Note for any reason, then (unless the Holder otherwise elects to
retain its status as a holder of Common Stock by so notifying  the Borrower) the
Holder  shall  regain the  rights of a Holder of this Note with  respect to such
unconverted   portions  of  this  Note  and  the  Borrower  shall,  as  soon  as
practicable,  return such unconverted Note to the Holder or, if the Note has not
been  surrendered,  adjust its records to reflect that such portion of this Note
has not been converted.  In all cases, the Holder shall retain all of its rights
and remedies (including, without limitation, (i) the right to receive Conversion
Default Payments pursuant to Section 1.3 to the extent required thereby for such
Conversion  Default and any subsequent  Conversion Default and (ii) the right to
have the Conversion Price with respect to subsequent  conversions  determined in
accordance with Section 1.3) for the Borrower's failure to convert this Note.

                         Article II. CERTAIN COVENANTS

          2.1 Distributions on Capital Stock. So long as the Borrower shall have
any  obligation  under this Note,  the  Borrower  shall not without the Holder's
written consent (a) pay, declare or set apart for such payment,  any dividend or
other distribution  (whether in cash, property or other securities) on shares of
capital stock other than  dividends on shares of Common Stock solely in the form
of  additional  shares of Common Stock or (b) directly or  indirectly or through
any subsidiary  make any other payment or distribution in respect of its capital
stock except for distributions  pursuant to any shareholders'  rights plan which
is approved by a majority of the Borrower's disinterested directors.

          2.2  Restriction on Stock  Repurchases.  So long as the Borrower shall
have any obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not without the Holder's
written consent redeem,  repurchase or otherwise acquire (whether for cash or in
exchange for property or other  securities or otherwise) in any one  transaction
or series of related transactions any shares of capital stock of the Borrower or
any warrants, rights or options to purchase or acquire any such shares.

          2.3  Borrowings.  So long as the  Borrower  shall have any  obligation
under this Note, the Borrower shall not,  without the Holder's  written consent,
create,  incur,  assume or suffer to exist any  liability  for  borrowed  money,
except (a)  borrowings in existence or committed on the date hereof and of which
the  Borrower  has  informed  Holder in writing  prior to the date  hereof,  (b)
indebtedness  to trade  creditors  or  financial  institutions  incurred  in the
ordinary  course of business or (c)  borrowings,  the proceeds of which shall be
used to repay this Note.

          2.4 Sale of Assets.  So long as the Borrower shall have any obligation
under this Note, the Borrower shall not,  without the Holder's  written consent,
sell,  lease or  otherwise  dispose  of any  significant  portion  of its assets
outside the ordinary  course of business.  Any consent to the disposition of any
assets may be conditioned on a specified use of the proceeds of disposition.

          2.5  Advances  and  Loans.  So long as the  Borrower  shall  have  any
obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not, without the Holder's written
consent,  lend money,  give credit or make advances to any person,  firm,  joint
venture or corporation,  including,  without  limitation,  officers,  directors,
employees, subsidiaries and affiliates of the Borrower, except loans, credits or
advances (a) in existence or committed on the date hereof and which the Borrower
has  informed  Holder  in  writing  prior  to the date  hereof,  (b) made in the
ordinary course of business or (c) not in excess of $50,000.

          2.6  Contingent  Liabilities.  So long as the Borrower  shall have any
obligation under this Note, the Borrower shall not, without the Holder's written
consent, assume, guarantee, endorse, contingently agree to purchase or otherwise
become  liable upon the  obligation  of any  person,  firm,  partnership,  joint
venture or corporation,  except by the endorsement of negotiable instruments for
deposit or  collection  and except  assumptions,  guarantees,  endorsements  and
contingencies  (a) in  existence  or  committed on the date hereof and which the
Borrower  has  informed  Holder in  writing  prior to the date  hereof,  and (b)
similar transactions in the ordinary course of business.

                         Article III. EVENTS OF DEFAULT

          If any of  the  following  events  of  default  (each,  an  "Event  of
Default") shall occur:

          3.1 Failure to Pay  Principal or Interest.  The Borrower  fails to pay
the  principal  hereof or  interest  thereon  when due on this Note,  whether at
maturity,  upon a Trading Market  Prepayment Event pursuant to Section 1.7, upon
acceleration or otherwise;

          3.2 Conversion  and the Shares.  The Borrower fails to issue shares of
Common Stock to the Holder (or announces or threatens that it will not honor its
obligation to do so) upon exercise by the Holder of the conversion rights of the
Holder in accordance with the terms of this Note (for a period of at least sixty
(60) days, if such failure is solely as a result of the  circumstances  governed
by  Section  1.3 and the  Borrower  is using its best  efforts  to  authorize  a

                                       13
<PAGE>
sufficient  number of shares of Common Stock as soon as  practicable),  fails to
transfer  or  cause  its  transfer  agent  to  transfer  (electronically  or  in
certificated  form) any  certificate  for shares of Common  Stock  issued to the
Holder  upon  conversion  of or  otherwise  pursuant  to this  Note as and  when
required by this Note or the Registration  Rights Agreement,  or fails to remove
any restrictive legend (or to withdraw any stop transfer instructions in respect
thereof) on any  certificate for any shares of Common Stock issued to the Holder
upon  conversion  of or otherwise  pursuant to this Note as and when required by
this Note or the  Registration  Rights  Agreement  (or  makes any  announcement,
statement or threat that it does not intend to honor the  obligations  described
in  this  paragraph)  and  any  such  failure  shall  continue  uncured  (or any
announcement,  statement  or threat  not to honor its  obligations  shall not be
rescinded  in  writing)  for ten (10) days  after the  Borrower  shall have been
notified thereof in writing by the Holder;

          3.3 Failure to Timely File  Registration or Effect  Registration.  The
Borrower  fails  to file the  Registration  Statement  within  sixty  (60)  days
following  the Closing  Date (as defined in the  Purchase  Agreement)  or obtain
effectiveness  with the Securities and Exchange  Commission of the  Registration
Statement within one hundred  thirty-five  (135) days following the Closing Date
(as defined in the Purchase Agreement) or such Registration  Statement lapses in
effect (or sales  cannot  otherwise  be made  thereunder  effective,  whether by
reason of the Borrower's failure to amend or supplement the prospectus  included
therein in accordance with the  Registration  Rights Agreement or otherwise) for
more than  twenty  (20)  consecutive  days or forty (40) days in any twelve (12)
month period after the Registration Statement becomes effective;

          3.4 Breach of Covenants.  The Borrower  breaches any material covenant
or other  material  term or condition  contained in Sections  1.3, 1.6 or 1.7 of
this Note,  or  Sections  4(c),  4(e),  4(h),  4(i),  4(j) or 5 of the  Purchase
Agreement and such breach  continues for a period of ten (10) days after written
notice thereof to the Borrower from the Holder;

          3.5 Breach of  Representations  and Warranties.  Any representation or
warranty  of  the  Borrower  made  herein  or in  any  agreement,  statement  or
certificate  given  in  writing  pursuant  hereto  or  in  connection   herewith
(including,  without  limitation,  the Purchase  Agreement and the  Registration
Rights  Agreement),  shall be false or misleading  in any material  respect when
made and the  breach of which  has (or with the  passage  of time  will  have) a
material  adverse  effect on the rights of the Holder with respect to this Note,
the Purchase Agreement or the Registration Rights Agreement;

          3.6  Receiver  or  Trustee.  The  Borrower  or any  subsidiary  of the
Borrower shall make an assignment for the benefit of creditors,  or apply for or
consent to the  appointment of a receiver or trustee for it or for a substantial
part of its property or business,  or such a receiver or trustee shall otherwise
be appointed;

          3.7 Judgments.  Any money  judgment,  writ or similar process shall be
entered or filed  against the Borrower or any  subsidiary of the Borrower or any
of its  property  or other  assets  for more  than  $50,000,  and  shall  remain
unvacated,  unbonded  or  unstayed  for a period  of  twenty  (20)  days  unless
otherwise  consented to by the Holder,  which  consent will not be  unreasonably
withheld;

                                       14
<PAGE>
          3.8 Bankruptcy. Bankruptcy, insolvency,  reorganization or liquidation
proceedings or other  proceedings for relief under any bankruptcy law or any law
for the relief of debtors  shall be instituted by or against the Borrower or any
subsidiary of the Borrower;

          3.9 Delisting of Common Stock. The Borrower shall fail to maintain the
listing  of the  Common  Stock on at  least  one of the  OTCBB or an  equivalent
replacement  exchange,  the Nasdaq National Market,  the Nasdaq SmallCap Market,
the New York Stock Exchange, or the American Stock Exchange; or

          3.10 Default  Under Other Notes.  An Event of Default has occurred and
is  continuing  under any of the other Notes  issued  pursuant  to the  Purchase
Agreement, then, upon the occurrence and during the continuation of any Event of
Default  specified in Section 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5, 3.7, 3.9, or 3.10, at the
option of the Holders of a majority  of the  aggregate  principal  amount of the
outstanding Notes issued pursuant to the Purchase Agreement  exercisable through
the delivery of written  notice to the  Borrower by such  Holders (the  "Default
Notice"),  and upon the  occurrence of an Event of Default  specified in Section
3.6 or 3.8, the Notes shall become  immediately due and payable and the Borrower
shall pay to the Holder, in full satisfaction of its obligations  hereunder,  an
amount  equal  to the  greater  of (i)  130%  times  the  sum  of (w)  the  then
outstanding  principal  amount of this Note plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest
on the  unpaid  principal  amount  of this  Note to the  date  of  payment  (the
"Mandatory  Prepayment Date") plus (y) Default Interest,  if any, on the amounts
referred to in clauses  (w) and/or (x) plus (z) any  amounts  owed to the Holder
pursuant to Sections  1.3 and 1.4(g)  hereof or pursuant to Section  2(c) of the
Registration  Rights  Agreement (the then  outstanding  principal amount of this
Note to the date of payment plus the amounts referred to in clauses (x), (y) and
(z) shall collectively be known as the "Default Sum") or (ii) the "parity value"
of the  Default  Sum to be  prepaid,  where  parity  value means (a) the highest
number of shares  of Common  Stock  issuable  upon  conversion  of or  otherwise
pursuant to such Default Sum in accordance  with Article I, treating the Trading
Day immediately preceding the Mandatory Prepayment Date as the "Conversion Date"
for purposes of determining the lowest applicable  Conversion Price,  unless the
Default Event arises as a result of a breach in respect of a specific Conversion
Date  in  which  case  such  Conversion  Date  shall  be the  Conversion  Date),
multiplied  by (b) the highest  Closing  Price for the Common  Stock  during the
period  beginning  on the date of first  occurrence  of the Event of Default and
ending one day prior to the Mandatory Prepayment Date (the "Default Amount") and
all other amounts payable  hereunder shall  immediately  become due and payable,
all without  demand,  presentment  or notice,  all of which hereby are expressly
waived, together with all costs, including,  without limitation,  legal fees and
expenses, of collection,  and the Holder shall be entitled to exercise all other
rights and remedies  available at law or in equity. If the Borrower fails to pay
the Default  Amount  within five (5) business  days of written  notice that such
amount is due and payable,  then the Holder shall have the right at any time, so
long as the  Borrower  remains  in default  (and so long and to the extent  that
there are sufficient  authorized shares), to require the Borrower,  upon written
notice,  to  immediately  issue,  in lieu of the Default  Amount,  the number of
shares of Common Stock of the Borrower  equal to the Default  Amount  divided by
the Conversion Price then in effect.

                           Article IV. MISCELLANEOUS

          4.1 Failure or Indulgence Not Waiver.  No failure or delay on the part
of the Holder in the exercise of any power,  right or privilege  hereunder shall

such power,  right or privilege preclude other or further exercise thereof or of
any other right, power or privileges. All rights and remedies existing hereunder
are  cumulative  to, and not  exclusive  of, any  rights or  remedies  otherwise
available.

          4.7 Certain  Amounts.  Whenever  pursuant to this Note the Borrower is
required to pay an amount in excess of the outstanding  principal amount (or the
portion  thereof  required  to be paid at that  time)  plus  accrued  and unpaid
interest  plus Default  Interest on such  interest,  the Borrower and the Holder
agree that the actual  damages to the Holder from the receipt of cash payment on
this Note may be  difficult  to  determine  and the  amount to be so paid by the
Borrower  represents  stipulated  damages  and not a penalty  and is intended to
compensate  the Holder in part for loss of the  opportunity to convert this Note
and to earn a return  from the sale of  shares  of Common  Stock  acquired  upon
conversion  of this Note at a price in excess of the price paid for such  shares
pursuant to this Note. The Borrower and the Holder hereby agree that such amount
of stipulated  damages is not plainly  disproportionate  to the possible loss to
the Holder from the receipt of a cash payment without the opportunity to convert
this Note into shares of Common Stock.

          4.8  Allocations  of Maximum  Share  Amount and Reserved  Amount.  The
Maximum  Share Amount and Reserved  Amount shall be allocated pro rata among the
Holders of Notes  based on the  principal  amount of such  Notes  issued to each
Holder.  Each increase to the Maximum Share Amount and Reserved  Amount shall be
allocated pro rata among the Holders of Notes based on the  principal  amount of
such Notes held by each Holder at the time of the increase in the Maximum  Share
Amount  or  Reserved  Amount.  In the  event a Holder  shall  sell or  otherwise
transfer any of such Holder's Notes,  each  transferee  shall be allocated a pro
rata portion of such transferor's  Maximum Share Amount and Reserved Amount. Any
portion of the Maximum Share Amount or Reserved  Amount which remains  allocated
to any person or entity  which does not hold any Notes shall be allocated to the
remaining Holders of Notes, pro rata based on the principal amount of such Notes
then held by such Holders.

          4.9 Damages Shares. The shares of Common Stock that may be issuable to
the Holder  pursuant to Sections  1.3 and 1.4(g)  hereof and pursuant to Section
2(c) of the Registration Rights Agreement ("Damages Shares") shall be treated as
Common Stock issuable upon  conversion of this Note for all purposes  hereof and
shall be subject to all of the limitations and afforded all of the rights of the
other shares of Common Stock issuable  hereunder,  including without limitation,
the right to be included in the  Registration  Statement  filed  pursuant to the
Registration Rights Agreement.  For purposes of calculating  interest payable on
the outstanding  principal amount hereof,  except as otherwise  provided herein,
amounts  convertible  into Damages  Shares  ("Damages  Amounts")  shall not bear
interest  but must be  converted  prior  to the  conversion  of any  outstanding
principal amount hereof, until the outstanding Damages Amounts is zero.

          4.10  Denominations.  At the request of the Holder,  upon surrender of
this  Note,  the  Borrower  shall  promptly  issue  new  Notes in the  aggregate
outstanding  principal amount hereof, in the form hereof, in such  denominations
of at least $50,000 as the Holder shall request.

          4.11 Purchase  Agreement.  By its acceptance of this Note, each Holder
agrees to be bound by the applicable terms of the Purchase Agreement.

          4.12 Notice of Corporate Events.  Except as otherwise  provided below,
the Holder of this Note shall have no rights as a Holder of Common  Stock unless
and only to the  extent  that it  converts  this Note  into  Common  Stock.  The
Borrower shall provide the Holder with prior  notification of any meeting of the
Borrower's  shareholders  (and copies of proxy  materials and other  information
sent to shareholders). In the event of any taking by the Borrower of a record of
its shareholders for the purpose of determining shareholders who are entitled to
receive  payment of any dividend or other  distribution,  any right to subscribe
for, purchase or otherwise acquire  (including by way of merger,  consolidation,
reclassification  or  recapitalization)  any  share of any  class  or any  other
securities  or property,  or to receive any other  right,  or for the purpose of
determining  shareholders  who  are  entitled  to vote in  connection  with  any
proposed sale, lease or conveyance of all or substantially  all of the assets of
the  Borrower  or any  proposed  liquidation,  dissolution  or winding up of the
Borrower,  the Borrower shall mail a notice to the Holder,  at least twenty (20)
days prior to the record  date  specified  therein (or thirty (30) days prior to
the consummation of the transaction or event, whichever is earlier), of the date
on which  any such  record  is to be taken  for the  purpose  of such  dividend,
distribution,  right or other event, and a brief statement  regarding the amount
and character of such dividend, distribution, right or other event to the extent
known at such time. The Borrower shall make a public  announcement  of any event
requiring notification to the Holder hereunder substantially simultaneously with
the  notification  to the Holder in  accordance  with the terms of this  Section
4.12.

          4.13 Remedies.  The Borrower  acknowledges  that a breach by it of its
obligations  hereunder will cause  irreparable harm to the Holder,  by vitiating
the intent and purpose of the transaction contemplated hereby. Accordingly,  the
Borrower  acknowledges  that the  remedy at law for a breach of its  obligations
under  this  Note will be  inadequate  and  agrees,  in the event of a breach or
threatened  breach by the  Borrower  of the  provisions  of this Note,  that the
Holder shall be entitled,  in addition to all other available remedies at law or
in equity, and in addition to the penalties  assessable herein, to an injunction
or injunctions restraining,  preventing or curing any breach of this Note and to
enforce specifically the terms and provisions thereof,  without the necessity of
showing economic loss and without any bond or other security being required.

                             Article V. CALL OPTION

          5.1 Call Option. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary contained in
this Article V, so long as (i) no Event of Default or Trading Market  Prepayment
Event shall have occurred and be continuing,  (ii) the Borrower has a sufficient
number of  authorized  shares of Common Stock  reserved  for issuance  upon full
conversion  of the Notes,  then at any time after the Issue Date,  and (iii) the
Common Stock is trading at or below $.02 per share,  the Borrower shall have the
right,  exercisable  on not less than ten (10) Trading Days prior written notice
to the Holders of the Notes (which  notice may not be sent to the Holders of the

                                       18
<PAGE>
Notes  until the  Borrower  is  permitted  to prepay the Notes  pursuant to this
Section 5.1),  to prepay all of the  outstanding  Notes in accordance  with this
Section 5.1. Any notice of prepayment hereunder (an "Optional Prepayment") shall
be delivered to the Holders of the Notes at their registered addresses appearing
on the books and records of the  Borrower  and shall state (1) that the Borrower
is exercising  its right to prepay all of the Notes issued on the Issue Date and
(2) the date of prepayment (the "Optional Prepayment Notice"). On the date fixed
for prepayment (the "Optional Prepayment Date"), the Borrower shall make payment
of the Optional Prepayment Amount (as defined below) to or upon the order of the
Holders as  specified by the Holders in writing to the Borrower at least one (1)
business day prior to the Optional  Prepayment  Date. If the Borrower  exercises
its right to prepay the Notes, the Borrower shall make payment to the holders of
an amount in cash (the  "Optional  Prepayment  Amount") equal to either (i) 130%
(for prepayments occurring within thirty (30) days of the Issue Date), (ii) 140%
for  prepayments  occurring  between  thirty-one (31) and sixty (60) days of the
Issue Date, or (iii) 150% (for  prepayments  occurring after the sixtieth (60th)
day following the Issue Date), multiplied by the sum of (w) the then outstanding
principal amount of this Note plus (x) accrued and unpaid interest on the unpaid
principal  amount of this Note to the Optional  Prepayment Date plus (y) Default
Interest, if any, on the amounts referred to in clauses (w) and (x) plus (z) any
amounts  owed to the  Holder  pursuant  to  Sections  1.3 and  1.4(g)  hereof or
pursuant  to  Section  2(c)  of the  Registration  Rights  Agreement  (the  then
outstanding  principal  amount  of this  Note to the  date of  payment  plus the
amounts  referred to in clauses (x), (y) and (z) shall  collectively be known as
the  "Optional   Prepayment  Sum").   Notwithstanding   notice  of  an  Optional
Prepayment, the Holders shall at all times prior to the Optional Prepayment Date
maintain the right to convert all or any portion of the Notes in accordance with
Article I and any  portion of Notes so  converted  after  receipt of an Optional
Prepayment  Notice and prior to the Optional  Prepayment  Date set forth in such
notice and payment of the aggregate Optional Prepayment Amount shall be deducted
from the  principal  amount of Notes which are  otherwise  subject to prepayment
pursuant to such notice. If the Borrower delivers an Optional  Prepayment Notice
and fails to pay the Optional  Prepayment Amount due to the Holders of the Notes
within two (2)  business  days  following  the  Optional  Prepayment  Date,  the
Borrower  shall forever  forfeit its right to redeem the Notes  pursuant to this
Section 5.1.
