Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     On December 17, 2004, we entered into a Securities  Purchase Agreement with
AJW Offshore,  Ltd.,  AJW  Qualified  Partners,  LLC, AJW Partners,  LLC and New
Millennium  Capital  Partners II, LLC for the sale of (i)  $2,800,000 in secured
convertible  notes and (ii) warrants to purchase  2,800,000 shares of our common
stock.

     The investors are obligated to provide us with the funds as follows:

     o    $1,400,000 was disbursed on December 17, 2004;
     o    $700,000 will be disbursed  within five days of filing a  registration
          statement covering the number of shares of common stock underlying the
          secured convertible notes and the warrants; and
     o    $700,000 will be disbursed  within five days of the  effectiveness  of
          the registration statement.

     The secured  convertible  notes bear interest at 10%, mature two years from
the  date of  issuance,  and are  convertible  into  our  common  stock,  at the
investors' option, at the lower of:

     o    $0.02; or
     o    60% of the average of the three lowest intraday trading prices for the
          common stock on the Over-The-Counter Bulletin Board for the 20 trading
          days before but not including the conversion date.

     The full principal amount of the secured  convertible notes, plus a default
interest  rate  of 15%,  is due  upon a  default  under  the  terms  of  secured
convertible notes. In addition,  we granted the investors a security interest in
substantially  all of our  assets,  including  the  assets of our  wholly  owned
subsidiaries,  and intellectual property. We are required to file a registration
statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission within 45 days of closing,
which will include the common stock underlying the secured convertible notes and
the warrants. If the registration  statement is not declared effective within 90
days from the date of closing,  we are required to pay liquidated damages to the
investors.  In the event that we breach any  representation  or  warranty in the
Securities  Purchase  Agreement,  we are required to pay  liquidated  damages in
shares of our common  stock or cash,  at the  election of the  investors,  in an
amount equal to three percent of the outstanding principal amount of the secured
convertible notes per month plus accrued and unpaid interest.


     The warrants are exercisable  until five years from the date of issuance at
a purchase price of $0.02 per share.  The investors may exercise the warrants on
a cashless  basis if the shares of common stock  underlying the warrants are not
then registered pursuant to an effective  registration  statement.  In the event
the investors exercise the warrants on a cashless basis, we will not receive any
proceeds.  In addition,  the exercise  price of the warrants will be adjusted in
the event we issue common stock at a price below  market,  with the exception of
any  securities  issued as of the date of the  warrants or issued in  connection
with the secured  convertible  notes issued pursuant to the Securities  Purchase
Agreement.

     Upon an issuance  of shares of common  stock  below the market  price,  the
exercise price of the warrants will be reduced accordingly.  The market price is
determined  by averaging  the last reported sale prices for our shares of common
stock for the five trading days immediately preceding such issuance as set forth
on our  principal  trading  market.  The exercise  price shall be  determined by
multiplying  the  exercise  price in effect  immediately  prior to the  dilutive
issuance by a fraction. The numerator of the fraction is equal to the sum of the
number of shares outstanding immediately prior to the offering plus the quotient
of the amount of  consideration  received by us in connection  with the issuance
divided by the market price in effect  immediately  prior to the  issuance.  The
denominator of such issuance shall be equal to the number of shares  outstanding
after the dilutive issuance.

     The  conversion  price of the secured  convertible  notes and the  exercise
price of the warrants may be adjusted in certain circumstances such as if we pay
a stock dividend, subdivide or combine outstanding shares of common stock into a
greater  or  lesser  number  of  shares,  or take such  other  actions  as would
otherwise result in dilution of the investors' position.

     The  investors  have  agreed to  restrict  their  ability to convert  their
secured  convertible  notes or exercise their warrants and receive shares of our
common  stock such that the number of shares of common stock held by them in the
aggregate and their affiliates after such conversion or exercise does not exceed
4.9% of the then issued and outstanding shares of our common stock.
