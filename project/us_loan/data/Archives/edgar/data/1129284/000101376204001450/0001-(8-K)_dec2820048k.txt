Item 1.01 Entry into a Material Definitive Agreement.

     On December 21, 2004, we acquired all of the intangible  assets and certain
liabilities  of Battleship  VFX, Inc.  ("Battleship")  in exchange for 4,582,106
shares (the  "Acquisition  Shares") of our common stock issued to Brenda Michel,
the sole owner of Battleship.  In addition,  we are obligated to issue 3,054,737
shares (the "Earn-out Shares") of our common stock to Ms. Michel upon Ms. Michel
generating $2 million in gross revenues for our company.  The Acquisition Shares
and the Earn-out Shares are subject to weighted-average anti-dilution protection
for a period of three years from issuance.

     Furthermore,  we  agreed to enter  into an  employment  agreement  with Ms.
Michel, pursuant to which we will employ Ms. Michel for a term of two years at a
salary of $150,000 per year. The employment  agreement will automatically  renew
every two years so long as Ms. Michel has  satisfactorily  performed pursuant to
the employment agreement and the terms of the acquisition.  We can terminate Ms.
Michel  for  cause  if she is  found  by a court  to  have  engaged  in  willful
misconduct,  gross negligence or convicted of a crime that constitutes a felony.
In the event we terminate Ms. Michel's contract for any reason other than cause,
we are  obligated  to pay Ms.  Michel an amount  equal to two years salary and a
non-recourse loan in exchange for all of our common stock owned by Ms. Michel at
that time. The amount of the  non-recourse  loan shall be the purchase price for
the common stock from Ms. Michel,  which shall be weighted  average price of our
common stock for the thirty days prior to Ms. Michel's termination.
