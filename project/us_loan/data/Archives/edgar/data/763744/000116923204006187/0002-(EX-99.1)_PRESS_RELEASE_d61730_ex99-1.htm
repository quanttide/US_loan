EMPLOYEE PERSONAL INJURY</FONT></H1>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>White Plains, New York &#151; December  27,  2004 &#151; Drew  Industries Incorporated  reported  today  that a jury in state court in San
Bernardino, California rendered a verdict in favor of a former  employee  of Drew&#146;s  subsidiary,  Lippert  Components,  Inc.,  for
compensatory and punitive damages arising from an injury to the employee&#146;s hand caused by a punch press machine.
</FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The verdict was comprised of compensatory damages of $464,000, most of which has been previously paid or accrued by the Company,
and punitive damages of $4 million.  Counsel for Lippert advised the Company that, under California law, the award of punitive
damages will most likely be reduced by more than half.  It is anticipated that a final decision by the court concerning the
reduction of punitive damages will be reached in approximately 60 days.</FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>Lippert intends to move for a new trial or appeal the verdict because counsel for Lippert asserts that the verdict is unsupported
by the evidence, citing numerous appealable issues that were created throughout the trial.</FONT></P>

<!-- MARKER FORMAT-SHEET="Para Flush Lv 0-TNR" FSL="Project" -->
<P><FONT FACE="Times New Roman, Times, Serif" SIZE=2>The Company is in the process of evaluating the amount of the accrual related to this case, which will be recorded in the fourth
quarter of 2004.</FONT></P>
