Status of USPoly Spin-Off </B></FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2"><B>Eugene, Oregon &#151; December 29, 2004
</B>&#151; PW Eagle, Inc. (Nasdaq-NMS: &#147;PWEI&#148;) today updated the status of its intended spin-off of its shares of its majority-owned subsidiary, USPoly Company (formerly PWPoly Corp.). As previously announced, the Company intends to
spin-off its shares of USPoly stock to its shareholders who own 8,000 or more shares of PW Eagle and make a cash dividend of equal value to its shareholders who own less than 8,000 shares. USPoly is in the final stages of preparing a registration
statement to be filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in connection with the spin-off. The filing has been delayed as a result of the need to resolve a disclosure matter relating to the registration statement. USPoly has filed a request
for a waiver with the Securities and Exchange Commission from certain rules requiring the filing of detailed historical financial statements of W.L. Plastics Corporation, a company in which USPoly has a 23% minority interest. </FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">During the first three quarters of 2004, PW Eagle has been accounting for USPoly&#146;s
interest in W.L. Plastics using the equity method of accounting because it owned more than 20% of W.L. Plastics and at that time could have had significant influence over the affairs of W.L. Plastics. Under this method of accounting, USPoly, and
hence PW Eagle, was required to include in its income statements its share of the undistributed earnings of W.L. Plastics. As a result of USPoly&#146;s acquisition of the business assets of Uponor Aldyl, USPoly is now a competitor of W.L. Plastics.
Since it is now a competitor, USPoly&#146;s relationship with W.L. Plastics has changed, and it no longer is able to exercise any significant control over the affairs of W.L. Plastics. Consequently, PW Eagle and USPoly will now account for
USPoly&#146;s interest in W.L. Plastics using the cost method of accounting. Under this method of accounting, USPoly will not include its share of W.L. Plastics&#146; earnings in its income in future periods. </FONT></P> <P

the time it acquired more than 20% of W.L. Plastics in January 2004, the Securities and Exchange Commission rules require that W.L. Plastics&#146; audited financial statements for 2001, 2002 and 2003 and its unaudited statements for the first three
quarters of 2004 be </FONT></P>

 <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">filed with the registration statement. USPoly is not able to obtain these financial statements from W.L. Plastics for the
purpose of filing them as required. As a result, USPoly is requesting a waiver of this requirement from the Securities and Exchange Commission. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">If the requested waiver is not obtained, and there is no assurance it will be, PW Eagle will not be able to complete the spin-off of its shares of USPoly stock as
currently anticipated. USPoly expects to hold discussions with the Securities and Exchange Commission and resolve this issue as soon as possible. If the Securities and Exchange Commission grants the requested waiver, PW Eagle anticipates that the
spin-off will occur within 90 days of the filing of the registration statement which is anticipated to be filed in early January 2005. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Separately, PW Eagle announced that on December 17, 2004, USPoly sold shares of USPoly common stock to several members of its operating management team at a price of
$1.10 per share, the price that the Board of Directors of USPoly determined to be the fair market value of those shares after conferring with an independent investment banker. The shares were sold to these employees as part of their employment
arrangements. The value per share of USPoly stock that will be used in connection with PW Eagle&#146;s contemplated future spin-off of its USPoly shares will be established by an independent committee of the Board of Directors of PW Eagle based on a
valuation of USPoly conducted by an independent investment banker. The valuation will be conducted using a similar methodology as of a date just prior to the record date for the spin-off. That valuation could be higher or lower than the $1.10 per
share price discussed above depending on the results of operations and other conditions at the time of the proposed spin-off. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
