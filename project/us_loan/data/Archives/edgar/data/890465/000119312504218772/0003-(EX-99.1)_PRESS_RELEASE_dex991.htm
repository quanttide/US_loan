STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Salt Lake City- December 23, 2004 - NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (Nasdaq: NPSP) announced today that it has closed a private placement of $175 million of
notes with institutional investors. The notes are secured by revenue paid to NPS from sales of Sensipar<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="1" COLOR="#000000"><SUP>&reg;<FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"></FONT></SUP><FONT
FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2" COLOR="#000000"></FONT></FONT>, a drug licensed to and sold by Amgen Inc. for the treatment of hyperparathyroidism. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Payments for the notes will be made from Sensipar royalties and milestone payments payable under a Development and License Agreement between NPS and
Amgen. The notes are non-recourse and non-convertible, meaning that under no circumstance is NPS obligated to repay the notes, and under no circumstance will the notes convert to equity. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT
SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The annual interest rate on the notes is 8%, with interest payable quarterly beginning March 30, 2005. In addition to
payments on the notes from royalties and milestones, an interest reserve account has been funded with approximately $14 million of the proceeds of the offering to support the payment of interest until December 30, 2006. Beginning March 30, 2006, if
the Sensipar royalties received exceed the interest payments and expenses due for any given year, the excess will be used to redeem the notes at par, and under certain circumstances, to pay a redemption premium. The legal final maturity date of the
notes is March 30, 2017, unless the notes are repaid earlier due to Sensipar sales that exceed certain predetermined amounts. In addition, the notes may be redeemed by NPS on any quarterly payment date subject to the payment of a redemption premium.
Once the notes are repaid in full, NPS will receive all royalty payments due under the Development and License Agreement with Amgen. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">Net proceeds to NPS from the financing will be approximately $155 million after interest reserves and transaction costs. NPS will use the proceeds of the
placement to fund clinical trials of NPS&#146;s product candidates, fund the development of its sales, marketing and manufacturing capabilities and build-up of inventory, advance its preclinical research programs, in-license or acquire complementary
product candidates or products, technologies or companies, and fund general corporate purposes. </FONT></P> <P STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px"><FONT SIZE="1">&nbsp;</FONT></P> <P
STYLE="margin-top:0px;margin-bottom:0px; text-indent:4%"><FONT FACE="Times New Roman" SIZE="2">The notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act of 1933 and may not be offered or sold in the United States absent an
applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Act. This press release is being issued pursuant to and in accordance with Rule 135c under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended. </FONT></P> <P
