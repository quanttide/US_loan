Item 4.01 Changes in Registrant's Certifying Accountant

(a)  Previous independent accountants

          (i)  On  November  1, 2004 the  Registrant  dismissed  Ham  Langston &
               Brezina  LLP  from  its  position  as the  Company's  independent
               accounts.

          (ii) The audit  report of Ham  Langston  & Brezina  LLP,  on March 29,
               2002,  for the year ended  December 31, 2001 contained no adverse
               opinion, disclaimer of opinion or modification of the opinion.

          (iii)The Registrant's Board of Directors  participated in and approved
               the decision to change independent accountants.

          (iv) In connection  with its audit for the most recent fiscal year and
               the interim  period until the date of dismissal , there have been
               no disagreements with Ham Langston & Brezina LLP on any matter of
               accounting principle or practice, financial statement disclosure,
               or  auditing  scope  or  procedure,  which  disagreement  if  not
               resolved to the  satisfaction of Ham Langston & Brezina LLP would
               have caused them to make reference thereto in their report on the
               financial statements.

          (v)  During the most recent  fiscal year and the interim  period until
               the date of dismissal , there have been no reportable  events (as
               defined in Regulation S-K Item 304 (a)(1)(v)).

          (vi) The Registrant  requested that Ham Langston & Brezina LLP furnish
               it with a letter  addressed to the SEC stating  whether or not it
               agrees with the above statements.  A copy of such letter is filed
               as an Exhibit to this Form 8-K.

(b)  New independent accountants

         On November 1, 2004, the Registrant engaged Thomas Leger & Co. LLP to
audit its financial statements for the years ended December 31, 2002 and 2003.
During the two most recent fiscal years and through December 31, 2003, the
Registrant has not consulted with Thomas Leger & Co. LLP regarding (i) the
application of accounting principles to a specified transaction, either
completed or proposed or the type of audit opinion that might be rendered on the
Registrant's financial statements, and no written report or oral advise was
provided to the Registrant by concluding there was an important factor to be
considered by the Registrant in reaching a decision as to an accounting,
auditing or financial reporting issue; or (ii) any matter that was either the
subject of a disagreement, as that term is defined in item 304 (a)(1)(iv) of
Regulation S-K and the related instructions to Item 304 of Regulation S-K, or a
reportable event, as that term is defined in Item 304 (a)(1)(v) of Regulation
S-K.
